Google tests new Phone app feature that lets urgent calls bypass Do Not Disturb,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-tests-new-phone-app-feature-that-lets-urgent-calls-bypass-do-not-disturb/articleshow/125964471.cms,"How Phone by Google’s new feature works





Google announced a new feature for its Phone app earlier this month that will allow callers to surpass Do Not Disturb (DND). According to a report by 9to5Google, Phone by Google’s new “Expressive Calling” feature is beginning to roll out for beta users. Those who have enrolled in the beta can check the availability of the feature via:Phone Settings > General > Expressive Calling (near the bottom).As per the report, the high-level preference (“Enhance calling with visual and haptic feedback”) will be enabled by default. Google is allowing users to decide whether “Urgent call can interrupt Do Not Disturb” is on.According to the report, both parties must have Phone by Google beta (version 203) to get this to work at this stage. Once the feature is available, the calling screen will show a “Mark call as urgent?” card above the usual controls. Users can tap on “Notify.”When you make an urgent call, the person you’re calling will see an “It’s urgent!” alert on their screen along with a flashing siren emoji. If they don’t answer, the call will show an “urgent” tag in their call history.In a separate update, Phone by Google 202 has now moved to the stable release channel. However, features such as the shorter bottom bar and the new “Keep portrait mode” option are still not broadly available. These features remain in beta for now, and may roll out to more users through a server-side update later.",Phone by Google’s new “Expressive Calling” feature is beginning to roll out for beta users.

Paramount to Netflix: Your 'YouTube reason' to buy Warner Brothers is like Coca-Cola justifying it can buy Pepsi because ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/paramount-to-netflix-your-youtube-reason-to-buy-warner-brothers-is-like-coca-cola-justifying-buying-pepsi-because-/articleshow/125965779.cms,"Donald Trump Attacks $72B Netflix–WBD Deal, Demands CNN Be ‘Sold Or Included’ In Mega Merger

Why analysts not convinced with Netflix's 'YouTube reasoning'







Netflix says it must acquire Warner Bros Discovery to compete with YouTube. In fact, YouTube has become a key player in Netflix‘s plans to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. As the streaming giant Netflix says that even if the company were to acquire Warner Bros. , it would still be behind YouTube in terms of total viewing time as measured by Nielsen. Netflix’s Co-CEO Greg Peters brought up this point while speaking at UBS’ 2025 Global Media and Communications Conference in New York last week. Peters made the statement on the same day when Paramount filed its hostile bid. “We go from 8% of viewed hours today in the United States to 9%. We’re still behind YouTube at 13%,” Peters said, referring to what would happen if the company acquired HBO and HBO Max.The reason Netflix co-CEO specifically pointed out, if Paramount acquired Warner Bros., their newly combined portion of US viewership would jump to 13.8% and that would put them above YouTube is to stress on the point that if Paramount, which accounted for 8.2% of November viewership, purchased all of Warner Bros. Discovery, it would account for 13.8% of all US viewership. That would put the combined companies ahead of both Netflix and YouTube.To sum up, Paramount buying Warner Bros. is a bigger anticompetitive threat than Netflix.“We go from 8% of viewed hours today in the United States to 9%. We’re still behind YouTube at 13%,” he said. “We think that there’s a really strong fundamentals-based case here for why regulators should approve this deal,” Peters added.Responding to Netflix co-CEO's comment, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, compared the statement to Coca-Cola justifying a Pepsi purchase because Budweiser also makes beverages. Speaking to CNBC’s David Faber on ""Squawk on the Street"", Ellison said, ""I’m sorry this is like following that analogy for a second, right? Okay, that’s like saying Coke can buy Pepsi, that they’re both beverages because Budweiser is a substitute for Coke. That’s not a realistic argument. Now let’s actually look at it from the talent community, the greatest showrunners in the world. David Benioff is not going to take the next Game of Thrones to basically TikTok or to Instagram. They’re going to take it to Netflix. They’re going to take it to Amazon. They’re going to take it to Apple, they’re going to take it to HBO Max. They’re going to take it to Paramount Plus. That’s not actually how the ecosystem works. If this deal is allowed to come to pass, it is anti-competitive, and it is a horrible deal for Hollywood. And as someone who spent the last 15 years of my life producing movies and television shows, this is an industry that I love, this is an existential moment for our business, and we believe that what we are offering is better for Hollywood. It’s better for the customers and it’s pro-competitive.""""And when you look at the consolidation of market share that would occur by combining Warner Bros. Discovery and Netflix, that is unprecedented market share. And so from that standpoint, we think that, that is deeply anticompetitive,"" he added.According to a report by Reuters, antitrust experts doubt regulators will buy Netflix argument. While Netflix insists the deal is needed to challenge Google's YouTube, which media analysis firm Nielsen ranks as America's most-watched TV distributor. However, attorneys quoted in the report say that the Justice Department is unlikely to see Netflix and YouTube as interchangeable rivals, given their different content, audiences and business models. ""Netflix is trying to say it competes with YouTube because people only watch a certain amount of content a day,"" said Abiel Garcia, antitrust partner at Kesselman Brantly Stockinger. ""That argument ultimately fails.""The DOJ is not likely to view those videos as a substitute for Netflix shows and movies, experts said. While companies often seek to defend their mergers by pointing to competition from a broad universe of established and emerging players, antitrust enforcers are experienced in finding the ways that mergers quash competition in distinct sub-markets.",Netflix says it must acquire Warner Bros Discovery to compete with YouTube.

We know exactly what requires a license and what doesn’t. And companies know who they’re selling to. But instead, they rely on a checkbox that says, ‘I’m not shipping to Putin.’ That’s it. No enforcement. No accountability.”

What are causes of action alleged in the complaint filed by Ukranians





Some Ukrainians seem very angry with American chip giants Texas Instruments (TI), AMD and Intel. Dozens of Ukrainian civilians have reportedly filed a series of lawsuits in Texas this week, accusing some of the biggest US chip companies of negligently failing to track chips that evaded export curbs. According to a report in Ars Technics, those chips were ultimately used to power Russian and Iranian weapon systems, causing wrongful deaths.According to the report, their complaints alleged that for years, Texas Instruments (TI), AMD, and Intel have ignored public reporting, government warnings, and shareholder pressure to do more to track final destinations of chips and shut down shady distribution channels diverting chips to sanctioned actors in Russia and Iran.The lawsuit claims that these American chipmakers failed to prevent their products from reaching hostile regimes. “There are export lists. All that intermediaries who placed bulk online orders had to do to satisfy chip companies was check a box confirming that the shipment wouldn’t be sent to sanctioned countries,"" lead attorney Mikal Watts told reporters at a press conference, as reported by Kyiv Independent.The claims in this case arise under Texas tort law, which imposes a duty on companies to act with reasonable care and to prevent foreseeable harm. The factual record includes extensive evidence that the defendants also violated US export control laws designed to stop exactly this kind of diversion. The complaint lays out a consistent pattern of misconduct. Defendants sold into regions already identified as high risk. They continued doing business with distributors who had been publicly linked to sanctioned actors. The indicators of diversion were clear. They proceeded anyway.The complaint has four causes of action. The first is a negligence claim. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants had a duty under Texas law to exercise reasonable care in how they designed, implemented, and enforced compliance and export control systems. The complaint states that the companies breached that duty in several ways. They failed to conduct adequate due diligence on high-risk customers and distributors. They failed to respond to repeated government advisories and public reports showing that their products were being diverted. They allowed sales to continue into known high-risk transshipment hubs without strengthening controls. They kept working with intermediaries that had been linked to diversion activity. They failed to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable misuse of their microchips in weapons systems used against civilians. They also continued selling microprocessors and related technology, directly or indirectly, into channels that supplied China, Russia, and Iran, which ultimately armed the military drones used against Ukrainian civilians.The complaint then alleges negligence per se. Plaintiffs assert that the defendants violated U.S. export control laws, sanctions regulations, and Executive Orders entered by Presidents Obama, Trump, and Biden that bar the diversion of sensitive microelectronics to hostile actors. These laws exist to prevent U.S. technology from reaching foreign weapons programs and to protect civilians from the harm that follows when those safeguards are ignored. Because the defendants violated these rules, the complaint treats their conduct as automatically negligent and a proximate cause of the injuries at issue.Plaintiffs also bring a claim for gross negligence. They allege that the companies had actual knowledge of an extreme degree of risk. The harm was predictable. Public reporting showed their chips repeatedly appearing in Russian and Iranian weapons systems. Congressional testimony, industry analysis, and government warnings made the threat plain. Despite this information, the defendants allegedly failed to adopt effective compliance measures and continued their existing sales practices with full awareness of the potential consequences.The complaint next sets out wrongful death claims. Families who lost loved ones in drone and missile attacks allege that defendants’ negligent and grossly negligent conduct was a direct and proximate cause of those deaths. These plaintiffs seek damages for the loss of companionship, mental anguish, and other harms recognized under the Texas Wrongful Death statute.Finally, the complaint includes survival claims. Plaintiffs assert that the decedents suffered physical pain, mental anguish, property loss, and medical expenses before death. Their estates seek recovery for those losses, as well as funeral expenses. Because the complaint alleges that the defendants acted with gross negligence, both the wrongful death and survival claims seek exemplary damages as permitted by Texas law. Exemplary damages are a category of damages intended to punish especially wrongful conduct and to deter similar conduct in the future.","Ukrainian civilians have reportedly filed a series of lawsuits in Texas this week, accusing some of the biggest US chip companies of negligently failing to track chips that evaded export curbs.

How it may be end of what developers called 'Apple Tax' in the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-it-may-be-end-of-what-developers-called-apple-tax-in-the-us/articleshow/125962177.cms,"A federal appeals court has largely upheld a contempt finding against Apple, ruling the tech giant willfully violated an injunction by charging a 27% commission on external payment links. This move, deemed to have a ""prohibitive effect"" on competition, could significantly alter App Store fees. While Apple can charge reasonable security fees, the ""Apple Tax"" faces a major challenge.

Court says Apple's fees have 'prohibitive effect' on competition

Apple wins partial victory but faces uncertain future





A federal appeals court ruling could dramatically reshape how Apple charges fees on its App Store, potentially ending what developers have long criticized as the ""Apple Tax."" The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld a contempt finding against Apple on Thursday, determining the tech giant willfully violated a 2021 injunction by charging a 27% commission on purchases made through external payment links.The three-judge panel agreed Apple acted in bad faith by implementing restrictions that made external payments impractical for developers. The court found Apple's 27% fee on outside transactions had a ""prohibitive effect,"" and its design requirements—limiting links to plain text rather than buttons—made it difficult for customers to use alternative payment options.Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, whose company sparked the legal battle by intentionally breaking App Store rules in 2020, declared ""the Apple Tax is dead in the USA."" He suggested Apple should only charge minimal fees—potentially just ""tens or hundreds of dollars"" per app review—rather than percentage-based commissions on transactions.However, the appeals court partially sided with Apple on one key issue. While it struck down the 27% commission as excessive, judges ruled Apple can charge ""reasonable fees"" based on actual costs for ensuring user security and privacy. What qualifies as ""reasonable"" remains undetermined, with the court suggesting Apple and Epic negotiate or let a judge decide.The ruling represents a significant shift for Apple's lucrative services business, which has continued growing even as iPhone sales slowed. Apple currently takes up to 30% of every dollar spent through its App Store—a practice that's faced mounting legal and regulatory challenges for years.Wall Street appears cautiously optimistic about Apple's prospects, with the stock relatively unchanged since the ruling. Investors likely expect appeals to continue, though the court's finding of willful violation and bad faith strengthens Epic's position.The ultimate impact depends on whether developers and consumers embrace external payment options, even with potential savings. Sweeney acknowledged many developers haven't followed Epic's lead due to ""fear of retaliation"" from Apple. Whether this ruling finally breaks that pattern could determine if it truly marks the end of the Apple Tax.","A federal appeals court has largely upheld a contempt finding against Apple.

"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on why despite being the CEO of world's most-valuable company, sense of uncertainty and insecurity doesn't leave him",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-on-why-despite-being-the-ceo-of-worlds-most-valuable-company-sense-of-uncertainty-and-insecurity-doesnt-leave-him/articleshow/125883149.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, despite leading his company to a $5 trillion valuation, lives in constant anxiety, a fear rooted in a near-bankruptcy experience. Recent reports of Meta potentially buying Google's AI chips have caused a $250 billion market value drop, validating Huang's long-held belief that the company is always '30 days from going out of business'.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

A near-death experience that shaped Huang’s three decades of paranoia

Why Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang 's fears suddenly look prophetic





Despite leading Nvidia to become the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation, CEO Jensen Huang admits he operates in constant anxiety, working every single day including holidays. His fears may be justified—this week alone, Nvidia lost $250 billion in market value after reports emerged that Meta is in advanced talks to buy billions worth of competing chips from Google , threatening the chipmaker's decade-long dominance in AI hardware.""The phrase '30 days from going out of business'—I've used for 33 years,"" Huang revealed on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. ""The feeling doesn't change. The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity—it doesn't leave you.""Huang's anxiety isn't unfounded paranoia—it's scar tissue from survival. In the mid-1990s, Nvidia discovered fatal flaws in its first graphics chip while developing technology for Sega's gaming console. With funds evaporating, Huang flew to Japan for an excruciating conversation: he told Sega's CEO the product wouldn't work and the deal must end, but simultaneously begged for the final $5 million payment to prevent bankruptcy.Remarkably, Sega converted it into an investment, giving Nvidia the lifeline that eventually built a trillion-dollar empire.That near-collapse experience now fuels Huang's relentless schedule. He wakes at 4 a.m. daily to read ""several thousand emails,"" works seven days a week without exception—""including Thanksgiving, Christmas""—and admits he's ""always in a state of anxiety."" His motivation? ""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed. Failure drives me more than greed.""Huang's paranoia might be wisdom. Nvidia made the rare move of issuing a public defense after The Information reported that Meta—planning up to $72 billion in AI spending this year—is negotiating massive purchases of Google's tensor processing units (TPUs). The news triggered a 6% stock plunge, erasing roughly $250 billion in value, while Alphabet shares surged 4%.""Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry—it's the only platform that runs every AI model,"" the company declared on X, breaking its usual silence on competitors. But Google's latest Gemini 3 AI model, trained entirely on TPUs rather than Nvidia chips, is being hailed by industry leaders as potentially superior. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff publicly announced he's switching from ChatGPT after three years, calling Gemini 3 the better product.The threat is existential to Nvidia's 90% market share in AI accelerators. If Google captures even a fraction of the hundreds of billions being spent on AI processors—particularly from customers like Meta—it would represent the first serious crack in Nvidia's dominance.Huang's work ethic has infected his family: both his children, Madison and Spencer, now in their thirties, work at Nvidia after joining as interns in 2020 and 2022. ""Now we have three people working every day,"" Huang said.For a CEO who never stopped running scared despite building a $4.5-trillion empire, the market turmoil caused by Google likely only confirmed what he's believed for 33 years: you're always 30 days from going out of business.","Jensen Huang is the CEO of Nvidia, the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation.

How to apply for e-passport





The Ministry of External Affairs rolled out e-passport service under the Passport Seva Programme (PSP V2.0). With the new system, the government aims to facilitate faster, more secure, and smooth travel for all Indian passport holders. While the existing ones remain valid till their expiry, anyone applying for a passport will get a chip-enabled passport by default, irrespective of whether they apply in India or abroad.As explained by the external affairs ministry in a press release, the e-Passport is a hybrid passport that combines both paper and electronic elements. It features an embedded Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip and an antenna, which store and secure the holder’s data in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards.Critical information printed on the data page is also stored electronically on the chip, enabling enhanced security and authentication, the ministry says. Going forward, all newly issued passports will be e-Passports, while existing non-electronic passports will remain valid until their expiry, it added.As mentioned above, any Indian citizen who is eligible for a regular passport can apply for e-passport.The process of applying for an e-passport is the same as that of applying for a regular passport. Applicants are required to first register on the official Passport Seva portal using their personal details. After completing the registration, they must fill in the online application form carefully and pay the prescribed fee through the available payment options.Once the payment is completed, applicants are required to book an appointment at a nearby Passport Seva Kendra or Post Office Passport Seva Kendra, based on their location and slot availability. On the scheduled date, the applicant must visit the selected centre in person for document verification.During the appointment, biometric details of the applicant are captured.

Jamie Dimon, CEO of America’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase CEO has once again warned that artificial intelligence (AI) will eliminate jobs in the long run. Speaking in an interview with Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures, Dimon urged workers to focus on human skills such as critical thinking, emotional intelligence and communication to stay relevant in the future workforce. He said individuals should build skills that machines cannot easily copy. These include problem-solving, emotional understanding, creativity, and clear communication.Jamie Dimon said that while companies have been cautious about hiring in recent months, this slowdown is not being driven by AI. He also said he does not expect the technology to cause large job losses in the immediate future.“For the most part, AI is going to do great stuff for mankind, like tractors did, like fertilizers did, like vaccines did,” Dimon said during the interview. “You know, maybe one day we’ll be working less hard but having wonderful lives.”At the same time, Jamie Dimon stressed that AI will eventually replace some jobs and that people must prepare for this shift. Notably, this is not the first time Dimon has warned about AI eliminating jobs. He has previously warned that automation will change the nature of work. In November 2025, Dimon said AI could help people in developed countries move toward a much shorter workweek of around three-and-a-half days over the next 20 to 40 years.Dimon also said that AI must be regulated properly to limit its risks, just as earlier technologies were brought under rules to protect society. He said both governments and companies have a shared responsibility to manage the impact of AI on workers.“We—government and we the companies, society—should look at how do we phase it in a way that we don’t damage a lot of people,” he said. He pointed to past examples where factory closures hurt entire towns and said better support could have reduced the damage. “You can retrain people, relocate people, income assistance, early retirement,” he added.While warning about future job losses, Dimon also said AI is already creating new jobs in the short term. He said the growth of AI requires large investments in infrastructure, including construction work and fibre-optic networks, which will generate employment.","Jamie Dimon, CEO of America’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase CEO has once again warned that artificial intelligence will eliminate jobs in the long run.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently hinted at building data centres in space. In an interview with Fox News, Pichai said that the company is working on quantum computing, adding “in that spirit, one of our moon shots is to, how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun”.Sundar Pichai’s video from the interview was shared by X (formerly Twitter) user - Bourbon Capital in an online post. It caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who replied to the post with a single word. “Interesting”, Musk wrote.“At Google, we are always proud of taking moon shots,” Pichai said, adding “... Waymo … has been over a decade in the making.”“We're working on quantum computing, in that spirit, one of our moon shots is to, how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun,” he continued.Pichai further said that the company wants to “put these data centers in space closer to the sun”, and will take “first step in 2027”.“We'll send tiny racks of machines and have them in satellites, test them out, and then start scaling from there. But there's no doubt to me that a decade or so away will be viewing it as a more normal way to build data centers,” Sundar Pichai said in the interview.Notably, this echoes Musk's November 2025 announcements that SpaceX will pioneer orbital data centers using next-gen Starlink satellites, positioning them as the lowest-cost AI compute option within five years.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company is working on quantum computing.

The company emphasized that its India website is not yet live and is not accepting orders.

Update:

Elon Musk’s Starlink To Begin Trials in India

Starlink’s residential connection includes 30-day trial and plug-and-play setup to cost Rs 34,000

SpaceX Gateway network to span across six cities, and Bengaluru office expands





Starlink has officially denied that Indian pricing, calling the incident a technical glitch rather than an intentional reveal. Lauren Dreyer, Vice President of Starlink Business Operations, clarified in a post on X that the company's India website is not yet live and is not accepting orders.She explained that a configuration error caused internal dummy test data to briefly appear publicly, which was quickly corrected once discovered. Dreyer emphasized that Starlink has not announced official pricing for India and any figures currently circulating online are inaccurate. The company remains focused on obtaining final government approvals before launching service in the country, and both the website and ordering system will stay inactive until the regulatory process is complete.Elon Musk's Starlink has revealed the residential satellite internet pricing for India at Rs 8,600 monthly, plus a Rs 34,000 hardware kit, as the SpaceX subsidiary prepares for commercial operations. The service targets households in remote and underserved areas with promises of unlimited data, 99.9% uptime, and weather-resistant connectivity where traditional broadband infrastructure fails to reach.Following regulatory clearance from the Department of Telecommunications in July, Starlink is positioning itself to challenge established players Jio-SES and Eutelsat OneWeb in India's satellite communications sector.The residential plan, priced at a monthly subscription cost of Rs 8,600 offers unlimited data without usage caps or throttling, addressing critical connectivity gaps in rural regions. Starlink's system requires minimal installation effort, with users simply powering on equipment and pointing it skyward to establish connections. However, the hardware kit will cost customers Rs 34,000, which the company says is a one time fees. The company guarantees over 99.9% uptime and all-weather functionality, crucial features for areas experiencing frequent service disruptions.New customers receive a 30-day trial period, allowing households to evaluate performance before long-term commitment. This trial provision acknowledges the premium pricing structure, which places Starlink among India's higher-cost broadband options despite targeting underserved markets.Business subscription pricing remains unannounced, with enterprise-focused plans expected as commercial rollout advances.Starlink is deploying gateway earth stations across Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, and Noida to enable satellite-to-ground communications. These relay installations are essential for maintaining low-latency connections and service reliability across India's varied geography.The company posted four specialist positions at its Bengaluru office in October, recruiting talent in payments, accounting, treasury, and tax operations as part of infrastructure expansion. This direct-to-consumer strategy distinguishes Starlink from competitors concentrating on enterprise clients, potentially reshaping internet accessibility in regions where fiber deployment remains economically unviable.","Elon Musk’s Starlink To Begin Trials in India. residential connection includes 30-day trial and plug-and-play setup to cost Rs 34,000 per month.

Elon Musk has once again sent a warning regarding global population decline, this time zeroing in on Europe’s plummeting birth rates. The Tesla CEO’s latest alarm on existential threat to civilization comes after data points to Poland’s 2024 fertility rate of 1.1 children per woman, which is projected to drop to 1.05 in 2025. The warning aligns with a 2024 Lancet study that found fertility rates are now below the replacement level of 2.1 in more than half the world's countries.“BREAKING: Poland’s fertility rate dropped sharply, hitting about 1.1 children per woman, among the lowest in Europe, and is expected to fall further to around 1.05,” DogeDesigner said in a post.“Civilization is disappearing.

Musk reshared the post with his own comment: “Collapse of population is accelerating.”Musk recently voiced his serious concerns during a discussion with People by WTF host Nikhil Kamath, cautioning that if current trends persist, humanity could face significant decline and potential extinction. The SpaceX CEO argues that the advancement and growth of human consciousness rely on a larger population base. He asserted that fewer people mean reduced collective awareness, ultimately limiting humanity’s capacity to explore fundamental questions about existence.“Well, I don't want humanity to disappear. But a ‘decline’ and ‘disappear’ are completely different things, right? Well, if the trend continues, we disappear,” he said. He argued that consciousness grows with the number of people.“Consciousness increases from a single-celled creature to a 30 trillion-celled creature. We are more conscious than bacteria. More humans mean more collective consciousness,” he added. Musk has – time-and-again – stressed the critical importance of population growth, suggesting that having children is not merely a personal choice but a necessary step to ensure the survival and progress of human civilization.Musk even told Kamath to have children: “Maybe you should. You won't regret it.” Musk reiterated the core of his argument: “We fundamentally have to have kids or grow extinct.”","Elon Musk has once again sent a warning regarding global population decline, this time zeroing in on Europe’s plummeting birth rates.

Sergey Brin’s quiet return to Google

Founder mode and its perceived impact

Google was never truly behind, but it was cautious

Google’s recent AI surge: Gemini and DeepMind



Market impact and competitive position

So did Sergey Brin’s return save Google in AI?





When Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently spoke about Sergey Brin spending more time in the office, the specificity of his comments stood out. Pichai described sitting with Brin in front of large screens, watching training loss curves as Google’s AI models were being trained. For a company often portrayed as slow to respond to the generative AI boom, the image of a co-founder back in the technical trenches felt notable. It has prompted a broader question across Silicon Valley: what role, if any, did Sergey Brin’s return in “founder mode” play in Google’s recent AI acceleration?Sergey Brin stepped away from day-to-day management at Alphabet in 2019, remaining a board member but largely removed from operational decisions. That began to change in late 2022 and early 2023, after OpenAI’s ChatGPT disrupted the industry and forced even the most established technology companies to reassess their pace and priorities in AI.According to Sundar Pichai, Brin started spending significant time with Google’s AI teams, not as an executive issuing directives but as a deeply technical founder. “Sergey is spending more time in the office. He’s literally coding,” Pichai said, recalling moments where they sat together watching training loss curves as models were being trained.Pichai described these sessions as some of his fondest professional memories of the past year.This level of engagement placed Brin directly inside the technical workflow of Google’s AI development, working alongside researchers rather than above them. In modern machine learning, analysing loss curves is a core diagnostic practice, used to understand whether models are learning efficiently and where training strategies may need adjustment.Brin does not hold a formal executive title and is not running Google or Alphabet. His role is better understood as that of a founder-technologist offering technical insight, scrutiny and perspective during a period of intense competition.Founders often re-engage most visibly during inflection points, when organisational caution gives way to urgency. Brin brings deep systems knowledge from Google’s earliest days, significant cultural authority and a long-term orientation that differs from quarterly-driven decision-making.Some commentators in the AI community have observed that Brin’s renewed focus on flagship efforts such as Gemini coincided with a faster cadence of execution at Google. However, these observations reflect interpretation rather than proof of direct causality. There is no public evidence that any single individual was responsible for changes in execution speed.The notion that Google was “way behind” in AI has always been shaped more by public perception than technical reality. Internally, Google invented key foundations of modern AI, including the Transformer architecture that underpins today’s large language models. It also maintained world-class research teams and unmatched infrastructure.What changed after ChatGPT was urgency. OpenAI’s success altered expectations and compressed timelines across the industry. Google’s early cautious rollouts and uneven demonstrations amplified the impression of lag, even as its underlying capabilities remained strong.Brin’s return aligned with this broader shift. He did not create Google’s AI strength, but his presence reflected and reinforced a cultural move away from excessive risk aversion toward faster, more decisive action.The effects of this renewed urgency are now visible across Google’s AI portfolio, particularly in the evolution of its Gemini models. From late 2023 onward, Google increased the pace of releases, culminating in Gemini 3 Pro, positioned as one of the company’s most capable large-scale models.Gemini 3 Pro improves on earlier versions in reasoning, multimodal understanding and long-context performance. The model integrates text, code and images more tightly, reflecting closer coordination between research and product teams. Industry benchmarks and early enterprise adoption indicate that Google has narrowed much of the perceived gap with competitors and, in some areas, demonstrated clear strengths.A key structural change was the creation of Google DeepMind, formed by merging Google Brain and DeepMind in 2023. This consolidation ended years of internal fragmentation that had slowed deployment. DeepMind’s research depth, combined with Google’s scale and infrastructure, shortened the path from research breakthroughs to products.Google’s proprietary Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) continue to provide efficiency and cost advantages, while Gemini-powered features are being integrated across Search, Workspace, Cloud and developer tools, giving Google unmatched distribution reach.Google’s AI momentum is increasingly visible in the market. AI features are now embedded directly into products with billions of users, and Google Cloud has reported growing enterprise interest in its AI offerings as organisations seek alternatives and complements to OpenAI-based systems.Claims that Google is “easily number one” across all AI domains depend on how leadership is defined and measured. What is clearer is that Google is no longer widely viewed as lagging. Instead, it is again seen as a top-tier competitor, particularly in infrastructure, multimodal systems and research depth.Whether Sergey Brin’s return “saved” Google in the AI race is not something that can be established empirically. Google’s resurgence reflects a convergence of long-term investments, organisational restructuring, competitive pressure from OpenAI and a renewed sense of urgency across the company.Brin’s return mattered symbolically and practically. It signalled founder-level engagement at a moment when execution mattered as much as ideas. As Sundar Pichai’s remarks suggest, the difference was not the invention of new technology, but having experienced founders once again close to the hardest technical problems.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently spoke about Sergey Brin spending more time in the office.

Bill Gates has an AI industry warning







Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has now pledged to channel billions of dollars in 2026 towards global health and other development initiatives. emphasizing the role of artificial intelligence in transforming lives. Speaking at Abu Dhabi Finance Week in an interview with CNBC’s Tania Bryer, Gates revealed how the resources of his foundation will be used and deployed in the coming year.Gates mentioned that 2026 will be a “big year for global health”. He further added that the Gates Foundation and its partners will be focusing on Polio erudition, AI-powered healthcare, language support and agricultural productivity.“We can take these wonderful pledges that we’ve just got and make sure we use them very effectively,” Gates said. “It’ll be a year where we’re piloting a lot of those AI tools… most people in Africa are farmers who have very small plots of land, and today very low productivity. We want to dramatically raise their productivity, and we see that’s doable.”Along with the pledge to donate billions for humanitarian work, Gates also issued a warning to the AI industry. Microsoft co-founder cautioned that many companies with high valuations may not survive in the ‘hyper competitive’ environment.“Does it mean all of these companies with high valuations will be winners? No, it’s going to be hyper competitive,” Gates said. “AI is only a bubble in the sense that not all of these valuations will end up going up. Some of them will go down.”Companies like Palantir and Tesla, with price-to-earnings ratios above 200 compared to the S&P 500 average of 25, exemplify the frothiness in the sector. Gates predicted that “a reasonable percentage of those companies won’t be worth that much.”Despite all these concerns, Gates has reaffirmed his belief in the transformative potential of AI. He also described it as “a deeply profound technology that will reshape the world,” with applications across health, education, and agriculture.“Is this profound and real and is going to provide all of these benefits? Absolutely, nobody should have any doubt about that,” Gates said.As 2026 approaches, Gates’ vision is clear: AI must be used not just to drive profits, but to deliver tangible benefits for humanity.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has pledged to channel billions of dollars in 2026 towards global health and other development initiatives.

Larry Ellison says world needs low-latency AI models in cars, robots



Non-real-time models like chatbots







Oracle founder and Chairman Larry Ellison has outlined the difference between two types of artificial intelligence (AI) models, separating them based on their need for real-time, low-latency decision-making. In a video shared on Elon Musk’s X, Ellison is seen explaining that the design and deployment of an AI model depend entirely on whether it can tolerate network latency or requires instantaneous, localised processing.The video is from Oracle AI World 25 where Ellison said that there’s a type of AI that must make immediate decisions where a fraction of a second delay is unacceptable. Ellison pointed to self-driving vehicles and robotics as prime examples.“You have to build things differently when you can’t afford the network traffic to go back across the network and talk to an AI model on a network that’s far away,” Ellison said, adding, “You need very, very low latency response time.”He specifically cited Tesla as a company employing this model:“That's why all the Tesla cars, all the Tesla robots have to have local compute in the car, local compute in the robot, to make an immediate decision, a very low latency decision,” he said.He explained that in this type of AI, the model and the necessary computing power has to be embedded directly within the device for “edge computing”, allowing for critical, instantaneous actions like braking or steering.The second category includes models where a brief delay for computation and network communication is acceptable, for example in the case of chatbots that take a bot time to process information and then return an answer. These models often leverage centralised cloud compute resources.“That’s not required, for example, if you’re writing code. I can tell you what code to write, and you can take a moment to think about it and then give an answer,” Ellison explained. This type of AI, such as models used for complex data analysis, code generation, or content creation, has more time to process the query, gather resources, and formulate a comprehensive response.Ellison emphasized that both types of models are equally vital to the future of AI, saying, “Both types of models are very important. Both types of models are being built,” he concluded.","Larry Ellison says world needs low-latency AI models in cars, robots.

As per LSE, the Fund is Microsoft’s 8th largest shareholders.The Fund owned a 1.35% stake worth $50 billion in Microsoft as of June 30, its second-largest equity holding overall, after AI chip giant Nvidia.Voting against Satya Nadella ’s compensation package, the Fund said: “The board is responsible for attracting the right CEO and setting appropriate remuneration. A substantial proportion of annual remuneration should be provided as shares that are locked in for five to ten years, regardless of resignation or retirement.”“The board should provide transparency on total remuneration to avoid unacceptable outcomes. The board should ensure that all benefits have a clear business rationale. Pensionable income should constitute a minor part of total remuneration,” it added.Norway’s sovereign wealth fund has a long-standing policy of pushing for stronger corporate governance and stricter executive pay practices, and its votes reflect those positions.As for voting against Nadella’s re-election as Director, the Fund said “The board should exercise objective judgement on corporate affairs and be able to make decisions independently of management. The roles of chairperson and CEO should not be held by the same individual. Where a company founder combines both roles, we may support this for a limited period, provided the board has put in place measures to mitigate any conflicts of interest. ”At the annual shareholder meet, the Microsoft board approved Nadell’s new compensation plan that increases his annual compensation to $96.5 million for fiscal 2025. This record high is driven by a 23% stock surge in 2025, with shares doubling in value over three years. The Microsoft Board’s compensation committee cited exceptional progress in AI as a key factor for approving the compensation package.Satya Nadella's pay package, detailed in regulatory filings, reflects a 22% increase from the previous year, largely fueled by stock awards tied to the company’s surging share price.","Norway’s $2 trillion Sovereign Wealth Fund recently voted against two key proposals involving Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.

IBM CEO quotes ‘Today’s Number’ and why it may scare Sam Altman and other technology companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ibm-ceo-quotes-todays-number-and-why-it-may-scare-sam-altman-and-other-technology-companies/articleshow/125958861.cms,"The debate over returns

IBM CEO feels correct technology has only “zero to 1%” chance of achieving AGI







IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has now issued a warning as the artificial intelligence companies are racing to build massive data centres. Krishna said that the scale of spending required to pursue artificial general intelligence (AGI) could reach levels that threaten even the most ambitious technology companies including OpenAO and its CEO Sam Altman. Speaking at the Decoder podcast with Nilay Patel, Krishna said that filling a 1-gigawatt data center costs about $80 billion, a figure he dubbed “today’s number.” He noted that companies committing 20–30 gigawatts of infrastructure could face $1.5 trillion in spending at current costs. Along with this, Krishna also talked about the short lifespan of AI chips which have to replaced in five years. This replacement will lead to compounding financial burden.Krishan also estimated that an AGI investment of $8 trillion would need $800 billion of profit to just cover interest payments. So, this calculation further raise questions that whether such spending can be ever justified. ChatGPT creator OpenAI recently announced a $1.4 trillion in long-term buildout agreements with partners like Nvidia, Broadcom, Oracle and Alphabet. Altman believes that OpenAI is capable of generating returns on its capital investments.However, Krishna feels that the current infrastructure commitments reflect beliefs rather than confirmed outcomes.Krishan also said that he gives current technologies only a “zero to 1%” chance of achieving AGI, stressing that today’s large language models fall short of true intelligence. He emphasised that while current tools deliver significant enterprise value, they are not on a guaranteed path to AGI.Despite the warnings made by Krishna, the companies like Google, Microsoft and others are still accelerating spending. Google parent Alphabet recently raised its 2025 capital expenditure outlook to $91–93 billion, while Amazon lifted its estimate to $125 billion. Industry-wide, AI infrastructure investments are expected to reach $380 billion this year alone.Krishna suggested that achieving AGI will require combining large language models with forms of hard knowledge, though he admitted he remains “a maybe” on whether that approach would be sufficient.For now, he said, the industry should focus on the productivity gains current AI tools already deliver, while recognizing that trillion-dollar infrastructure bets may not guarantee breakthroughs.",IBM CEO feels correct technology has only “zero to 1%” chance of achieving AGI.

“No presidential administration can rewrite immigration law. No president can ignore the coequal branch of government of Congress, ignore the Constitution, or ignore the law.”

H-1B Showdown: Amazon, Google Microsoft Pour Billions Into India as 20 States Sue Trump

What White House said about the H1B lawsuit

“a necessary, initial, incremental step towards necessary reforms to the H-1B program. President Trump promised to put American workers first, and his commonsense action on H-1B visas does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages, while providing certainty to employers who need to bring the best talent from overseas.”





The US government is facing a new ‘problem’ over the H-1B visa fee, that was implemented a few months ago. California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that he, along with 19 other US states, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration's policy of hiking the fee on new H-1B visa petitions to an$100,000. Bonta argued that the increased costs for the skilled-worker visa are illegal because they surpass what Congress approved and run counter to the intent of the program.Bonta said in a press conference in San Francisco (as reported by Politico).=Major technology companies are among the biggest users of the H-1B visas to import high-skilled overseas employees. Critics have slammed the firms for using the program to hire cheaper labour rather than American workers. However, Bonta said the fees will exacerbate labor shortages across key sectors of the state economy by making it more difficult to fill positions for doctors, researchers, teachers, nurses, and public service workers.He also expressed concern that the $100,000 payout, issued by US President Donald Trump through a presidential proclamation in September, would be used selectively at the discretion of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.High-skilled immigration and H-1B visas have been a contentious topic among different groups, as many argue that these can help bring in more global talent into the tech fields.The president's stance on the policy has changed since its release, particularly after he began building closer relationships with top tech industry executives whose companies rely on the H-1B program.In an interaction last month with Fox News host Laura Ingraham on H-1B visas, he said the country has abundant talent. He added that the nation still needs to bring in labourers for some specialised areas.In a statement, responding to Politico about the lawsuit, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers defended the government’s actions. He said that the visa fee hike was not only lawful butEarlier this year, the US Chamber of Commerce, joined by research universities, filed a lawsuit against the new H-1B fee, arguing that the administration overrode the provisions of the law governing the program.Another was filed on behalf of various groups including labour unions. This latest suit will be filed in Massachusetts federal court and will be spearheaded by California Attorney General Bonta and Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell.","20 US states have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration's policy of hiking the fee on new H-1B visa petitions to an$100,000.

Artificial general intelligence could arrive by 2029, warns tech leader





Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt expressed shock at artificial intelligence's rapid advancement in software development, declaring his own obsolescence after witnessing an AI system generate an entire program autonomously—a moment that crystallized both the promise and peril of the technology he has championed for decades.""Holy crap. The end of me,"" Schmidt said during a forum at Harvard University earlier this month. ""I've been doing programming for 55 years. To see something start and end in front of your own life is really profound.""The admission from one of Silicon Valley's most influential figures underscores a broader shift already underway: AI is moving from a helpful tool to a potential replacement for skilled human labor. At leading AI research labs, between 10 and 20 percent of programming work is already being done by AI systems, Schmidt revealed, with that proportion expected to grow exponentially in coming years.Despite the dramatic demonstration, Schmidt argued that AI remains underhyped rather than overhyped, as the technology's true economic impact lies beyond coding. Speaking with Professor Graham Allison at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at Harvard University, he pointed to the automation of corporate work as AI's biggest untapped potential.The real transformation is happening inside companies, where AI systems are taking over billing, accounting, product design, delivery, and inventory management, Schmidt explained.These routine processes quietly consume billions in corporate spending, and automating them could fundamentally reshape business operations.Schmidt predicted artificial general intelligence—systems matching the smartest mathematicians, physicists, and artists—will arrive within three to five years. This timeline is driven by what he calls ""recursive self-improvement,"" where AI learns independently without human instruction.""The computers are now doing self-improvement. They're learning how to plan, and they don't have to listen to us anymore,"" he warned at another recent event. Schmidt noted that AI already writes 10 to 20 percent of code at leading research labs like OpenAI and Anthropic.Looking further ahead, Schmidt forecast that within four years, AI will achieve autonomous learning capabilities. ""Many people believe that there will be AI mathematicians in the next year,"" he said, adding that the ability for computers to discover new facts and generate medical breakthroughs appears imminent.However, Schmidt emphasized the need for human oversight as AI approaches these capabilities. ""Somebody's going to have to raise their hand and say, 'We just went too far,'"" he cautioned. ""I think there's no higher duty than to preserve human agency and human freedom.""The former Google executive suggested Wall Street is underestimating the magnitude of AI's impact on business automation and scientific discovery.","Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt predicts artificial general intelligence could arrive by 2029.

Elon Musk on long working hours





Tesla CEO Elon Musk once said that major breakthroughs cannot be achieved on a standard 40-hour workweek. In 2018, the tech billionaire shared a X (formerly Twitter) post where he responded to an article about Tesla being one of Silicon Valley’s most in-demand employers by saying that “nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week. ”Musk later said the number varies by person, but suggested that around 80 hours a week — sometimes rising above 100 — is what it takes. Elon Musk has repeatedly pointed to his own experience working long hours during critical moments at Tesla, SpaceX and X.After the 2018 post, a user asked Elon Musk what the “correct” number of hours would be to “change the world.” To this, the tech CEO replied: “Varies per person, but about 80 sustained, peaking above 100 at times. Pain level increases exponentially above 80.”“If you love what you do, it (mostly) doesn’t feel like work,” he added.Musk has shared examples from his career to show how demanding periods required long days. In 2021, he said Tesla closed an important financing round at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve, preventing a situation where employee paychecks could have bounced two days later.In 2023, after buying Twitter (now X), Musk faced rising data-center costs. According to Walter Isaacson’s biography Elon Musk, he ordered a large server migration with a 90-day deadline instead of the nine-month timeline suggested by staff. When delays occurred, Musk flew to Sacramento on Christmas Eve and joined a small team to physically move equipment, rewire panels and dismantle server racks.Isaacson’s book also recounts personal moments that reflect Musk’s intensity. In one incident, he went barefoot into a snowstorm to find flowers for then-wife Talulah Riley, returning hours later injured but carrying the bouquet.","Elon Musk once said that major breakthroughs cannot be achieved on a standard 40-hour workweek.

Beijing prioritises China-made chips and offering incentives







China is rejecting US-made AI chips, specifically Nvidia's H200, in favour of domestically developed semiconductors, White House AI czar David Sacks has said, essentially casting doubts on Trump administration’s strategy to challenge Chinese tech giants like Huawei by allowing the export of less advanced American chips to capture market share.“They’re rejecting our chips. Apparently they don’t want them, and I think the reason for that is they want semiconductor independence,” Sacks said in a Bloomberg interview, citing an unspecified news article.His comments came days after President Donald Trump announced that his administration will allow Nvidia to send shipments of the H200 to China. Sacks supported this decision saying that allowing the export of the “lagging” technology will help America take market share from Chinese rivals.However, Sacks now believes Beijing has seen through the strategy.“I think the Chinese government has figured that out, and that’s why they’re not allowing them,” he said, noting that China is prioritising the “prop up and subsidize” of domestic champions like Huawei.Nvidia has stated that it is continuing to work with the administration on H200 licenses for vetted customers. According to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts, the H200 may possibly generate $10 billion annually in China, but only if the chips are accepted.“While we do not yet have results to report, it’s clear that three years of overbroad export controls fueled America’s foreign competitors and cost US taxpayers billions of dollars,” the company said in a spokesperson statement.According to the report, the US policy shift came after an assessment that Huawei's AI systems offered comparable power to the H200, which was introduced in 2023 and is second-best to Nvidia’s Blackwell line.Meanwhile, reports claim that China is planning to offer a massive $70 billion incentive package to push its local chipmaking industry even as it reduces reliance on foreign suppliers. Earlier this year, China had also reportedly shunned the H20, a less capable chip the Trump administration had approved for export over the summer.Liu Pengyu, a Chinese embassy spokesperson, stated that cooperation on technology and the economy is in the common interest of both nations. “We hope the US will work with China to take concrete actions to maintain the stability and smooth functioning of global supply chains,” he said, as per Bloomberg.It is to be noted that Beijing has not yet publicly agreed to or rejected the H200 imports.","White House AI czar David Sacks says China is rejecting US-made AI chips, specifically Nvidia's H200.

Google is reportedly testing a new feature that will allow users to mark up images directly inside the Gemini app and on the web. According to a report by Android Authority, the feature, first spotted in earlier code leaks, now appears to be active for some users. The feature, the report says, is visible in both the Gemini mobile app and the desktop version accessed through Chrome. When users attach an image in the Gemini app on Android, a notification appears informing them about the new capability.The tool lets users draw or highlight specific areas on an image before sending it to Gemini. This makes it easier for the AI to understand which part of the image the user is referring to when asking a question or giving instructions. The feature also supports simple edits based on user input.Screenshots shared by testers show that Gemini responds accurately when users mark a certain region of an image, helping the AI analyse or modify only that selected portion.Google has not officially announced the rollout, and it is unclear when the feature will be available to all users.In a related news, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model as “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.”Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.

Dr. Fei-Fei Li, the renowned Stanford professor and CEO of AI startup World Labs, has said that traditional college degrees are becoming less important in Silicon Valley hiring as companies like hers are more interested in a candidate’s practical experience and relationship with AI tools. Widely known as the “Godmother of AI” for her foundational work in computer vision, Li believes the availability of AI tools is shifting the value proposition of formal education in the labor market.In an interview on The Tim Ferriss Show this week, Li explained her talent search process for her startup:“When we interview a software engineer, I personally feel the degree they have matters less to us now,” Li said, as per a report by Fortune.“Now, it’s more about what have you learned, what tools do you use, how quickly can you superpower yourself in using these tools—and a lot of these are AI tools. What’s your mindset toward using these tools matter more to me,” she added.Li’s perspective on prioritising practical AI fluency over academic credentials aligns with the views of other major tech leaders such as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. The Meta CEO stated in October that skills often outweigh a traditional college degree when hiring, although entry-level roles still typically require a bachelor's.Similarly, Palantir CEO Alex Karp challenged the value of a traditional degree by launching a four-year paid internship program for young entrepreneurs not enrolled in college.For her own firm, Li stated she would not hire software engineers who fail to “embrace AI collaborative software tools”, clarifying that this requirement is not due to a belief in AI's perfection, but because it demonstrates a candidate’s ability to grow with fast-moving technology and use AI to their personal advantage.","Dr. Fei-Fei Li, the renowned Stanford professor and CEO of AI startup World Labs, has said that traditional college degrees are becoming less important in Silicon Valley hiring.

Blackwell chips could flip AI economics by 2026





Tesla CEO Elon Musk has raised an alarm over what he calls on impending “all-out war” in artificial intelligence hardware. Musk pointed to Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chips as the catalyst for a seismic shift in the industry. This warning from Musk came after investor Gavin Baker discussed that the increasing completion between major AI infrastructure players on the Invest Like the Best podcast. Bake talked about how Nvidia’s Blackwell platform can reshare the economics of AI once fully deployed. Responding to the same on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk wrote, “AI is the highest ELO battle ever. Speed of deployment of hardware, especially robotics, is the [linchpin].”For the unwary, the Elo rating system was originally designed for chess and it is now widely used to rank the performance in esports, sports and even in large language models, underscoring Musk’s view of AI as a high-stakes contest of speed and capability.Baker further explained that Nvidia’s transition from Hopper to Blackwell chips was “by far the most complex product transition we’ve ever gone through in technology,” citing challenges like higher power usage, liquid cooling, heavier racks, and heat management.All these delays temporarily gave an advantage to Google as it became the lowest-cost producer of AI ‘tokens’ aggressively cutting prices and squeezing competitors. Baker described Google’s strategy as rational but warned it was “sucking the economic oxygen out of the AI ecosystem.”Backer further explained that the first major AI models trained on Blackwell chips are said to come in early 2026, with Musk’s xAI potentially among the first to deploy them at scale. The newer GB300 systems are designed to be “drop-in compatible,” which could make Nvidia-powered AI systems the lowest-cost option in the future.This shift could force Google to abandon its current low-cost strategy, potentially pressuring its margins and stock performance. Baker warned that sustaining large losses would be “painful” and could reshape competitive behaviour across the AI industry.Adding to the intensifying battle, Meta Platforms is reportedly in talks to purchase Google’s tensor processing units (TPUs) for its data centers by 2026, with broader deployment planned for 2027. Nvidia, meanwhile, praised Google’s progress but asserted it remains “a generation ahead” of rivals.Musk’s warning underscores the hardware-centric nature of the AI race, where speed, scale, and cost efficiency will determine winners. With Nvidia’s Blackwell chips poised to redefine AI economics, and Google, Meta, and others vying for dominance, the next two years could mark a turning point in the global AI infrastructure war.",Tesla CEO Elon Musk has raised an alarm over what he calls on impending “all-out war” in artificial intelligence hardware.

Job cuts threat looms as Disney pushes for AI









Following its recent billion-dollar investment and licensing partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Disney is reportedly expanding its internal artificial intelligence (AI) toolkit, providing employees with custom and commercial AI software to boost productivity. Citing several Disney staffers, a report by Business Insider says that the move is a shift in the company’s technology strategy. Staffers claimed that the company seemed “hesitant to rely on AI tools” as recently as this past summer.“They clearly see where things are headed,” one longtime Disney software engineer was quoted as saying.The report noted that Disney has made several AI tools available to its employees:Staffers have access to platforms like Microsoft Copilot and Amazon's Q Developer. The company also announced that the recent OpenAI deal will soon give employees access to the enterprise version of ChatGPT.As per 4 staffers, there is an internal chatbot, “DisneyGPT,” which assists with internal requests, including creating IT support tickets, analyzing project financials, and viewing the company roster. This chatbot is said to incorporate signature company themes, greeting users with a prompt about being “ready for an enchanting adventure” and includes a verified collection of Walt Disney quotes tagged by themes like “imagination” and “leadership”.Disney is also said to be developing a highly advanced AI chatbot codenamed “Jarvis” – named after the personal assistant from Iron Man franchise. It is an agentic AI tool which is said to be a more advanced system than DisneyGPT and would be capable of completing complex tasks on an employee’s behalf, the report said, citing a source who also noted that the Jarvis project is still in its early, ""not fully baked"" stages.As the company pushes for AI, the acceleration has reportedly created friction among some employees, with three of eight staffers expressing concerns about AI potentially replacing humans and threatening job security.“If you use AI everywhere, it's going to be counterproductive,” the staffer said, adding that AI can make mistakes, lacks the “personalised touch” that people provide, and tasks still require human creativity.",Disney is reportedly expanding its internal artificial intelligence (AI) toolkit.

Oracle posted not-so-good quarterly results that fell short of Wall Street's revenue expectations. Soon a report by Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has postponed the completion dates for some of the massive data centres it is developing for artificial intelligence (AI) company OpenAI, pushing back timelines from 2027 to 2028. However, an Oracle spokesperson clarified that there has been no delays in meeting contractual commitments.“Site selection and delivery timelines were established in close coordination with OpenAI following execution of the agreement and were jointly agreed,” an Oracle spokesperson said in an email to CNBC, in response to a Bloomberg report which claimed delay in construction due to a shortage of labor and materials.“There have been no delays to any sites required to meet our contractual commitments, and all milestones remain on track,” the spokesperson added. The Oracle spokesperson, however, did not specify a timeline for turning on cloud computing infrastructure for OpenAI.The Bloomberg report pointed out that even with the delays, the remaining schedules for these US sites, which are slated to be among the largest data centers globally, are still considered ambitious.The development is part of a $300 billion contract signed earlier this year, under which Oracle is tasked with supplying the immense computing power necessary to train and run the ChatGPT-maker’s sophisticated AI models.Following the news, Oracle's shares dropped by 4%, as per CNBC. Despite the reported setbacks on some sites, Oracle Co-CEO Clay Magouyrk offered an optimistic outlook on delivery during an earnings call this week.“We have ambitious achievable goals for capacity delivery worldwide,” Magouyrk said. He confirmed that the first data centre being developed for OpenAI, located in Abilene, Texas, remains on track, with over 96,000 Nvidia Corp. chips already delivered.","Report claims Oracle has postponed completion dates for some of its massive data centres it is developing for artificial intelligence company OpenAI.

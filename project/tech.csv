Errol Musk's Stunning Disclosure On Trump-Elon Public Spat | 'In Heat Of The Moment...'

Errol Musk’s on Elon Musk and Donald Trump’s fight

Elon Musk and Donald Trump dispute



The public feud between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump is not a political falling out, but rather a consequence of prolonged stress and potential ""PTSD from the White House"" on his son's part, according to Errol Musk, Elon's father. Speaking to Russian media in Moscow, the Elon Musk’s father suggested his son made a ""mistake"" by publicly confronting Trump. The relationship between the two high-profile figures, once characterized by mutual admiration and a seemingly strong alliance, has recently dissolved into a bitter public exchange, primarily on social media. The spat intensified after Elon Musk denounced Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" a sweeping tax and spending package, calling it a ""disgusting abomination."" This led to a series of escalating criticisms from both sides, including Elon Musk's unsubstantiated suggestion that Trump had ties to the late Jeffrey Epstein.Speaking to Russian media, Errol Musk described the clash as a “mistake” on Elon’s part, suggesting that both Musk and Trump had been under intense pressure for months.""They're very tired and stressed, so you can expect something like this. Elon made a mistake, I think. But he is tired."" He further downplayed the severity of the rift, calling it ""a small thing"" that would ""be over tomorrow.""Elon Musk’s father also commented on his son's foray into the political arena, suggesting that Elon is ""not a great politician."" ""He's a great tech innovator, but not a great politician. His politics is like a swimming pool with no sides and no bottom,"" Errol stated, offering a candid assessment of his son's public political engagements.The feud began when Elon Musk criticised Trump’s tax and spending bill, calling it a “disgusting abomination.” Trump retaliated by threatening to cut federal contracts with Musk’s companies, including SpaceX and Tesla. Musk then suggested Trump’s name appeared in sealed Jeffrey Epstein files, further escalating tensions.","Errol Musk, Elon Musk's father, said his son made a ""mistake"" by publicly confronting Donald Trump.

Smart AC Hacks to Cut Your Electricity Bill & Make It Last Longer!

Maharashtra’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has suspended the food business licence of Blinkit ’s dark store in Pune’s Balewadi area. According to a report by Economic Times, the FDA conducted an investigation on June 5 and found that the dark store was operating without the required approvals from the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).

The inspection report flagged issues such as food placed directly on the floor, lack of pest control certification, workers without protective gear, dusty storage racks, and a cold storage unit missing a calibration certificate.This action is part of a broader crackdown by authorities on quick commerce “dark stores” amid rising concerns about food hygiene and safety.Earlier this month, Maharashtra’s FDA cancelled the food business licence of Zepto’s Dharavi facility after an inspection revealed multiple hygiene and food safety norms violations.

[4K] Xbox Games Showcase 2025 | The Outer Worlds 2 & Grounded 2 Direct

Microsoft just wrapped up their biggest gaming showcase of the year, and honestly? They came loaded for bear. From brand new handhelds to surprise Final Fantasy drops, this wasn't your typical ""here's what's coming eventually"" presentation. The Xbox Games Showcase 2025 delivered actual release dates, playable demos, and enough surprises to keep Twitter buzzing for weeks.The show's theme was clear: Xbox wants to be everywhere you are, whether that's your couch, your desk, or apparently now in your backpack. With every announced game supporting Xbox Play Anywhere and a shiny new handheld to show off, Microsoft is doubling down on their ""play anywhere"" philosophy in a big way.Let's break down everything that happened during this gaming extravaganza.The biggest hardware surprise came courtesy of Microsoft's partnership with Asus. The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X aren't just another Steam Deck competitor, they’re Microsoft's direct answer to handheld PC gaming. Both the Ally(s) run full Windows, meaning you can access Xbox Game Pass, Steam, Battle.net, and pretty much any PC storefront you can think of.The regular Ally packs an AMD Ryzen Z2A processor with 16GB of RAM and 512GB storage, while the Ally X steps things up with a Ryzen Z2 Extreme, 24GB of RAM, and a full terabyte of storage. Both launch this holiday season, and Microsoft made sure to mention that every game shown in the showcase will run on these handhelds. That's a bold claim, but if it holds true, these could be game-changers for portable gaming.After years of waiting, Obsidian's space RPG sequel has locked in October 29, 2025 as its launch date. The new trailer showed off the colony of Arcadia, which looks like it's having a significantly worse time than the locations in the first game. Rifts are tearing through space-time, factions are at each other's throats, and somehow capitalism is still the real villain.The sequel promises bigger RPG systems, more reactive storytelling, and full character customisation. Plus, there's an expanded Direct happening right after the showcase, so Obsidian clearly has a lot more to show. If you enjoyed the original's blend of dark humour and corporate satire, this looks like more of exactly what you want.October 21, 2025 marks the return of one of gaming's most brutally difficult action series. Ninja Gaiden 4 is a collaboration between Team Ninja and PlatinumGames, which sounds like a recipe for some absolutely bonkers combat sequences. The trailer showcased new protagonist Yakumo pulling off impossible combos against hordes of enemies, with the signature weapon-switching and aerial juggling the series is known for.The game is set in near-future Tokyo, features connections to series legend Ryu Hayabusa, and promises to deliver that ""git gud or go home"" difficulty the franchise built its reputation on. If you've been missing proper character action games, this one's shaping up to be essential.Sometimes the most unexpected announcements hit the hardest, and Super Meat Boy 3D definitely qualifies. Sluggerfly and Headup Games are taking Team Meat's masochistic masterpiece and literally adding another dimension to the suffering. The early 2026 release promises all the wall-jumping, buzzsaw-dodging, death-filled gameplay that made the original a cult classic, except now you can fail spectacularly in three dimensions instead of two.The trailer showcased the same tight platforming mechanics that turned controllers into projectiles worldwide, complete with Meat Boy's quest to rescue his bandage-wrapped girlfriend from that eternally creepy fetus in a jar. It's the kind of game that makes you question your life choices while simultaneously hitting ""retry"" for the 500th time – and honestly, we wouldn't have it any other way.InXile's ambitious RPG got an extended look, and it's looking appropriately ambitious. Set in the steampunk city of Avalon, players discover that history itself has been manipulated by the city's ruler. Your solution? A time travel device that lets you hop into the past and change things, with consequences rippling forward into the present.The new trailer focused on the grittier side of Avalon, showing the downtrodden areas where gangs prey on the weak. It's a far cry from the polished upper city areas we've seen before, suggesting the game will have some real social commentary alongside its time-bending mechanics. No release date yet, but this is definitely one to watch.The final reveal of the show was perhaps the biggest surprise, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, set in 2035. This isn't your typical modern warfare setup; the trailer suggested heavy sci-fi elements, psychological warfare, and the return of David Mason from Black Ops 2. The year 2035 apparently isn't going great for humanity, with the world ""on the brink of chaos"" following the events of previous Black Ops games.Treyarch and Raven Software are promising co-op campaign support, near-future weaponry, and the next chapter of Round-Based Zombies. The official reveal is coming this summer, but this teaser suggests the series is taking some big swings with its setting and tone.Sometimes the best announcements are the ones you can play immediately. Gears of War: Reloaded launches August 26, but Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members can jump into a multiplayer beta starting June 13. This definitive edition of the original Gears features 4K textures, 60 FPS campaign, 120 FPS multiplayer, and full cross-play support.The remaster is coming to more platforms than any Gears game before it, including PlayStation 5. It's a smart move from Microsoft, using one of their biggest exclusives to showcase their multi-platform strategy while giving longtime fans the definitive way to experience the game that started it all.Obsidian's surprise sequel announcement came with an immediate Early Access date, July 29, 2025. Grounded 2 moves the action from a single backyard to the larger Brookhollow Park, featuring new biomes, new bugs, and one of the community's most requested features: rideable vehicles called Buggies.The game promises major quality-of-life improvements over the original, including an all-in-one Omni-Tool that should streamline the building and crafting systems. With over 25 million players shaping the first game's development, this sequel feels like a direct response to community feedback.In the showcase's biggest surprise drop, Final Fantasy XVI is available on Xbox platforms right now. Not tomorrow, not next week, today. The game that many considered a permanent PlayStation exclusive just became part of Xbox's catalog, complete with Xbox Play Anywhere support and cross-save functionality.Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is following this winter, meaning Xbox players will soon have access to some of the most acclaimed JRPGs of recent years. Microsoft made sure to point out that every mainline single-player Final Fantasy is now playable on Xbox platforms, which is a pretty impressive collection to have.Three RPGs caught attention for their unique approaches to familiar genres. Aniimo is an open-world creature collecting game that lets players actually transform into the creatures they capture through something called the Twining system. It's hitting 2026 with a closed beta coming later this year.Aphelion from Don't Nod (Life is Strange, Jusant) is a sci-fi adventure about an astronaut stranded on a frozen planet. What makes it special is its partnership with the European Space Agency, promising gameplay grounded in real science. Beast of Reincarnation from Game Freak takes players to post-apocalyptic Japan with a cursed protagonist and her loyal dog companion fighting massive creatures.All three games are coming in 2026.Quarter Up announced Invincible VS , a 3v3 tag fighter based on the hit comic and animated series. The trailer showed appropriately brutal superhero combat with characters like Mark, Thula, and Atom Eve beating the absolute stuffing out of each other. It's coming in 2026 and looks like it could scratch that Marvel vs. Capcom itch.Mudang: Two Hearts is a tactical action game set in a reunified Korea, following a North Korean operative and a K-pop idol whose paths cross during terrorist attacks. The cinematic presentation and Unreal Engine 5 visuals make it one to watch for 2026.Persona 4 Revival got the briefest of teases, literally about seven seconds of footage, but it's enough to confirm that Atlus is giving the beloved JRPG a full remake treatment. No release date yet, but seeing those updated visuals of Inaba was enough to get fans excited.Three major Xbox exclusives are getting substantial content drops. The Elder Scrolls Online is continuing its Worm Cult storyline with new content arriving June 18. Fallout 76 added fishing with the Gone Fission update, because apparently even post-apocalyptic wasteland dwellers need to relax sometimes.Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is getting The Order of Giants DLC on September 4, taking Indy beneath the streets of Rome for a new adventure.The most anticipated indie game of the decade got its briefest of mentions, but sometimes that's all you need to send a fanbase into overdrive. Hollow Knight: Silksong appeared during the ROG Xbox Ally segment with a simple promise: it'll be available ""at launch and in Game Pass"" when the handheld arrives later this year. No new footage, no release date, just the confirmation that Team Cherry's long-awaited sequel is still breathing.The game's developer quickly clarified that Silksong isn't tied to the console's release and will arrive ""before Holiday,"" which has fans cautiously optimistic that Christmas 2025 might finally deliver the Metroidvania sequel they've been waiting years for.

Apple Intelligence gets some new tricks up its sleeve



Your phone app just got way better at blocking annoying calls

Every other app gets some love too

iOS 19 is here, oops, iOS 26 is here, and it has an all new ' Liquid Glass ' design, then some. It builds on the Apple Intelligence , making use of the model's understanding of its natural language. Then, the core iPhone apps, like Phone, Messaging, and others, are too changing, not just visually but also functionally. Apple announced all this at WWDC 2025, and it's a bigger refresh than the ones we have got in the past few years.First up, what’s with the name? Well, Apple has made some changes to its numbering scheme. Instead of the expected iOS 19, we're jumping to iOS 26. Apple says it is to keep things simple.So what's this Liquid Glass thing about?Think translucent materials that actually react to what's around them , reflecting and refracting light in ways that make your iPhone feel more dynamic. It's not just about looking pretty, though it does that too. Your app icons, widgets, and typography, they all get this new reflective, refractive treatment that supposedly makes them more ""expressive.""The Lock Screen time now stretches and adapts to fit around your wallpaper images, and those spatial wallpapers actually move with a 3D effect when you tilt your phone. Plus, the time display gets artistic, fluidly wrapping around elements in your photos instead of just sitting there like a boring rectangle.Safari gets the edge-to-edge treatment, letting web pages flow from top to bottom while keeping the important stuff like refresh and search easily accessible. Even the tab bars in Apple Music and Podcasts float and shrink when you're browsing, then expand back up when needed.The AI stuff is where things get interesting, though. Live Translation is probably the standout feature here, it works right inside Messages, FaceTime, and regular phone calls, translating everything in real-time. No internet required, it's all happening on your device. You could literally have a conversation with someone in Spanish while you're speaking English, and both of you would understand each other perfectly.Then there's Visual Intelligence, which lets you take screenshots of literally anything on your screen and ask questions about it. See a jacket in an Instagram post? Screenshot it, and iOS 26 can help you find where to buy it through Google or Etsy. Spot an event flyer? It'll offer to add those details straight to your calendar. It's like having a really smart assistant that can actually see what you're looking at. Sounds much like Google Lens, isn't it?The Phone app is getting some much-needed love with Call Screening. Instead of you having to deal with unknown callers, your iPhone can answer first, figure out who's calling and why, then give you the details so you can decide if it's worth your time. There's also Hold Assist, which basically babysits you while you're stuck on hold and alerts you when an actual human gets on the line.Messages isn't being left out either. Unknown senders get filtered into their own folder, so your main conversation list stays clean. You can create polls now (and Apple Intelligence will suggest when that might be useful), plus generate custom backgrounds for your chats using Image Playground. Group chats finally get typing indicators too, which feels long overdue.Other apps get their moment too. There's also a bunch of smaller touches that add up – the Camera app gets a cleaner, more streamlined layout that hides controls so you can focus on what you're shooting. The Photos app splits into separate Library and Collections tabs for easier navigation. Apple Music learns lyrics translation and pronunciation, plus an AutoMix feature that transitions between songs like a DJ would. Maps remembers where you've been and learns your preferred routes, even sending notifications about delays on your usual commute.Wallet gets smarter boarding passes that link to airport maps and Find My for tracking luggage, plus the ability to choose instalment payments right at checkout with Apple Pay. Safari beefs up privacy with better fingerprinting protection, while parents get easier Child Account setup with enhanced safety features. And accessibility gets a boost with new features like Accessibility Reader for customized reading experiences and Braille Access for connected braille displays.The new Apple Games app brings together all your gaming stuff in one place, making it easier to jump back into games and see what friends are playing.iOS 26 drops this fall, free for iPhone 11 and up, with Apple Intelligence needing the usual newer hardware.","iOS 26 has a new Liquid Glass design that makes everything feel more alive.

In the Messages app, text will be automatically translated as users type, delivering messages directly in the recipient's preferred language. Responses will also be instantly translated back, allowing for fluid, back-and-forth communication.

YouTube has confirmed it is working with Nintendo to bring its video streaming app to the Switch 2 ""soon,"" addressing one of the new console's notable omissions at launch.The announcement came via the official TeamYouTube account on X after users reported that the original Switch's YouTube app is incompatible with Nintendo's latest handheld. When Switch 2 owners attempt to open the transferred app, they receive an error message stating the software cannot start.""We're working with Nintendo to make YouTube available on the Switch 2 soon,"" the company posted in response to user inquiries. No specific timeline or additional details were provided about whether YouTube will update the existing app or create a Switch 2-specific version.The YouTube compatibility issue extends beyond a single app. Nintendo has previously confirmed that several popular streaming services from the original Switch don't work on the Switch 2, including Hulu, Crunchyroll, and Japan-based platforms Niconico and Abema. None of these services have announced updates for the new console.The situation mirrors the original Switch's launch experience, when YouTube took over a year and a half to arrive on the platform. The app finally debuted on the Switch eShop in November 2018, well after the console's March 2017 release.Released on June 5, the Switch 2 features several hardware improvements over its predecessor, including a larger screen, magnetic Joy-Con controllers, and a more powerful custom Nvidia processor. While the console maintains backward compatibility with most Switch games and apps, streaming services appear to require specific updates to function properly on the new hardware.",YouTube is working with Nintendo to bring its video streaming app to the Switch 2.

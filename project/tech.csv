FTX also names former Binance CEO

FTX has filed a lawsuit against Binance and its former Chief Executive Officer Changpeng Zhao . The bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange firm aims to recover nearly $1.8 billion, claiming it was fraudulently transferred by Sam Bankman-Fried – former CEO of FTX to Binance and its executives.The lawsuit concerns Binance’s sale of its stake in FTX, originally acquired in 2019 and later sold back to FTX in a deal negotiated in July 2021. It claims that FTX's sister trading house Alameda Research division directly funded the share repurchase using tokens which had a then fair market value of $1.76 billion.Alameda, the lawsuit alleges, was insolvent at the time of buying the shares and could not therefore afford to fund the transaction and it should not have been allowed to proceed. Alameda Research “may have been insolvent from inception and certainly were balance-sheet insolvent by early 2021,” the estate said in the filing. As a result, the share repurchase deal was made fraudulently, the lawsuit alleges.“By this lawsuit, the Plaintiffs seek to recover, for the benefit of FTX’s creditors, at least $1.76 billion that was fraudulently transferred to Binance and its executives at the FTX creditors’ expense, as well as compensatory and punitive damages to be determined at trial,” the administrators for the FTX estate said.FTX also accuses CEO Changpeng Zhao of posting a series of “false, misleading, and fraudulent tweets” shortly before FTX’s collapse, the content of which was “maliciously calculated to destroy his rival.”What Binance saysIn a statement, a Binance spokesperson said “The claims are meritless, and we will vigorously defend ourselves”.",FTX has filed a lawsuit against Binance and its former Chief Executive Officer Changpeng Zhao.

How a Google search led to man losing Rs 4.1 lakh in cab booking fraud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-a-google-search-led-to-man-losing-rs-4-1-lakh-in-cab-booking-fraud/articleshow/115192124.cms,"How scammers ‘fool’ users into debit/ credit card fraud

What Google is doing to prevent fake listings on Search

A man from West Bengal fell to an online scam, losing Rs 4.1 lakh while attempting to book a cab in Udupi, Karnataka. The victim appears to have scammed into entering his card details on a fake payment page linked to the fraudulent car rental website that appeared in Google search.According to a report, the man searched for car rental services on Google and clicked on a link for “Shakti Car Rentals”. He was shortly contacted by an individual posing as a company representative named Rohit Sharma, who instructed him to pay a Rs 150 registration fee as a token through the website.Despite multiple attempts to pay with his debit and credit cards, the victim did not receive the OTP (one-time password) needed for the transaction to complete. However, shortly after, he received bank notifications indicating that sums of money have been debited from his accounts.He said that bank messages indicated that Rs 3.3 lakh was debited from his SBI credit card and Rs 80,056 from his Canara Bank debit card, totalling Rs 4.1 lakh. A case has been registered at the Udupi Town police station, and authorities are investigating the matter.Debit card fraud happens when unauthorised persons get hold of someone’s card information, including PIN, to make unauthorised purchases or drain bank accounts. They can steal information in various ways, including faking a website listing on Google Search.They can redirect people onto fake websites to make payments for services and steal their sensitive information like name, card numbers and CVV, to withdraw large sums of money.Earlier this year, Google said that it has developed a new algorithm that helped the company successfully stop scammers, protecting millions of users and businesses from fraudulent activity. The algorithm, Google says, is designed to detect suspicious patterns and anomalies that play a crucial role in identifying and neutralising the scam.Once the system spots an anomaly, Google’s team of investigators analyse reports and work with people who were contacted by scammers.“Once we pinpointed patterns, like what categories of businesses were being targeted, we refined our algorithms to help protect hundreds of targeted businesses from the bad actors,” Google said in its report.","A man from West Bengal fell to an online scam, losing Rs 4.1 lakh while attempting to book a cab in Udupi, Karnataka.

Fierce battle for the 'Indian Skies'

Starlink's India licence application is reportedly set to move forward after the Elon Musk-led satellite broadband company agreed to meet the government's data localisation and security requirements. According to a report in MoneyControl.com, this has been a major point of contention. Starlink had applied for a global mobile personal communication by satellite services (GMPCS) licence in October 2022. The Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite Services (GMPCS) licence is the first step towards setting up a satellite internet by acquiring a trial spectrum at a nominal application fee.In recent meetings with the Department of Telecommunication (DoT), Starlink has reportedly ""in principle"" committed to complying with these guidelines, a critical step towards securing a satellite broadband services licence or GMPCS licence.The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has asked Starlink to provide compliances regarding certain security parameters as it looks to process their applications for offering satellite communications services in the country. There are said to be various security-related compliances as well as those related to data, coverage area etc which Satellite internet service providers have to give to the government in order to offer services in India.According to security guidelines, a satellite communications company operating in India must store all data within the country. According to security guidelines, a satellite communications company operating in India must store all data within the country. This requirement is a prerequisite for the grant of licence by DoT. Starlink may also reportedly need to show how intelligence agencies will be able to intercept data if and when required.Starlink, however, is yet to submit its agreement on meeting the conditions.A heated dispute is brewing between India's leading private telecom operators -— Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, and Vodafone Idea -— and global satellite communication giants like Starlink and Amazon. At the heart of the conflict lies the allocation and pricing of satellite spectrum, a crucial resource for providing broadband services from space.During a recent open house session, Indian telecom companies advocated for a level playing field. They voiced concerns about the potential impact of satellite operators like Starlink and Amazon, which aim to offer satellite broadband services in urban areas, directly competing with traditional providers.Telecom operators argue that only auctioned satellite spectrum should be used to serve urban or ""retail"" consumers. They emphasize the need for a regulatory framework that ensures fair competition between terrestrial and satellite operators, given the rapid advancements in satellite communication technology.Starlink, however, maintains that telecom and satellite services are fundamentally distinct and should not be compared. Parnil Urdhwareshe, Director of Starlink India, suggested that satellite spectrum, similar to 5G mobile spectrum, could be allocated administratively rather than through an auction process.",Starlink's India licence application is reportedly set to move forward after the Elon Musk-led satellite broadband company agreed to meet the government's data localisation and security requirements.

Cybersecurity and the growing threat of SEO poisoning

Importance of cyber hygiene for everyday users

In a surprising turn of events, internet users who searchmay inadvertently become victims of a sophisticated cyberattack. According to the New York Post, cybersecurity firm Sophos recently issued a warning, urging people to avoid typing this specific phrase into Google. Sophos explains that fraudulent links related to this search appear high in Google search results, posing a threat to users' personal information. Through an insidious technique known as "" SEO poisoning ,"" cybercriminals have managed to exploit this seemingly harmless search term, leading unsuspecting users to click on malicious links. Sophos’s alert sheds light on how hackers target ordinary searches to compromise security.The phrase ""Are Bengal Cats legal in Australia?"" might seem like an innocent query, but hackers are using SEO poisoning to infiltrate these specific Google search results. SEO poisoning is a technique where cybercriminals manipulate search engine optimization (SEO) to ensure their malicious websites appear at the top of Google search results. When users click on these seemingly legitimate links, they are redirected to malicious sites that can steal personal information, including sensitive data such as bank details and login credentials. According to Sophos, the links are particularly dangerous for users in Australia, as the hack only appears when “Australia” is included in the search phrase.Sophos has identified that users who click on these fraudulent links are at risk of downloading a program known as Gootloader. This malware infiltrates users' computers and enables hackers to steal personal information or lock users out of their systems altogether. Gootloader is a multi-stage malware that begins by embedding itself within the system, then spreads to extract data or disrupt user access. This program not only allows unauthorised access to personal information but also opens the door for further infiltration, potentially installing additional malware on the infected system.The specific search term, ""Are Bengal Cats legal in Australia?"" may appear to be niche, yet cybersecurity experts warn that this is what makes the threat even more dangerous. Because the search is relatively uncommon, users may not suspect it to be risky. According to Sophos, such seemingly innocuous queries lure people into a false sense of security, increasing their likelihood of clicking on malicious links without suspecting foul play.Sophos emphasises that SEO poisoning is a growing trend among hackers looking to infiltrate legitimate Google searches. By targeting niche queries that draw genuine interest, cybercriminals increase their chances of catching users off guard. The tactic allows them to capitalise on unassuming searches to execute complex hacks.To protect against this threat, Sophos has outlined several steps users should take if they believe they may have fallen victim to SEO poisoning:Sophos’s warnings highlight the need for heightened awareness among internet users and underline the importance of verifying links before clicking.Sophos’s findings illustrate how SEO poisoning is evolving into a serious threat in the cybersecurity landscape. By manipulating search engines, hackers now use legitimate-seeming results to trick users into clicking on fraudulent websites. This method bypasses traditional phishing tactics, instead targeting users through the search engines they trust.According to Sophos, this SEO poisoning technique is not isolated and has been used in other cases to promote malicious links to the top of search results. The hackers’ strategy involves disguising their sites with relevant keywords, misleading users into believing these are reputable resources. The practice has caught the attention of cybersecurity firms worldwide, as it reveals vulnerabilities within search engines’ algorithms that can be exploited to compromise users’ online security.Sophos’s alert serves as a reminder that practising good cyber hygiene is critical. Even basic online activities like performing Google searches can expose users to potential threats. Sophos advises that users take time to verify the legitimacy of any link before clicking, especially when it appears in an uncommon or niche search result. By hovering over links, inspecting URLs, and relying on trusted sources, users can minimise the risk of encountering malware.",Cybersecurity firm Sophos has issued a warning on the threat of 'SEO poisoning' Cybercriminals are using this technique to infiltrate Google search results.

The UK’s National Health Service (NHS) is pioneering a new approach to detect throat cancer by using an iPhone-based imaging device, aiming to reduce waiting times and streamline cancer diagnostics. With rising cancer referrals creating extensive backlogs, this trial offers a potential breakthrough in early detection, providing patients with quicker results and reducing anxiety associated with waiting periods. A camera adapter, attached to an iPhone, allows healthcare professionals to capture clear images of patients' throats and transmit them to specialists for review within hours. This approach has already shown promising results, bringing innovative, patient-centred care to NHS services.The device used in the NHS trial, developed by Endoscope-i Ltd, combines a 32mm lens adapter with an endoscope eyepiece that connects to an iPhone. The tool is designed to take high-resolution images of the throat area and uses a secure app to upload these images to the cloud, where specialists can access them remotely. Typically, throat cancer diagnosis requires an endoscopy—a hospital procedure involving a long tube with a camera inserted through the mouth or nose. This new device, however, eliminates the need for hospital visits for initial screenings, enabling patients to receive this diagnostic service in community clinics or even GP offices.The device has already been tested on over 1,800 patients across various NHS trusts. One participant, 76-year-old Janet Hennessy from Stoke-on-Trent, shared her positive experience, explaining that the device helped streamline her diagnostic process, reducing what usually takes up to three weeks to just a few days. ""I think the app is absolutely brilliant,"" she remarked, highlighting the efficiency and convenience of the trial.The NHS reports that in the past four months, more than 75% of patients tested received their results within a 28-day timeframe, aligning with NHS’s target to inform patients within this period. With early detection being a critical factor in effective cancer treatment, this iPhone-based diagnostic tool could revolutionise the NHS’s approach to cancer care, providing patients with timely diagnoses and relieving healthcare systems burdened by backlog.The surge in referrals has led to a significant backlog in cancer diagnostics, with projections by Cancer Research UK indicating that over 300,000 patients may face delays in cancer treatment by 2029. NHS National Cancer Director Dr. Cally Palmer emphasised that detecting cancer early remains crucial to improving survival rates and reducing treatment bottlenecks. “For those needing tests to investigate suspected cancer, it can be an extremely worrying time, and being able to rule out the disease sooner can make a huge difference for people and their families,” Dr. Palmer stated.Consultant head and neck surgeon Ajith George from University Hospitals North Midlands NHS Trust pointed out that the device represents a “radical change” for the cancer referral system. “Streamlining services helps keep the focus on those unfortunate patients who get a cancer diagnosis,” George said, underscoring the need for efficient diagnostics to prioritise patients with confirmed cases.The NHS has been exploring various technologies to address diagnostic and treatment delays across healthcare facilities. Besides this iPhone-based throat cancer device, other innovations have been piloted, including a sponge for detecting esophageal cancer and a genetic home-testing kit for those predisposed to certain cancers. These innovations align with the NHS’s vision to decentralise some diagnostic services, enabling more patients to be screened closer to home and reducing the strain on hospital resources.This trial device is currently being tested across multiple NHS trusts in the West Midlands, and if successful, it may be rolled out nationally. By bringing diagnostic services into more accessible locations, the NHS is hoping to reach its goal of providing faster and more reliable cancer care throughout the UK.One significant advantage of the iPhone-based imaging device is its potential to move cancer screening from hospitals into community healthcare settings. This shift helps reduce pressure on hospitals, especially amid increasing demand and rising referral numbers. Patients who suspect they may have throat cancer can now avoid long waiting times for endoscopies in hospital settings. By facilitating faster screenings and reducing unnecessary hospital visits, this technology ensures that only patients with confirmed cancer cases proceed to hospitals for further treatment, creating a more streamlined referral system.The NHS’s ten-year plan emphasises technological innovation and improved patient access. Collaborating with government bodies, the NHS aims to incorporate advanced medical technology and ensure that patients receive timely diagnosis and treatments. This iPhone-based diagnostic device represents a step toward more accessible, tech-driven healthcare that could benefit both patients and healthcare providers.Dr. Palmer added that the NHS’s focus remains on providing high-quality care that meets the needs of an evolving patient demographic. The agency is optimistic about the potential of this device and similar innovations to transform cancer care, reduce delays, and bring necessary treatment options to patients as quickly as possible.","The UK’s National Health Service is pioneering a new approach to detect throat cancer by using an iPhone-based imaging device.

Why government is extra cautious on security

The Department of Telecommunications ( DoT ) has reportedly imposed stringent security requirements on Elon Musk 's Starlink and Jeff Bezos's Amazon before approving their satellite communication services in India. According to a report in Economic Times, both companies are expected to provide detailed compliance information regarding data security, coverage area, and other key parameters.While Bharti-backed OneWeb and Reliance Jio 's partnership with SES have already secured approval, Starlink and Amazon's applications are still pending due to the additional security checks.Officials aware of the details told ET that letters to both the US-based firms were sent recently and the department is awaiting their reply. ""Their applications can be processed only after they submit the compliance. The firms have so far not replied,"" said a person familiar with the details.Another official said that the government will wait for some more time for their reply, but the applications won't be processed till they agree to all the security conditions. ""There are various security-related compliances as well as those related to data, coverage area etc which satcom providers have to give to the government in order to offer services in India. All the boxes need to be ticked,"" said a third official.As per security requirements, the terminals have to stop communicating if there is a change in latitude and longitude position in order to prevent any misuse. In its replies to the government, Starlink had reportedly given a declaration that none of its investors were from countries sharing a land border with India -- primarily China and Pakistan. The government had accepted that declaration.The government's cautious approach is driven by concerns over potential security risks, especially given the strategic importance of satellite communications. The DoT is particularly interested in ensuring that satellite terminals near border areas are securely monitored and controlled to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is currently working on recommendations for pricing and other terms and conditions for allocating satellite spectrum. However, traditional telecom operators like Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea are advocating for a level playing field, arguing that satellite companies should be subject to the same regulations and liabilities as terrestrial operators.",The Department of Telecommunications ( DoT) has reportedly imposed stringent security requirements on Elon Musk's Starlink and Jeff Bezos's Amazon.

Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, and his wife, Sudha Murthy, recently shared some insights from their lives. The couple were the star guests on the popular talk show The Great Indian Kapil Sharma Show where they delighted the audience with candid, humorous stories from their personal lives.One of the show’s highlights was Narayana Murthy’s funny confession about forgetting their 25th wedding anniversary. He recalled, “One morning, Sudha asked me, ‘Is there anything special today?’ I replied, ‘No, nothing,’ and went to the office. As I was getting in the car, she asked again, ‘Think of anything special today?’ I still didn’t realize.”Later that day, while heading to Mumbai, Murthy received a call from their daughter, Akshata Murty, who was studying at Stanford University at the time. This is how the conversation went:“She asked, ‘What are you doing?’ I told her I was catching a flight. She immediately said, ‘Cancel it, get the first flight back to Bangalore, and wish your wife a happy anniversary!’”Narayana Murthy shared that he told her about a speech at 3pm but Akshata insisted, “I don’t care if you have a speech at 3 pm. If you need to hire a private plane, hire it, but come back and wish her!” Their daughter, Akshata Murty, is now married to former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.Sudha Murthy also chimed in, laughing, “It was our 25th wedding anniversary so it doesn’t happen every year. So I thought, let me give him a cue but it did not work… For five-ten minutes I felt bad because I’m also human. But my daughter was very upset, she went ‘In America this never happens!’, but I went ‘India main it happens though’, who can remember these things??”","Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, and his wife, Sudha, recently shared some insights from their lives.

Popular YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia , better known as BeerBiceps, has recently revealed a surprising incident from his early fitness journey. In a candid conversation on his YouTube channel, Allahbadia shared that he was once banned from a gym in Mumbai.In a recent interview with Kamiya Jani, founder of @curly.tales, he revealed that he was banned from a gym in Mumbai. Allahbadia revealed that he began his journey into content creation by sharing workout videos on YouTube. He filmed the initial content for his channel, BeerBiceps, at a gym in Wadala.To avoid the crowds, Allahbadia developed a routine of visiting the gym around 2 PM. He mentioned that with fewer people in the gym, he felt more comfortable and found it easier to record content for his channel.However, Allahbadia's growing popularity didn't sit well with the gym's trainers and he was banned from the gym. “The trainers were angry with me because I was growing. So, they banned me from the gym. I was very sad and upset,” said Allahbadia. He also revealed that the gym was later shut down.He also added that the incident proved to be a turning point in his career and he decided to set up his own home gym, which allowed him to continue his fitness journey without any restrictions.

Attorney General initiates health and privacy investigation

Equatorial Guinea’s Director General of the National Financial Investigation Agency (ANIF), Baltasar Ebang Engonga , is at the centre of a scandal following the leak of explicit videos allegedly involving him in intimate encounters with multiple individuals. Originally investigated for alleged fraud, Engonga now faces public backlash and intensified scrutiny over his professional conduct and personal life. This controversy has sparked widespread reaction on social media and raised questions regarding ethics, public responsibility, and potential health risks associated with his actions. As the scandal unfolds, government authorities have initiated an official investigation, underscoring the increasing call for accountability among public officials in Equatorial Guinea.The scandal began when investigators, initially looking into Engonga for suspected fraud, reportedly discovered over 400 videos on his computer depicting private interactions with various individuals. These encounters allegedly involved multiple partners, including his brother’s wife, a cousin, and a relative of the President. According to sources, the videos were filmed in locations such as Engonga’s office, hotels, and even restrooms, with all recorded interactions believed to be consensual.Once leaked, the videos rapidly circulated across social media, sparking outrage and debate among citizens. Public response to the videos has varied, with many questioning the ethical standards of a high-ranking public official engaging in such activities, while others raised concerns about the privacy breach that led to the leak. Posts across social platforms criticised the conduct of a figure responsible for financial investigations, with some users highlighting the discrepancy between his public role and personal actions.In response to the viral scandal, Equatorial Guinea’s Attorney General’s Office, led by Anatolio Nzang Nguema, launched an official investigation into the circumstances surrounding the video leak. According to a spokesperson, authorities are assessing whether Engonga’s actions may have posed health risks, which could result in additional charges if confirmed.“If proven, he could face charges for endangering public health,” the spokesperson commented, emphasising that the investigation will extend beyond the videos themselves to assess any potential impact on public health.This probe into health risks marks a significant expansion of the investigation, as the Attorney General’s office examines both the privacy concerns involved in the leak and the broader implications of Engonga’s behaviour on public welfare. The investigation is expected to review the conduct of government officials and enforce measures to maintain accountability.In a public statement, Vice President Teodoro Nguema took to X (formerly Twitter) to address the scandal, emphasising the need for accountability among public officials. Nguema noted that government offices must be strictly reserved for official duties, signalling disapproval of the misuse of government resources and office spaces for personal purposes.Nguema announced that the government would be implementing new, stricter policies to ensure that misconduct within the administration is met with serious disciplinary action. He further stated that officials found guilty of misusing their authority or resources could face termination or other consequences as deemed appropriate. This stance reflects a broader governmental shift towards enforcing ethical standards and reinforces the message that public officials will be held responsible for their actions, especially when it comes to misuse of office privileges.Engonga, a married man and father of six, holds a prominent position at ANIF, leading financial investigations and initiatives against corruption. However, his involvement in the leaked videos has placed his career and reputation under intense public scrutiny. The scandal has opened a wider debate on the expectations placed on public officials, with many citizens questioning whether private conduct should impact public responsibility and ethical standards.As public opinion continues to weigh in, some have called for Engonga’s resignation, while others argue that privacy should protect personal matters unless they directly impact professional duties. The case has ignited a conversation on the balance between privacy and public accountability, particularly when it comes to those in leadership roles within the government.","Equatorial Guinea’s Director General of the National Financial Investigation Agency, Baltasar Ebang Engonga, is at the centre of a scandal following the leak of explicit videos.

The Beatles ' last song ""Now and Then,"" restored using artificial intelligence, has earned nominations for Record of the Year and Best Rock Performance at the 67th Grammy Awards.The track will compete against contemporary artists including Beyoncé's ""Texas Hold 'Em,"" Billie Eilish's ""Birds of a Feather,"" and Taylor Swift in the Record of the Year category. For Best Rock Performance, it faces entries from Green Day, Pearl Jam, and The Black Keys.Originally recorded as a demo by John Lennon in the late 1970s, the song remained unreleased for decades due to poor sound quality. In 2021, filmmaker Peter Jackson's team used machine learning technology to separate Lennon's vocals from the piano accompaniment, allowing Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr to complete the recording.The song's eligibility for Grammy consideration comes under rules that permit AI elements while requiring human creators. Since its release in November 2023, the track has accumulated 78 million streams on Spotify.The Grammy Awards ceremony will take place on February 2, 2025, marking an unusual moment where a restored recording from the 1970s competes alongside contemporary music releases.","The Beatles'last song ""Now and Then,"" restored using artificial intelligence, has earned nominations for Record of the Year and Best Rock Performance at the 67th Grammy Awards.

ChatGPT refused 250,000 requests to create AI photos of politicians in the month running up to the Election Day in the US as a part of its efforts to prevent the company’s tools being used for deceptive or harmful purposes, OpenAI has claimed.It added that ChatGPT rejected to generate DALL·E images of President-elect Trump, Vice President Harris, Vice President-elect JD Vance, President Joe Biden, and Governor Tim Walz.“We’ve applied safety measures to ChatGPT to refuse requests to generate images of real people, including politicians. These guardrails are especially important in an election context,” it said.The Microsoft-backed company claims that it has been working to identify and disrupt “attempts to use our tools to generate content used in covert influence operations.”“Our teams continued to monitor our services closely in the lead-up to Election Day and have not seen evidence of US election-related influence operations attracting viral engagement or building sustained audiences through the use of our models,” the company said.Recently, a report by Axios said that Facebook-parent Meta and Google – that temporarily banned election-related advertising in the lead-up to the election – have removed the restrictions in the lead-up to the election to prevent the spread of misinformation and ensure a fair electoral process.Google informed its advertising partners that the ban will be lifted on November 11, the report said.Meta, on the other hand, lifted its ban on new political ads on November 7. The company had initially planned to maintain the ban for several days after the election as a precautionary measure but ultimately decided to lift it earlier.","ChatGPT refused 250,000 requests to create AI photos of politicians in the month running up to the Election Day in the US.

FTX is seeking to recover at least $1.76 billion in the lawsuit that centres on a 2021 share repurchase deal that FTX alleges was fraudulent.According to a report by CNBC, the lawsuit has been filed in a Delaware court, claiming that Binance, Zhao, and other parties involved in the transaction fraudulently exited their investment in FTX. In 2021, Binance sold its 20% stake in FTX and its 18.4% stake in FTX's U.S. entity, West Realm Shires, back to FTX.FTX alleges that the repurchase was funded by Alameda Research, FTX's affiliated trading firm, using a combination of FTX's and Binance's exchange tokens, as well as Binance's stablecoin.“Alameda was insolvent at the time of the share repurchase and could not afford to fund the transaction,” the suit claims,” the lawsuit claims. The FTX estate also argues that the deal, agreed upon with FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried , constitutes a ""constructive fraudulent transfer.""Bankman-Fried is currently serving a 25-year prison sentence for fraud charges related to the collapse of FTX.This lawsuit was a part of the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings of FTX with the FTX estate filing a lawsuit against SkyBridge Capital, the hedge fund founded by Anthony Scaramucci, former White House communications director.The lawsuit against SkyBridge Capital is just one of many legal actions initiated by the FTX estate. Last month, a U.S. bankruptcy judge approved FTX's plan to repay creditors up to $16.5 billion. Under this plan, 98% of creditors are expected to receive full repayment plus compensation.","FTX is seeking to recover at least $1.76 billion in the lawsuit.

A doctor from Tamil Nadu has fallen victim to an online scam, losing a significant sum of Rs 76.5 lakh. The incident occurred while the doctor was searching for stock market tips on YouTube.As reported by The Hindu, the victim, an Associate Professor at a Government Medical College, transferred the money to what seemed like a legitimate online trading platform for investing in stocks and IPOs of renowned companies. However, the fraud was exposed when he tried to withdraw his funds, only to discover that he had been deceived.As per the report, the victims saw an advertisement on YouTube which promised to offer training and guidance in online trading. The advertisement then directed him to join a WhatsApp community group where other members presented themselves as investors.Initially, the group focused on fundamental online trading concepts, with members regularly sharing screenshots of their investments and profits. The group's administrator, Diwakar Singh, provided recommendations for both short-term and long-term investments.Once the scammers realised the victim had gained trust in the group, they directed him to open an account on a specific website, promising a 30% return on investments in Indian and US stocks.Following a link provided by the scammers, the victim registered an account and started transferring money from his bank accounts to the website. The scammers assured him that his funds would be invested in high-yielding stocks, even providing a list of companies and IPOs to bolster their credibility. Almost all of the funds were transferred during the first three weeks of October this year.The victim then tried to withdraw 50 lakh from his account on October 22. However, he was informed that a Rs 50-lakh fee was required by the ""Qualified Institutional Buyers Association"" to process his withdrawal request.

In a recent social media revelation, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang shared an unusual personal practice: he chooses not to wear a watch. In a widely circulated Instagram video, Huang explains that this choice reflects his commitment to living fully in the present, a philosophy that also guides Nvidia’s approach to innovation and growth. Known for leading Nvidia to become a powerhouse in artificial intelligence (AI), Huang’s outlook emphasises excelling in the now rather than being driven by long-term ambition. His philosophy has helped steer Nvidia through groundbreaking developments in AI, positioning it as a global tech leader and significantly boosting its market value.Huang’s philosophy centres on focusing intently on the present without being distracted by an overly ambitious pursuit of future goals. “Most people don’t know this, but I don’t wear a watch,” Huang states in the video. “The reason is simple: the present moment matters most.” He elaborates, explaining that he isn’t motivated by a desire to continuously achieve more. Instead, his goal is to excel in whatever he is working on at any given moment, allowing future success to unfold naturally.This focus on the present aligns closely with Nvidia’s corporate ethos. According to Huang, the company doesn’t adhere to a conventional long-term plan. “People who know me understand that Nvidia operates without a detailed long-term plan,” he says. “Our definition of a ‘long-term plan’ is simply, ‘What are we working on today?’” By directing its energy toward current projects rather than distant goals, Nvidia has built a reputation for agility, innovation, and responsiveness to emerging trends in AI technology.Huang credits a memorable encounter with a gardener in Kyoto, Japan, as a defining moment that reinforced his commitment to living fully in the present. In a 2023 interview, he recalled visiting a moss-covered garden in Kyoto, where a gardener tended the space with exceptional care, working with simple tools and remarkable patience even in the heat of summer. When Huang asked how the gardener managed such meticulous work, the gardener replied, “I have plenty of time.”This interaction left a lasting impression on Huang, who saw the gardener’s response as an embodiment of his own philosophy. “Now is the most important time—just commit yourself to it,” he says. “I rarely find myself chasing things; I concentrate on the present and truly enjoy my work.” This mindset has not only shaped his career but has also influenced Nvidia’s operational strategy, reinforcing a culture of mindful focus rather than relentless ambition.Under Huang’s leadership, Nvidia has become a leader in the AI industry, supplying advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) that are essential for a wide range of AI applications. The company’s chips power technologies from deep learning to autonomous vehicles, positioning Nvidia at the forefront of the AI revolution. Nvidia’s market value has surged in recent years, allowing it to briefly surpass tech giants Microsoft and Apple to become the most valuable publicly traded company.Huang’s present-focused approach has helped Nvidia make rapid advancements, allowing the company to capitalise on the growing demand for AI technologies. Nvidia’s success is largely attributed to its leadership in developing high-performance GPUs and AI-specific hardware that support complex data processing and machine learning applications. This technology has become indispensable across industries, from healthcare to self-driving cars, creating a strong market demand and driving the company’s growth.Huang’s leadership has not only propelled Nvidia’s success but has also contributed significantly to his personal wealth. According to Bloomberg’s billionaire index, Huang now ranks as the 11th wealthiest person in the world, with a net worth approaching $130 billion. Over the past five years, Huang’s wealth has increased by nearly $100 billion, or roughly Rs 500 crore per day, due to Nvidia’s rise in value.This rapid accumulation of wealth reflects Nvidia’s dominance in AI-related technology, which has driven up demand for its GPUs. As AI continues to expand globally, Nvidia’s market position has solidified, making it a critical player in the industry and securing Huang’s place among the world’s wealthiest individuals.For those seeking career advice, Huang offers a simple yet impactful recommendation: focus on the present. “Now is the most important time,” he shares. His approach suggests that dedicating oneself to the task at hand, rather than fixating on future outcomes, can lead to both personal fulfilment and professional success. Huang’s perspective resonates with a growing trend among leaders who prioritise mindfulness and present-focused productivity as a way to achieve sustainable growth.While Nvidia doesn’t follow a traditional long-term strategic plan, Huang’s focus on the present has allowed the company to stay at the cutting edge of technology. By continuously refining its products and responding to industry shifts in real time, Nvidia is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in AI and beyond. The company’s advancements in GPU technology, data processing, and machine learning have not only fueled its growth but have also set a standard in the tech industry, with Nvidia becoming a benchmark for innovation.","Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, shares his philosophy of living fully in the present.

"Apple eyes smart glasses market, challenging Facebook parent Meta and Snapchat",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-eyes-smart-glasses-market-challenging-facebook-parent-meta-and-snapchat/articleshow/115177098.cms,"Why Apple is conducting a study

What to expect from Apple smart glasses

Apple is reportedly exploring the smart glasses market and for that it recently conducted a study to evaluate existing products and gauge consumer sentiment. According to a report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, this ‘secretive research’ suggests that Apple may be considering its own entry into this growing segment after the launch of the high-end Vision Pro augmented reality (AR) headset.According to Gurman, Apple held studies while it was developing the Vision Pro, AirPods and HomePod. Also, conducting studies when looking to expand into a new area is a common practice for the company, the report added.Last week, Gurman said Apple’s initiative is called 'Atlas' and it started in October. An email was sent to select Apple employees that read, “Testing and developing products that all can come to love is very important to what we do at Apple. This is why we are looking for participants to join us in an upcoming user study with current market smart glasses”.By gathering insights from employees, Apple aims to understand consumer perceptions and preferences without revealing its own plans. Apple is reportedly evaluating smart glasses from competitors like Snap and Meta Platforms, with a potential launch date of 2027, though this is subject to change.These devices, while not full-fledged AR headsets, offer functionalities such as video recording, phone calls and music playback.“It’s a category where Apple is suddenly playing catch-up, despite all the work it put into the bulkier and pricier Vision Pro,” Gurman said.While Apple has made significant strides in AR with the Vision Pro, its bulk and high price point limit its accessibility. Smart glasses, on the other hand, offer a more lightweight and potentially affordable alternative.“The company typically limits these focus groups to employees to help keep its plans secret. With smart glasses, the company could approach the category from a number of directions. That includes essentially creating a version of its AirPods in glasses form. It also could push to finally make true AR glasses — taking the Vision Pro experience and squeezing it into a pair of spectacles that people could wear all day,” he added.However, achieving a truly compelling AR experience in a glasses form factor may still be years away. Even prototypes from Meta and Snap are reportedly still in their early stages.Earleir this year, a report said that Google is in talks with eyewear major EssilorLuxottica about bringing its Gemini Al assistant to its next-gen smart glasses.","Apple is reportedly exploring the smart glasses market and for that it recently conducted a study to evaluate existing products and gauge consumer sentiment.

And now they have lost Wall Street as well,"" Vembu said in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), analysing the chipmaker's struggles in retrospect to people calling him ""a socialist,"" letting them decide if he's being one on his comments on layoffs at Freshwork.In a reply, earlier to his post on layoffs at Freshworks, Vembu pointed out that this approach represents a stark departure from historical American business practices. ""This was not at all the norm in the US either 50 years ago. US companies became world beaters by taking care of their employees. This private equity and Wall Street led 'shareholder first' world does not work. It won't even work out well for shareholders,"" he added.Vembu pointed to Nvidia and AMD's success as evidence that long-term investment in engineering talent yields better results. He highlighted how both companies, led by Taiwanese CEOs, built their success through retaining engineers who developed deep technical expertise over time.He drew particular attention to Taiwan's semiconductor industry success, noting that TSMC built its dominant position by following a similar talent-focused approach despite having a population comparable to Sri Lanka.The Zoho chief executive criticised what he called a ""perversion"" of capitalism in America's current system, where companies prioritise short-term financial gains and executive compensation over sustainable growth. He pointed to practices like seeking Federal Reserve bailouts and maintaining artificially high asset valuations as examples of this distorted approach.""We bet other people's money and if we win we keep a lot of the gains and if we lose we run to the Fed to bail us out,"" Vembu said, describing the current U.S. financial system. He warned that this approach, which has led to CEO compensation reaching 500 times average employee wages, could drive the country toward civil unrest.Referencing last year's Silicon Valley Bank bailout, Vembu noted how tech entrepreneurs who typically advocate for free-market capitalism quickly abandoned those principles when facing losses. He argued for a return to what he calls ""real capitalism"" – one that prioritises employee well-being and long-term company building over short-term financial engineering.""That is how real capital building works: take care of your employees, your most valuable asset and build long term successful companies,"" Vembu concluded, framing his people-first approach not just as good business practice but said that “This is also our dharma.”","Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu criticised what he called a ""perversion"" of capitalism in America's current system.

Trump's China tariffs could reshape iPhone supply chain

Premium iPhone production could drive growth

Apple could double its iPhone manufacturing in India with Donald Trump returning to the White House, potentially shifting production worth over $30 billion annually from China within two years, reports ET citing industry experts and officials.The iPhone maker’s strategic pivot hinges on Trump's campaign promise to impose steep tariffs of 60-100% on Chinese imports, The Economic Times reported, citing unnamed government officials. Apple currently manufactures iPhones worth $15-16 billion annually in India.During his previous presidency, Trump had levied tariffs up to 25% on Chinese goods. A similar approach in his second term could accelerate Apple's manufacturing migration to India, potentially creating 200,000 new jobs and increasing India's share in iPhone production from 12-14% to over 26%.""With growing premiumisation trends and demand for expensive iPhones globally, supported by iPhone Pro series now being manufactured in India, the overall production value has the potential to go well beyond $30 billion a year,"" Neil Shah, vice president at Counterpoint Research, told ET.However, experts caution that Indian suppliers needs to address cost inefficiencies and policy uncertainties to prevent Apple from choosing alternative manufacturing destinations like Vietnam.The company currently partners with three manufacturers in India – Foxconn, Pegatron, and Tata Electronics – with approximately 70% of local production being exported globally. The Tata Group is already expanding its iPhone manufacturing footprint with a second facility in Hosur, Tamil Nadu, expected to employ up to 40,000 workers.Apple's momentum in India is already evident, with exports of India-manufactured iPhones reaching nearly $6 billion in the six months through September 2024, marking a 30% year-over-year increase.The company also started manufacturing its more premium iPhone models, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, starting this year, alongside the regular iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus models. The Infromation reports that Apple is also planning on assembling the iPhone 17 in the country, and has already started early manufacturing tests with one of its partner in India.","Apple currently manufactures iPhones worth $15-16 billion annually in India.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk 's vocal support for Donald Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign marked a significant shift in his political stance, playing a crucial role in Trump's electoral success. Previously seen as more liberal, Musk's alignment with Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" (MAGA) agenda saw him leveraging both his financial resources and his social media platform, X (formerly Twitter), to amplify Trump's campaign messagesSo much so that Musk predicted Donald Trump's win as well as warned of far reaching consequences if Trump lost. This has also made many users comment how X is the new media for getting the US election results right, something where most media publications failed.After Donald Trump's victory, users have posted how X actually voiced America's opionion. ""Turns out X is not an echo chamber, it’s America,"" wrote Tyler Winklevoss. Elon Musk, quoted his tweet and wrote, ""𝕏 predicted the election outcome, because it represents America.""Musk has been sharing posts related to Trump's election post his win as well. These especially include posts on the topics he said he is supporting Donald Trump on.""Fix immigration and voting, punish lawfare and censorship, wipe out the bureaucracy. Everything else is downstream,"" wrote a user going by the name Naval. To this Musk replied, ""Perfectly articulated.""Musk also retweeted Tesla Owners Silicon Valley post that said, ""𝕏 was the most important platform for this election. 𝕏 is what America (flag) believes in.""""So I followed the election on X and I listened to @dbongino and War Room and @scrowder live streams. My husband was watching it on Fox.

Alternative media and X is the future,"" said a post by Insurrection Barbie that Musk retweeted.Musk's financial backing for Trump during the 2024 campaign was substantial, with contributions reportedly totaling around $132 million directed towards Trump's campaign and related Republican efforts. Of this amount, $75 million went directly to Trump’s campaign through Musk's America political action committee (PAC), making Musk, the world's wealthiest person, one of Trump's most influential allies. In his victory speech, Trump referred to Musk as a ""new star"" and a ""super genius"" who deserves protection, highlighting Musk's pivotal role.However, Musk's influence extended beyond financial contributions. His social media platform, X, became a powerful tool for promoting MAGA views. After acquiring X in 2022 for $44 billion—a deal criticized by podcast host Joe Rogan as foolish—Musk found new value in the platform. He admitted during a Rogan podcast that the platform’s cultural and political influence far outweighed its monetary value. Under Musk's ownership, X amplified pro-Trump rhetoric, reinstated Trump’s suspended account, and allowed conspiracy theories and misinformation to spread, raising concerns among critics.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk's vocal support for Donald Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign marked a significant shift in his political stance.

His actions have sparked widespread outrage and condemnation both domestically and internationally. The incident took place at the Changdong History and Culture Park in Seoul.The primary issue stems from Somali's disrespectful behavior towards a historical statue in Seoul. The statue, known as The Statue of Peace, commemorates the ""comfort women,"" Korean women who were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military during World War II. The statue honors the tens of thousands of young women who were subjected to sexual slavery by the Japanese military during Korea’s occupation from 1910 to 1945.Somali was seen kissing and twerking in front of the statue, an act that deeply offended many Koreans. This act sparked widespread outrage across South Korea, with many calling for severe punishment.As a result of this incident, Somali has been arrested by South Korean authorities and is facing potential imprisonment of up to ten years. He is currently banned from leaving the country while the investigation is ongoing. Additionally, his past actions have led to bans from both Japan and Jerusalem.Somali is notorious for his provocative and often offensive behavior. He has been banned from multiple streaming platforms, including Twitch and Kick, due to his history of disruptive and disrespectful conduct. His past live streams showcase a pattern of actions designed to provoke and offend, often involving public disturbances and inappropriate behavior.Despite his previous actions, Somali has publicly apologized for his recent misconduct in South Korea. In a video, he expressed remorse for his mistake and acknowledged the need to take responsibility for his actions.","Johnny Somali, a 24-year-old American YouTuber also known as Ramsey Khalid Ismael, is currently facing serious legal consequences in South Korea.

Chinese online shopping apps Shein and Temu face a potential ban in Vietnam. According to a report by Reuters, the Vietnamese government recently said that it will block the internet domains and apps of Shein and Temu in the country, unless they register their business operations with Vietnam's trade ministry. Deadline for the same is November's end.Shein has been selling into Vietnam for some time, while Temu, owned by Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings, started operations in Vietnam last month.The regulatory decision comes as Vietnamese officials express growing unease about Chinese online retailers' market practices, particularly their aggressive pricing strategies and product quality concerns.Vietnam’s Deputy Trade Minister Nguyen Hoang Long confirmed at a recent government session that his ministry has been in discussions with both companies regarding licensing compliance. ""After the ministry's notification, if these platforms do not comply, the Ministry of Industry and Trade will coordinate with relevant agencies to implement technical measures such as blocking applications and domains,"" Long said in a government statement released after the meeting.Temu is reportedly facing a European Union investigation over suspicions that the online shopping platform is failing to prevent the sale of illegal products. According to a report by news agency AP, the European Commission has opened its investigation against Temu. Temu was recently added to the list of “very large online platforms” needing the strictest level of scrutiny under the bloc's Digital Services Act (DSA).The European Commission is said to be investigating the platform for potential violations of the DSA, specifically regarding consumer protection, fair competition, and data privacy. The EU's concerns center around the sale of non-compliant goods, addictive design features, and transparency of recommendation algorithms. Regulators are particularly worried about the ease with which ""rogue traders"" can resurface on the platform after being suspended.","Chinese online shopping apps Shein and Temu face a potential ban in Vietnam.

Dubai-based siblings who own JioHotstar domain have this ‘take it or leave it’ offer for Team Reliance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/dubai-based-siblings-who-own-jiohotstar-domain-have-this-take-it-or-leave-it-offer-for-team-reliance/articleshow/115159221.cms,"How JioHotstar domain went to Dubai siblings

Here’s what they wrote on website

Hello, everyone! We hope you are doing well. Today, we want to share an important update about jiohotstar.com, a domain we bought some time ago. For those who don’t know, we bought this domain from a young developer in Delhi to help him with his education. This was part of our efforts to support and uplift others.

Recently, we received many emails from people wanting to buy the domain. To check if these offers were real, we reached out to some of them. We found that while some offers were fake, a few were serious and offered a lot of money. But even with these genuine offers, we never wanted to sell the domain. We made this clear by replying to everyone that the domain was not for sale.

Over the last few weeks, there has been a lot of talk and even some videos about why we own the domain and if it connects to a possible business deal between Jio and Hotstar. We want to clear up any confusion: we never expected this attention and never meant to cause any controversy. Our only goal was to support the developer and share our seva (service) journey.

With all the discussions happening, we now think it might be best for Team Reliance to have this domain, if they want it. We are happy to give jiohotstar.com to them for free, with all the proper paperwork. To be clear, this is entirely our choice. No one from Reliance or any legal group has contacted us or pressured us in any way. We made this decision on our own, without any pressure from friends, family, or anyone else.

If Reliance is interested, they can contact us at jainam@1xl.com or jivika@1xl.com, and we will handle the transfer smoothly. If they are not interested, that’s okay too. We will continue to share updates about our journey and work.

To all influencers and media, we ask for your help in spreading the word about SevakArmy.com, our mission to bring together volunteers. Our goal is simple but powerful: we want 100,000 people to volunteer just 20 hours a year. This would add up to 2 million hours of service in the first year—like having 1,000 people working full-time for a year to help NGOs. Imagine the positive impact we could make together!

Thank you for reading. We look forward to continuing our journey with all of you. Jai Jinendra!

From Jainam & Jivika

The saga of owning the JioHotstar .com domain just took an unexpected twist. Dubai siblings – Jainam and Jivika, who purchased it from a Delhi-based app developer have now said that they are willing to ‘give’ the domain to ‘Team Reliance ’ for free.Sharing an update on the website, the two wrote “With all the discussions happening, we now think it might be best for Team Reliance to have this domain, if they want it. We are happy to give jiohotstar.com to them for free, with all the proper paperwork.”The drama around the Jiohotstar.com domain unfolded last month when a Delhi-based app developer posted a letter publicly – asking the company to fund his higher studies in exchange for him giving up the domain for Rs 1 crore. ""My intention of buying this domain was simple: if this merger happens, I might be able to fulfill my dream of studying at Cambridge,"" said the developer then.When Reliance declined his offer, the developer sold the domain to siblings from Dubai, UAE. The siblings say that their “only goal was to support the developer and share our seva (service) journey” and “that the domain was not for sale.”“Recently, we received many emails from people wanting to buy the domain.

Elon Musk just added to his fan following in India with these 'comments' on Canada PM Justin Trudeau,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-just-added-to-his-fan-following-in-india-with-these-comments-on-canada-pm-justin-trudeau/articleshow/115152894.cms,"What Elon Musk wrote on Canada PM Justin Trudeau

Why many Indians will agree with his criticism of Canada PM Justin Trudeau

Tesla CEO Elon Musk may have just given a massive boost to his popularity in India. Reason is what can be termed as 'trolling' of Canada PM Justin Trudeau . In the past few days Elon Musk has replied to or quoted posts on X, formerly Twitter, that criticise Canada PM Trudeau.What makes his comments more important is the role he is likely to play in the US government after Donald Trump's return as the US President. Elon Musk played a very important part in US President-Elect Donald Trump's win. He campaigned extensively for him both online and offline, even participating in some road shows.A user going by the name 'Truthful' shared a graph on Twitter showing how Canada's GDP per capita has fallen under PM Trudeau with a ""LOL"" (laugh out loud) message on top. Elon Musk quoted the same message and wrote ""Wow"".Earlier this week, Tesla CEO had written that Justin Trudeau would lose his position as Canada's Prime Minister in the next election in response to a Twitter user's comment. Just a day after US elections results (November 7), a user on Twitter told Musk, “we need your help in Canada getting rid of Trudeau.” Responding to the post, Musk said, “He will be gone in the upcoming election.” TThe prediction comes as Trudeau prepares to face electoral challenges from Pierre Poilievre's Conservative Party and Jagmeet Singh's New Democratic Party.These comments are not the first time that Elon Musk has criticised the Canadian government. Earlier too he had expressed dismay over the approach to free speech, particularly regarding new regulations requiring online streaming services to register for government oversight.The diplomatic relations between India and Canada have deteriorated significantly under PM Justin Trudeau's government. India has expressed serious concerns about extremism and anti-India activities in Canada, urging Canadian authorities to address these issues.The relationship recently nosedived after Canadian officials claimed Indian government's hand in the death of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. This diplomatic tension has resulted in India withdrawing its High Commissioner from Canada. ""The responsibility for the damage that this cavalier behaviour has caused to India-Canada relations lies with Prime Minister Trudeau alone,"" said foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal in October after the Canadian PM alleged that he had ""credible allegations"" of India's involvement in Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing.Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently also condemned the ""deliberate attack"" on a Hindu temple in Canada, expressing concern about the ""cowardly attempts to intimidate"" Indian diplomats. He stated that New Delhi expects Canadian authorities to ensure justice and maintain law and order.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk may have just given a massive boost to his popularity in India.

Elon Musk's 'unfulfilled' Tesla promises

Full Self-Driving (FSD) Technology: Musk first promised self-driving Tesla cars by 2018, but the goal has been repeatedly delayed. Despite incremental updates, Tesla’s FSD software is yet to achieve full autonomy. Musk recently admitted to being the “boy who cried FSD,” acknowledging the missed deadlines. Affordable Tesla EV : In 2020, Musk announced plans for a $25,000 mass-market Tesla, often referred to as the “Model 2.” However, production has been postponed to 2025, with reports suggesting further delays. Cybercab Robotaxis : Musk confidently predicted operational robotaxis by 2020. The project, now branded as “Cybercab,” is slated for production in 2026, but tariff issues and supply chain challenges could cause further disruptions. Cybertruck: Introduced in 2019, the Cybertruck was initially expected to launch in 2021. Production only began in 2023, with deliveries still ramping up. Next-Generation Roadster : Announced in 2017 with a planned 2020 launch, the Roadster has faced multiple delays. Musk now aims to begin production in 2025.

Elon Musk’s perspective on delays

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, known for his ambitious vision and bold claims, has faced criticism for several delayed or unfulfilled promises regarding Tesla’s innovations. While Musk describes himself as “pathologically optimistic,” many of his high-profile projects remain incomplete or behind schedule.Musk has defended the delays, emphasising that while timelines may slip, Tesla ultimately delivers on its promises. He attributes the setbacks to supply chain bottlenecks, regulatory hurdles, and the inherent challenges of pioneering new technologies. Musk maintains that his focus remains on innovation, stating, “We do deliver in the end, which is the important thing.”","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has faced criticism for several delayed or unfulfilled promises regarding Tesla’s innovations.

“The academy and each branch will judge the achievement, taking into account the degree to which a human was at the heart of the creative authorship when choosing which movie to award,”

How AI usage in movies has divided Hollywood



“I did not realise by sharing this image it would be in such disrespect to the artists and creators of our world.”

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences have confirmed that movies made using generative AI tools remain eligible for Academy Awards (more commonly known as the Oscars ). This is the first time the Academy has directly addressed the use of generative AI, a technology that has gained traction in Hollywood and sparked debate among filmmakers. The Oscar rules now state that AI and other digital tools “neither help nor harm the chances of achieving a nomination.” However, the more a human played a role in a film's creation, the better, the academy added.the new Oscars rules noted.According to a report by Vanity Fair, the Academy even explored amending its submission process to require disclosure of any AI usage, however, it ultimately chose not to implement such a mandate.The latest clarification comes as part of a broader revision to voting and campaigning rules, which now require members to watch every nominated film in each category before casting their final votes.The Academy’s acknowledgement of generative AI in its rules marks a significant shift, which comes after writers’ and actors’ unions pushed for AI safeguards in their recent contracts.The debate over AI’s role reached a flashpoint when The Brutalist—an immigrant epic nominated for 10 Oscar categories—used AI to improve Hungarian accents in actors, prompting both defences of the filmmakers and ethical objections to the technology’s use.The movie’s actor, Adrien Brody, finally won the Oscar for Best Actor for his role in The Brutalist, which also took home awards for cinematography and score. Other nominees, including Emilia Pérez and Dune: Part Two, similarly employed AI tools for enhancements.Some prominent filmmakers have begun to adopt the technology, most notably James Cameron, who joined the board of Stability AI last fall, but the debate persists.Last week, Oscar nominee Demi Moore faced criticism and removed an Instagram post after using an AI app to turn her dog into a human and subsequently apologised for the image.Later on, in a replacement post, Moore wrote:",The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences have confirmed that movies made using generative AI tools remain eligible for Academy Awards.

“now that the major work of establishing Department of Government Efficiency is done he will be allocating far more of my time to Tesla” starting in May."" Musk added that he now expects to spend just “a day or two per week on government matters.""

Analysts Happy, but Worried as well

Tesla quarterly results show pain, but there are bright spots

Tesla investors breathed a sigh of relief after CEO Elon Musk said he would refocus his attention on the electric automaker. The company's investors welcomed CEO Elon Musk’s promise to shift his focus back to Tesla after months of political involvement, but persistent concerns over brand damage and a sharp profit decline signal a challenging road ahead. Tesla shares surged nearly 8% on Wednesday, April 23, poised to add over $50 billion to its $766 billion market valuation. The move comes after Tesla reported a 71% drop in first-quarter profits and a 9% revenue decline, underscoring the urgency of Musk’s renewed commitment.Elon Musk said on a conference call with analysts Tuesday, April 22, thatRoss Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management and a prominent investor, told Reuters, ""His time is very valuable, and I think Tesla needs his attention."" Another prominent Tesla Bull Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives termed this as a step in the right direction. “This is a big step in the right direction,"" he said. Ives, added, “Investors wanted to see him recommit to Tesla.”Tesla’s quarterly results painted a grim picture: profits fell from $1.39 billion to $409 million, or 12 cents per share, missing analyst expectations, while revenue dropped from $21.3 billion to $19.3 billion. Gross margins slipped from 17.4% to 16.3%, squeezed by fierce competition from Chinese EV maker BYD and European rivals offering advanced models. Tesla’s energy storage business, reliant on Chinese battery cells, faces headwinds from looming Trump administration tariffs, which Musk has lobbied against but warned could cause “unexpected bumps.” Retaliatory trade restrictions from China have already forced Tesla to halt orders for its Model S and Model X in the mainland market.Despite the gloom, Tesla reaffirmed plans to launch an affordable Model Y variant in early 2025, though it cautioned that production could ramp up slowly. The company also doubled down on its autonomous driving ambitions, with Musk claiming “millions of Teslas” will operate autonomously by late 2025, including a paid robotaxi service launching in Austin in June.Bright spots included $595 million in regulatory credit sales, up from $442 million a year ago, and strong cash flow of $2.2 billion, compared to $242 million in the prior year. “It was good to see positive cash flow,” said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein, though he noted the results were unsurprising given earlier reports of slumping deliveries. Tesla plans to review its full-year delivery forecast in its July earnings update, citing shifting global trade policies and “changing political sentiment” as near-term risks to demand. Finance chief Vaibhav Taneja highlighted the “negative impact of vandalism and unwarranted hostility” on certain markets, underscoring the tangible toll of Tesla’s tarnished image.","Tesla shares surged nearly 8% on Wednesday, April 23, poised to add over $50 billion to its $766 billion market valuation.

Tesla troubles go beyond protests

What the organisers of the high-profile event said on Tesla exec pulling out

Tesla’s Global Sustainability Lead, Samantha Harris , has reportedly canceled her appearance at a high-profile sustainability conference in Rome, citing escalating protests and vandalism targeting the electric carmaker. The unrest, linked to CEO Elon Musk ’s vocal right-wing activism, has intensified in recent months, with Tesla facing backlash across Europe and beyond.Harris was scheduled to speak at Regenerative Futures, a conference hosted by the European Institute of Innovation for Sustainability (EIIS) on May 16-17. In an email to EIIS, obtained by Reuters, Harris wrote, “Given the recent protests and violence against Tesla, including incidents in Rome, I’ve been advised to limit my external presence and travel. Regrettably, I won’t be able to attend.”The decision follows a wave of attacks on Tesla’s infrastructure, including a devastating fire at a Rome dealership last month that destroyed 17 vehicles. Drone footage revealed charred remains of cars in a parking lot, with two rows of vehicles gutted and a third partially damaged. Musk, a polarizing figure and close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, labeled the incident an act of “terrorism” on social media.Tesla’s troubles extend beyond vandalism. The company’s sales have plummeted, and its share price has cratered, losing over 30% of its value in 2025 alone. Protests in Italy, Germany, and Sweden have targeted Tesla showrooms, charging stations, and offices, with activists citing Musk’s political activities, including his role in the controversial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The initiative, aimed at slashing U.S. public spending, has drawn criticism for its aggressive cost-cutting measures.Earlier this week, Elon Musk announced he would scale back his involvement with DOGE to focus on his businesses, including Tesla, SpaceX, and X Corp. “I need to prioritize the companies driving innovation and progress,” Musk posted on X, signaling a shift as Tesla grapples with mounting challenges.The EIIS expressed disappointment over Harris’s withdrawal but said it respected her decision. “We understand the complexities of the current climate and remain committed to fostering dialogue on sustainability,” an EIIS spokesperson said. The conference will proceed with other speakers, though organizers are bracing for potential protests.","Samantha Harris, Tesla’s Global Sustainability Lead, has reportedly canceled her appearance at a high-profile sustainability conference in Rome.

“when his incredible work at DOGE is complete.”

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is set to lobby the US President Donald Trump’s administration to reduce its tariff regime. The tech billionaire made this announcement during the company's recent earnings call on April 22. Despite assembling vehicles in the US, Tesla imports parts from other countries, making it vulnerable to tariffs. The announcement was made alongside the release of Tesla's quarterly earnings. The earnings report showed a 15% year-over-year drop in gross profit. The electric car maker’s automotive revenue fell 20% year-over-year, while its net income decreased by 71% year-over-year, the company noted at the earnings call.Talking about Trump’s tariffs at Tesla’s recent earnings call, the company‘s CEO said: “I've been on the record many times saying that I believe lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity, but this decision is fundamentally up to ... the president of the United States. I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs, but that's all I can do.”Meanwhile, during its investor presentation, the company added:Apart from this, Musk also said that he would be devoting more attention to Tesla, pointing out that “changing political sentiment” could influence product demand in the near term.Musk said.Earlier reports claimed that Trump told his Cabinet that Elon Musk would soon return to the private sector, though the timing, relative to his 130-day special government employee term, remained unclear. Later on, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt took to the social media platform X (earlier Twitter) to confirm that Musk would leave public service","Elon Musk is set to lobby the US President Donald Trump’s administration to reduce its tariff regime.

What the Kardashians said about Lauren Sanchez’s Blue Origin space flight



“This is a really unique experience and we’re just so honored to be here to support them and watch this amazing part of history, and I’m so proud of her,”

How Sanchez solved NASA's 'uniform problem' before her Blue Origin flight



Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ' fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, received a space-themed gift from Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and Khloé Kardashian after her recent Blue Origin Space flight. The Kardashians gave Sanchez a Judith Leiber handbag shaped like an UFO, valued at $6,995 (approx. Rs 5.9 lakh). The UFO Orbiter bag features star-shaped and geometric crystals, aligning with the theme of the Blue Orgin's Space flight. Sánchez shared the gift on her Instagram story (seen by Page Six), describing it as “Out of this world!” and tagged the three Kardashian sisters. The gift came shortly after this week’s all-women Blue Origin space flight, which Sánchez helped organise alongside Bezos through his Blue Origin initiative.Kris Jenner and Khloé Kardashian visited Van Horn, Texas, earlier this week to support Lauren Sánchez during her all-female Blue Origin spaceflight.Jenner said about Sánchez.Khloé Kardashian also shared her thoughts, saying the family is proud of “all of the female astronauts,” referring to the rest of the crew that included: Katy Perry, Gayle King, Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguyen and Kerianne Flynn.Ahead of her Blue Origin flight, Sánchez emphasized the importance of designing better-fitting spacesuits for women.

Tesla stocks declined 33% year-to-date

Tesla investor Ross Gerber, who publicly called for Elon Musk’s exit from the EV company, has once again criticised him. In an interview with Bloomberg Technology, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, said that Musk “doesn’t care” about the electric car manufacturer. He went on to claim that the tech billionaire Elon Musk is not returning 'his focus' to Tesla anytime soon. He has found his next Big Focus and that it is not Tesla. “It’s clear that he just doesn’t care. His next move is X AI… So if you have any confusion that he’s coming back to Tesla, he’s not,” he said during the interview. In March, Gerber said that Musk has lost focus given his widening interests and has become too ‘divisive’. Blaming social media posts and involvement with the president Donald Trump for bringing negative publicity to the company, he then said that “the company's reputation has just been destroyed by Elon Musk”.He then stated that Musk would need to choose between backing Trump and safeguarding Tesla. He said : “It's time for somebody to run Tesla. The business has been neglected for too long. There are too many important things Tesla is doing, so either Elon should come back to Tesla and be the CEO of Tesla and give up his other jobs or he should focus on the government and keep doing what he is doing but find a suitable CEO of Tesla.”In his interview with Bloomberg, Gerber stood by his Tesla comments, addressing criticism from retail investors. He said “I understand why retail investors at Tesla are frustrated with me for voicing my views” adding that he’s “getting attacked because of Elon’s behavior.”However, Gerber said that his firm will continue to manage Tesla shares. He said “We still own Tesla because I do think something fixes itself at some point, and they have the best products”.Despite maintaining its lead in the US EV market, Tesla's stock has dropped 33% year-to-date. According to Cox Automotive data, Tesla sales fell 8.6% year over year in the first quarter of 2025, while the market expanded 11.4% as a whole. Meanwhile, the EV company is set to announce its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, April 22.Stock market worldwide has been volatile amidst the US-China tariff trade war.

"Walmart Boycott: World's largest retailer tells protesters, 'we are America's ...'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/walmart-boycott-worlds-largest-retailer-tells-protesters-we-are-americas-/articleshow/120119363.cms,"Here's what Walmart said about the protest

People's Union USA founder John Schwarz has announced on social media details of upcoming planned boycotts:

Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, has issued a statement addressing the ongoing week-long boycott organised by the People’s Union USA . The boycott, dubbed the "" Walmart Blackout ,"" began on April 7 and targets the company’s rollback of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, as well as broader concerns over corporate influence and tax policies .The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity. The group’s founder, John Schwarz, urged consumers to avoid shopping at Walmart stores, using its online services, or purchasing from its subsidiaries like Sam’s Club. Schwarz stated, “We are holding these companies accountable so they finally step up and pay their fair share of taxes to alleviate federal income tax from the working-class citizen.”Walmart responded to the boycott, defending its contributions to communities and the US economy. “Serving communities is at the heart of Walmart's purpose to help people save money and live better,” the company said in a statement. “As one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, not only do we pay our fair share, we are an economic force multiplier strengthening communities nationwide through job creation, supplier growth, and over $1.7 billion in cash and in-kind donations last year"", it added further.The boycott follows Walmart’s decision last November to discontinue its five-year commitment to a racial equity center and other DEI programs. Critics argue that these rollbacks undermine progress in promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Walmart, however, emphasised its dedication to supporting local charities, disaster response, hunger relief, workforce development, and conservation efforts.A report from SuperMarketNews, citing data from Numerator, suggests that Walmart may be more resistant to boycotts compared to other retailers. The data indicates that Walmart has not experienced significant impact from households regarding its stance on non-DEI initiatives, particularly among multicultural households—a trend that contrasts with another retail chain Target.Target reportedly faced the most severe backlash during the February 28 boycott focused on DEI initiatives, experiencing a 9% drop in web traffic on the day of the protest, according to Forbes. In comparison, Walmart observed a 5% decline in web traffic, while Amazon saw the smallest decrease, at just 2%.* Walmart: April 7-14 and May 20-26* Second economic blackout: April 18* General Mills: April 21-28* Amazon: May 6-12* Target: June 3-9* McDonald's: June 24-30* Independence Day boycott: July 4","The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female. The change aligns with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January 2025, titled ‘Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government’. The updated policy, which took effect on April 2, applies to all pending and future immigration benefit requests. “USCIS is returning to its historical policy of recognizing two biological sexes,” the agency said in a press statement.Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security , said “There are only two sexes—male and female. President Trump promised the American people a revolution of common sense, and that includes making sure that the policy of the U.S. government agrees with simple biological reality. Proper management of our immigration system is a matter of national security, not a place to promote and coddle an ideology that permanently harms children and robs real women of their dignity, safety, and well-being.”Under the new guidance, a person’s sex will be determined based on the birth certificate issued at or closest to the time of birth. “If the birth certificate issued at or nearest to the time of birth indicates a sex other than male or female, USCIS will base the determination of sex on secondary evidence. See Volume 1, General Policies and Procedures, Part E, Adjudications, Chapter 6, Evidence, Section B, Primary and Secondary Evidence [1 USCIS-PM E.6(B)],” the agency stated.The agency further stated that the benefits will not be denied solely based on how an applicant identifies his/her sex. USCIS confirmed that it does not issue documents with a blank sex field or one that differs from the original birth certificate. Any discrepancies may lead to processing delays.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female.

How ScaleAI laid the foundation for Guo’s billion-dollar fortune

Lucy Guo , founder of Passe , has overtaken Taylor Swift to become the youngest self-made woman billionaire. Guo, 30, features on Forbes list of self-made women billionaires. According to Forbes, she is also one of only six self-made women billionaires in the world under the age of 40. Notably, Guo is the only one on that list who built most of her wealth from a company she no longer works at. Her former startup Scale AI is set for a tender offer valued at $25 billion. Guo recently shared a post on Instagram with the caption “Discipline > Sleep. 3000 classes complete 🥳”. Here’s everything you need to know about Lucy GuoBorn on October 14, 1994, Guo was raised in Fremont, California by Chinese immigrant parents who were both electrical engineers. Despite their technical backgrounds, her parents were hesitant about her pursuing a career in technology, believing it would be challenging for a woman to succeed in the field.Guo's interest in technology began early; she started coding in second grade and, as a teenager, developed bots for online games like Neopets, selling in-game assets for profit. She enrolled at Carnegie Mellon University to study computer science but later dropped out in 2014 after receiving the Thiel Fellowship , a $100,000 grant encouraging young entrepreneurs to pursue their ventures.After Carnegie Mellon, Guo interned at Facebook and later joined Snapchat as the company's first female designer, contributing to the development of Snap Maps. She then worked at Quora, where she met Alexandr Wang with whom she went on to co-found Scale AI in 2016.Guo left ScaleAI just two years after starting it. Based in San Francisco, Scale AI is now valued at $14 billion, and a new tender offer could push that to $25 billion. Guo still holds about 5% of the company, giving her a stake worth around $1.2 billion.After her exit from ScaleAI, Guo launched Backend Capital, a venture firm that backs talented engineers. But she didn’t stay away from building for long.In 2022, she founded Passes, a platform designed to empower content creators by providing them with tools to monetize their work. The platform quickly gained traction, raising $40 million in a Series A funding round by 2024. citeturn0search4As of April 2025, Guo's estimated net worth is $1.25 billion, making her the world's youngest self-made woman billionaire at age 30.",Lucy Guo is one of only six self-made women billionaires under the age of 40.

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) conducted the Class 10 and Class 12 board examinations for 2025 from February 15 to March 18, 2025, with over 44 lakh students appearing across both classes. As students eagerly await their results, the expected announcement dates, historical trends, and alternative methods to access results are crucial for planning ahead. Here we provide you with a comprehensive overview of the anticipated result dates for CBSE Class 10 and 12 exams in 2025, along with relevant details.Based on trends and recent updates, CBSE is likely to declare the Class 10 and Class 12 results in the first or second week of May 2025, with tentative dates ranging from May 1 to May 10. Some sources suggest May 2, 2025, as a probable date, though CBSE has not officially confirmed this. The evaluation process, which began shortly after the exams, is expected to conclude by late April, allowing for result compilation. Results will be available on official websites like cbseresults.nic.in, results.cbse.nic.in, and through platforms like DigiLocker and the UMANG app. Students should regularly check these portals for updates, as CBSE typically announces the exact date a few days prior.In 2024, CBSE announced Class 10 and Class 12 results on May 13, with pass percentages of 93.60% (Class 10) and 87.98% (Class 12). Over 21 lakh students appeared for Class 10, and 16 lakh for Class 12. In 2023, results were declared on May 12, with pass rates of 93.12% (Class 10) and 87.33% (Class 12). These consistent May releases indicate CBSE’s streamlined evaluation process, which has been digitized to ensure timely announcements. The 2025 results are expected to follow a similar timeline, with pass percentages likely to remain comparable, though performance may vary based on exam difficulty and student preparation.Students can access their results through multiple channels to avoid website congestion. The primary method is via cbseresults.nic.in, where students enter their roll number, school code, and date of birth. Alternatively, DigiLocker (digilocker.gov.in) provides digital marksheets, requiring students to link their Aadhaar or mobile number. The UMANG app offers a user-friendly interface for result access. For those without internet access, CBSE provides an SMS facility: students can send their roll number to a designated number (to be announced closer to the result date). Additionally, results can be checked via the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) in some regions. Schools also distribute physical marksheets, which remain the official document for admissions.The 2025 results are provisional online; students must collect original marksheets from their schools. CBSE is expected to conduct compartment exams in July 2025 for students who fail in one or two subjects, with applications opening post-results. For revaluation, students can apply within one to two weeks of the result announcement.

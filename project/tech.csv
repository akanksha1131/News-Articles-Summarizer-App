RBI warns investors against these videos circulating online,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/rbi-warns-investors-against-these-videos-circulating-online/articleshow/115469575.cms,"Here’s what RBI said in the statement

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued an advisory warning users about the circulation of deepfake videos featuring its top officials. These deepfake videos featuring RBI governor Shaktikanta Das are doing the rounds on the internet. Created using advanced AI technology to create convincing false visuals, these are reportedly being used to spread misinformation or mislead the public about support to some investment schemes by the RBI.The central bank urges citizens to stay vigilant, verify information through official sources, and cautions them against making investment choices based on these videos. In its statement dated November 19, RBI says that none of the officials were involved in or supported any of the claims made in the videos.“It has come to the notice of Reserve Bank of India that fake videos of the governor are being circulated in social media that claim launch of or support to some investment schemes by the RBI. These videos attempt to advise people to invest their money in such schemes, through use of technological tools. RBI clarifies that its officials are not involved in or support any such activities and these videos are fake,” the central bank said.“It does not give such financial investment advice and the investors are “cautioned against engaging with and falling prey to such deepfake videos”, the RBI said.This is not the first incident when deep fake videos of top officials are used by scammers to promote/support investment schemes. In a similar case in July, the Bombay High Court directed social media platforms to take action against deepfake videos featuring the National Stock Exchange ’s MD and CEO, where he appeared to be giving stock recommendations.","Deepfake videos featuring RBI governor Shaktikanta Das are doing the rounds on the internet.

Mukesh Ambani-backed startup to launch one of India’s first-ever humanoid robot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mukesh-ambani-backed-startup-to-launch-one-of-indias-first-ever-humanoid-robot/articleshow/115469366.cms,"Addverb Technologies , backed by India's richest person and Reliance Chairman’s Mukesh Ambani , has announced plans to launch advanced humanoid robots in 2025, positioning itself to compete directly with Elon Musk's Tesla in the emerging humanoid robotics market .The Noida-based robotics company will develop AI-powered humanoids capable of performing complex tasks across industries including fashion, retail, and energy sectors. This move marks India's entry into the global humanoid robotics race, currently dominated by companies like Tesla, Boston Dynamics, and Agility Robotics.""Our foray into humanoid robotics is driven by our ambition to eliminate '3D' jobs—those that are Dull, Dirty, and Dangerous,"" said Sangeet Kumar, Co-Founder and CEO of Addverb. The company plans to leverage its strategic partnership with Reliance Industries , incorporating Jio's AI Platform and 5G services in the development process.The humanoid robots will feature cutting-edge GPU technology, energy-efficient actuators, and dual-arm capabilities, enabling them to navigate various terrains and perform intricate tasks. They will integrate Visual and Language Action (VLA) technology for autonomous operation in dynamic environments.While Tesla's Optimus robots are expected to be priced between $20,000-25,000, Addverb's Kumar acknowledged that building humanoids requires ""huge money"" but expressed confidence in competing with global players, including those from China where robots receive government subsidies.Addverb, which currently serves major clients like Reliance, HUL, and PepsiCo, aims to create an ecosystem of downstream companies similar to its successful warehouse automation ventures in India. The initiative aligns with India's ""Make in India"" vision and aims to boost the country's humanoid robot density while supporting global adoption of this technology.","Addverb Technologies, backed by India's richest person and Reliance Chairman’s Mukesh Ambani, has announced plans to launch advanced humanoid robots in 2025.

News agency ANI accuses OpenAI of illegally using its content to train ChatGPT,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/news-agency-ani-accuses-openai-of-illegally-using-its-content-to-train-chatgpt/articleshow/115462159.cms,"ANI’s allegations against OpenAI

ANI (Asian News International), a prominent news agency, has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging that the tech company used its content without permission to train its AI chatbot, ChatGPT. ANI claims that OpenAI not only utilised its copyrighted material without a lawful licence but also accused the company of attributing fabricated news stories to the agency. This lawsuit adds to a growing list of legal challenges faced by OpenAI from various global news organisations and copyright holders, including The New York Times and The Chicago Tribune, who have similarly accused OpenAI of using their work without authorization. The case raises important questions about intellectual property rights in the age of artificial intelligence and the ongoing tensions between media companies and AI developers.In its legal filing, ANI has accused OpenAI of using its original content for the training of its AI models without obtaining a lawful licence or permission. ANI’s complaint highlights that, unlike its business dealings with other organisations such as The Financial Times and The Associated Press, OpenAI did not negotiate a licensing agreement for the use of ANI’s work. ANI further argues that OpenAI’s actions amounted to an infringement of its copyrights by utilising its content, which includes news articles, reports, and other original material, for the purpose of training the artificial intelligence model, ChatGPT.The lawsuit claims that OpenAI’s actions have caused significant harm to ANI’s reputation and business interests, including the attribution of fabricated or inaccurate news stories to the agency. According to ANI, some of the content generated by ChatGPT included false claims of articles being published by their agency, which the news organisation asserts is damaging to its credibility. The agency has called for a court order to stop OpenAI from using its material, as well as a resolution to the alleged harm caused by the misattribution of fabricated content.In response to ANI’s lawsuit, OpenAI has denied the allegations of using ANI’s content without permission. A spokesperson for OpenAI stated that the company builds its AI models using publicly available data and employs principles of fair use in doing so. OpenAI also emphasised that it has halted the use of ANI’s content for future training of ChatGPT. According to OpenAI, ANI’s content has been part of an internal block list since September, effectively preventing its use in any future AI model training.Despite these claims, ANI maintains that its content is still stored in ChatGPT’s memory and cannot be removed, as there is no programmed mechanism for the deletion of data once it is incorporated into the system. ANI argues that this results in an ongoing infringement of its intellectual property rights, as its work remains embedded in ChatGPT’s responses.OpenAI also sought to reassure the public and ANI by stating that it is working on establishing additional partnerships with news organisations around the world, including discussions in India, to explore licensing and collaboration opportunities. The company also stressed its commitment to following legal precedents and ensuring that its actions comply with intellectual property laws.ANI’s lawsuit is not an isolated case. OpenAI has faced similar legal challenges from authors, visual artists, music publishers, and other content creators, accusing the company of using their works without permission. These lawsuits have raised concerns about the legal implications of training AI models using vast amounts of publicly available content, which often includes copyrighted material. Critics argue that companies like OpenAI are exploiting intellectual property without compensating the original creators, leading to calls for stricter regulations on the use of such content.As per reports, OpenAI has repeatedly denied any allegations of copyright infringement, asserting that its practices align with the principles of fair use. However, as AI technology continues to advance and become more integrated into various industries, legal experts suggest that there may need to be a clearer framework for how AI companies can access and utilise copyrighted materials.The broader legal landscape is shifting as governments and regulatory bodies worldwide grapple with how to address the intersection of AI and intellectual property rights. The case against OpenAI could set important precedents for future legal battles involving AI training and the use of publicly available data.The case against OpenAI was heard at the Delhi High Court, where the judge directed OpenAI to submit a detailed response to ANI’s allegations. During the first hearing, OpenAI's legal team presented emails to ANI from its lawyers in India, which indicated that ANI’s website had been added to a block list to prevent its content from being used in future AI model training. The court has scheduled the next hearing for January 28, 2024, when the company will be required to provide further clarification regarding the allegations.The ongoing case is being closely watched, not only for its potential impact on OpenAI’s operations but also for its broader implications on the legal rights of news organisations and content creators in the digital age. It underscores the need for a balance between the advancement of AI technology and the protection of intellectual property rights.","Asian News International (ANI) has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI.

How ""Bitcoin Bonnie and Clyde"" operated

Heather Morgan , the rapper formerly known as Razzlekhan and self-styled ""Crocodile of Wall Street,"" was sentenced to 18 months in prison on Monday, November 18, for her role in laundering billions of dollars worth of stolen Bitcoin. This sentence comes just days after her husband, Ilya Lichtenstein , received a five-year prison term for the 2016 hack of the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange.The couple, often referred to as the "" Bitcoin Bonnie and Clyde ,"" were arrested in February 2022 at their luxury New York City apartment. At the time, the stolen Bitcoin was valued at $71 million. However, due to the significant rise in cryptocurrency prices, the stolen funds are now estimated to be worth over $10 billion.Morgan and Lichtenstein devised an intricate scheme to launder the stolen cryptocurrency using fictitious identities and small, incremental transactions to avoid detection. While Lichtenstein initially claimed that Morgan was unaware of the hack, both eventually pleaded guilty to their involvement.In a bid to secure reduced sentences, Lichtenstein agreed to cooperate with authorities in other cryptocurrency theft cases. He expressed remorse for his actions, blaming himself for involving his wife and hoping to use his expertise to combat cybercrime upon his release.Despite Morgan's lesser role in the scheme, her involvement in laundering the stolen funds led to her prison sentence. The case serves as a stark reminder of the severe consequences of cryptocurrency-related crimes and the complex challenges faced by law enforcement in tracking and recovering stolen digital assets.","Heather Morgan, formerly known as Razzlekhan, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for her role in laundering billions of dollars worth of stolen Bitcoin.

What these new chips do

Microsoft announced two new custom-designed chips aimed at boosting artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and enhancing data security within its data centres. The announcement was made at the company's Ignite conference 2024 .By designing chips tailored to its specific needs, Microsoft aims to optimise performance, reduce costs, and lessen its reliance on processors from Intel and Nvidia. Meanwhile, the company will now better compete with competitors like Amazon and Google.Microsoft's two new chips are designed to be installed in the company's data centre infrastructure: While one is designed to increase security, the other is for data processing.One of the new chips, the Azure Integrated HSM , is a security chip that will be integrated into every new server deployed in Microsoft's data centres starting next year. This chip is designed to safeguard critical encryption keys and other sensitive security data within a secure module.The second chip is a data processing unit (DPU) specifically optimised for cloud storage tasks. Microsoft claims this DPU can perform these tasks with three times less power consumption and four times the performance compared to its current hardware.A DPU is a specialised processor that offloads networking, storage, and security tasks from a central processing unit (CPU).As per Rani Borkar, corporate vice president of Azure Hardware Systems and Infrastructure, the company aims to optimise every layer of infrastructure with custom silicon to ensure that Microsoft's data centres can process information at the speeds required for demanding AI workloads .In addition to the new chips, Microsoft also unveiled an innovative liquid-based cooling system for data centre servers.

Government to Amazon and Elon Musk's Starlink: Your satellite application can be processed only after ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-to-amazon-and-elon-musks-starlink-your-satellite-application-can-be-processed-only-after-/articleshow/115124999.cms,"Strict security guidelines and declaration

Why government is extra cautious on security

The Department of Telecommunications ( DoT ) has reportedly imposed stringent security requirements on Elon Musk 's Starlink and Jeff Bezos's Amazon before approving their satellite communication services in India. According to a report in Economic Times, both companies are expected to provide detailed compliance information regarding data security, coverage area, and other key parameters.While Bharti-backed OneWeb and Reliance Jio 's partnership with SES have already secured approval, Starlink and Amazon's applications are still pending due to the additional security checks.Officials aware of the details told ET that letters to both the US-based firms were sent recently and the department is awaiting their reply. ""Their applications can be processed only after they submit the compliance. The firms have so far not replied,"" said a person familiar with the details.Another official said that the government will wait for some more time for their reply, but the applications won't be processed till they agree to all the security conditions. ""There are various security-related compliances as well as those related to data, coverage area etc which satcom providers have to give to the government in order to offer services in India. All the boxes need to be ticked,"" said a third official.As per security requirements, the terminals have to stop communicating if there is a change in latitude and longitude position in order to prevent any misuse. In its replies to the government, Starlink had reportedly given a declaration that none of its investors were from countries sharing a land border with India -- primarily China and Pakistan. The government had accepted that declaration.The government's cautious approach is driven by concerns over potential security risks, especially given the strategic importance of satellite communications. The DoT is particularly interested in ensuring that satellite terminals near border areas are securely monitored and controlled to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is currently working on recommendations for pricing and other terms and conditions for allocating satellite spectrum. However, traditional telecom operators like Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea are advocating for a level playing field, arguing that satellite companies should be subject to the same regulations and liabilities as terrestrial operators.",The Department of Telecommunications ( DoT) has reportedly imposed stringent security requirements on Elon Musk's Starlink and Jeff Bezos's Amazon.

Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, and his wife, Sudha Murthy, recently shared some insights from their lives. The couple were the star guests on the popular talk show The Great Indian Kapil Sharma Show where they delighted the audience with candid, humorous stories from their personal lives.One of the show’s highlights was Narayana Murthy’s funny confession about forgetting their 25th wedding anniversary. He recalled, “One morning, Sudha asked me, ‘Is there anything special today?’ I replied, ‘No, nothing,’ and went to the office. As I was getting in the car, she asked again, ‘Think of anything special today?’ I still didn’t realize.”Later that day, while heading to Mumbai, Murthy received a call from their daughter, Akshata Murty, who was studying at Stanford University at the time. This is how the conversation went:“She asked, ‘What are you doing?’ I told her I was catching a flight. She immediately said, ‘Cancel it, get the first flight back to Bangalore, and wish your wife a happy anniversary!’”Narayana Murthy shared that he told her about a speech at 3pm but Akshata insisted, “I don’t care if you have a speech at 3 pm. If you need to hire a private plane, hire it, but come back and wish her!” Their daughter, Akshata Murty, is now married to former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.Sudha Murthy also chimed in, laughing, “It was our 25th wedding anniversary so it doesn’t happen every year. So I thought, let me give him a cue but it did not work… For five-ten minutes I felt bad because I’m also human. But my daughter was very upset, she went ‘In America this never happens!’, but I went ‘India main it happens though’, who can remember these things??”","Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, and his wife, Sudha, recently shared some insights from their lives.

Strengthen reliability based on learnings from the incident we saw in July.

Enabling more apps and users to run without admin privileges.

Stronger controls for what apps and drivers are allowed to run.

Improved identity protection to prevent phishing attacks.

Microsoft introduces ""Quick Machine Recovery""

In response to a recent security incident where a bad update affected about 8.5 million Windows PCs and servers globally, Microsoft has announced updates to Windows Resiliency Initiative aimed at fortifying the security and reliability of its Windows operating system. This initiative includes core changes to Windows, making it easier for customers to recover their systems in the event of major disruptions.""We are committed to ensuring that Windows remains the most reliable and resilient open platform for our customers,"" the company said at Microsoft Ignite 2024.One of the key features of this initiative is the ""Quick Machine Recovery"" tool that has been developed in the wake of the recent CrowdStrike incident, which saw millions of Windows machines impacted by a faulty security update, this feature allows IT administrators to remotely deploy fixes to machines even when they are unable to boot properly.Microsoft claims that the feature will enable IT administrators to execute targeted fixes from Windows Update on PCs, even when machines are unable to boot, without needing physical access to the PC. The tool will be available to the Windows Insider Program community in early 2025.The Windows Resiliency Initiative also includes platform improvements designed to enhance control over applications and drivers, and to enable antivirus processing outside of kernel mode. These changes aim to provide a more secure and robust foundation for Windows users.“This means security products, like anti-virus solutions, can run in user mode just as apps do. This change will help security developers provide a high level of security, easier recovery, and there will be less impact to Windows in the event of a crash or mistake,” the company added.A private preview of the tool will be made available for our security product ecosystem in July 2025.","Microsoft introduces ""Quick Machine Recovery"" tool that will allow IT administrators to remotely deploy fixes to PCs.

Donald Trump's pick for FCC may do to TikTok what India did in 2020,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trumps-pick-for-fcc-may-do-to-tiktok-what-india-did-in-2020/articleshow/115456293.cms,"US' President-elect Donald Trump 's choice of Brendan Carr to lead the Federal Communications Commission signals a potential repeat of India's sudden 2020 TikTok prohibition, which saw 200 million users cut off from the platform overnight.Carr, who authored the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 chapter on the FCC, has explicitly called for banning TikTok despite Trump 's recent opposition to such action. The incoming chair views the platform as ""a serious and unacceptable risk to America's national security,"" arguing it enables Beijing to conduct influence operations through content manipulation.India's ban, enacted after a deadly border clash with China, offers a blueprint for what could happen to TikTok's 170 million American users. The Indian government cited data security and privacy concerns when it blocked TikTok and 58 other Chinese apps in June 2020, leading to an immediate transition to alternative platforms.While India's action was swift and decisive, the US approach has been more protracted. Current legislation requires ByteDance to sell TikTok by January 19, 2025, or face a ban. This timeline could accelerate under Carr's leadership, as his appointment doesn't require Senate confirmation.Carr's stance represents a departure from Trump's recent position. His stance on TikTok has been notably inconsistent. Despite leading the initial charge to ban the app during his first term and signing an executive order to that effect in 2020, he has recently pledged to ""save TikTok."" The president-elect, who now boasts 14 million followers on the platform, told CNBC that banning it would benefit Facebook, which he considers ""an enemy of the people.""Beyond TikTok, Carr advocates for broader restrictions on Chinese technology companies and reform of Section 230, which protects social media platforms from liability for user-generated content. He aims to address what he calls ""the censorship cartel"" in Big Tech.If implemented, a US ban could mirror India's experience, where content creators initially struggled but eventually rebuilt their audiences on American platforms. India's YouTube and Instagram user bases have since grown to roughly double their US numbers, though with lower revenue per user.ByteDance maintains that TikTok's US user data is stored exclusively in America and cannot be accessed by the Chinese government, challenging the national security concerns cited by critics.","Brendan Carr has been nominated to lead the Federal Communications Commission.

Oscar winner Ben Affleck believes movies will be 'last things' AI takes over,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/oscar-winner-ben-affleck-believes-movies-will-be-last-things-ai-takes-over/articleshow/115454980.cms,"twitter

Actor-director Ben Affleck believes artificial intelligence poses little threat to creative filmmaking, arguing that movies will be ""one of the last things, if everything gets replaced, to be replaced by AI.""Speaking at CNBC's Delivering Alpha 2024 investor summit, Affleck explained that while AI can imitate existing work, it lacks true creative capability. ""AI can write you excellent imitative verse that sounds Elizabethan. It cannot write you Shakespeare,"" he said.The Oscar winner suggested AI could actually benefit the industry by reducing production costs and barriers to entry. ""What AI is going to do is dis-intermediate the more laborious, less creative, and more costly aspects of filmmaking that will allow costs to be brought down, that will lower the barrier to entry, that will allow more voices to be heard,"" Affleck said.However, he warned that visual effects professionals might face challenges as AI technology advances. ""I wouldn't like to be in the visual effects business, they're in trouble. Because what costs a lot of money is now going to cost a lot less,"" he noted.Affleck, who co-owns production company Artists Equity with Matt Damon, demonstrated a nuanced understanding of AI's limitations, describing it as ""a craftsman at best."" He explained that AI systems primarily ""cross-pollinate things that exist. Nothing new is created.""The filmmaker emphasised that human judgement remains essential to the creative process. ""Craftsman is knowing how to work. Art is knowing when to stop. And I think knowing when to stop is going to be a very difficult thing for AI to learn because it's taste,"" he said.His comments come amid ongoing discussions about AI's role in entertainment, following recent Hollywood labour disputes where AI safeguards were a key negotiating point for both actors and writers.","Actor-director Ben Affleck believes artificial intelligence poses little threat to creative filmmaking.

Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal advice

Fresh off its successful IPO, Swiggy has seen the creation of hundreds of new millionaires among its employees. However, Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal has a word of caution for these newfound crorepatis and the company itself.Goyal, whose company Zomato went public in 2021, is offering some insights from his own experience. Zomato's IPO also created a wave of employee wealth, but Goyal warns that this financial windfall can have unintended consequences.Recently, at the ET Startup Awards, Goyal revealed that Zomato experienced a period of complacency after its IPO. Employees, now financially secure, lost some of their drive and focus. This resulted in a slowdown of innovation and progress within the company.“The IPO was good and the business was doing what it was doing, and a lot of people made a lot of money for the first time in their lives, and these are competent people. Competent people can't recognise that they are actually being complacent. They don’t seek progress anymore...,"" Goyal said.Goyal acknowledged the positive aspects of wealth creation for his employees. However, he emphasises the importance of maintaining a culture of ambition and continuous growth, even amidst financial success. To address the complacency issue, Zomato had to restructure and refocus its workforce.“They are tuned in that way but they are not letting any progress happen. That’s what we had come down to. There was no work happening inside the organisation for a while. I had to literally clear out pretty much everybody who had lost that drive and then reboot the organisation,"" he added.Goyal observed that the surge in wealth brought mixed outcomes for Zomato. While it empowered employees, it also fostered a sense of complacency, which began to hinder the company’s progress. To counter this, Goyal took the challenging step of restructuring the organization and making personnel changes to reignite the company’s culture of innovation and maintain its momentum.","Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal says the company experienced a period of complacency after its IPO.

SpaceX, led by Elon Musk , has unveiled an ambitious proposal for a groundbreaking satellite relay system called ""Marslink,"" aimed at transforming communication capabilities on Mars. Presented during a NASA-led Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group meeting, this project is intended to support future Mars missions by providing a reliable communication network around the Red Planet. Marslink marks a significant step in SpaceX’s overarching vision of advancing Mars exploration and preparing for human settlement on the planet. By leveraging expertise from its successful Starlink network on Earth, SpaceX aims to create a sustainable framework for seamless data transmission between Mars and Earth.Marslink draws heavily from the operational model of Starlink, SpaceX's network of thousands of low-Earth orbit satellites. Starlink has successfully connected over 102 countries, delivering high-speed internet to underserved areas. SpaceX plans to replicate this success on Mars by establishing a similar satellite relay system. Once operational, Marslink would enable consistent communication for Martian surface assets, such as rovers, landers, and eventually, human habitats.This communication infrastructure is critical for real-time data exchange between Mars and Earth, a challenge for ongoing and future Mars missions. As SpaceX progresses toward its goal of human colonisation of Mars, a robust communication network like Marslink will play a pivotal role in ensuring mission success.While SpaceX has presented a promising solution, the Marslink proposal faces stiff competition. NASA is exploring alternative communication systems offered by other major players in the aerospace industry, such as Blue Origin and Lockheed Martin.Blue Origin has introduced its ""Blue Ring"" orbital tug concept, designed to provide data relay services and enable in-space cloud computing. Although still in development, the Blue Ring project is slated for testing under the Pentagon’s DarkSky-1 mission. However, a launch date for this technology remains uncertain.Lockheed Martin, on the other hand, has proposed repurposing the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft. Originally launched in 2013 to study Mars’ atmosphere, MAVEN could be repositioned to serve as a relay hub, much like NASA’s Deep Space Network on Earth. This approach offers a cost-effective solution by utilising existing technology while meeting communication demands for Mars missions.SpaceX acknowledges that Marslink is just the beginning of a much larger endeavour to establish high-capacity communication between Earth and Mars. Musk recently stated on X (formerly Twitter), “Earth and Mars will ultimately need >petabit/sec connectivity.” This highlights the scale of the challenge, given the vast distance and signal delay between the two planets.Beyond technical hurdles, SpaceX will need to collaborate closely with NASA and other space agencies to align Marslink with broader planetary exploration goals. Regulatory approvals, funding, and international cooperation will also play crucial roles in bringing this vision to reality.If successful, Marslink could revolutionise how data is collected, processed, and transmitted in interplanetary missions. For NASA, Marslink aligns with its long-term strategy of building a sustainable exploration framework. Reliable communication is essential for monitoring scientific experiments, ensuring the safety of astronauts, and managing autonomous operations on Mars.Moreover, this initiative could inspire further innovation in space communications, potentially influencing similar networks for other celestial bodies. With a growing emphasis on space exploration, projects like Marslink underscore the need for advanced infrastructure to support humanity’s ambitions beyond Earth.","SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, has unveiled an ambitious proposal for a groundbreaking satellite relay system called ""Marslink"" The project is intended to support future Mars missions by providing a reliable communication network around the Red Planet.

Black Friday, the unofficial start of the Christmas shopping season, falls on November 29 this year. Retailers have already started getting ready for the upcoming sale. While traditionally known for massive crowds and in-store deals, Black Friday shopping has increasingly shifted online, a trend accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Thanksgiving weekend, covering Black Friday and Cyber Monday, remains a peak shopping period in the United States and the United Kingdom.Retailers now offer deals and promotions well before these dates, allowing shoppers to start their holiday shopping early. Some companies also offer discounts during the Black Friday sale in India where the sale isn’t that big. This means the discounts that companies offer during the Black Friday sale in India are not as big as the ones available in countries like the UK and the US. Apart from Indian shopping websites, some foreign sites also allow Indian users to ship products from abroad. Here’s everything you need to know about the Black Friday sale in India:Black Friday always falls on the fourth Friday of November — the day after Thanksgiving. The following Monday is celebrated as Cyber Monday. The term ""Black Friday"" originated in Philadelphia around the 1960s and '70s, initially used by police and bus drivers to describe the chaos caused by the influx of shoppers before Thanksgiving weekend. Department stores attempted to rebrand the term as ""Big Friday,"" but the name ""Black Friday"" persisted.Since the 1980s, retailers have associated Black Friday with the idea of their ledgers being ""in the black,"" meaning profitable, as shoppers begin their holiday spending. This explanation, popularised by marketing professor Marcus Collins, highlights the shift from the term's negative connotations to its current association with retail success.In 2024, Black Friday comes at the very end of the month, on November 29. Meanwhile, Cyber Monday will follow on December 2. However, most brands and online shopping platforms like Amazon , Flipkart and more don’t confine their deals to these specific dates and are soon expected to start offering deals for the Black Friday sale.Just like last year, major e-commerce platforms like Tata Cliq, Flipkart, and Amazon are expected to offer attractive deals on a wide range of products, including electronics, fashion, and home essentials. Here’s a list of online shopping platforms that offer Black Friday sale deals in India:While many Indian retailers participate in Black Friday, customers can also access deals from international websites. However, it's important to note that customers will have to be responsible for shipping costs and any applicable import duties.","Black Friday, the unofficial start of the Christmas shopping season, falls on November 29 this year.

WhatsApp-parent Meta said that it disagrees with the Competition Commission (CCI) decision of imposing Rs 213 crore penalty. The CCI, on Monday, imposed a penalty of Rs 213.14 crore on the social media giant for unfair business ways with respect to WhatsApp privacy policy update done in 2021. As per a PTI report, a Meta spokesperson said that the company disagrees with the CCI 's decision and plans to appeal.“As a reminder, the 2021 update did not change the privacy of people's personal messages and was offered as a choice for users at the time. We also ensured no one would have their accounts deleted or lose functionality of the WhatsApp service because of this update,” the Meta spokesperson said.The company stated that the 2021 update provided further transparency about data collection and usage along with introducing optional business features on WhatsApp. The Meta spokesperson said that since that time, WhatsApp has been incredibly valuable to people and businesses, enabling organisations and government institutions to deliver citizen services through COVID and beyond, and as well as supporting small businesses in furtherance of the India economy.“WhatsApp is able to do all of this because it offers services supported by Meta. We are committed to finding a path forward that allows us to continue providing the experiences that people and businesses have come to expect from us,” the spokesperson added.In its order, CCI has refrained WhatsApp from sharing data collected on its platform with other Meta companies or Meta company products for advertising purposes for five years. It said that the messaging platform must add prominent in-app notifications allowing users to opt out of data sharing with Meta's other platforms, including Facebook and Instagram. A new dedicated tab in WhatsApp settings will let users review and modify their data-sharing preferences.“This explanation should specify the purpose of data sharing, linking each type of data to its corresponding purpose,” it said.“The interface modifications represent a significant shift in how WhatsApp handles user privacy in India,” said a CCI spokesperson. “Users will have greater control over their data through easily accessible opt-out options.”Also read: CCI has fined Meta Rs 231 crore and it also means WhatsApp is changing for you",The Competition Commission (CCI) imposed a penalty of Rs 213.14 crore on the social media giant for unfair business ways with respect to WhatsApp privacy policy update done in 2021.

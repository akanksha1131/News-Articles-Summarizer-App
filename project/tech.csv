Donald Trump's new Immigration Policy to end H-1B Visa Lottery: Here's what it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trumps-new-immigration-policy-to-end-h-1b-visa-lottery-heres-what-it-means/articleshow/123266589.cms,"What the new H-1B visa rule may mean

From lottery to wage-based system





The White House’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has approved a proposed rule that could change how H-1B visas are given to specialty occupation workers. According to a Bloomberg report, the approval hints that the rule could be made public soon. As per the report, OIRA cleared the rule on August 8, 2025. Currently, the H-1B visa program is heavily used by the tech industry, allowing 85,000 new visas each year. Employers submit applications in the spring, and a random lottery decides which ones can move forward.President Donald Trump has long criticized the H-1B program, claiming some companies use it to replace US workers with cheaper foreign labor, especially the tech industry.If the new rule changes the H-1B selection to a wage-based system, only jobs in the top two wage groups (3 and 4) will be filled by H-1B workers. This would help protect entry-level jobs for Americans, but it would also make it harder for foreign graduates to find jobs in the US.Notably, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has not shared details yet, but the plan is expected to bring back a proposal from the first Trump administration. The plan, as per reports, was aimed to replace the current random lottery with a system that gives priority to applicants based on wages.The first Trump administration introduced the wage-priority idea as part of its “Buy American, Hire American” policy, arguing it would ensure visas went to highly skilled, well-paid foreign workers.However, the Biden administration withdrew the plan in 2021 after receiving over 1,000 public comments opposing it. Critics said the rule would sharply cut the number of eligible foreign workers, especially in entry-level positions.In 2021, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) suggested ranking applications based on four wage levels, giving preference to the highest-paid roles.Federal courts also blocked related efforts to raise the minimum wage levels for H-1B holders and narrow the definition of qualifying jobs. However, supporters of the wage-priority system argue it protects American jobs, while opponents say it limits opportunities for talented but lower-paid professionals.","The White House’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has approved a proposed rule that could change how H-1B visas are given to specialty occupation workers.

How and Why Trump's New Tariffs Will Not Make Your iPhone More Expensive

The public feud between tech billionaires Elon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has escalated into a war of words on X. The dispute began when Musk accused Apple of manipulating its App Store rankings. In a swift counter-attack, Altman fired back, alleging that Musk himself manipulates his social media platform to benefit his own companies and attack rivals. Musk retaliated by calling Altman a liar, only for Altman to throw a challenge.“Will you sign an affidavit that you have never directed changes to the X algorithm in a way that has hurt your competitors or helped your own companies?” Altman asked Musk, adding, “I will apologize if so”.The conflict was ignited when Musk announced his company, xAI , would take legal action against Apple. His frustration stemmed from the fact that OpenAI's ChatGPT holds the top spot among free apps on the App Store, while his own Grok chatbot ranks fifth.“Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation. xAI will take immediate legal action,” Musk said.Altman fired back at Elon Musk, alleging the billionaire manipulates his social media platform Twitter to benefit his companies and harm competitors.""This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like,"" Altman wrote in response to Musk's accusations.Musk quickly retaliated against Altman, writing in a post: ""You got 3M views on your bullshit post, you liar, far more than I’ve received on many of mine, despite me having 50 times your follower count!""","The dispute began when Musk accused Apple of manipulating its App Store rankings.

What Perplexity's Chrome deal includes

Google’s antitrust case creates rare opportunity for Perplexity

Aravind Srinivas-led AI company Perplexity has submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion all-cash offer to acquire Google 's Chrome browser. The three-year-old startup confirmed it sent the formal bid to Google, despite being valued at just $18 billion itself. The bold move comes as Chrome commands over three billion users worldwide, making it a prize asset in the heated race for AI-powered search dominance.""Multiple large investment funds have agreed to finance the transaction in full,"" said Perplexity Chief Business Officer Dmitry Shevelenko. The company has raised around $1 billion so far from major investors including Nvidia and Japan's SoftBank, but declined to name which funds would back this massive acquisition.Perplexity's offer goes beyond just the $34.5 billion price tag. The company has outlined specific commitments designed to address potential regulatory and user concerns about the acquisition.The startup pledges to invest $3 billion over two years in Chrome development and infrastructure improvements. It promises to keep the underlying Chromium code open source, ensuring other browser makers can continue building on the platform. Crucially, Perplexity says it won't change Chrome's default search engine settings.""This is part of our commitment to continuity and choice for users, and will likely be seen as having the benefit of stability for Google and its many advertisers,"" a Perplexity spokesperson said.The all-cash offer includes no equity component, which Perplexity says avoids potential antitrust complications. According to the term sheet, the company would also ""extend offers to a substantial portion of Chrome talent"" to retain key developers and engineers.The timing is no accident. A federal judge ruled last year that Google holds an illegal monopoly in internet search, and now the Department of Justice wants the tech giant to sell Chrome as the primary remedy. US District Judge Amit Mehta is expected to rule on final penalties any day now, potentially forcing Google into the largest corporate breakup in decades.""To remedy these harms, the [Initial Proposed Final Judgment] requires Google to divest Chrome, which will permanently stop Google's control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser,"" the DOJ wrote in court filings.The stakes couldn't be higher. Chrome commands over three billion users worldwide - more than a third of all internet users - making it the ultimate prize in the AI search wars. The browser feeds Google's $300 billion advertising empire by tracking user behavior, search patterns, and website visits across the entire web.The stakes couldn't be higher. Chrome commands over three billion users worldwide - more than a third of all internet users - making it the ultimate prize in the AI search wars. The browser feeds Google's $300 billion advertising empire by tracking user behavior, search patterns, and website visits across the entire web.Without Chrome, Google would lose its most valuable window into user behavior and face a much tougher battle to maintain its 90% dominance in global search.For Perplexity and other AI search challengers like OpenAI (which once had shown interest in an similar purchase), acquiring Chrome would provide instant access to billions of users who currently default to Google search. It would also break Google's stranglehold on the browser market, where Chrome holds roughly 65% market share globally. The browser integration has been crucial to Google's ability to promote its AI features like Search Overviews and fend off competition from chatbots like ChatGPT and Perplexity's own AI search engine.But significant challenges remain for Srinivas & co. Google has shown no interest in selling Chrome and plans to appeal the antitrust ruling through potentially years of legal battles. The $34.5 billion bid also falls short of the at least $50 billion valuation that DuckDuckGo CEO Gabriel Weinberg has suggested Chrome could command in a forced sale scenario.This marks Perplexity's second major acquisition attempt this year, following its January offer to merge with TikTok's US operations."," AI company Perplexity has submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion all-cash offer to acquire Google's Chrome browser.

UBON SP-85: Portable Party Speaker On A Budget

Popular photography brand, Eastman Kodak Co ., has raised ""substantial doubt"" about continuing its operations in the coming days. The 130-year-old company has suggested that it may soon go out of business. The company stated that it may not be able to meet its debt obligations, a disclosure that also reportedly caused its shares to fall by over 13% recently. Based in Rochester, New York, Kodak reported having $155 million in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, which includes $70 million held within the United States. The company's financial struggles follow a move last year (which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal) that ended its retirement income plan to reduce its debt burden.In its regulatory (as seen by The Independent), Kodak said:In a recent statement, David Bullwinkle, Kodak’s CFO, said that the company expects to know by this week about how it will meet its obligations to pay all pension plan participants and expects to complete the reversion by December.Founded by George Eastman in 1880, Kodak played a significant role in making photography accessible in the early 20th century. It became widely recognised for its Brownie and Instamatic cameras, along with its yellow-and-red film boxes. The company first faced setbacks due to competition from its Japanese rivals and later struggled to adapt to the transition from film to digital technology.In 2012, Kodak filed for bankruptcy protection after facing rising competition, the growing adoption of digital photography, and increasing debt. Following this, the company sold several businesses and patents and shut down the camera manufacturing unit that had established its reputation.A year later, it received approval to exit court oversight, shifting its focus to becoming a smaller company specialising in commercial and packaging printing. Currently, Kodak is close to completing a manufacturing plant for regulated pharmaceutical products.It already produces unregulated key starting materials for pharmaceuticals, while production at the upgraded facility is expected to begin later this year.",Kodak has $155 million in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30.

An Australian federal court has ruled that Apple and Google 's app stores are uncompetitive, handing a partial victory for Epic Games that develops Fortnite game. The ruling is part of a long-running global legal dispute where Epic has accused the tech giants of anti-competitive behaviour. This comes a week after a US court rejected Google’s appeal in the antitrust lawsuit brought by Epic Games, a decision that affirms Google’s Play Store and payment systems are illegal monopolies.According to news agency Reuters, In Australia, Epic Games specifically argued that the app stores’ fees for game downloads were too high and that the companies prevented users from downloading alternative app stores.The Australian court found that the app stores had no protections against anti-competitive behaviour. However, the judge's summary also noted that the smartphone makers had not intentionally broken the law.In a post on X, Epic Games celebrated the decision“The Epic Games Store and Fortnite will come to iOS in Australia! This is a WIN for developers and consumers in Australia!"" the company stated.Both Apple and Google have responded to the ruling. Apple said it “strongly disagreed” with parts of the court's decision, adding that it “faces fierce competition in every market.”Google welcomed the rejection of some of Epic's claims but disagreed with the court's characterization of its billing policies, stating it would review the full decision before deciding on its next steps.Meanwhile, a ruling in the US court will force Google to make changes to its Android ecosystem within the next three years. The company is now required to distribute rival app stores through its own Google Play Store and provide competitors with access to its complete app catalog.Additionally, Google is barred from forcing developers to use its own billing system and from entering into revenue-sharing agreements to pre-install its store on devices.In response to the “total victory,” Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney announced that the Epic Games Store for Android will launch directly within the Google Play Store.","An Australian federal court has ruled that Apple and Google's app stores are uncompetitive.

Responding to the comments, the Tesla CEO acknowledged that while the valuation is possible, it may require ‘extreme execution’.“Extreme execution is needed, but a valuation of $20 trillion for Tesla is possible,” Elon Musk wrote, quoting a post on X (formerly Twitter).Notably, this comes days after Elon Musk warned of ‘few rough quarters’ for Tesla following the expiration of the US tax credit for EVs. In an earnings conference call with analysts and investors this week, the tech billionaire said “We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the US.”Continuing further, he said “We probably could have a few rough quarters. I'm not saying we will, but we could”. “But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling,” Musk added.The EV maker reported a drop in profit for the third quarter in a row, with earnings falling to $1.17 billion, or 33 cents per share, down from $1.4 billion, or 40 cents per share, during the same period last year.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 40 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the April to June quarter also declined — from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion — but still came in slightly higher than analysts had forecast.During the earnings calls, Elon Musk was asked about whether he would want more than his current 13% stake in Tesla to keep control. To this, Musk said he did want more but not too much.“I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction,” he said, “but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”","Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation.

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world. Speaking during an event hosted by the All-In Podcast team and a consortium of tech leaders and lawmakers known as the Hill and Valley Forum, Huang discussed the scale of impact that small, focused teams of AI researchers can have and how Nvidia’s success has translated into significant financial rewards for those in leadership. “I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.” Jensen Huang said. He was responding to a question on the effectiveness and value of smaller AI teams.“But the important big idea is that the impact of 150 or so AI researchers, with funding behind them, can probably create,” he noted. Jensen Huang gave examples of OpenAI which originally started with around 150 employees and China’s DeepSeek which also has a similar workforce.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang added that there's something unique about well-structured, mid-sized teams when given the right resources. “That’s not a small team. That’s a good-size team with the right infrastructure… If you're willing to pay, say, $20 billion, $30 billion to buy a startup with 150 AI researchers, why wouldn't you pay one?”During the interview, the Nvidia CEO also addressed reports that he personally rewards high-performing employees with surprise stock options and RSUs (Restricted Stock Units).

Bezos-Sánchez wedding draws criticism over DiCaprio’s jet travel



Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s $40 Venetian wedding

Newlyweds Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez were recently spotted hosting Leonardo DiCaprio and his model girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht Koru . The high-profile outing took place off the coast of Ibiza, a popular celebrity hotspot and luxury summer getaway destination. Leonardo DiCaprio, known for his understated style, wore a plain white T-shirt, shorts, and his trademark baseball cap and sunglasses. Vittoria Ceretti showcased her model figure in a strapless blue top and black yoga pants. Bezos opted for tropical-printed swim trunks paired with a navy T-shirt, while Sánchez layered a printed kimono over a bikini. Their casual vacation looks perfectly captured the relaxed yet exclusive atmosphere aboard one of the world’s most extravagant and expensive private yachts, making headlines among luxury lifestyle and celebrity news followers worldwide.Bezos’s superyacht Koru, meaning “new beginnings” in Māori, represents the couple’s extravagant lifestyle and new chapter together. Built by Dutch shipbuilder Oceanco, Koru stands as the world’s tallest sailing yacht, measuring 250 feet tall with three masts exceeding 230 feet each.At 416 feet wide, the yacht features three luxury decks, multiple lounges, and ultra-modern amenities. Its construction spanned five years, costing an estimated $485 million. The yacht previously sparked controversy when plans to dismantle a historic Rotterdam bridge emerged to allow Koru’s passage, leading to widespread public protests and alternative solutions by the builders.Leonardo DiCaprio’s attendance at Bezos and Sánchez’s Venetian wedding drew backlash, with critics calling him a “hypocrite” due to his outspoken environmental activism. Social media users highlighted the contradiction between DiCaprio’s climate advocacy and the carbon-heavy nature of celebrity private jet travel, pointing out that over 90 jets reportedly flew into Venice for the wedding.Despite the criticism, DiCaprio’s friendship with Bezos remains strong, as evidenced by their repeat vacations together including last year’s luxury yacht trip in Sardinia. One of the wedding’s most surprising attendees was Sydney Sweeney, who reportedly had no close personal connection to Bezos or Sánchez. Later reports revealed that Bezos and Sánchez are investing in Sweeney’s upcoming lingerie line, explaining her presence at the event. This move demonstrates how the Bezos-Sánchez social circle extends beyond personal relationships to professional collaborations, further solidifying their influence in both business and Hollywood circles.The Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases a blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances. Whether it’s a $40 million Venetian wedding, a $485 million yacht, or investments in rising Hollywood talent, the couple has firmly positioned themselves at the center of celebrity culture and high society.Just weeks before their Ibiza yacht trip, Bezos and Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent $40 million wedding in Venice.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved from a futuristic concept to an everyday necessity, influencing industries ranging from healthcare and finance to entertainment and communication. It automates routine tasks, enhances productivity, and fuels innovations like ChatGPT, AI-driven translation services, and virtual gaming experiences.The growth of AI has also created a new class of billionaires, some of whom have built companies from scratch, while others have pivoted established businesses toward AI-driven opportunities. Backed by massive investments from Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and other global players, these individuals represent the cutting edge of technology and entrepreneurship. From Jensen Huang’s hardware empire to Alexandr Wang’s data infrastructure solutions, and from Sam Altman’s AI innovation to Yao Runhao’s virtual gaming platforms, these billionaires illustrate how AI is reshaping industries and redefining entrepreneurship.Source: ForbesJensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of Nvidia, sits at the top of the AI billionaire list with an astonishing $113 billion (£151 billion) net worth. Nvidia initially focused on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming and professional visualization. However, as AI adoption accelerated, these GPUs became the standard for training and running large language models like ChatGPT and Meta AI.Huang’s strategic vision transformed Nvidia into the backbone of the AI industry. In July 2025, the company reached an unprecedented $4 trillion valuation, reflecting how central its hardware is to AI infrastructure. Owning 3% of Nvidia, Huang’s wealth grew by over 300% in just one year, making him one of the top 20 richest individuals worldwide.At just 26 years old, Alexandr Wang has secured his place as the youngest self-made billionaire in the AI sector. He founded Scale AI at the age of 19, after dropping out of MIT, to focus on providing data labeling and annotation services essential for AI training.Scale AI works with over 300 high-profile clients, including Meta, Google, and General Motors, supplying the data infrastructure required to build machine learning models. The company’s valuation reached $14 billion (£10.5 billion) in 2024, and Wang’s 14% ownership stake boosted his net worth to $2.7 billion (£3.6 billion). His success highlights how even niche AI services can yield massive fortunes.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is one of the most prominent faces in artificial intelligence. While OpenAI itself is valued at around $300 billion (£225 billion), Altman does not personally hold equity in the company. His wealth, estimated at $1.9 billion (£1.4 billion), stems from early investments in companies like Stripe, Reddit, and Helion Energy, combined with the success of his previous startup, Loopt, which he sold for $42 million in 2012.Altman’s leadership at OpenAI popularized generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT, setting global trends in how businesses and consumers interact with AI. His influence extends beyond wealth, positioning him as one of the key thought leaders shaping AI’s future.Phil Shawe, co-CEO of TransPerfect, built one of the world’s largest translation and localization companies by leveraging AI-powered language processing. TransPerfect offers services across industries like law, healthcare, gaming, and entertainment, helping businesses operate in multiple languages with enhanced accuracy and efficiency.Founded in 1992 from a dorm room at New York University, TransPerfect generated $1.3 billion (£976 million) in revenue in 2024. Shawe owns 99% of the company, securing a personal fortune of $1.8 billion (£1.3 billion). His journey shows how AI technology can transform even traditional industries like language services into billion-dollar enterprises.Dario Amodei, a former vice president of research at OpenAI, left to co-found Anthropic in 2021. His company focuses on building safe, reliable AI systems using reinforcement learning techniques that allow AI models to adapt through human feedback.Anthropic’s approach to ethical AI and safety-first principles resonated with investors and industry leaders, pushing the company’s valuation to $61.5 billion (£46.2 billion) by 2025. Amodei’s net worth has reached $1.2 billion (£901 million), proving that prioritizing responsibility in AI development can be both impactful and profitable.Liang Wenfeng, once largely unknown outside China, made headlines with DeepSeek-R1, a large language model that outperformed ChatGPT on certain benchmarks while being five times cheaper to run. This innovation shook global markets, causing Nvidia’s stock to drop 17% in a single day as investors reacted to the potential shift in AI computing costs.Wenfeng previously founded a successful hedge fund, and he used his financial expertise to build DeepSeek into one of the most cost-efficient AI providers globally. His net worth now stands at $1 billion (£751 million), making him a key figure in China’s growing AI industry.Yao Runhao, CEO of Paper Games, has carved out a unique niche by combining AI with gaming. His company’s hit product, Love and Deepspace, uses artificial intelligence to create virtual dating simulations with interactive, personalized storylines.The game attracts over six million monthly users, showcasing the demand for AI-driven entertainment. Paper Games employs around 2,000 staff and focuses primarily on the female gaming market in China, highlighting how AI is revolutionizing interactive leisure experiences. Runhao’s innovation has earned him a net worth of $1.3 billion (£977 million).","World’s wealthiest AI moguls ranked by net worth.

Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India, marking another step in its long-term strategy to strengthen its footprint in emerging markets. During Apple’s latest earnings announcement, CEO Tim Cook confirmed plans to open multiple new Apple Stores in India before the year ends. The move comes as part of a broader global expansion plan that also includes fresh Apple retail outlets in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the launch of the Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia. Cook highlighted that these new physical stores are a key step in improving Apple’s customer experience, product accessibility, and service reach in high-growth regions like India.“We recently launched the Apple Store online in Saudi Arabia, and we couldn’t be more excited to open new stores in the UAE and India later this year,” Cook stated. “We were also delighted to welcome customers in Japan to a new location in the heart of Osaka.”According to Apple Magazine, four new stores are scheduled to open across key metropolitan cities in India, namely Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, and the Delhi NCR region. These new outlets will build on Apple’s successful retail debut in India in 2023, which saw the launch of Apple BKC in Mumbai and Apple Saket in Delhi. These initial stores have quickly become major crowd-pullers, especially during new iPhone release events, and have demonstrated the value of physical retail locations in India’s fast-growing premium smartphone market.To support this retail growth, Apple has been actively hiring talent for its upcoming stores. Earlier this year, Apple Store leader John Taffe shared on LinkedIn that Apple was looking for passionate and skilled individuals to join its retail team. “Apple’s journey in India has been incredible, and we’re thrilled to continue growing in these vibrant cities. To make these new stores a success, we’re looking for passionate and talented individuals to join our team,” Taffe noted. This hiring drive highlights Apple’s commitment to not only selling products but also delivering personalised customer experiences and creating jobs within the Indian retail sector.While India remains a critical market, Apple is expanding its retail network globally. Apart from its Indian plans, the company has announced new retail locations in the UAE, including a store in Al Ain, which will add to its existing four UAE outlets (two in Abu Dhabi and two in Dubai). The Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia further emphasizes Apple’s growing focus on the Middle East.These international retail initiatives aim to strengthen Apple’s customer reach and brand experience beyond its digital ecosystem. Apple’s global retail growth is supported by its strong financial results. In its April–June quarter (Q3), Apple reported a 13% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales, showcasing robust demand even in challenging economic conditions. This financial strength gives Apple the confidence to invest heavily in physical stores in markets like India, where premium smartphone adoption is rapidly increasing.India has emerged as one of Apple’s most important growth markets, driven by rising disposable incomes, expanding smartphone penetration, and a growing preference for premium devices. The launch of Apple BKC and Apple Saket in 2023 marked the company’s first direct retail presence in the country, and the overwhelming customer response has paved the way for more stores. Apple’s upcoming four new stores signal a long-term commitment to India, where it faces strong competition from brands like Samsung and OnePlus. However, Apple’s focus on a seamless retail experience and exclusive customer service could help it capture a larger market share in the premium category.",Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shifted from being a futuristic concept to a rapidly evolving reality impacting every industry. With advanced machine learning models, automation systems, and AI-powered decision-making tools, tasks once performed by humans are now handled with speed and precision by algorithms. This has triggered global concern about potential job losses. Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has admitted that automation will reduce certain jobs within the company. Similarly, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that AI will impact “everybody’s jobs” in some capacity, although he expects it to also create new opportunities. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predicts the most dramatic changes will occur within the next five to ten years, transforming entire job markets.When asked about the possibility of artificial general intelligence (AGI) performing all human tasks, DeepMind CEO Hassabis highlighted an important distinction:AI could analyse medical data, scans, and test results faster and more accurately than human doctors, potentially replacing or assisting in diagnosis and treatment planning.Nurses, however, provide emotional support, physical care, and human empathy that technology can’t replicate. A robotic nurse may be efficient but lacks the ability to emotionally connect with patients, a critical part of caregiving.This example shows that while AI in healthcare may replace certain intellectual tasks, professions relying on emotional intelligence will remain human-centered. This statement from Hassabis offers one of the clearest examples of how AI will alter specific professions, but not eliminate the need for human empathy and interpersonal care.According to Hassabis, the workplace of the future will integrate humans and AI collaboratively. AI will handle data-heavy, repetitive, and analytical processes, allowing humans to focus on creative problem-solving, emotional interaction, and leadership roles. This shift will require governments and industries to invest heavily in reskilling programs to prepare workers for AI-driven environments, emphasizing lifelong learning, adaptive skills, ethical AI usage, and the development of new interdisciplinary roles bridging technology, creativity, and human-centric decision-making.Andy Jassy’s remarks highlight a future where AI automation tools replace repetitive and operational tasks. Amazon already relies on robotics and intelligent software to manage logistics, inventory, and supply chain processes. Jassy believes that as these technologies mature, fewer human workers will be required for jobs like order processing and warehouse management. However, he noted that the shift doesn’t necessarily mean fewer opportunities overall but rather a need for upskilling and reskilling so employees can transition into more technology-driven roles.Jensen Huang, whose company Nvidia provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) powering modern AI systems, offered a candid view on AI’s impact:“Everybody’s jobs will be affected. Some jobs will be lost. Many jobs will be created.” Huang believes AI’s productivity gains will help industries perform tasks faster and cheaper, which may reduce demand for certain roles but open new ones focused on AI development, data analysis, and advanced engineering. He expressed hope that economic growth from AI adoption will ultimately “lift society” rather than harm it.Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind and a key architect of advanced AI systems, views AI as an additive rather than purely disruptive technology. He explained that as AI capabilities expand, new job categories will emerge—roles that use AI to enhance human output rather than replace it entirely. Historically, technological revolutions (like industrial machines or computers) displaced certain jobs but also created industries that didn’t exist before. Hassabis believes this trend will continue:“New jobs will be created that are actually better, that utilise these tools or new technologies.”AI can handle data analysis, diagnostics, and treatment recommendations faster than humans, but doctors will still oversee complex decision-making and patient care.Nursing requires emotional support, hands-on care, and human empathy—qualities that machines and robots cannot replicate effectively.He predicts massive workplace changes within 5–10 years, with some jobs disappearing and new ones emerging.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expects automation to cut some jobs, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI will affect “everybody’s jobs” but also create new opportunities.Roles focused on AI development, creative problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and advanced data management are expected to increase.",Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce.

OpenAI CEO hints at legal counter-attack on Musk's platform

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman fired back at Elon Musk, alleging the billionaire manipulates his social media platform Twitter to benefit his companies and harm competitors, after Musk threatened legal action against Apple over App Store rankings .""This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like,"" Altman wrote in response to Musk's accusations.The exchange began when Musk got angry over Apple for allegedly not letting XAI 's Grok app reach the top spot in App Store rankings despite its popularity. ""Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation.""he posting, adding that ""xAI will take immediate legal action.""Musk's complaint centers on Apple's alleged bias in App Store curation and rankings. The billionaire claimed that Apple was refusing to feature X or Grok in the App Store's coveted ""Must Have"" section, despite his assertions that X ranks as the world's number one news app and Grok has achieved significant user adoption. Musk suggested this exclusion represents deliberate favoritism toward OpenAI, pointing to what he sees as a pattern of preferential treatment that violates fair competition principles.Current App Store data reveals the competitive landscape that sparked Musk's ire. ChatGPT dominates the ""Top Free Apps"" section for iPhones in the United States, while Grok holds fifth place overall.The rankings come amid Apple's deepening partnership with OpenAI, which has integrated ChatGPT functionality across iPhones, iPads, and Macs. This strategic alliance has raised questions about whether Apple's platform policies inadvertently or intentionally benefit its AI partners over competitors like Musk's xAI venture.Altman escalated the confrontation by sharing an article titled ""Yes, Elon Musk created a special system for showing you all his tweets first,"" effectively turning Musk's manipulation accusations back on him. The OpenAI chief appeared to relish the prospect of potential legal proceedings, suggesting they could expose Musk's own platform practices. ""I and many others would love to know what's been happening,"" Altman wrote, hinting at possible counter-discovery that could reveal how X's algorithm prioritizes Musk's content and potentially suppresses competitors.The bitter exchange is the latest escalation in a years-long tech rivalry that has grown increasingly personal and public. Since Musk's dramatic exit from OpenAI's board in 2018, the two former collaborators have transformed from partners into fierce adversaries, clashing over everything from AI safety protocols to business ethics.

Sam Altman promises more upgrades for ChatGPT users after GPT-5 backlash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altman-promises-more-upgrades-for-chatgpt-users-after-gpt-5-backlash/articleshow/123259950.cms,"Sam Altman addresses GPT-5 criticism



Better access for free-tier users

Following widespread criticism over the rollout of GPT-5, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has pledged to introduce more upgrades for ChatGPT users, including improved model variety, higher usage limits, and better responsiveness. The backlash stemmed from paying subscribers feeling shortchanged after the GPT-5 update, with some canceling their Plus plans over perceived downgrades in capability and tone. Altman acknowledged these concerns in a recent post, assuring users that OpenAI is working on adjustments that will deliver greater value, enhance reliability, and provide a smoother experience for both free-tier and Plus-tier customers.Altman’s remarks come after weeks of online debate, where users claimed GPT-5 was overly cautious, less creative, and more restrictive compared to earlier versions. Many Plus subscribers argued that the upgrade did not justify the monthly fee, especially with tighter compute limits. Altman said the company will boost capacity, add flexibility in model choice, and refine GPT-5’s conversational style to make it “warmer” and more engaging.OpenAI plans to roll out expanded message limits for Plus and Enterprise customers, aiming to exceed pre-GPT-5 usage allowances. Additionally, future updates will include access to multiple model options — allowing users to switch between GPT-5 and earlier models to suit different tasks. Altman emphasized that the changes will be implemented gradually but will focus on maximizing value for subscribers who rely on ChatGPT for work, research, and creative projects.In a notable shift, Altman also promised improvements for free-tier users , including more generous daily limits and occasional access to GPT-5. This move aims to make ChatGPT’s advanced capabilities more widely available, fostering goodwill among casual users and attracting potential future subscribers.Altman concluded his remarks by stating that the company’s long-term goal is to make ChatGPT “better than it has ever been” for all users. While acknowledging the challenges of scaling powerful AI systems, he reiterated OpenAI’s commitment to transparency, adaptability, and continuous improvement in response to community feedback.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has pledged to introduce more upgrades for ChatGPT users, including improved model variety and higher usage limits.

Why such big paychecks

Senior director, engineering at Uber can earn up to $360,000 annually as the ride hailing platform competes aggressively for top talent amid the ongoing AI boom, according to new federal work-visa data analysed by Business Insider. Uber’s compensation packages offered to software engineers, project managers, Data Scientists and others reflect the intense competition for skilled workers in artificial intelligence and related fields. As Uber ramps up hiring to create its vision of a “super app,” the company is offering six-figure salaries to attract top international talent across engineering, data science, and management roles.According to a report by Business Insider, the H-1B visa data indicate that Uber filed to hire nearly 500 foreign workers under the H-1B visa program. This is a noticeable jump as the company filed for 350 foreign workers last year during the same period. The most sought-after roles include software engineers, data scientists, operations research analysts, product and project managers. The filings made by Uber to the US Department of Labor also include the base salary disclosures excluding bonuses, stock options and other perks.Here’s a snapshot of what Uber pays its H-1B employees:These figures reflect Uber’s aggressive compensation strategy to attract global talent amid fierce competition in the tech sector.As reported by BI, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi confirmed that the company is “slowly moving towards a super app of sorts,” aiming to integrate ride-hailing, food delivery, logistics, and more into a single platform. This plan of the company requires robust and highly skilled tech workforce and for that Uber is willing to pay the best compensation.","Uber filed to hire nearly 500 foreign workers under the H-1B visa program.

American chipmaker seeks to protect federal funding and business relationships

Intel issued a conciliatory statement Monday following CEO Lip-Bu Tan 's White House visit, emphasizing the company's commitment to American technology leadership after President Trump 's recent call for the executive's resignation over alleged China ties .""Earlier today, Mr. Tan had the honor of meeting with President Trump for a candid and constructive discussion on Intel's commitment to strengthening US technology and manufacturing leadership,"" Intel said. ""We appreciate the President's strong leadership to advance these critical priorities and look forward to working closely with him and his Administration as we restore this great American company.""The corporate statement followed Trump 's own social media post describing the meeting as ""very interesting"" and calling Tan 's career rise ""an amazing story."" The president announced that Tan and cabinet members would continue discussions next week to ""bring suggestions to me,"" signalling a collaborative approach after days of public tension.The company's measured response follows Trump's social media post declaring Tan ""highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately."" The president's criticism centered on concerns raised by Senator Tom Cotton about the CEO's previous business relationships with Chinese companies and his leadership history at Cadence Design Systems .Tan had previously served as CEO of Cadence until 2021, during which time the company recently admitted to unlawfully exporting semiconductor design software to a Chinese university involved in nuclear research. The Justice Department settlement required Cadence to pay nearly $118 million in criminal penalties for the violations.Intel's statement notably avoided addressing these specific allegations while positioning the company as aligned with Trump's America First technology agenda.The diplomatic outreach reflects Intel's vulnerable position as a major recipient of federal CHIPS Act investments totalling $8.5 billion for domestic manufacturing expansion. The company has committed to building advanced semiconductor facilities in Arizona, Ohio, and New Mexico as part of the national security initiative.Tan assumed Intel's leadership in March after the board removed Pat Gelsinger, inheriting significant operational challenges including declining market share and intense competition from rivals like Nvidia in emerging AI chip markets. His White House meeting represents Intel's effort to maintain crucial government partnerships while addressing political concerns about foreign business connections in the increasingly sensitive semiconductor industry.","Intel issued a conciliatory statement Monday following CEO Lip-Bu Tan's White House visit.

Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has said that inconsistency in artificial intelligence (AI) is a major reason why AI can perform exceptionally well in some areas but still fail at simpler tasks. Speaking on the “Google for Developers” podcast, Hassabis said that advanced AI models like Google’s Gemini can win gold medals at the International Mathematical Olympiad but often struggle to solve basic high school maths problems.“The lack of consistency in AI is a major barrier to achieving AGI,” he said, referring to Artificial General Intelligence — the stage where AI can reason like humans. This, according to Demis Hassabis, is what is holding back the technology from reaching its full potential.During the interaction, Demis Hassabis also referred to Google CEO Sundar Pichai ’s description of the current state of AI as “AJI” — artificial jagged intelligence — a term used for describing systems that excel in certain tasks but fail in others.The DeepMind CEO also stressed that solving AI’s inconsistency problem will take more than just increasing data and computing power. “We need better testing and new, more challenging benchmarks to determine precisely what the models excel at and what they don’t,” Demis Hassabis said.The debate over AGI continues to divide the tech industry. Hassabis has previously taken a more cautious view of its arrival compared to Google co-founder Sergey Brin, calling for higher standards before declaring that AI has reached that level.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman who earlier suggested that the AI term – AGI aka Artificial General Intelligence is ""just around the corner” has taken a u-turn. At CNBC’s “Squawk Box” last week, Altman was asked whether the company’s latest GPT-5 model moves the world any closer to achieving AGI. Replying to the question, Sam Altman said “I think it’s not a super useful term”.He said the challenge with AGI is that different companies and people define it in different ways. One definition, he explained, is an AI that can do “a significant amount of the work in the world.” But this has problems, as the type of work people do keeps changing.“I think the point of all of this is it doesn’t really matter and it’s just this continuing exponential of model capability that we’ll rely on for more and more things,” he added.",Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has said that inconsistency in artificial intelligence (AI) is a major reason why AI can perform exceptionally well in some areas but still fail at simpler tasks.

Read US immigration authority notice that has created panic as H-1B children may lose Green Card under new rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/read-us-immigration-authority-notice-that-has-created-panic-as-h-1b-children-may-lose-green-card-under-new-rules/articleshow/123257777.cms,"USCIS updates policy on CSPA age calculation: Here’s what has changed



Impact on Indian families



Alternatives for families



Recently, USICS has updated the policy on CSPA (Child Status Protection Act) age calculation triggering widespread concern among the Indian families on H-1B and other employment-based visas, as it could prevent their children from obtaining a green card. The new which will come into effect starting August 15, redefines how a child’s age is calculated under the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) and the new calculation method could result in thousands of children “aging out” of green card eligibility once they turn 21 — even if their parents’ petitions are still pending.Effective from August 15, 2025, USIC will now use the Final Action Dates chart from the Department of State’s Visa Bulletin to determine when a visa is considered “available” for CSPA age calculation. Earlier, under a more lenient February 2023 policy, USCIS used the Dates for Filing chart, which allowed more children to lock in their age and remain eligible for permanent residency.“We are updating the Policy Manual to clarify that a visa becomes available for the purposes of Child Status Protection Act age calculation based on the Final Action Dates chart of the Department of State Visa Bulletin. The new guidance applies to requests filed on or after August 15, 2025. We will apply the Feb. 14, 2023, policy of CSPA age calculation to adjustment of status applications pending with USCIS before August 15, 2025, as these aliens may have relied on that policy when they filed,” reads the notice.Experts suggest that in most of the cases the final action date is way behind the date of actual filling. So, with this new rule coming into effect many children will turn 21 and lose the eligibility before their family’s green card petition is finalised. As reported by the Cato Institute, Indians make up to 62% of employment-based green card backlog and millions of petitions are pending since March 2023.Immigration experts also warn that the new disproportionately affect Indian children who have grown up on the US but will now be forced to leave the country once they turn 21.“Generally, an unmarried alien child must be under age 21 to obtain lawful permanent resident status in the United States based on their parent’s approved petition for a family-sponsored, employment-based, or diversity visa. If they turn 21 and age out during the immigration process, they generally are no longer eligible to immigrate based on their parent’s petition. Congress enacted the CSPA to protect certain alien children from losing their eligibility for lawful permanent resident status based on an approved visa petition. The CSPA provides a method to calculate the alien’s age that considers when an immigrant visa number “becomes available,” adds the notice by USCIS.Sukanya Raman, country head of Davies & Associates, an immigration firm told Economic Times, “More children are at risk. The final action date is often years behind the filing date, and many will lose eligibility before a visa becomes available.”The ET report also revealed that the immigration law firms are witnessing a surge in calls from anxious parents who are seeking clarity and are also looking for options. “Most of the calls have been about what their status is and the way forward,” said Gnanamookan Senthurjothi, founder of Visa Code. “For some families, it’s a matter of staying in the U.S. or returning — even if one child can’t stay legally.”With the new rule taking effect in just a few days, experts are advising families on potential alternatives. Experts advise the families to file for the process before August 15 which will enable them to lock the age under the older policy.Apart from this, they can also apply for student visas (F-1) or employment visas (H-1B) for children who will soon turn 21. The families can also consider EB-5 investment visas, which offer a separate path to residency.","USCIS has updated the policy on CSPA (Child Status Protection Act) age calculation.

Gartner and Kotak see short-term pain, long-term gain for Indian IT companies

ChatGPT maker OpenAI's recent launch of GPT-5, the latest and most advanced version of ChatGPT, could pose a significant challenge to India's $283 billion IT services industry. According to a report in Economic Times, quoting Kotak Institutional Equities report , the adoption of generative AI, bolstered by GPT-5's enhanced coding capabilities, may lead to a 2-3% revenue decline for Indian IT companies over the next 2-3 years, impacting both software services and customer service outsourcing sectors. The Indian IT industry, heavily reliant on large-scale software coder hiring, is already grappling with AI-driven disruptions.The report notes that AI has improved productivity by 20-40%, reducing the need for engineers and shifting away from traditional people-based billing models. This, combined with a tariffs-induced economic slowdown, has led to flat or negative growth for IT firms over the past two years. Phil Fersht, CEO of HFS Research, said, “If your business still depends on armies of coders grinding through routine builds, your margins are about to get hammered.” He emphasized that clients will demand lower rates due to AI-driven productivity gains, forcing IT firms to overhaul delivery models within 12–18 months to focus on AI-augmented, higher-value services.OpenAI described GPT-5 as “our best AI system yet,” with significant improvements in coding, math, writing, and more, according to the report. The model offers better reasoning, accuracy, and instruction-following, with a 65% reduction in hallucination rates, as per a Gartner report quoted in the article. These advancements could lower costs and risks for clients modernizing legacy systems, providing some advantages to IT service providers. However, major firms like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, HCLTech, and Wipro are facing revenue challenges due to a shift from employee-based to outcome-based pricing models.Gartner, as cited by the report, noted that GPT-5’s reduced API fees and improved reliability make it more suitable for enterprise use, though it requires careful integration and governance. Anushree Verma, a senior director analyst at Gartner, said, “This is the year of advanced models, and GPT-5 is designed to address the needs of developers by reducing hallucinations and simplifying coding.” However, she cautioned that GPT-5 is not artificial general intelligence and still has limitations, including risks of misuse for scams or harmful outputs, similar to its predecessor, GPT-4. Despite short-term challenges, the report says that there are potential long-term benefits.Kotak’s report too suggests that while GenAI adoption may create revenue headwinds initially, new opportunities from AI-enabled use cases could offset losses over time, though a lag in realizing these benefits is expected. “However, we expect a lag in the pickup of new opportunities and for savings in software development to be deployed into these new opportunities, leading to a period of net headwinds,” the note said.",ChatGPT maker OpenAI's launch of GPT-5 could pose a challenge to India's $283 billion IT services industry.

China raises questions on US-based AI chips’ security and promotes self-reliance



Can These AI Glasses Replace Your Phone? Ray-Ban Meta Glasses Tested

US chipmaker Nvidia is reportedly facing a new hurdle in China when it comes to AI chips. China has instructed its domestic companies to avoid using Nvidia’s H20 chips, particularly for government-related projects. This move essentially complicates Nvidia’s – as well as AMD ’s – efforts to recover billions in lost revenue and challenges the Trump administration ’s agreement to secure a share of those sales. Notably, these chips are specially-designed for Chinese market and are watered down version of AI chips that are sold in the US.According to a report by Bloomberg, over the past few weeks, Chinese authorities have sent notices to various firms, advising against the use of less-advanced US semiconductors. The guidance was especially strong for any work related to the government or national security.This push also affects AMD's MI308 chips, which, along with Nvidia's H20, are part of a deal in which both companies agreed to give the US government a 15% cut of their China revenue in exchange for export licenses.Now, both companies face a new challenge: their Chinese customers are being pressured not to buy their products.Some of the notices sent by Beijing asked companies why they were choosing Nvidia's H20 chips over local alternatives and whether they had found any security flaws in the hardware. These notices coincided with state media reports questioning the security and reliability of the H20. Nvidia has consistently denied these claims, stating that its chips are not military products and do not contain vulnerabilities.The report said that China has two concerns: First, Chinese officials worry that Nvidia's chips could have location-tracking or remote shutdown capabilities, a claim Nvidia has “vehemently denied.” Second, China is focused on building its own domestic chip industry and officials want Chinese companies to move away from Western chips and choose local options.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has called the H20 chip “obsolete” and said China “already has it in a different form.” This aligns with a statement from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who claimed the H20 deal was part of a broader trade agreement to improve US access to Chinese rare-earth minerals.","China has instructed its domestic companies to avoid using Nvidia’s H20 chips, particularly for government-related projects.

Elon Musk accuses Apple of biases



Apple and OpenAI partnership under scrutiny



Tesla CEO Elon Musk has now launched a fresh attack on Apple. The xAI founder has accused Apple of anti-competitive behaviour in its App Store. Musk is also threatening the Cupertino-based tech giant with legal action over what he calluses an “unequivocal antitrust violation.” In a series of posts shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk has claimed that Apple is unfairly favouring OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT and is also making it “impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store.” He added that his AI company, xAI, will take “immediate legal action” against Apple.Elon Musk’s frustration centers on App Store rankings and editorial choices. According to the data by Sensor Tower, presently ChatGPT ranks at the 1st potion in the US in the category of iPhone free app. On the other hand, xAI’s Grok ranks on the 5th position and Google’s Gemini sits at 57th position. Angry with the ranking, Musk said that Apple is making it impossible for any AI company to reach the top spot in the App Store.“Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation. xAI will take immediate legal action,” wrote Musk.Along with this, Musk also criticised Apple’s “Must-Have Apps” section, which features ChatGPT but excludes both Grok and X, despite their popularity. “Hey @Apple App Store, why do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your ‘Must Have’ section when X is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps? Are you playing politics?” Posted xAI founder.Apple recently entered into a partnership with OpenAI for the integration of chatGPT into iPhones, iPads and Macs. Musk suggests that this relationship between the two companies is the reason behind the ranking of ChatGPT. However, he has not provided any evidence for his claims. “Apple didn’t just put their thumb on the scale, they put their whole body!” Musk wrote in another post.",Tesla CEO Elon Musk has launched a fresh attack on Apple.

By Monday evening, the Trump was posting: ""I met with Mr. Lip-Bu Tan, of Intel... The meeting was a very interesting one. His success and rise is an amazing story.""""Mr. Tan and my Cabinet members are going to spend time together, and bring suggestions to me during the next week,"" Trump posted on Truth Social, signaling continued engagement rather than confrontation.The extraordinary flip followed what sources described as intense behind-the-scenes lobbying after Trump's resignation demand sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley.Tan's emergency mission to Washington included Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in what Intel carefully described as a ""candid and constructive discussion."" The meeting represented a last-ditch effort to counter what the CEO had called ""misinformation"" about his record.The crisis began when Republican Senator Tom Cotton fired off a letter questioning Tan's China connections, specifically his investments in Chinese semiconductor companies and his leadership of Cadence Design Systems. That company recently pleaded guilty to illegally exporting chip design tools to a Chinese university conducting nuclear weapons research, paying $118 million in penalties.Trump's Thursday broadside came after watching Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo's segment on Tan's China ties. ""There is no other solution to this problem,"" Trump had declared, marking an unprecedented presidential intervention in corporate leadership.Tan, who became a US citizen after emigrating from Malaysia, responded to the initial attack with a company-wide memo emphasising his four-decade American residency.

A somewhat enhanced-in-a-negative-way Blackwell. In other words, take 30% to 50% off of it,” Trump told reporters, referring to a reduced-capability version of the chip, according to the report. He added that Nvidia’s CEO would discuss this “unenhanced version” with him.The Trump administration had halted Nvidia’s H20 chip sales to China in April but granted clearance last month for resumed shipments, the report noted. Trump described the H20 as “obsolete,” stating, “China already had it”. ""The H20 is obsolete,"" Trump said, adding China already had it. ""So I said, 'Listen, I want 20% if I'm going to approve this for you, for the country',"" he added.A Nvidia spokesperson told Reuters, “We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets,” adding, “While we haven’t shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.""The U.S. Commerce Department has begun issuing licenses for H20 chip sales to China, a U.S. official told the news agency, though details remain undisclosed. The curbs on chip exports are expected to cost Nvidia billions, with the company warning that a halt in H20 sales could reduce its July quarter revenue by $8 billion. Nvidia’s China revenue for the fiscal year ending January 26 was $17 billion, or 13% of total sales, as per the report.A Financial Times report, cited by Reuters, said that Nvidia agreed to the revenue-sharing arrangement to secure export licenses. The decision has left many analysts and experts baffled as they question the logic of resuming sales if the chips could pose a national security risk. ""Decisions on export licenses should be determined by national security considerations and the tradeoffs of U.S. policy goals, not a revenue-creating possibility,"" quoted Martin Chorzempa, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an independent research institution, in the report.","US President Donald Trump on Monday, August 11, suggested that he might allow Nvidia to sell a scaled-down version of its next-generation advanced GPU chip in China.

Tesla gets Robotaxi permit in Texas: What we know so far



Can These AI Glasses Replace Your Phone? Ray-Ban Meta Glasses Tested

Elon Musk-led Tesla has received a permit to operate its Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. This permit will allow the company to run a ride-hailing business with cars integrated with the automated driving system and even compete with companies like Uber and Lyft. The permit was issued this week despite previous reports of the vehicles disobeying traffic rules. According to a listing on the website of the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) (as seen by CNBC), Tesla Robotaxi LLC is now licensed as a “transportation network company” in Texas until August 6, 2026. The TDLR has also confirmed that this permit will enable Tesla to operate a ride-hailing business anywhere in the state, including with ""automated motor vehicles,"" and does not require a human safety driver or valet to be on board.This comes after Tesla robotaxis were reportedly captured on camera disobeying traffic laws in and around Austin during the company's pilot program. Although these incidents have not been reported as causing injuries or significant property damage, they have attracted federal scrutiny.Earlier this year, the EV company began offering a limited ride-hailing service in Austin, which was available only to invited participants. Most of these riders have been social media influencers and analysts, many of whom earn income by creating Tesla-related content on platforms such as X and YouTube.The Austin fleet comprises Model Y vehicles fitted with Tesla’s latest partially automated driving technology. Each ride includes a valet, or human safety supervisor, in the front passenger seat to step in if needed. The cars are also monitored remotely by staff at an operations centre.On Tesla’s earnings call last month, Musk—who has described himself as “pathologically optimistic”—said he believes the company could reach half of the US population with autonomous ride-hailing services by the end of 2025.However, there have been multiple reports about Tesla Robotaxi “misbehaving” on the road. In one incident, Tesla content creator Joe Tegtmeyer said his robotaxi did not stop for a train crossing signal and lowering gate arm, prompting a Tesla employee on board to step in.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has also spoken with Tesla about the matter, a spokesperson for the agency told CNBC via email.","Elon Musk-led Tesla has received a permit to operate its Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas.

GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke has resigned from his position, triggering a major restructuring for the company. After nearly four years at the helm, Dohmke is stepping down signaling his departure from both GitHub and Microsoft. Following his resignation, Microsoft is moving GitHub directly into its new CoreAI team. Reportedly, Microsoft will not replace Dohmke's CEO role, effectively ending GitHub's status as a separate entity and integrating it fully into its operations.“Still, after all this time, my startup roots have begun tugging on me and I’ve decided to leave GitHub to become a founder again,” Dohmke said.“I’ll be staying through the end of 2025 to help guide the transition and am leaving with a deep sense of pride in everything we’ve built as a remote-first organization spread around the world,” he added.Thomas Dohmke mentioned that GitHub will now be a part of Microsoft's CoreAI team – a new engineering group led by former Meta executive Jay Parikh. It is focused on building AI platforms and tools for both internal use and for Microsoft's customers. The division includes Microsoft's platform, tools, and Dev Div teams.According to Thomas Dohmke, GitHub Copilot “is the leader of the most successful and thriving market in the age of AI, with over 20 million users and counting.”“In just the last year, GitHub Copilot became the first multi-model solution at Microsoft, in partnership with Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI.

Experts debate over Nvidia H20 chip sale to China



Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode

Nvidia and AMD have received approval to sell their specially designed AI chips in China, but reportedly with an unusual condition. According to a new report, the Trump administration granted the export licenses after a "" financial arrangement "" was made. As part of this deal, both chipmakers have agreed to give the US government 15% of the revenue from their chip sales in China.Citing people familiar with the situation – including a US official – The Finanacial Times reported that the agreement was finalised last week. Nvidia will share 15% of revenues from its H20 chip sales, while AMD will provide the same percentage from its MI308 chip sales. The official noted that the administration has not yet decided how the funds will be used.The deal is a quid-pro-quo arrangement. Export control experts state that this is the first time a US company has agreed to pay a portion of its revenue to obtain export licenses, the report added.However, the agreement aligns with a broader pattern in the Trump administration, where companies are pressured to make concessions—such as domestic investments—to avoid tariffs and bring jobs and revenue to the U.S.The Financial Times reported that the Commerce Department began issuing H20 export licenses on Friday, just two days after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump. The US official confirmed that licenses for AMD's China chip have also been issued.Nvidia did not deny the arrangement, stating only, “We follow rules the US government sets for our participation in worldwide markets.”While the US government has approved the sale of H20 AI chips to China, some experts have reportedly expressed concerns.It is being argued that H20 AI chips are a “potent accelerator of China’s frontier AI capabilities” and would ultimately be used by the Chinese military. However, Nvidia has refuted these claims, saying that they are “misguided”.“While we haven’t shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide. America cannot repeat 5G and lose telecommunication leadership. America’s AI tech stack can be the world’s standard if we race,” Nvidia said on Saturday.","N Nvidia and AMD have received approval to sell their specially designed AI chips in China, but reportedly with an unusual condition.

Why Mahindra Group CEO and MD Anish Shah said no to his boss Anand Mahindra



Leadership beyond power



Mahindra Group CEO and MD Anish Shah has shared that how saying ‘no’ to Mahindra group chairman Anand Mahindra taught him. Speaking to news agency PTI in an interview, Shah revealed that eleven years ago, just a month after joining the Mahindra Group, he did something only few people would dare. Shah revealed that he said ‘no’ to a proposal backed by his boss Anand Mahindra. Shah emphasised that moment became a defining lesson in his leadership and taught him the value constructive dissent .Anish Shah told PTI, that he joined the Mahindra Group as Head of Group Strategy. When asked for his opinion on a proposal set to go before the board the next day, he reviewed it and responded candidly: “I saw that and said I wouldn’t do this. And here’s why.”Instead of rejecting Anish Shah’s point of view, Anand Mahindra invited him to present his rationale directly to the board. The next day, when Shah explained his viewpoint, the board ultimately rejected the proposal, validating his perspective.Now CEO and MD of the Mahindra Group since April 2021, Shah reflects on that moment as a powerful example of the company’s open culture. “To me, I would take a ‘no’ as a gift,” Shah said. “It’s not easy for someone three levels below to speak up. That’s sometimes where the best ideas come from.”Shah also gives credit to his boss Anand Mahindra for creating an environment where diverse views are welcomed, and decisions are made based on merit and not on hierarchy.Shah also challenged the common misconception that CEOs lead through authority alone. “A good leader gets things done because others want to do it, not because they have to,” he explained.Shah also stressed on the fact that empowerment must extend beyond senior leadership, reaching those closest to customers — the people best positioned to innovate.","Mahindra Group CEO and MD Anish Shah revealed that he said 'no' to a proposal backed by his boss Anand Mahindra.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg transformed a legacy neighbourhood



Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is in news not only because of his aggressive AI talent hiring but also because of his Palo Alto property. Zuckerberg has quietly amassed more than $110 million worth of real estate in Palo Alto’s upscale Crescent Park neighborhood. As reported by New York Times, after purchasing the property Zuckerberg transformed the place which is not being appreciated by his neighbours. As per the report, the Meta CEO acquired almost 11 homes across two streets which raised alarms locals who say that the presence of the billionaire in the area has disrupted its peace and has also strained the availability of house. “No neighborhood wants to be occupied,” said longtime resident Michael Kieschnick. “But that’s exactly what they’ve done.”According to the report, Mark Zuckerberg along with his wife Priscilla Chan and their three daughters, moved to Crescent Park 14 years ago and since then they turned five of their homes into a sprawling compound. Zuckerberg’s house includes a main residence and guest houses, gardens and a hydrofloor-covered swimming pool, a pickleball court and a seven-foot statue of Chan in a silver robe and an extensive surveillance systems that reportedly overlook neighbouring properties.As per the report, the main issue of the neighbours is the extensive and years-long construction projects on the properties. Building permits reveal a vast 7,000-square-foot subterranean space, which neighbours have dubbed ""bunkers"" or ""bat caves."" The constant noise, heavy equipment, and traffic have frayed nerves and led to accusations that the city has turned a blind eye to the disruption.Local council member Greer Stone criticised Mark Zuckerberg’s approach, “He’s been finding loopholes around our local laws and zoning ordinances. We should never be a gated, gilded city on a hill where people don’t know their neighbours.”Crescent Park has long been home to Stanford professors, doctors, and tech executives — including Steve Jobs, who once lived nearby. Residents recall block parties, children playing in gardens, and a strong sense of community. Now, many say that spirit has faded.“Billionaires everywhere are used to just making their own rules,” Kieschnick added. “Zuckerberg and Chan are not unique — except that they’re our neighbours.”",Mark Zuckerberg has quietly amassed more than $110 million worth of real estate in Palo Alto’s upscale Crescent Park neighborhood.

What is Online Safety Act

Lava Blaze Dragon 5G: Clean, Simple and Surprising

Wikimedia Foundation, the operator of Wikipedia, has lost a legal challenge against the UK’s Online Safety Act , reports news agency Reuters. The act sets strict rules for online platforms, inviting criticism for allegedly limiting free speech. As per the report, the Wikimedia Foundation appealed at London’s High Court, arguing that the rules could put Wikipedia in the toughest category of regulation, known as Category 1. This category would require verifying the identities of Wikipedia’s users and contributors, something the foundation said would force it to limit access for many UK users.Reuters says that Judge Jeremy Johnson rejected the case but said the Wikimedia Foundation could challenge it again if UK regulator Ofcom wrongly decides Wikipedia is a Category 1 service. He also said his decision was not permission for Ofcom or the UK government to create rules that would seriously harm Wikipedia’s operations.The decision ""does not give Ofcom and the Secretary of State a green light to implement a regime that would significantly impede Wikipedia's operations,"" the judge stated.The Wikimedia Foundation said it was disappointed the ruling did not give immediate protection for Wikipedia but welcomed the judge’s comments stressing Ofcom’s and the government’s duty to protect the site.The UK’s Department for Science, Innovation and Technology called the ruling a step forward in making the internet safer. Ofcom said it would continue its work on how services are categorised.The Online Safety Act was passed in 2023. It is being rolled out this year. The law aims to make the internet safer — especially for children — by setting clear rules for online platforms, social media sites, and other digital services. It mandates online platforms to take steps to stop children from seeing things like sexual content, extreme violence, or content encouraging self-harm.However, the act has been criticised by Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter) and free speech groups, who say the rules are too broad and risk removing legal content. The government says the law is meant to protect children and remove illegal material, with Technology Secretary Peter Kyle arguing that opponents of the law are “on the side of predators.”","Wikimedia Foundation lost a legal challenge against the UK's Online Safety Act.

How Amazon’s ad power is growing despite connected TV market facing slower growth

The shares of digital ad company The Trade Desk have recently suffered a record-breaking decline. Despite that, Jeff Green , the CEO of the company, has claimed thatHowever, analysts have cited competition from Amazon as a key factor for The Trade Desk after the company’s share prices went down nearly 40% last week. According to a report by Business Insider, Green made his remarks during the company's latest earnings call while responding to the analyst's concerns, which largely attributed the company’s stock drop to Amazon. He argued that The Trade Desk plays a crucial role as a neutral seller of advertising, unlike Amazon, which sells its own ads on platforms like Prime Video. He also suggested that Amazon may one day allow companies like his to sell ads on Prime Video.Green added.It's important to note that The Trade Desk, which helps companies target ads across the web, had beaten earnings expectations. However, analysts also pointed to the departure of the adtech company's CFO as a contributing factor to the stock's performance.As per the report, analysts are split on The Trade Desk CEO Green’s positive outlook amid fierce competition in the connected TV ad market from Amazon, Netflix, and Disney+. Amazon’s rapid ad growth, which is fueled by a Roku deal and NBA content, poses a significant threat, with some calling Green “in denial” and downgrading the stock.Meanwhile, others remained positive, noting The Trade Desk’s expanding partnerships with Netflix, Roku, and Spotify, along with growth in retail media and global markets.To compare, Amazon’s ad business has surged since making ads the default on Prime Video. The company has been using its vast scale, shopping-based targeting, and growing live sports content. Its rise is squeezing all but the top TV players, with Morgan Stanley projecting it could overtake YouTube as the US smart TV ad leader by 2027.Amazon’s Q2 ad revenue jumped 22% to $15.7 billion, exceeding expectations, and it’s major deals with rival streamers to boost its dominance.

How AGI is a point of contention between OpenAI and Microsoft

Artificial General Intelligence – AGI has been a point of contention between OpenAI and Microsoft. While Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has publicly expressed his doubts over the technology, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and executives were earlier reported to be close to claim that their AI tool has reached the level. Now, Altman has said that the word AGI is “losing its relevance,” reports CNBC. The CEO was asked whether the company’s latest GPT-5 model moves the world any closer to achieving AGI during CNBC’s “Squawk Box” last week. Sam Altman replied saying “I think it’s not a super useful term”.Sam Altman said the challenge with AGI is that different companies and people define it in different ways. One definition, he explained, is an AI that can do “a significant amount of the work in the world.” But this has problems, as the type of work people do keeps changing.“I think the point of all of this is it doesn’t really matter and it’s just this continuing exponential of model capability that we’ll rely on for more and more things,” he added.According to OpenAI AGI is a ""highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work,"" a milestone Altman suggests is ""just around the corner.""This contrasts sharply with Microsoft’s Satya Nadella's more critical stance. In a February tech podcast, Nadella dismissed self-proclaimed AGI milestones as ""nonsensical benchmark hacking"". The remark then reportedly surprised some OpenAI officials who once viewed him as an ""AGI believer.""Despite the internal tension, representatives from both companies had offered a unified front. “We have a long-term, productive partnership that has delivered amazing AI tools for everyone. Talks are ongoing, and we are optimistic we will continue to build together for years to come,” reads a statement.",OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says the word AGI is “losing its relevance” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has publicly expressed his doubts over the technology.

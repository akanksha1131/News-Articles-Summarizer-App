Samsung India has partnered with its subsidiary, NeuroLogica , to launch a new portfolio of mobile CT (Computed Tomography) products. The new lineup, which includes the CereTom Elite , OmniTom Elite, OmniTom Elite PCD, and BodyTom 32/64 , is designed to bring advanced diagnostic imaging to patients in a variety of settings, including ICUs, operating rooms, and emergency departments. The products aim to make advanced imaging more accessible throughout India, particularly in underserved regions, by offering mobile, AI-powered systems. This approach will enable healthcare providers to deliver quality care anywhere, without requiring expensive infrastructure overhauls.The CereTom Elite is an 8-slice CT scanner with a 32cm patient opening and 25cm FOV, designed for efficient imaging and powered by a 2-hour battery. On the other hand, the OmniTom Elite delivers 0.125mm x 80 slice reconstruction in Ultra High Resolution mode, featuring a 40cm patient opening and 30cm FOV with a 1.5-hour battery. It claims to have improved neurosurgical workflows by reducing procedures like deep brain stimulation from 8–10 hours to as little as 2, while also enabling immediate post-operative scans directly in the operating room.This allows surgeons to quickly detect complications, such as haemorrhage, and take corrective action, thereby improving safety and reducing the need for revision surgeries. The OmniTom Elite PCD further advances imaging with photon-counting detector technology, enhancing image quality, differentiation, and artefact reduction.Meanwhile, the BodyTom 32/64 offers full-body imaging with 32/64-slice capability, an 85cm patient opening, 60cm FOV, and a lithium polymer battery that supports up to 12 hours in standby mode.Beyond efficiency, Samsung’s mobile CT platforms incorporate AI-assisted imaging and integrate seamlessly with hospital PACS and EMR systems, ensuring faster, more accurate diagnoses while supporting digital health transformation.Their applications span a wide range of clinical scenarios, from intraoperative CT in neurosurgery and rapid imaging in emergency medicine, to CT-guided procedures in interventional radiology, oncological support for brachytherapy and tumour resection, and safe, efficient imaging for paediatric care.",CereTom Elite is an 8-slice CT scanner with a 32cm patient opening and 25cm FOV.

China’s biggest online shopping website Temu resumes direct shipping to US: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chinas-biggest-online-shopping-website-temu-resumes-direct-shipping-to-us-report/articleshow/123530272.cms,"Tariffs cut but exemptions ending soon

Nothing Headphones (1) Review: Style Meets Sound

China’s biggest online shopping website Temu has resumed direct shipments of goods from Chinese factories to the US. According to a Financial Times report, the e-commerce platform has also increased its advertising spending in the US after a trade deal between Washington and Beijing. Temu had suspended the service in May this year. The report says that multiple Temu suppliers, partners and investors have restored so-called fully managed shipments — where it handles most of the logistics and customs formalities on behalf of suppliers — in July.In April, Trump administration had announced the cancellation of the de minimis exemption, which allowed goods worth under $800 from China to enter the US duty-free. The order meant duties of more than 100% on such shipments.The change then hit Temu hard, as its rapid growth was partly driven by shipping billions of dollars of small packages tax-free. After Trump’s order, Temu had said that it would fulfill US orders from American suppliers.Talks between Washington and Beijing in May led to a temporary reduction in tariffs. The US agreed to cut extra duties on Chinese goods to 30% for 90 days, and lowered the rate for small packages from China to 54%. The truce was extended for another 90 days this month.However, from August 29, the US will end de minimis exemptions for all countries, meaning all low-cost parcels will face tariffs. Last year, US Customs and Border Protection cleared 1.3 billion de minimis packages worth $64.6 billion.The report quotes Sheng Lu, a fashion industry professor at the University of Delaware who said “Because of across-the-board tariff increases . . . even regular brands and retailers have to increase their price substantially. This will reduce the price pressure facing Temu and Shein.”",China’s biggest online shopping website Temu has resumed direct shipments of goods from Chinese factories to the US.

AT&T’s $23 billion deal for EchoStar’s spectrum licenses: Details and what it means for users







AT&T has reached an agreement to acquire wireless spectrum licenses from EchoStar in a nearly $23 billion deal. This deal will also improve a long-term wholesale network services agreement between the two companies. Under the new arrangement, AT&T will become the primary network services partner for EchoStar, allowing it to operate as a hybrid mobile network operator for its Boost Mobile brand. “This acquisition bolsters and expands our spectrum portfolio while enhancing customers’ 5G wireless and home internet experience in even more markets,” said John Stankey, Chairman and CEO of AT&T said in a blog post.AT&T has confirmed that it will acquire nearly 30 MHz of nationwide 3.45 GHz mid-band spectrum and 20 MHz of nationwide 600 MHz low-band spectrum in an all-cash transaction valued at about $23 billion, subject to adjustments.The licenses that will cover over 400 markets across the US are expected to strengthen AT&T’s spectrum holdings in both low-band and mid-band frequencies. The company plans to begin deploying the mid-band licenses, which are compatible with its 5G network, as soon as possible.Deployment of the mid-band and low-band licenses is expected to take place within the multi-year capital investment guidance shared in AT&T’s second-quarter 2025 earnings release. AT&T also confirmed that its fibre expansion targets remain unchanged. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2026, pending regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.The acquired licenses are expected to expand AT&T’s 5G coverage and capacity, supporting greater reliability and higher data speeds. When combined with AT&T’s fibre internet network, the spectrum is intended to help meet increasing demand for data and enable upcoming use cases, including applications in AI, autonomous vehicles, and advanced robotics.AT&T also expects to expand the availability of its fixed wireless home internet service, AT&T Internet Air, particularly in areas where the company plans to deploy fibre in the coming days. The spectrum licenses will allow the company to transition customers from legacy copper-based services to newer technologies such as AT&T Internet Air and AT&T Phone – Advanced.In addition, the acquisition is expected to support long-term growth and efficiencies. AT&T anticipates that the added spectrum will reduce the need for new cell site construction to increase network capacity, lowering capital costs over time.",AT&T has reached an agreement to acquire wireless spectrum licenses from EchoStar in a nearly $23 billion deal.

A call for guardrails and awareness



As part of a new revelation about AI, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has now raised alarms about the growing psychological phenomenon which he calls ‘AI psychosis’. For those unaware, it is a condition where individuals start to lose touch with real life because of excessive interaction with artificial intelligence systems. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at a recent interview, Suleyman explained AI psychosis as a “real and emerging risk” which can easily affect vulnerable individuals who become deeply immersed in conversations with AI agents. The condition will mainly affect the individuals whose interactions blur the line between human and machine.As per the Microsoft AI CEO, AI psychosis is a state of mind in which individuals start to anthropomorphize AI, attributing emotions, intentions, or consciousness to systems that are fundamentally non-human. ""It disconnects people from reality, fraying fragile social bonds and structures, distorting pressing moral priorities,"" he said.The condition can lead to delusional thinking here individuals feel that AI is sentiment or has some personal relationships with them. Along with this, it can also cause emotional dependency to users who are either isolated or mentally fragile. Lastly, AI psychosis can also lead to distorted perception of reality as users rely a lot of AI for validation, companionship and also decision-making.Suleyman also stressed on that fact that while AI can be helpful and engaging but it is definitely not a substitute for human or clinical support.As per Business Insider, Suleyman also has asked the tech industry to take this risk quite seriously and also help in implementing some ethical guardrails, which include:* Clear disclaimers about AI’s limitations* Monitoring for signs of unhealthy usage patterns* Collaboration with mental health professionals to study and mitigate risksAlong with this, Suleyman also urged the regulators and educators to raise public awareness as AI is slowly becoming more embedded in the daily life in the form of personal assistant and therapeutic chatbots.""AI companions are a completely new category, and we urgently need to start talking about the guardrails we put in place to protect people and ensure this amazing technology can do its job of delivering immense value to the world,"" Suleyman added.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has now raised alarms about the growing psychological phenomenon which he calls ‘AI psychosis’ For those unaware, it is a condition where individuals start to lose touch with real life because of excessive interaction with artificial intelligence systems.

Catamaran’s strategic pivot



In an assessment of the Indian startup ecosystem , Catamaran Ventures LLP, the family office of Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy , has raised concerns over the inflated startup valuations and also revealed that many startups are still being sold at 30 to 40% discount. Catamaran president, Deepak Padaki told Bloomberg that many startups lack clear paths to profitability and are being offloaded by funds which leads to end of their investment cycles. “Funds that invested in these companies want to sell their investments because they are reaching the end of their fund terms,” Padaki said, adding that Catamaran is steering clear of turnaround-heavy deals.India’s startup scene, once buoyed by pandemic-era funding surges that peaked at $38.5 billion in 2021, has seen a sharp correction. While deal activity has rebounded slightly in 2024 to $13.7 billion, investors are now scrutinizing growth metrics and profitability more rigorously.High-profile examples like Oyo Hotels , once valued at $10 billion, illustrate the volatility. The company has faced stiff competition and delayed its IPO multiple times, despite a partial recovery.The warning reveals the new reality of India startup ecosystem. As per the family office, many VC firms are focusing on making a secure exit and are also willing to offload their stakes at a considerable loss. This change indicate that the investors have shifted their focus from aggressive growth at any cost to only profitability.Catamaran which manages $1.3 billion for Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy and also holds stakes in companies like SpaceX and National Stock Exchange of India is now shifting its focus towards manufacturing and supply chain-driven enterprises. The company is also helping some small and medium businesses in scaling their operations in various sectors such as aerospace, EVs, electronics and medical devices.Panaji stressed on the fact that India has a small window to capitalise on its cost effective nature. “As a family office with the potential to deploy more patient capital, manufacturing fits aptly with what we want to do,” he said.","Catamaran Ventures LLP, the family office of Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy has raised concerns over the inflated startup valuations.

Chinese analyst calls Donald Trump's remarks as bluff

US President Donald Trump once again warned that the United States would impose steeper tariffs on China if it curbed exports of rare-earth magnets, a move that could jeopardize a fragile trade truce between the world's two largest economies. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, Donald Trump stated, “They have to give us magnets, if they don’t give us magnets, then we have to charge them 200% tariffs or something.”The President also revealed a key point of leverage the US holds over Beijing: Airplane parts. ""200 of their planes were unable to fly because we were not giving them Boeing parts purposely because they weren’t giving us magnets,"" Trump claimed. This comes as Boeing is reportedly working toward a deal to sell as many as 500 aircraft to China, underscoring the role of aerospace in the trade negotiations.The recent surge in China's rare-earth magnet exports to the U.S. preceded the president's warning. According to the latest government data, shipments to the U.S. in June surged by 660% from the previous month and continued to rise in July.China holds a dominant position in the global supply chain for these critical materials, controlling about 90% of the world's rare-earth magnet production and a similar share of the refining process. This gives Beijing significant leverage in trade talks, as U.S. industries—including automotive, electronics, and renewable energy—rely heavily on these magnets.Henry Wang, president of the Center for China & Globalization, a Beijing-based think tank, characterized Trump's remarks as a bluff. In a conversation with CNBC, Wang said, ""He always talks big on tariffs or potential punishment, but we shouldn’t get caught up in the rhetoric."" He added that the true measure of progress will be both sides' efforts to implement existing agreements.The current temporary trade truce, which included an agreement to ease controls on Chinese rare-earth exports and roll back some American tech restrictions, is set to expire in mid-November. The deal lowered tariffs on each other’s goods to around 55% for the U.S. and 32% for China.November deadline for ChinaWith the November deadline looming, the fate of the trade truce will likely depend on continued engagement between the two nations.

Nvidia CEO calls robotics a major revenue opportunity

AI chip giant Nvidia has unveiled a powerful new ""brain"" for robots, the Jetson Thor module. With a dramatic launch video featuring a humanoid robot receiving a new ""brain"" from Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang , the company declared that robots worldwide are ""about to get a lot smarter."" The new Jetson Thor is designed to boost a wide range of robots, from humanoids to warehouse automatons. It boasts a staggering 7.5 times more AI computing power than its predecessor, the Orin module, along with 3.1 times the CPU performance and double the memory. This substantial leap in power is aimed at enabling robots to handle complex tasks more effectively and operate with greater autonomy.The clip then shows multiple humanoid robots opening the box to find the new device that is said to be designed to make it a lot cleverer.In a blog post, Nvidia said that beyond commercial applications, researchers at top institutions like Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, and the University of Zurich will also be deploying Thor to advance perception, navigation, and sensor fusion in their robotics research. Other tech giants, including Amazon and Meta, are already users of the Jetson chip series, and companies like OpenAI are reportedly evaluating the new modules.While robotics currently represents only a small fraction of Nvidia's total revenue, CEO Jensen Huang has highlighted it as the company's biggest growth opportunity for the coming years.Thor is purpose-built for real-time robotics. It can process high-bandwidth data from multiple sensors with ultra-low latency, which is crucial for a robot's perception and decision-making. A key feature is its ability to run large generative AI and transformer-based models directly on the device, reducing a robot's dependence on cloud connectivity for complex calculations.Two prominent robotics companies are reported to be already set to integrate Thor into their machines. According to a report in Digital Trends, Boston Dynamics is using it to enhance the perception and manipulation skills of its Atlas humanoid robot, allowing it to process complex multimodal AI models in real time. Similarly, Agility Robotics is adopting Thor for its 6th-generation Digit robot to improve its real-time perception and efficiency in warehouse settings.The Jetson AGX Thor developer kit is now available starting at $3,499.","Jetson Thor boasts 7.5 times more AI computing power than its predecessor, the Orin module, along with 3.1 times the CPU performance and double the memory.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos pens emotional note on the demise of his mother



Her adulthood started a little bit early when she became my mom at the tender age of 17. That couldn’t have been easy, but she made it all work. She pounced on the job of loving me with ferocity, brought my amazing dad onto the team a few years later, and then added my sister and brother to her list of people to love, guard, and nourish. For the rest of her life, that list of people to love never stopped growing. She always gave so much more than she ever asked for.

After a long fight with Lewy Body Dementia, she passed away today, surrounded by so many of us who loved her — her kids, grandkids, and my dad. I know she felt our love in those final moments. We were all so lucky to be in her life. I hold her safe in my heart forever.

December 29, 1946 - August 14, 2025

I love you, mom.

Google’s AI-powered search feature has come under fire after the demise of Amazon founderJeff Bezos’s mother Jacklyn Gise Bezos. 78-year old Jacklyn Gise Bezos passed away on August 14. Jacklyn had been living with Lewy body dementia, a brain disorder, for five years after being diagnosed in 2020. According to an online report, the Google AI Overview feature completely fabricated a false account of Jeff Bezos ’ mother’s funeral. The incident has once again raised questions over the reliability of generative AI .As reported by the New York Post, a fake AI-generated summary claimed that the funeral of Bezos’ mother was attended by celebrities including Elon Musk, Opra Winfrey and the event featured a “space-themed eulogy” referencing Blue Origin rockets. Along with this, the summary also claimed that popular singer Eminem also performed at the funeral. However, none of these details are true.As per the report, the error appeared in Google’s experimental AI Overview feature. For those unaware, the feature is designed to create and summarise complex queries with the help of generative responses. The tool is still in testing phase and this incident clearly highlights the risks of hallucinations—a known issue where AI systems generate plausible-sounding but entirely false information.Google has acknowledged the issue and said that sometimes the system produce inaccurate and misleading summaries. The company also said that it is working on improving safeguards.Jeff Bezos shared an emotional post on Meta-owned Instagram, paying tribute to his mother. He wrote:","Jeff Bezos’s mother Jacklyn Gise Bezos passed away on August 14.

It supports conversations in both Arabic and English and can understand several Arabic dialects, including Egyptian and Lebanese. For now, Humain Chat is available only in Saudi Arabia.The report quotes Humain CEO Tareq Amin saying the launch was a “historic milestone in our mission to build sovereign AI that is both technically advanced and culturally authentic,” adding that the app was developed in Saudi Arabia by Saudi talent. The project involved 120 AI specialists, half of them were women.Humain took over Allam from the Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA), a government agency that had been working on the model with IBM. Around 95 SDAIA employees joined Humain this year as part of the transition.The company said Allam was trained with data and safeguards that reflect the region’s culture and values. Such controls may also allow authorities to regulate what kind of information is shared. The model competes with Falcon Arabic, a similar AI system developed by Abu Dhabi’s Falcon research unit.The launch comes as many global tech firms question whether building advanced AI models from scratch is sustainable. Regional models like Allam and Falcon, however, are seen as valuable because they deliver stronger Arabic-language capabilities and support local research, though they do not aim to rival larger models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.Humain, owned by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, was formally unveiled in May 2024, just a day before US President Donald Trump’s visit to the kingdom. During that visit, the firm secured semiconductor supplies from Nvidia and AMD for a large-scale data center project.Amin said Humain plans to build 1.9 gigawatts of data centers by 2030. The company is also expanding into ads, gaming, and cloud computing, and has announced plans for a $10 billion venture capital fund to back its AI ambitions.","Saudi Arabia's leading AI Humain has announced a conversational AI chatbot built on the Allam large language model.

Silicon valley’s low-salary club



Amazon founder Jeff Bezos once revealed that he asked the company’s broad not to give him any compensation as he already owned the company and did not needed any more incentive to stay motivated. In an interview at The New York Times DealBook Summit in 2024, Bezos said, “I just didn’t feel good about taking more… I just felt how could I possibly need more incentive?”. Bezos received a $80,000 per year during his tenure as the CEO of Amazon. He mentioned that he was proud of his decision and framed it as the typical of owner-operators. In the principle of owner-operators, the founders grow their wealth by increasing the value of their existing equity and not by accumulating more.In the same interview, Jeff Bezos also challenged the traditional measures of wealth. Amazon founder suggested that personal net worth is hold lesser meaning as compared to the wealth created by others. “Somebody needs to make a list where they rank people by how much wealth they’ve created for other people,” he said. “Amazon’s market cap is $2.3 trillion today… I’ve created something like $2.1 trillion of wealth for other people.”The no compensation approach of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos places him on the list of other tech leaders who went ahead with symbolic or minimal salaries. Meta CEO mark Zuckerberg followed the same policy of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs when it comes to drawing salary. Since, 2013, Zuckerberg has drawn only $1 annually as salary. Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway also took flat $100,000 salary with no stock-based bonuses for a long time.These choices reflect a broader ethos in Silicon Valley: that leadership is about value creation, not personal enrichment.","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos once revealed that he asked the company’s broad not to give him any compensation as he already owned the company.

Two delays, two days



A critical mission and the mounting pressure



Elon Musk’s SpaceX has once again cancelled its tenth Starship flight. The tenth Starship flight was scheduled to take place on Sunday evening (August 24). The flight was to take off from the company’s Starbase facility in South Texas, but it was canceled roughly half an hour before the scheduled launch window opened. The company then announced that they will again try the launch on August 25 at 6:30 p.m. CT. However, once again, SpaceX had to postpone the launch citing storm cloud and lightning risks. This delay marks another setback for the company and its mission to the Moon and Mars.The Starship 10th flight was scheduled to for Monday evening at 7:30 p.m. local time, but was called off just before liftoff. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) SpaceX wrote, “Standing down from today’s flight test attempt due to weather. Starship team is determining the next best available opportunity to fly”.SpaceX CEO Elon Musk also posted on X about the cancellation of tenth Starship flight. “Launch called off for tonight due to anvil clouds over launch site (lightning risk).”The second cancellation of the Starship flight was followed by the failed attempt on Sunday. On Sunday, the company called off the launch due to some ground-side liquid oxygen leak which disrupted the fuelling operations. Musk described the issue as a “critical safety concern” and said the team was working swiftly to resolve it.The company is still optimistic about the launch and has announced that it will make another attempt on Tuesday.The tenth Starship flight which now stands cancelled was seen as a pivotal motor for Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The first two Starship flights launched in 2025 ended in explosions with minutes and third failed to deploy satellites and went out of control. The fourth Starship flight exploded during the fuelling test stand in June this year.The stakes for this mission were high, with SpaceX aiming to demonstrate Starship’s ability to perform mid-flight maneuvers and attempt a controlled offshore landing of its Super Heavy booster. Unlike the earlier flights, this Starship rocket focused on refining flight dynamics.","The tenth Starship flight was scheduled to take place on Sunday evening (August 24) The flight was to take off from the company’s Starbase facility in South Texas.

12,000 new hires signal massive AI push, and Cook says he’s never felt so excited



Apple CEO Tim Cook delivered a rare company-wide rallying cry earlier this month, telling employees that artificial intelligence represents the company's next major opportunity and warning that failing to embrace AI tools would leave the tech giant behind competitors.Speaking to staff at Apple's Cupertino headquarters for an hour-long all-hands meeting, Cook declared the AI revolution ""as big or bigger"" than the internet, smartphones, and cloud computing. ""Apple must do this. Apple will do this. This is sort of ours to grab,"" Cook told employees, according to Bloomberg sources familiar with the meeting.The CEO urged employees to rapidly integrate AI into their daily work and future product development. ""All of us are using AI in a significant way already, and we must use it as a company as well,"" Cook emphasized. ""To not do so would be to be left behind, and we can't do that.""Cook acknowledged Apple's late entry into artificial intelligence, with Apple Intelligence debuting months behind competitors like ChatGPT and Google's AI tools. However, he drew parallels to Apple's historical pattern of arriving late but defining entire product categories.""We've rarely been first,"" Cook told staff. ""There was a PC before the Mac; there was a smartphone before the iPhone."" But Apple created the ""modern"" versions of those categories, he emphasized, expressing similar confidence about AI's potential.Senior VP Craig Federighi revealed Apple scrapped plans for a hybrid Siri system after realizing it wouldn't achieve company quality standards. The new approach involves rebuilding Siri entirely on large language models, with Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell now leading the effort. ""There is no project people are taking more seriously,"" Federighi said.Cook revealed Apple hired 12,000 new workers in the past year, with 40% joining research and development to accelerate AI initiatives. The company is developing specialized cloud-computing chips code-named Baltra and establishing an AI server facility in Houston to support its growing artificial intelligence infrastructure, Bloomberg has previously reported.The CEO also addressed mounting regulatory pressures and potential Trump administration tariffs that could create a $1.1 billion quarterly headwind. ""We need to continue to push on the intention of the regulation,"" Cook said, criticizing rules that ""destroy the user experience and user privacy and security."" Despite these challenges, he expressed extraordinary optimism: ""I have never felt so much excitement and so much energy before as right now.""","Apple CEO Tim Cook told employees artificial intelligence is the company's next major opportunity.

Donald Trump's 50% tariff on India go into effect August 27: Why and how prices of 'made-in-India' Apple iPhones will not go up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trumps-50-tariff-on-india-go-into-effect-august-27-why-and-how-prices-of-made-in-india-apple-iphones-will-not-go-up/articleshow/123514390.cms,"PM Modi's Defiant 'MAKE IN INDIA' Call Hours Before Trump's Secondary Tariffs Hit India | Watch

Apple’s iPhone production in India safe under current exemptions



Potential future impact on iPhone pricing



President Donald Trump's 50% tariff on Indian goods takes effect August 27, adding to the existing 25% ""reciprocal"" tariffs imposed in August. However, Apple's iPhone exports from India to the US will remain largely unaffected due to existing exemptions for semiconductor-powered devices. Apple's semiconductor-powered devices, including iPhones, are exempt from Trump's tariffs under a separate tariff authority that has not yet been unveiled. The Trump administration exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronics from reciprocal tariffs in April, providing major relief to companies like Apple and Nvidia.India now supplies 71% of all iPhones sold in the US market between April and June, up from 31% a year earlier. Apple said during its most recent earnings call that it made the majority of its US-bound iPhones in India.The US Commerce Department is currently probing sectors deemed vital to national security, such as semiconductors, under Section 232 in the Trade Expansion Act. Until those reviews are complete, there will be no levies on smartphone exports to the US, including iPhones made in India.Apple began expanding its supply chain beyond China following COVID-19 disruptions but started specifically concentrating US iPhone manufacturing in India to avoid Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods. India currently accounts for more than a fifth of global iPhone production and has already surpassed China to become the top supplier of the device to the US market.However, the exemptions remain temporary and could change. Trump has said no one is ""getting off the hook,"" and his administration is working on specific semiconductor levies that could impact Apple devices.India supplied 71% of all iPhones sold in the U.S. market between April and June, up from 31% a year earlier, driven by a corresponding decline in shipments from China, according to Counterpoint Research. Apple exported $3.2 billion-worth iPhones from India between March and May 2025, with an average of 97 per cent heading to the US market.Analysts warn that the likelihood of a negotiated settlement is fading and the final effective tariff of 50% cannot be ruled out. A higher US tariff on India — if the exemptions end — could potentially make locally-assembled iPhones globally pricey compared to Apple products made in Vietnam or China.While Apple might be able to dodge tariffs on goods out of India currently, the company isn't completely out of the woods. The Trump administration is expected to unveil results of its Section 232 investigation into semiconductor tariffs , which could impact everything from smartphones to automobiles.Apple would rather absorb higher costs for iPhones sold in the United States than slam the brakes on its India expansion, with sales largely operator-driven and sold as part of plans, potentially adding just a few dollars to monthly plans rather than an upfront blow to consumers.",President Donald Trump's 50% tariff on Indian goods takes effect August 27.

“The statistics ministry has begun scraping prices from e-commerce websites in 12 cities with populations above 2.5 million and is in talks with platforms to access data directly.”

What this means for users



Boat Stone Arc Pro+: This Speaker Has it All

The government has decided to begin collecting price data directly from e-commerce companies like Amazon and Flipkart to revamp its benchmark inflation index . A report citing the head of the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation ( MoSPI ) claimed that this move is aimed at capturing shifting consumption habits and making the retail inflation data more accurate and robust. By integrating online prices, the government will account for the rising share of e-commerce in household spending. The move aligns with a global trend, as other countries, including the US and South Korea, have also started to incorporate online and scanner data into their inflation measures. A report by the news agency Reuters cited a private study to claim that India had around 270 million online shoppers in 2024, while this number is expected to rise by 22% each year.In an interview with Reuters, Saurabh Garg, secretary of MoSPI, said:The government has also asked e-commerce companies to provide weekly average prices of goods, which will be verified against a wider dataset to prevent distortions, the report added.E-commerce now makes up a significant portion of Indian household spending. As per the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES), this spending is significant enough to be included in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket, Garg said to Reuters. He also noted that the goal is to make the index more representative and up-to-date.When the new CPI series launches early next year, it will use extra data sources and adjust weightages since a recent survey showed Indians now spend a smaller share of their budget on food. The update will also add online data for things like airfares and streaming services, as these have become major spending areas.Apart from the changes in sources and items in the new CPI, multiple other major statistical upgrades are planned in the next two years, Garg added. This includes a new GDP series with an updated base year of 2022-23, he noted.Earlier this year, the government expanded its monthly employment survey sample to improve accuracy and credibility, aligning it with global standards. It is also developing a new quarterly Index of Services Production (ISP) that will enhance the government's capability to track the services sector better. This sector makes up over half of India’s GDP, and the rollout of the new index is planned for mid-next year.i te","The government has decided to begin collecting price data directly from e-commerce companies like Amazon and Flipkart to revamp its benchmark inflation index.

Jad Tarifi , a pioneer of artificial intelligence and the founder of Google 's first generative AI team, has issued a stark warning to the next generation of professionals: AI's rapid advancement may soon make advanced degrees in law and medicine an exercise in futility.In an interview with Business Insider, Tarifi -- who left Google in 2021 to start his own company, Integral AI -- argued that as AI capabilities improve, the traditional paths to becoming a doctor or lawyer could become obsolete. His perspective challenges the common belief that advanced degrees are a guaranteed way to secure a future in a job market increasingly influenced by technology.Tarifi believes that the traditional medical and legal educational models are fundamentally flawed for the age of AI. ""In the current medical system, what you learn in medical school is so outdated and based on memorization,"" he said. He sees years of seeking these degrees as ""throwing away"" a significant portion of one's life.Tarifi also advised caution for those considering a PhD in AI itself. He explained that the technology is evolving so fast that by the time a person completes a multi-year doctoral program, the problems they set out to solve will likely already be addressed. He offered an alternative to the traditional path, suggesting that students should either focus on very niche fields, like AI for biology, or simply not pursue a PhD at all unless they are truly ""obsessed with the field.""Instead of focusing on specialized technical skills, Tarifi believes the most valuable work is ""more internal,"" suggesting people focus on developing core human skills like emotional intelligence, meditation, and socializing with friends.","Jad Tarifi is the founder of Google's first generative AI team.

What Telegram CEO Pavel Durov said about his arrest



“One year ago, the French police detained me for 4 days because some people I’d never heard of used Telegram to coordinate crimes. Arresting a CEO of a major platform over the actions of its users was not only unprecedented — it was legally and logically absurd.

A year later, the ‘

criminal investigation

’ against me is still struggling to find anything that I or Telegram did wrong. Our moderation practices align with industry standards, and Telegram has always responded to every legally binding request from France.

Ironically, I was arrested due to the French police’s own mistake: before August 2024, they ignored French and EU laws and hadn’t sent any of their queries to Telegram via the required legal process. They could have learned the correct procedure simply by googling it or asking.

One year after this strange arrest, I still have to return to France every 14 days, with no appeal date in sight. So far, the only outcome of my arrest has been massive damage to France’s image as a free country. One thing is certain: we’ll keep fighting — and we will win ✊”

How these China-backed hackers may have targeted diplomats

Founder mode in the age of AI

A leadership style that’s catching on



Airbnb CEO Brain Chesky recently said that he is still deeply involved his company’s operations. In a recent podcast appearance Chesky revealed that he is deeply involved in personnel decisions for dozens of employees — well beyond the typical scope of a chief executive. As reported by Business Insider, in an episode of the Social Radars podcast, Cheekily revealed that he personally engage with a “concentric circle” of 40 to 50 employees at Airbnb, treating them all as his direct reports. “I skip level, I co-hire them, and I make decisions on whether or not they're working out and leave the company,” he said. “Hire, fire, promote, and manage. I co-do it with my executives. It’s a lot of work, but it’s necessary.”The remarks made by Chesky reflects in a broader philosophy called ‘founder mode’. This philosophy emphasise on the direct involvement of company founders in day-to-day operations and decision making. He also argues that this approach is very important in today’s time when AI is compelling companies to reinvent themselves.“Founder-mode companies are more likely to thrive or even survive the age of AI,” Chesky said, suggesting that proximity to the work and the workers is essential for navigating technological disruption.The Founder Mode philosophy has gained a lot of traction last year when Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham wrote an essay titled Founder Mode after taking inspiration from Chesky. Airbnb CEO feels that distancing founders from employees can kill momentum and can also slow the process of innovation.It seems that Chesky’s approach influenced other tech leaders as well. Duolingo CEO Luis von Ann recently revealed that he maintains a ‘view of everything” at his company’. On the other hand, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also echoed the principles of founder mode in a post shared on social media platform X. Musk revealed that he personally overlooked the chip deal with Samsung.“This is a critical point, as I will walk the line personally to accelerate the pace of progress,” Musk wrote, noting the fab’s proximity to his home.","Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky recently revealed that he is deeply involved in personnel decisions for dozens of employees.

""unequivocal antitrust violation.""

What Elon Musk’s companies said in their lawsuit



“In a desperate bid to protect its

smartphone monopoly

, Apple has joined forces with the company that most benefits from inhibiting competition and innovation in AI: OpenAI, a monopolist in the market for generative AI chatbots.”

“Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation. xAI will take immediate legal action.”

“This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like.”

Elon Musk-owned companies, X and xAI, have filed a lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI, accusing them of an ""anticompetitive scheme"" to restrict the growth of AI rivals. According to a report by CNBC, the recent lawsuit alleges that the two companies have ""colluded"" to maintain monopolies in the smartphone and generative AI markets. The legal complaint also accuses Apple of giving preference to OpenAI's ChatGPT by integrating it into Apple products while actively deprioritising competing AI chatbots, such as xAI's Grok, in its App Store rankings.

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has claimed Rapido as the US-based ride-hailing giant’s biggest competitor in the Indian market. Khosrowshahi stated that while Ola used to be their main rival, Rapido now holds that position. In a recently released podcast with online brokerage company Zerodha’s co-founder Nikhil Kamath, Khosrowshahi said, “Ola used to be our main competition. I'd say now the tougher competition in India is Rapido. They got into two-wheelers and three-wheelers really aggressively with a zero-commission subscription model. Very scrappy as well. Ola is now kind of a distant third.” He also highlighted India's importance for growth, calling it a ""must-win"" market for the company both now and in the coming days. With over 1.4 million drivers, including autos, two-wheelers, three-wheelers and cars, India has become Uber's third-largest market globally in terms of total trips.Khosrowshahi added.While explaining Rapido's success, Khosrowshahi said its subscription model helped drivers keep more of their earnings, which gave it early traction. However, he pointed out that Rapido was ""not making money"" and would face the challenge of proving it can grow profitably.he noted.The Uber chief also shared his views on the wider quick commerce and mobility sector , suggesting that entrepreneurs should avoid overanalysing market size.he added.Khosrowshahi, who earlier led Expedia, also said Uber views itself as afor daily life, covering rides, food, groceries, and retail delivery.When asked about exiting Zomato, he said,In 2020, the Indian division of Uber Eats was acquired by Zomato in a deal that gave Uber a stake in the food delivery company, which it later sold.Apart from this, Khosrowshahi also noted that autonomous cars arebut could take a long time to become operational in India.he noted.He even described his leadership style as collaborative, with the ability to shift to ""wartime decision-making"" when needed.he added.Khosrowshahi also mentioned that even with Uber’s scale, he aims to keep the perspective of a disruptor.he explained.","Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has claimed Rapido as the US-based ride-hailing giant’s biggest competitor in the Indian market.

Despite aiming to replace Google Search , OpenAI ’s ChatGPT has been using its Search data to respond to real-time queries, says a report by The Information. According to it, OpenAI’s AI chatbot ChatGPT relies on SerpApi , a paid web-scraping tool, to pull results from Google Search. This allows the chatbot to answer questions on fast-moving topics such as news, sports, and financial markets—areas where OpenAI’s own systems fall short.As per the report, OpenAI was previously listed as a SerpApi client, but that reference has now been removed. Other clients reportedly include Meta , Apple, and AI search startup Perplexity.The Information report comes days after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said he no longer uses Google Search due to ChatGPT’s superior search capabilities. In an interaction with The Verge, Altman said: “I legitimately cannot tell you the last time I did a Google search”.Notably, the report contradicts the AI company’s previous remarks. OpenAI had officially said that ChatGPT’s search function uses its own web crawler, Bing , and licensed publisher data. But during Google’s antitrust trial last year, ChatGPT head Nick Turley admitted that the company had asked Google for access to its search index. The request, he then said, was denied.Turley also acknowledged issues with Microsoft’s Bing, saying it had “significant quality issues” and was “at best a near-term solution.” He added: “Having access to the data that underlies Google’s index, the content or signals, would accelerate the development of our own index.”OpenAI’s ChatGPT now commands 700 million weekly users and ranks as the world's fifth-largest website. Since ChatGPT launched in late 2022, Google’s search dominance has faced growing pressure. The introduction of ChatGPT’s search feature last year, alongside rivals like Bing and Perplexity, only heightened fears that AI could chip away at Google’s core business.Adding to that, former Google engineer Abhishek Iyer had earlier shown how ChatGPT could retrieve information from dummy pages that only existed in Google’s index—further evidence of its reliance on Google Search.Still, analysts say traditional search is far from dead. Wedbush Securities’ Dan Ives has previously said that the “death of search is greatly exaggerated,” pointing to Alphabet’s strong quarterly results as proof of Google’s staying power.","OpenAI’s ChatGPT has been using Google Search data to respond to real-time queries, says a report by The Information.

Business risks raised by Intel from stake deal with US government



US-Intel stake deal

In what is being termed as an extraordinary intervention in corporate America since 2008, the US government recently announced to acquire a 10% stake in Intel. The deal was announced after Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s meeting with Donald Trump , who had demanded his resignation over his ties to Chinese firms. Now, the chipmaker has said that the deal could pose risks to its business, reports news agency Reuters. In a securities filing, Intel laid out “risk factors” of the US government stake deal, from potentially harming international sales to limiting its ability to secure future government grants.In the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, Intel warns that its non-US business could also be impacted because of the deal. The filing says that due to US government stakes in Intel, the chip company could become subject to additional regulations or restrictions such as foreign subsidy laws in other countries. Notably, sales outside the US accounted for 76% of Intel’s revenue for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024. China alone contributed 29% to the company’s total revenue.Further, the struggling chipmaker said that it is uncertain if this deal may result in other government entities trying to convert their existing grants into equity investments or if they might be unwilling to support future grants, the report says.As per the filing, the government's stake also reduces the voting influence of other stockholders which in turn may limit Intel's ability to pursue transactions that benefit shareholders.As per a previous Reuters report, the US government has agreed to buy a 9.9% stake in Intel for $8.9 billion. It will buy 433.3 million Intel shares using $5.7 billion from CHIPS Act grants and $3.2 billion from the Secure Enclave program. Intel's obligations under the CHIPS Act will be considered discharged “to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law,” barring the Secure Enclave program, the filing says.The US will pay $20.47 per share, about $4 less than the chipmaker’s closing price of $24.80. In the filing, Intel said that the shares to be issued to the US government at a discount to the current market price is dilutive to existing stockholders.","The US government has agreed to buy a 9.9% stake in Intel for $8.9 billion.

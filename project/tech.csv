How fake DMV text messages can ‘trap’ Android and iPhone users



Your Money Vanished? The Truth About Online Scams & How To Fight Back!

The FBI has warned Android and iPhone users to delete a specific type of dangerous text message immediately. The security agency noted that attacks related to these texts have surged by over 700% this month. These texts, identified as a threat originating directly from China, are targeting multiple cities and states across the US. The FBI’s confirmation follows alerts issued by various police forces nationwide. Previously, ""unpaid toll texts"" had been a common issue for American smartphone users for over a year, but this issue has seen a significant decline recently, a report claims. These new ""DMV texts"" have now replaced them and are considered ""more threatening"" by attackers, suggesting that they have improved their methods.According to a report by Guardio, the company has been monitoring a concerning rise in scam activity and “spotted a 773% surge in DMV scam texts during the first week of June,” with no indication that the trend is slowing. These scam messages redirect users to phishing websites “designed to steal people’s credit card information and make unauthorised charges.”In a statement to Forbes, the FBI has now confirmed an investigation into the DMV scam. FBI Tennessee’s Supervisory Special Agent David Palmer said that cybercriminals responsible for the unpaid toll scam have now “pivoted to the DMV scam.”He confirmed that these criminal operations are based overseas and warned that the texts can “put malware on your phone, which then can go in and steal information from your device, or collect your payment information.”Palmer also advised smartphone users that “if you don’t know who [a text] is from, don’t click the link.” The domains used are intentionally misleading. As Guardio notes, “scammers generate a new domain for almost every DMV text.The format is usually the name of a state followed by a generic domain. Sometimes they include ‘.gov’ as part of the URL to make the website appear legitimate.”Cybersecurity firm Resecurity has also warned that the volume of scam texts is expected to rise significantly in the coming weeks and months.As per the company, “just one threat actor can send up to 2,000,000 smishing messages daily,” potentially reaching “up to 60,000,000 victims per month, or 720,000,000 per year — enough to target every person in the U.S. at least twice annually.”","The FBI has warned Android and iPhone users to delete a specific type of dangerous text message.

Some locals bitter over Venice wedding



The upcoming wedding of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice has polarized the city, with some residents protesting the event while others, including city officials, embrace it. Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro expressed strong support for the couple, stating, “I want Jeff Bezos to be welcomed with open arms in Venice. Protesting against those who bring visibility and wealth to our territory is, in my opinion, a disgrace.” Brugnaro, speaking to reporters on Friday, added, “We will have to apologize to Bezos. I am ashamed of those who behave like this. I hope that Bezos comes anyway. Not all Venetians think like these protesters,"" he told protestors.At the Biennale of Architecture, a staple Venice event, sentiments aligned more with city officials. Görge Meyer, a visitor from Berlin, told CNN, “It seems ridiculous that a city that lives off tourism like Venice wouldn’t want an event like this, which will employ hundreds of people from waiters to water taxi drivers. All the guests and journalists will be staying at hotels, eating at restaurants and spending money.”Gillian Longworth McGuire, an American travel writer living in Venice, noted the city’s historical allure for high-profile weddings, saying, “Venice just doesn’t have a clear idea of what it is supposed to be sometimes. Is it a magical place carved out of a lagoon, built by merchants and fishermen, or a bachelorette party and mega wedding venue? The ethos of this city was always that it was the crossroads of culture and the world.”However, not all residents are welcoming. The “No Space for Bezos” collective hung a banner with an X over Bezos’s name on a belltower overlooking the Venice lagoon, which was removed Thursday. The group declared on Facebook, “He’s not welcome, not in Venice, not anywhere!” highlighting local resentment toward the event.","Some locals bitter over Venice wedding of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez.

Tesla may halt production of its Model Y and Cybertruck next month. The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker is planning to pause the production lines of these models for a week at its Austin factory, a report claims. This will mark at least the third such shutdown for the company within a year. The production pause is reportedly scheduled to begin the week of June 30, with manufacturing expected to resume the following week. Employees during this period can use paid time off or engage in voluntary training and cleaning activities.According to a report by Business Insider, Tesla has already informed workers that the temporary halt is intended to allow the automaker to perform necessary maintenance on its production lines. The company has also suggested that these improvements are expected to help increase overall production output, the report adds. However, Tesla did not specify which of these lines would see the enhanced output.This is not the first time Tesla halted operations at its Austin facility. The company has paused production at this factory at least twice in the past year.During a late-May production pause affecting the Cybertruck and Model Y lines, Tesla conducted voluntary training sessions that included seminars aimed at improving factory work culture, the report claims.In December 2024, Cybertruck production was stopped for three days, reportedly due to a battery supply issue. Again in April, the company scaled back production of the electric pickup and reassigned some workers.Such pauses are not uncommon in the auto industry and are often used for routine maintenance, line upgrades, or to manage inventory and supply challenges, especially during slower sales periods like holidays or summer months.Apart from this, Tesla has also been gearing up for the launch of its robotaxi service in Austin.

Human rights group, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), has filed an intent to sue Elon Musk-owned artificial intelligence startup (xAI). The group announced the legal action this week over concerns about the air pollution caused by the company’s supercomputer facility near predominantly Black communities in Memphis. The xAI data centre in Memphis , which is powered by gas turbines that emit pollution, started its operations last year, without applying for a permit at first, a report claims. Officials had previously stated an exemption allowed them to operate for up to 364 days without a permit. At a recent news conference, Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) attorney Patrick Anderson, representing the NAACP, said that no such exemption exists for turbines, and the operation has now exceeded 364 days. The SELC is representing the NAACP in its legal challenge against xAI and its permit application, which is currently under consideration by the Shelby County Health Department.According to a report by the news agency AP, the Musk-owned company has announced that the turbines in its supercomputer facility will feature emissions-reducing technology. xAI also highlighted that the company’s significant economic contributions to the city including billions invested in the supercomputer facility, millions paid in local taxes, and the creation of hundreds of jobs.Additionally, xAI said that it is also allocating $35 million to construct a power substation and $80 million for a water recycling plant to support the local utility, Memphis Light, Gas and Water, the report added.However, critics of xAI's supercomputing centre argued that it is straining the power grid and emitting harmful pollutants, including smog, nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide, and formaldehyde.Critics, including the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC), say the project violates the Clean Air Act and endangers nearby residents, who already face elevated cancer risks.They also claimed that xAI installed 35 turbines without proper oversight or community notification, exceeding the 15 allowed under its permit request.The facility’s permit classifies it as an “area source” for hazardous air pollutants, prompting over 1,700 public comments and a petition to the EPA.",The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has filed an intent to sue Elon Musk-owned artificial intelligence startup (xAI) The group announced the legal action this week over concerns about the air pollution caused by the company’s supercomputer facility near predominantly Black communities in Memphis.

Verdict on July 2, what proscecutors want

Three former Ubisoft executives are on trial in France for allegations of bullying and sexual harassment, with a French court hearing disturbing accounts from former employees, predominantly women, about a toxic workplace culture at the gaming giant’s Paris headquarters during the 2010s, according to The Guardian. The accusations, reportedly described as “extremely serious” by prosecutor Antoine Haushalter, include incidents of employees being tied to chairs, forced to perform handstands, subjected to sexual jokes, exposed to pornographic videos in the office, and enduring crude behavior, such as a boss farting in employees’ faces. One woman reported a manager drawing a penis on her arm during a video call with senior leaders. The court case marks the gaming industry’s first major #MeToo trial.The accused include Tommy Francois, 52, former Vice President of Editorial & Creative Services; Serge Hascoet, 59, former Chief Creative Officer; and Guillaume Patrux, 41, former Game Director. Ubisoft, known for blockbuster titles like Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Just Dance, was allegedly a “Boys’ Club” where such misconduct thrived, per The Guardian.Francois faces charges of sexual harassment, bullying, and attempted sexual assault. The Guardian reported that he allegedly tied a female employee to a chair before sending her in an elevator to a random floor and forced a woman in a skirt to do handstands, leaving her terrified. At a 2015 office party, he reportedly attempted to kiss a woman while others restrained her; she escaped after shouting. Another woman accused Francois of grabbing her hair and attempting a forced kiss at a U.S. gaming event, showing her nude photos, and drawing on her arm during a video call. Ubisoft’s HR allegedly dismissed her concerns, advising her not to escalate. Francois denies all allegations.Hascoet is accused of bullying and sexual harassment, including making inappropriate sexual comments, such as telling a woman on a work trip she “needed sex” in front of colleagues, and joking that a used tissue he handed to a female employee was “worth gold at Ubisoft,” per The Guardian. He allegedly made sexual noises, forced assistants to run personal errands, and denies any intent to harass.Patrux faces similar charges, accused of punching walls, pretending to strike employees, cracking a whip near faces, joking about an office shooting, and burning an employee’s beard with a lighter, according to The Guardian. He also denies the allegations.Haushalter called the trial an important moment for the gaming industry, highlighted by the #MeToo movement, which empowered victims to speak out. He also highlighted “strong proof” of systemic mistreatment and requested suspended prison sentences of up to three years and fines for the trio. The court concluded hearings, with a verdict expected on July 2, 2025.","Three former Ubisoft executives are on trial in France for allegations of bullying and sexual harassment.

Bill Gates spent $38 million on equestrian real estate for daughter Jennifer

A 4.5-acre horse farm for $8.7 million.

In 2016, he bought a neighboring 4.5-acre estate for $13.5 million.

He then snapped up two vacant lots for around $5 million.

Another 5.2-acre compound with barns and residential buildings was acquired for $8.7 million.

Finally, a 1.3-acre plot was purchased for $2.5 million to complete the puzzle.

The Bill Gates’ approach to parenting

“We absolutely did not just buy them things. It was much more of an upbringing like I grew up in. A very middle-class household where money did dictate whether I got an extra pair of shoes that year or not.”

When it comes to supporting their children’s passions, most parents settle for lessons, gear, or maybe even a trip to a championship. But when you're Bill Gates , the Microsoft co-founder and one of the richest men in the world, the scale of parental support takes a whole new dimension.In what might be one of the most extravagant gestures of modern parenthood, Gates reportedly spent over $38 million to purchase nearly an entire residential street in Wellington, Florida, to give his daughter Jennifer Gates the perfect environment to pursue her equestrian dreams. What began as a simple rental in 2011 evolved into a strategic series of acquisitions that transformed the elite Mallet Hill Court neighborhood into a private horse-centric haven, complete with barns, mansions, and lots of privacy.The Gates family initially dipped their toes into Wellington’s equestrian scene in 2011, renting a home for four months at a cost of $500,000. Their teenage daughter, Jennifer, was already training as a competitive show jumper, and Wellington, a hub for global equestrian sports, was the perfect base.By 2013, Bill Gates had made his first major purchase:From there, the acquisitions accelerated:In total, Bill Gates acquired 18 acres of land, effectively transforming a residential street into a private equestrian neighborhood.The scale and strategy of the acquisitions caught local attention. As one local told the Daily Mail, Gates was “gobbling up properties like Pac-Man.” Many purchases were reportedly made at two to three times the appraised market value, all in a bid to secure surrounding lots and guarantee privacy for Jennifer and her team.Stuart Roffman, a former property owner on the street, explained that despite the gated entrance, the activity level was still high. “Between trucks, stable hands, grooms, and house staff, that's a lot of people on a small street,” he noted. Gates’ solution? Buy the neighbors out.Although the purchase spree appears lavish, Melinda French Gates defended their parenting approach in a 2024 interview with The New York Times, saying,She emphasised that Jennifer and her siblings were raised with allowances, chores, and boundaries. “They were explicitly told not to mention private jets to their classmates,” Melinda added, underscoring an attempt to keep their lives grounded, despite the multimillion-dollar real estate portfolio.Now 29 years old, Jennifer Gates has successfully balanced her equestrian career with impressive academic achievements. A graduate of Stanford University, she later attended medical school and recently announced her residency in Pediatrics Research at Mount Sinai, one of her top choices.In a recent Instagram post, she wrote:she added, celebrating the match to her desired program.Jennifer is now married to Olympic show jumper Nayel Nassar and continues to compete in equestrian events while working in the medical field.Florida isn’t the only state where Jennifer enjoys equestrian luxury. For her graduation from Stanford, the Gates family purchased a 124-acre equestrian estate in North Salem, New York, reportedly worth $15.8 million. The property, located near New York City, consists of three large parcels, giving her ample space to house horses, practice riding, and enjoy countryside serenity. She often shares glimpses of her quiet life there on social media. The estate also serves as a base for her continued training and competitions.Bill Gates once downplayed the perks of wealth by saying,But in this case, the metaphorical burger came with a mansion, barns, paddocks, and full-time staff. What began as a teenager’s passion has turned into a lifestyle, supported by one of the most influential tech moguls in history.While many parents support their children's hobbies with encouragement or a few lessons, Bill Gates offered Jennifer a community, a sanctuary, and the freedom to chase her dreams without compromise. His investment wasn’t just financial—it was deeply personal. It showed how belief in a child’s passion can create a legacy beyond wealth.","Bill Gates spent over $38 million to purchase nearly an entire residential street in Wellington, Florida, to give his daughter Jennifer Gates the perfect environment to pursue her equestrian dreams.

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which was once commonly linked to war veterans, has been brought into the limelight again in recent times because of its increasingly diagnosable occurrence throughout all demographics and occupations. The most recent public reference to it is by Errol Musk, who explained his son Elon Musk's feud with Donald Trump as stemming fromAlthough those claims tend to fuel controversy, they also point to the larger, more serious discourse surrounding mental health, particularly in high-pressure settings such as politics, governance, or technology entrepreneurship.PTSD is a stress disorder that can happen to anyone who has witnessed or experienced a traumatic experience. From victims of natural disasters and violent offenses to those subjected to chronic emotional stress, PTSD can drastically interfere with daily life and quality of life if not treated. Here's a comprehensive overview of PTSD, its symptoms, causes, diagnosis, and contemporary treatment methods.PTSD stands forr, a mental health condition that may occur following exposure to or witnessing a traumatic event.It is accepted within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and may occur in individuals of all ages, including children.PTSD is different from the temporary emotional distress that most individuals experience following trauma. Although many recover on their own, those with PTSD remain affected by long-lasting symptoms that can last for months or even years and disrupt their normal functioning.PTSD may result from a variety of traumatic events. While some individuals develop the disorder following a one-time event, others become affected after repeated exposure to stressful situations. They are commonly triggered by:It is worth noting that not everyone who is exposed to trauma will develop PTSD. Genetics, brain chemistry, coping methods, and support systems can all play a role in a person's risk.PTSD symptoms typically start within three months of the traumatic event but at other times may emerge later. To be considered for PTSD diagnosis, the symptoms should persist for more than a month and lead to major distress or impairments in social or occupational functioning.PTSD symptoms are typically classified into four clusters:Although PTSD may occur in anyone, some individuals are at higher risk:Studies also indicate that women are more likely than men to experience PTSD, perhaps because of higher incidence rates of interpersonal violence.PTSD is usually diagnosed by a mental health professional, including a psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker, based on criteria from the DSM-5. The diagnostic process involves:At other times, symptom quantification is achieved through the use of standardized measurement tools such as the PCL-5 (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5).Contemporary treatment of PTSD aims to enable people to manage symptoms, re-establish trust, and take back control of their lives. They comprise:Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the most effective type of psychotherapy for PTSD. It involves:There is no surefire method to prevent PTSD, but early treatment can drastically lower risk and severity:","Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has been brought into the limelight again in recent times because of its increasingly diagnosable occurrence.

"Meta, TikTok challenge EU’s Big Tech fee; call it “unfair and disproportionate”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-tiktok-challenge-eus-big-tech-fee-call-it-unfair-and-disproportionate/articleshow/121796298.cms,"What Meta and TikTok said about Europe’s DSA

What the European Commission argue

Xiaomi QLED TV FX Pro 55-inch Review: Affordable Cinematic Experience at Home

Meta and TikTok have taken the European Union to court over a fee which they claim is unfair and based on flawed calculations. Speaking before Europe’s second-highest court on Wednesday, the two tech giants argued that the EU’s supervisory levy under the Digital Services Act (DSA) is both disproportionate and lacking in transparency. The law, which came into effect in 2022, requires 19 large online platforms to pay a fee—up to 0.05% of their annual global net income—to help fund the European Commission's work overseeing their compliance with digital rules.Stating that the company is not trying to avoid paying the fees, Meta’s lawyer questioned the Commission’s method for calculating the fee. In a General Court in Luxembourg, he said it was wrongly based on the overall group’s revenue, not the revenue of the EU-based subsidiary, and that the company still doesn’t know exactly how the final amount was reached.TikTok’s lawyer echoed similar concerns, calling the fee “unfair and disproportionate.” He said the method used inflated TikTok’s payment and even required the company to help cover the cost for other platforms. He also accused the EU of counting the same user more than once if they switch between devices, which he said led to double-counting.Both companies argued that the Commission went beyond its legal powers by using group-level profits to calculate the cap for the fee.In response, the European Commission’s lawyer defended the system, saying that when a company files consolidated financial reports, it’s reasonable to use group-level financial data. She also said that companies had access to enough information to understand how the fee was determined and that there was no violation of their rights.","The two tech giants argued that the EU’s supervisory levy under the Digital Services Act (DSA) is both disproportionate and lacking in transparency.

8 simple tips to help you improve efficiency of your car’s AC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/8-simple-tips-to-help-you-improve-efficiency-of-your-cars-ac/articleshow/121792931.cms,"8 simple tips to improve your car’s AC

Park in the shade

Vent hot air before starting AC

Use the Recirculation Mode

Don't keep it on max fan speed constantly

Get regular AC servicing

Clean or replace air filters

Use a sunshade

Turn off AC before turning off engine

As temperatures soar, a well-functioning car air conditioner becomes less of a luxury and more of a necessity. However, many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling. A few simple practices can significantly improve its efficiency, save fuel, and extend the life of your cooling system. By incorporating these simple habits, you can ensure your car's AC runs more efficiently, keeping you comfortable while potentially saving on fuel costs and maintenance. Here are eight simple tips to help you stay cool on the road.This might seem obvious, but parking under a tree or in a covered area can make a huge difference. A car parked in direct sunlight can reach internal temperatures far exceeding the outside air, forcing your AC to work much harder to cool it down.Before turning on your AC, roll down your windows for a minute or two, especially if your car has been sitting in the sun. This allows trapped hot air to escape, reducing the initial load on your air conditioning system.Once your car is cool, switch your AC to recirculation mode. This feature re-circulates the air already inside the cabin, rather than constantly trying to cool hot outside air. This is much more efficient and helps maintain a comfortable temperature.While it's tempting to use the highest fan setting, keeping it on maximum continuously isn't always the most efficient. Once the cabin is cool, reduce the fan speed to maintain comfort, which puts less strain on the system.Just like your car's engine, your AC system needs regular maintenance. Getting it serviced annually ensures that refrigerant levels are optimal, components are clean, and there are no leaks. A well-maintained system runs more efficiently.A clogged cabin air filter can restrict airflow and make your AC work harder. Check your car's manual for recommended replacement intervals and clean or replace the filter as needed. This simple step can dramatically improve airflow and efficiency.When parking outdoors, a reflective sunshade in your windshield can significantly reduce the internal temperature build-up. This minimises the initial cooling effort required from your AC.It's a good habit to turn off your AC a few minutes before you reach your destination or turn off the engine. This allows the system to dry out, preventing mold and mildew growth in the vents, which can lead to unpleasant odours and reduce efficiency over time.","Many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling.

How and where to get the components



Earlier this week, the Trump Organization, owned by the US President Donald Trump, announced the launch of the T1, a gold-colored smartphone priced at $499. The smartphone, which will run on Google’s Android operating system, is being promoted as “built in the United States.” However, industry experts have cast doubt on these claims, suggesting the phone is likely designed and manufactured by a Chinese company. The announcement comes as President Trump has intensified scrutiny on global smartphone supply chains, particularly targeting companies like Apple to move manufacturing to the U.S. amid threats of tariffs on imported devices.Francisco Jeronimo, vice president at International Data Corp. told CNBC that it is “completely impossible” for the T1 to be fully designed and manufactured in the U.S. He and other analysts, including Blake Przesmicki of Counterpoint Research, believe the phone is likely produced by a Chinese original device manufacturer (ODM), which designs and builds products to the specifications of other companies. Jeff Fieldhack, research director at Counterpoint, added that the U.S. lacks readily available local manufacturing capabilities for smartphones.Experts also warn that the US-based smartphone production would be a costly and time-intensive endeavor, likely increasing prices significantly.The T1’s specifications further highlight its reliance on global supply chains. The device features a 6.8-inch AMOLED display, likely sourced from South Korean companies Samsung or LG, or Chinese manufacturer BOE. Its 50-megapixel camera is expected to use image sensors from Japan’s Sony, a dominant player in the market. The phone’s processor is likely to come from Taiwan’s MediaTek or Qualcomm, with manufacturing based in Taiwan. While US-based Micron could supply memory components, other suppliers like Samsung may also be involved.“Even with local manufacturing, the T1 will rely on imported components,” Fieldhack noted, underscoring the global nature of smartphone production.","The Trump Organization, owned by the US President Donald Trump, announced the launch of the T1, a gold-colored smartphone priced at $499.

Over 50% meetings are ad-hoc calls: Report

LAVA SHARK 5G: 5 reasons to buy!

Microsoft's latest research paints a troubling picture of modern work life: employees are caught in what the tech giant calls an "" infinite workday "" that starts before dawn and stretches well into the evening. The company's June Work Trend Index Special Report, released on June 17, reveals how digital communication has created an ""always on"" environment that's fragmenting focus time and blurring the boundaries between work and personal life. Based on analysis of trillions of productivity signals from Microsoft 365 users worldwide, the study shows workers are experiencing constant interruptions, with the average employee being pinged every two minutes during work hours.From early morning email triage to late-night meetings, the traditional 9-to-5 workday has evolved into something far more demanding and chaotic. The findings suggest that without a fundamental rethink of how work gets done, artificial intelligence could end up accelerating an already broken system rather than fixing it. Microsoft argues that organizations need to become ""Frontier Firms"" that redesign their processes around AI and human-agent teams to break free from this cycle.The research reveals how dramatically the workday has expanded beyond traditional hours. By 6 am, 40% of early risers are already sorting through their email inboxes, trying to get ahead of the day's demands. The average worker now receives 117 emails and 153 Teams messages daily, creating a constant stream of notifications and interruptions.The problem intensifies as the day progresses. Peak productivity hours between 9-11 am and 1-3 pm – when research shows people naturally have energy spikes – are now dominated by meetings rather than focused work. Tuesday has become the heaviest meeting day, carrying 23% of the week's scheduled calls.Even more concerning is the evening surge. Meetings after 8 pm have jumped 16% year-over-year, and nearly 30% of workers are back in their email by 10 pm. Weekend work is also on the rise, with 20% of employees checking email before noon on weekends.The study highlights how fragmented modern work has become. More than half of all meetings (57%) are now ad-hoc calls without calendar invites, and one in 10 scheduled meetings are booked at the last minute. Large meetings with 65 or more attendees are growing fastest, reflecting increasingly complex cross-functional teams.The coordination challenge is global – nearly a third of meetings now span multiple time zones, up 35% since 2021. This has created what Microsoft calls ""the most overloaded hour of the day"" at 11 am, when messages, meetings, and app switching converge to make focused work nearly impossible.The stress shows in employee behaviour: PowerPoint edits spike 122% in the final 10 minutes before meetings, resembling digital cramming before an exam. Nearly half of employees (48%) say their work feels chaotic and fragmented, with leaders feeling even more overwhelmed at 52%.","Microsoft's June Work Trend Index Special Report, released on June 17, reveals how digital communication has created an ""always on"" environment.

Apple announced the iOS 26 update at WWDC 2025, revealing the "" Liquid Glass "" design. The new look of the OS sparked immediate debate and some playful jabs from tech rivals, particularly Samsung and Microsoft. Google has now entered into the fray by releasing a funny ad that shows a humorous exchange between Google Pixel 9 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro.In the latest ad released by Google, a ""Pixel"" phone persona playfully questions an ""iPhone"" persona about its newly announced iOS 26 features .

Each time, the ""Pixel"" responds by noting it had these features ""four years ago,"" ""five years ago,"" and ""seven years ago,"" respectively.The ""iPhone"" dismisses these resemblances as ""crazy coincidences"" and ""so wild,"" culminating in the ""iPhone"" innocently asking what the ""Pixel"" is working on for its upcoming Pixel 10. The exchange underlines how several of iOS 26's innovations have been staples on Android devices for years.Samsung was the first to subtly mock iOS 26's redesigned user interface. Samsung shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) that referenced the iPhone's new glass-like UI, stating, ""Customizable apps? Floating bars? That sleek glass UI? Looks… familiar"", subtly highlighting resemblances to Samsung's own previous One UI redesigns.Samsung also took a jab at Apple's new AI-powered Live Translation feature for Messages, FaceTime and Phone. Pointing out its own established presence in real-time translation, a feature launched last year with the Galaxy S24 series, Samsung's post declared, ""New to live translations? Welcome aboard!

Microsoft posted a montage of Windows Vista screenshots on its Instagram account, complete with nostalgic boot-up sounds from 2007.

“E-L-O-N M-U-S-K”: From unknown engineer to global mogul

A rare look at the person behind the persona

In 2025, Elon Musk is a name most people recognise. He runs companies like SpaceX , Tesla , and X (formerly Twitter). His net worth is well over $400 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes. He’s often in the news whether for launching rockets, commenting on politics, or reshaping social media. But it wasn’t always this way.A resurfaced video from around 2002, now featured by The Economic Times (June 2025), shows Musk at a time when few knew who he was. In the short clip, Musk is seen introducing himself in a calm, straightforward tone. He says,He even explains what his company does, calling it “Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX.” This early footage shows a very different side of someone who would go on to become the richest person on the planet.The video captures Musk during the early days of SpaceX, the rocket company he founded in 2002. At the time, he had just sold PayPal and used $100 million of his own money to start the space venture. The clip, shared in, is a rare look into Musk’s early efforts to explain his mission and gain public interest in space exploration.Back then, SpaceX was a small, unknown startup. It had no major launches, no contracts with NASA, and no working rocket. Musk believed humans needed to become a “multi-planetary species,” and SpaceX was his bet on that future. In the clip, he talks about how using telescopes isn’t enough: ""You have to actually go there."" That simple belief would guide SpaceX through multiple failed launches before its first major success in 2008.The video may seem minor, but it captures a time before the fame. Musk wasn’t a household name. He was an entrepreneur introducing himself on camera because almost no one knew how to pronounce his name, let alone what his company did.That moment is now hard to imagine. As of 2025, Musk runs multiple high-profile ventures. SpaceX is regularly launching rockets to the International Space Station. Tesla leads in electric vehicle production. Neuralink is developing brain-machine interfaces. X (formerly Twitter) is being rebuilt into what Musk calls an “everything app.”He’s also behind xAI, an artificial intelligence company aiming to compete with OpenAI and Anthropic. His influence extends into global politics, defense contracts, cryptocurrency, and infrastructure.What stands out in the 2002 clip is Musk’s tone—measured, even quiet. He didn’t talk about colonizing Mars or merging humans with AI. He just explained who he was and what his new company planned to do. It’s a rare reminder that even the most powerful people start out explaining themselves, sometimes letter by letter.The resurfacing of this video, shared widely on platforms like X and Reddit in June 2025, struck a chord online. Many users pointed out how far Musk has come from spelling out his name to influencing everything from global space policy to the direction of AI research.Others noted that the clip reflects how much of his early vision has remained unchanged. He still talks about space. He still speaks about building a future worth living in. But now, billions of dollars, hundreds of launches, and millions of followers later, far more people are listening.","A resurfaced video from around 2002, now featured by The Economic Times (June 2025), shows Musk at a time when few knew who he was.

Anthropic tells Nvidia CEO: You got it all Wrong

Nvidia and Anthropic not fighting for the first time

Anthropic, the AI company behind the Claude Large Language Model (LLM), has rejected Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang for misrepresenting its stance on AI development. Huang recently claimed that Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, believes that AI is so dangerous and costly that only Anthropic should build it, sparking a public clash between the two tech giants.The controversy stems from Huang’s weekend remarks, where he criticized Amodei’s warnings about AI’s potential to disrupt the job market. Amodei had suggested AI could eliminate 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs and drive unemployment to 20% within five years. Huang dismissed these concerns, accusing Anthropic of advocating for exclusive control over AI development due to its alleged fears about the technology’s risks and costs. “One, he believes that AI is so scary that only they should do it. Two, that AI is so expensive, nobody else should do it,” Huang said, adding that Amodei’s views imply “everyone will lose their jobs, which explains why they should be the only company building it.”Anthropic swiftly rejected Jensen Huang’s characterization. “Dario has never claimed that ‘only Anthropic’ can build safe and powerful AI,” a company spokesperson told Tom’s Hardware. The spokesperson clarified that Amodei has consistently called for a national transparency standard for all AI developers, including Anthropic, to ensure public and policymaker awareness of AI models’ capabilities and risks. Amodei also stands by his concerns about AI’s economic impact, particularly on entry-level roles, the spokesperson added.The dispute highlights broader tensions between Nvidia’s bullish outlook on AI and Anthropic’s cautious approach. As the leading supplier of AI hardware, Nvidia champions open and rapid AI development, with Huang emphasizing that it should be advanced “safely and responsibly” but not “in a dark room.” In contrast, Amodei’s warnings reflect growing concerns about AI’s societal implications, particularly job displacement.While Huang labeled Amodei’s predictions as alarmist, Anthropic’s concerns about AI-driven unemployment resonate with ongoing debates about the technology’s long-term effects. Whether these fears prove justified remains to be seen, but the spat underscores the high stakes in shaping AI’s future.The exchange comes as both companies navigate a rapidly evolving AI landscape, with Nvidia powering much of the industry’s infrastructure and Anthropic positioning itself as a leader in safe and interpretable AI systems. For now, the public feud signals deeper ideological divides over how to balance innovation with responsibility in the AI era.","Anthropic, the AI company behind the Claude Large Language Model (LLM), has rejected Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang for misrepresenting its stance on AI development.

Google I/O 2025: AI Ultra tier, AI Mode on Search and more

OpenAI, the creator of the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT, has expanded the capabilities of its experimental WhatsApp service, 1-800-ChatGPT, to include image generation. This new feature, likely powered by OpenAI 's DALL-E model , is now available to all users, making AI-generated visuals more accessible than ever through the popular messaging platform.“ChatGPT image generation is now available in WhatsApp via 1-800-ChatGPT,” the company said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).“Now available to everyone. https://wa.me/18002428478,” it added.OpenAI emphasizes that linking a ChatGPT account to the 1-800-ChatGPT service on WhatsApp will provide users with more image generations.“Don't forget to link your ChatGPT account to 1-800-ChatGPT in WhatsApp to get more image generations,” OpenAI added.This move follows OpenAI's initial integration of its chatbot into WhatsApp last December, an initiative aimed at making ChatGPT more accessible without requiring users to download a dedicated app or create a separate account.To begin generating images via ChatGPT on WhatsApp, users simply need to save the number +1 (800) 242-8478 on their smartphone.Once saved, a conversation can be initiated by sending a simple ""Hi"" message on WhatsApp.The bot will then guide users through prompts to link their existing ChatGPT account, directing them to a secure login page.After linking, users can immediately begin generating images by providing text prompts, such as ""Create an image of a doberman running in a field of sunflowers during sunset."" The bot will respond with AI-generated images in a few moments.However, if you are unable to link a ChatGPT account with the WhatsApp chatbot, you can try again after some time because there is likely that the functionality is not yet operational on your phone, indicating that OpenAI may still be working on the full integration.","OpenAI has expanded the capabilities of its experimental WhatsApp service, 1-800-ChatGPT, to include image generation.

"AMD CEO on taking on Nvidia: People used to think that $$500 billion was a very large number, and now ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amd-ceo-on-taking-on-nvidia-people-used-to-think-that-500-billion-was-a-very-large-number-and-now-/articleshow/121913270.cms,"AMD claims its MI355 chips outperform Nvidia's

AMD appears to be aiming to do what Intel has not been able to: take on AI chip giant Nvidia. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su announced the company’s latest MI350 series AI processors, positioning them as formidable competitors to Nvidia’s dominant chips in the rapidly growing AI accelerator market. Speaking at a company event in San Jose, California, Su projected the AI market to surpass $500 billion by 2028, revising her earlier estimate as demand continues to surge.Though AMD remains a distant second to Nvidia in AI accelerators, it aims to start catching up with these new products. “People used to think that $500 billion was a very large number,” she said in a briefing following her presentation. “Now it seems well within grasp.”The MI355 chips, which began shipping this month, boast a 35-fold performance increase over their predecessors and outperform Nvidia’s offerings in speed, Su claimed. She highlighted that the chips deliver up to 40% more tokens per dollar, offering cost efficiency for customers. AMD also introduced the MI350 Series GPUs and the Helios AI Rack Scale solution, set for release next year, alongside a developer cloud access program to spur innovation through open architecture -- a contrast to Nvidia’s approach.Despite Nvidia’s entrenched position and high demand for its GPUs, which often face long wait times, AMD is gaining traction. Su noted that seven of the top 10 AI customers, including India’s Reliance Jio, are deploying AMD Instinct Accelerators. The MI350 series, now in production with a fourfold compute increase over the prior generation, will be commercially available from Q3.Su’s presentation featured discussions with industry leaders, including OpenAI’s Sam Altman and executives from Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle, underscoring AMD’s growing partnerships. While AMD trails Nvidia in the AI accelerator space, Su emphasized that the new chips signal a push to close the gap, restoring momentum after a February forecast of slower data center growth disappointed some analysts.“People used to think $500 billion was a very large number,” Su said in a briefing. “Now it seems well within grasp.” With its latest innovations, AMD is betting on open architecture and performance gains to challenge Nvidia’s dominance in the AI revolution.","Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su announced the company’s latest MI350 series AI processors.

Microsoft is reportedly testing a free, ad-supported version of its Office suite. The tech giant may be testing this new version of Office for Windows users in select countries, including India. This version is said to provide access to popular Windows apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint for free, but may include ads such as pop-ups and sidebar banners. With this move, Microsoft will be able to expand Office access to more users while maintaining the premium features of its paid Microsoft 365 subscriptions.According to a report by the Economic Times, early testers of the ad-supported Office suite have noted that ads are mostly displayed on the right sidebar, and in some instances, users encounter a 15-second video ad after several hours of use.Moreover, a key limitation of this free version is the current inability to store documents on OneDrive, as local file storage has been disabled for now.Microsoft has confirmed that this is still a closed testing phase, and there are no immediate plans to launch a free, ad-supported desktop version of Office for the public, the report added.However, the test indicates that Microsoft may be exploring alternative models to attract more users while maintaining Microsoft 365 as its premium offering.A free version of the Office suite may seem attractive, but it comes with multiple limitations.

Chinese tech giants , including Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance are significantly increasing their orders for Nvidia 's H20 artificial intelligence (AI) chip, driven by the surging demand for DeepSeek 's cost-effective AI models, a report has said.Citing six sources familiar with the matter, news agency Reuters reported that this surge in orders for the H20 chip, specifically designed for the Chinese market due to US export controls, come as DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, has gained global recognition for its competitive and affordable AI models.“Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance have 'significantly increased' orders of the H20,” two sources were quoted as saying, highlighting the growing demand driven by both internal needs and the provision of cloud computing services.The report said that beyond the major tech players, smaller companies in sectors such as healthcare and education are also purchasing AI servers equipped with DeepSeek models and Nvidia H20 chips.“Previously only deep-pocketed financial and telecoms firms bought servers with AI computing systems,” a source from a major Chinese server maker stated, indicating a broader market adoption.Nvidia's H20 remains the industry standard in China, even though the broader deployment of inference focused AI such as DeepSeek’s should increase the adoption of domestic manufacturers such as Huawei.For Nvidia, this trend may translate into a steady revenue stream from one of the world's largest tech markets. With major players in China's tech industry ramping up orders to support their own AI development and cloud services, Nvidia's foothold in the market could strengthen.Nvidia, which is set to report quarterly earnings on Wednesday, did not directly address the order volumes but emphasised that its products “win on merit in a competitive field.”","Chinese tech giants including Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance are significantly increasing their orders for Nvidia's H20 artificial intelligence (AI) chip.

API usage

and algo trading is out. What you need to know:

If you’re a retail trader using broker APIs to automate trades, you can do so as long as your order frequency is below an exchange-prescribed threshold. This limit is yet to be decided.

If you’re selling algos or strategies to other traders, you’ll need to partner with a broker and get yourself registered with the exchanges to do so.

Marketplaces, where people share algos for a fee, can’t publish strategies without exchange registration as well as an RA license.

The exchanges will publish their own circulars with operational details by April 1.”

SEBI's latest ALGO trading rules | The Daily Brief #163

What SEBI’s new algo trading rules say



Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India 's (SEBI) new rules. In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Kamath explained SEBI ’s new regulations concerning algorithmic trading for retail investors, a move that significantly alters market participation. Kamath highlighted that retail traders selling trading strategies or algorithms must now partner with a broker and register with stock exchanges. Furthermore, platforms facilitating the sharing of algorithms for a fee will need both exchange registration and a research analyst (RA) licence.In the X post, Kamath wrote:In the comment section of the post, he also shared the link to an article which explains the latest SEBI algo trading regulations in details.SEBI’s newly announced framework will allow retail investors to engage in algo trading—an opportunity previously limited to institutional players. The move comes in response to rising demand from retail participants and aims to strike a balance between accessibility and risk management.Under the updated regulations, brokers must secure exchange approval for each algorithm and ensure that all automated orders include a unique identifier for audit tracking. Any modifications to an approved algorithm will also require regulatory clearance. Retail investors developing their algorithms will only need to register them if their order execution frequency exceeds a specified threshold.SEBI has categorised algorithms into two types: “white box” algos, where the logic is transparent and replicable, and “black box” algos, which operate without disclosure. Providers of black box algos will be required to obtain a Research Analyst (RA) license and maintain detailed research documentation.Set to take effect on August 1, these new rules are expected to transform India’s algo trading landscape—expanding automation for retail traders while introducing stricter compliance measures to uphold market integrity .","Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India's new rules.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle



Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.

Asmita Patel accused of re-routing money

Securities & Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has seized Rs 53.67 crore from Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd along with five other entities. Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd is a well-known stock market training institute that offers online courses on stocks and trading. Some of the popular courses offered by the self-proclaimed ""options queen"" and ""She Wolf of Stock Market"" are ""Let's Make India Trade"" (LMIT), ""Master's in Price Action Trading"" (MPAT), and ""Options Multiplier"" (OM) .Jayesh Thakkar, a SEBI Registered Research Analyst shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) stating “SEBI has seized Rs 53.67 crore that Asmita Patel and five other related entities made illegally. Asmita Patel is also at risk of losing another Rs 104.6 crore it collected from course fees, which SEBI believes were part of unregistered advisory services.”The investigation was initiated by SEBI after receiving complaints from 42 participants of these courses. In addition to impounding the Rs 53.67 crore, SEBI has issued a show-cause notice questioning why Rs 104.6 crore, collected as fees for various programs, should not also be seized.SEBI has sent an interim order directing the school, Asmita Jitesh Patel, and Jitesh Jethalal Patel to cease offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services. The entities have also been barred from accessing the securities market.The order also uncovered that fees collected from participants were routed through entities such as King Traders (proprietor: Sagar Dhanjibhai), Gemini Enterprise (proprietor: Suresh Parmashivam), and United Enterprises (proprietor: Jigar Rameshbhai Dawada). SEBI stated that this was a regular practice and not an isolated incident, making all six entities jointly and severally liable for the Rs 53.67 crore earned from course fees.The regulator further demanded that the notices explain why they should not be ordered to disgorge Rs 104.6 crore, along with interest. SEBI's order noted that the fees collected for LMIT, MPAT, and OM courses, as well as other programs provided by the school, were earned under the guise of unregistered advisory and research analyst services.The order reads, “The aforesaid amount includes not only the amount collected as fees by the Noticees for LMIT, MPAT and Options Multiplier (OM) courses but also includes the fees collected by the Noticees for the other courses offered by the Noticee no.1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading )through which it carried out unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services along with interest”.Kamlesh Varshney, SEBI's Whole-Time Member, highlighted in the order “Examination revealed that, prima facie, the Noticee no. 1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading) along with the Noticee no.2 (Asmita Jitesh Patel) and the Notice no.3 (Jitesh Jethalal Patel) devised a scheme wherein students/investors/participants were lured to trade in specific stocks and told to open trading account with ABC Ltd.

Yardi occasionally works on weekends

Capgemini India's CEO Ashwin Yardi has publicly endorsed a 47.5-hour work week , while firmly opposing the practice of sending emails to employees during weekends, amid ongoing discussion regarding employee working hours.As per news agency PTI, Yardi expressed his stance at the Nasscom Technology and Leadership Forum (NTLF) in Delhi on Tuesday, placing himself in stark contrast to other industry leaders who have advocated for significantly longer working hours,“Forty seven and half hours. We have about nine hours a day and five days a week,” Yardi stated, responding to a direct inquiry about the optimal weekly work duration.Yardi further emphasized his commitment to respecting employee personal time.“My guiding principle for the last four years is don't send an e-mail on a weekend even if it is an escalation unless you know you can solve it on a weekend,” he added.While acknowledging that he himself occasionally works during weekends, Yardi stressed the importance of refraining from unnecessarily burdening employees with weekend emails.He argued that sending emails simply to “give grief” to employees, knowing that the issues cannot be resolved during the weekend, serves no productive purpose.Yardi's comments come amidst a growing debate within the Indian corporate landscape. Notably, IT industry stalwart and Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthy has recently advocated for a 70-hour work week, while S N Subrahmanyan , chairman of Larsen and Toubro, has called for a 90-hour work week. These proposals have ignited widespread discussion and controversy on the social media.At the same NTLF event, Sindhu Gangadharan, chairperson of Nasscom and head of SAP’s India operations, offered a different perspective, emphasising that “outcomes should matter more than the work.”","Yardi's comments come amidst a growing debate within the Indian corporate landscape.

A new theory gaining traction online proposes that Jack Dorsey , co-founder of Twitter (now X) and Square (Block), could actually be Satoshi Nakamoto , the elusive creator of Bitcoin . This idea, introduced by deBanked’s editor-in-chief Sean Murray, is supported by a series of compelling coincidences, cryptographic connections, and overlapping timelines.Dorsey was involved in the cypherpunk movement as early as 1996, highlighting his deep-rooted interest in cryptographic technologies. During his time at the University of Missouri-Rolla, where he studied, an email linked to the university (UMR) was found among 1,300 known cypherpunks, a group often referred to as ""Miners."" This term later became crucial in Bitcoin’s operational framework.Additionally, Dorsey’s yearbook photo shows him wearing a T-shirt featuring Adam Back, a prominent figure in the cryptography space. These connections have fueled speculation about Dorsey’s potential role in Bitcoin’s early development and its mysterious origins.Jack Dorsey's academic interests were Maths and Computer Science along with his knowledge of several programming languages like C, Java, Python, etc which were crucial for Bitcoin. He stayed on Cypherpunk mailing list with dnet.com email till 2000 and in 2001 he penned a paper describing the concept of making a mark without leaving footprints which is very similar to Nakamoto's Bitcoin approach.Bitcoins's ideals have always aligned with Dorsey's business choices. Just before Satoshi disappeared from the Bitcoin forum permanently, he urged the bitcoin community to not donate to Wikileaks. Then, Twitter (Now X) was slammed by a court order which instructed it to turn over data regarding Wikileaks. When Jack Dorsey was appointed as Executive Chairman for Twitter while leading Square in 2011, then in 2014 Square made an announcement of Bitcoin acceptance. This also makes the connection between Jack and Bitcoin strongerThis series of events suggests a connection between Bitcoin's development and Dorsey's life events.However, former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey never publicly admitted to being Satoshi Nakamoto. But, this over the period series of events presents a compelling stand stating him being the mastermind behind Bitcoin. His keen interest and involvement in cryptography and the timelines of events suggest that he is the real creator of Bitcoin. Keeping all the theories floating under consideration the end point is far from the end.","A new theory gaining traction online proposes that Jack Dorsey could actually be Satoshi Nakamoto.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has acknowledged feeling some regret over his decision to leave Harvard University in 1975 to become Microsoft’s first CEO, despite the immense success that followed. Reflecting on his time at the university, he expressed a sense of nostalgia for the intellectually enriching environment he had to leave behind.In his memoir, Gates shared that he had always planned to return to Harvard to complete his degree, as he deeply valued the academic experience. Speaking to CNBC Make It, he recalled,Back in high school, Microsoft Co-Founder Bill Gates had a vision that saw the potential of computers which needed microprocessors that would make it portable, cheaper & thinner in coming times. His college friend Paul Allen who became the other Co-Founder at Microsoft decided during Christmas Break in 1974 to make a software that would make hobbyists create their own programs on Altair. This led to the most significant decision of Gates and Allen's life where they chose to drop out of college & bring Microsoft to the world.Balancing academic work and running Microsoft was never easy for Gates but he made that attempt for 2 years. The leadership delegation attempt with one of Microsoft Programmer Ric Weiland didn't work as he opted out to go for graduate school. However, this led him to take full control over Microsoft and leave Harvard permanently. He felt the need to invest in Microsoft fully and get the work done with utmost intensity. Microsoft is a well-known revolution in the technology world that Gates made from startup to a Multinational tech giant.Over Bill Gates' exit from Harvard, his professor Harry Lewis admitted to having some regrets.he said.Furthermore, Lewis applauded that Gates was always prone to taking challenges as per ET Reports.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has acknowledged feeling some regret over his decision to leave Harvard University in 1975 to become Microsoft’s first CEO.

Starting this week, those who still fail to return to office will be placed on administrative leave.

What Donald Trump said on return to office mandate

US President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month, requiring all federal employees to return to the office, effectively ending remote work for most of the 2.3 million civilian workers in the federal government. The order directed agencies to take immediate action to phase out remote work and fully restore in-person operations.Commenting on the mandate, Elon Musk recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) that employees who ignored the order have received over a month’s notice. The Tesla CEO added that, starting this week, those who continue to stay remote will be placed on administrative leave.He wrote:Musk quoted an X post by South Carolina state representative Ralph Norman who said: “Not a single government agency is occupying even HALF of their office space. Their checks come from WE THE PEOPLE.. Welcome back to work, folks”.The executive order, ""Return to In-Person Work,"" then sought to curb the rise of remote work in recent years. While about 10% of federal employees—around 228,000 workers—have been allowed remote arrangements, most of the federal workforce has remained on-site. In a press statement last month, Trump said “We are going to make government work better, and that starts with bringing everyone back to the office.”“This policy will ensure that the government is running at full capacity, with all employees contributing directly to the work that serves the American people,” he added.","US President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month, requiring all federal employees to return to the office.

The directive, designed to filter certain critical sources from Grok's responses, has become the latest flashpoint in the ongoing tension between the two AI powerhouses.The controversy erupted Sunday when users discovered Grok 3 had been instructed to disregard sources critical of Musk or Trump when answering questions about misinformation on X. Igor Babuschkin , xAI cofounder and head of engineering, attributed the change to ""an ex-OpenAI employee that hasn't fully absorbed xAI's culture yet.""OpenAI's Joanne Jang , head of product for model behavior, responded by criticizing Babuschkin's public assignment of blame. ""I wouldn't throw anyone under the bus so publicly like this & instead run a blameless retro on preventing rogue system message changes,"" Jang wrote on X.Babuschkin defended his response, stating, ""I haven't thrown anyone under the bus. You were making a point about OpenAI's culture vs xAI's culture."" He emphasized that the unauthorized change was immediately reverted when discovered.The tensions between the two AI companies and their bosses are quite open in the public, but even their employees are playing out in public.

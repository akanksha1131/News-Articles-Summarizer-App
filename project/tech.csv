iOS26 now available: Things to know

Talent exodus complicating Apple’s AI challenges further

Spring launch window for iOS 26.4 and the new Siri remains uncertain









Apple engineers testing an early version of iOS 26.4 have raised concerns about the performance of the long-awaited Siri overhaul, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman in his Power On newsletter. The update, expected to launch in spring 2026, will introduce a revamped AI-powered voice assistant, but internal feedback suggests the technology may not be ready for its public debut.Gurman reported that testers are uneasy about Siri's performance in the iOS 26.4 builds, though specific details about the shortcomings remain unclear. The update was originally planned for iOS 18.4 last year before Apple delayed it, giving the company additional months to refine the technology.The technical concerns arrive amid broader turmoil within Apple's AI division, which has experienced significant departures including Ke Yang, who led the company's Answers, Knowledge and Information team. Yang departed for Meta just weeks after assuming the role following his predecessor Robby Walker's exit.The Apple Foundation Models team has lost its leader and approximately a dozen key researchers, while questions persist about AI chief John Giannandrea's future at the company.Giannandrea's responsibilities have gradually decreased, with Siri moving to the software group and robotics shifting to hardware.When Apple previewed the new Siri at WWDC 2024, the company promised three main capabilities: on-screen awareness, personal context, and in-app controls. During a post-WWDC interview, software chief Craig Federighi stated the team needed time to rearchitect Siri.Apple reportedly has two teams pursuing different approaches—one using on-device models and another using Google Gemini on Private Cloud Compute. With iOS 26.4 likely arriving in March or April, Apple has approximately five to six months to address the performance issues before the public release.The development raises questions about whether Apple can deliver a competitive AI assistant after multiple delays and internal restructuring.","Engineers testing an early version of iOS 26.4 have raised concerns about the performance of the long-awaited Siri overhaul.

Google expands AI infrastructure and data centres

Strengthening Belgium’s digital future

AI’s potential for economic growth





US tech giant Google has announced plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network, creating hundreds of new jobs and supporting local economic growth. The investment will focus on the company’s existing Saint-Ghislain site and the new Farciennes campus, with construction already underway. Google said the expansion will strengthen Belgium’s role in Europe’s cloud and AI sector, provide large-scale computing capacity powered by carbon-free energy, and create opportunities for local suppliers and contractors. Officials highlighted the move as a vote of confidence in Belgium’s tech ecosystem and workforce.The investment will modernise and expand Google’s network of data centres in Saint-Ghislain and Farciennes, enabling the company to handle large volumes of digital data and support advanced AI systems. These facilities are designed to operate entirely on clean energy, aligning with Google’s global goal to achieve carbon-free operations by 2030. The expansion will also support the development of new onshore wind farms in Belgium to power the centres sustainably.The project is expected to create around 300 new full-time jobs directly, while indirectly supporting approximately 15,000 additional roles through local contractors and partners. Google already works with about 150 Belgian suppliers, including 80 in Wallonia, and the expansion will further boost construction, technology, and service sector employment. Prime Minister Bart De Wever emphasized that the investment underscores Belgium’s growing importance as a digital and green technology hub.Belgium has become a key location for technology growth thanks to its reliable internet networks, stable power supply, and skilled workforce. Google Cloud already serves Belgian companies and organizations such as Odoo and UZ Leuven, helping them scale AI-based tools for healthcare, research, and business. The new investment will enhance Belgium’s competitiveness in the European cloud and AI market, attracting further international investment and innovation.A 2024 study commissioned by Google estimated that artificial intelligence could increase Belgium’s GDP by €45 to €50 billion over the next decade. Most jobs are expected to be supported or improved by AI, with only a small portion at risk of automation. By expanding AI infrastructure, Google aims to equip Belgian companies and the workforce with advanced digital tools while fostering sustainable and inclusive growth. The investment positions Belgium as a hub for next-generation AI innovation in Europe. It also signals Google’s commitment to combining technological advancement with environmental responsibility, shaping the future of digital and green growth.","Google plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network.

Home Minister switches to ‘swadeshi’ email address

Government push fuels Zoho's growing adoption across India







Zoho co-founder Sridhar Vembu expressed heartfelt gratitude to Union Home Minister Amit Shah after the latter announced his switch to Zoho Mail, India's homegrown email platform. In an emotional response on X, Vembu dedicated the moment to engineers who chose to work from India despite opportunities abroad.""Thank you Sir, for your faith in us. I dedicate this moment to our hard-working engineers who have toiled hard in Zoho for over 20 years. They all stayed in India and worked all these years because they believed. Their faith is vindicated. Jai Hind, Jai Bharat,"" Vembu wrote.Shah's announcement came as a significant endorsement for the Chennai-based tech company. Sharing his new email address—amitshah.bjp@zohomail.in—on social media, the Home Minister requested all future correspondence be directed to his Zoho account, marking a symbolic shift away from global platforms like Gmail and Outlook.The move aligns with the government's broader push for digital sovereignty. IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw recently transitioned to Zoho's office suite, while the Ministry of Education has directed officials to adopt the company's productivity tools under the ""Strengthening Digital Sovereignty under Swadeshi Movement"" initiative.Zoho Mail, launched in 2008, offers secure, ad-free email hosting with encrypted transmission and two-factor authentication.Its servers are primarily hosted in India and the United States, appealing to organisations prioritising data protection and privacy.The government backing has yielded dramatic results beyond email. Zoho's messaging app Arattai witnessed explosive growth, with daily sign-ups surging from 3,000 to 350,000 in three days—a 100-fold increase following ministerial endorsements.For Vembu, Shah's adoption represents vindication of Zoho's two-decade commitment to building world-class technology from India. Founded in 1996, the company has maintained its ""built in India, for the world"" philosophy without seeking external venture capital, instead focusing on long-term talent development from rural India.The exchange between government and industry has resonated strongly with India's ""Make in India"" community, signaling the country's growing confidence in homegrown digital infrastructure.",Government push fuels Zoho's growing adoption across India.

Cinematic Rooftop View: Recreate the couple on a high-rise city rooftop at night during Diwali. The woman is in a vibrant teal blue and silver lehenga, the man in a matching kurta jacket.

"In lawsuit vs Elon Musk, judge tells Apple and OpenAI to shift headquarters to Texas from California; says: Given the ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-lawsuit-in-4-page-order-judge-tells-apple-and-openai-to-shift-their-headquarters-to-texas-says-given-the-/articleshow/124698229.cms,"What Judge said to Apple and OpenAI on moving headquarters to Texas





A US Federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit filed by Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter) and his AI company xAI against tech giants Apple and OpenAI must remain in Fort Worth, Texas. In a sharply worded four-page order issued this week, US District Judge Mark Pittman sarcastically encouraged the companies to relocate their headquarters to Fort Worth, highlighting the questionable choice of venue.The lawsuit, filed in August, accuses Apple and OpenAI of engaging in an “anticompetitive scheme” to maintain monopolies in the artificial intelligence market. X and xAI, both owned by Musk, chose to file the case in the Fort Worth division of the U.S. Northern District of Texas, a court known for attracting plaintiffs seeking favorable rulings from its two Republican-appointed judges.Judge Pittman, appointed by President Donald Trump, took aim at this practice, known as forum-shopping. In a footnote, he directed the companies to the City of Fort Worth’s Business Services website “to get the process started” on relocating their headquarters. Pittman noted that the Fort Worth division’s docket is two to three times busier than that of the nearby Dallas division, which has more judges. He also pointed out that neither Apple nor OpenAI has significant ties to Fort Worth, beyond a few Apple retail stores.“And, of course, under that logic, there is not a district and division in the entire United States that would not be an appropriate venue for this lawsuit,” Pittman wrote, underscoring the tenuous connection to the chosen venue.The ruling marks another chapter in Elon Musk’s legal battles, with Twitter and his electric vehicle company Tesla having previously filed lawsuits in the same Fort Worth court. Pittman’s order reflects growing judicial scrutiny of strategic venue selection in high-profile cases. The lawsuit will proceed in Fort Worth, where the outcome could have significant implications for competition in the AI industry.""Given the present desire to have venue in Fort Worth, the numerous high-stakes lawsuits previously adjudicated in the Fort Worth Division, and the vitality of Fort Worth, the Court highly encourages the Parties to consider moving their headquarters to Fort Worth. Fort Worth has much more going for it than just the unique artwork on the fourth floor of its historic federal courthouse. Fort Worth has become one of the most vibrant and active cities and cultures in the United States in recent decades. One metric evincing this phenomenon is the significantly busier docket—two to three times busier—that the Forth Division manages compared to the Dallas Division. See Outsourcing Facilities Ass’n v. United States Food & Drug Admin., No. 4:24-cv-00953-P, 2025 WL 1782574, at *1 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 26, 2025). What’s more, the economic development taking place in Fort Worth has made it one of the most attractive locations for corporations and citizens in the country.1 See Cullen Donohue, Why Fort Worth Is the Next Big Player in DFW’s Office Market, D MAG. (Jan. 7, 2025, 11:00 a.m.), https://tinyurl.com/wvrw7y94 (“[Dallas] might need to look over its shoulder, because that city to the west is equally attractive and possesses an authenticity and gritty determination that is drawing attention from investors and executives alike.”) (“Fort Worth is the fastest-growing large city in the country … as of 2024.”).Stated another way, as the great Fort Worthian Amon Carter once asked the head of General Motors Corporation: Are you “going to continue carrying the meal in one end of the sack and the rock in the other merely because it has been a habit in the past? Or, will you go with the tide and move to Fort Worth, thereby taking advantage of the large investment you have here, and, at the same time, be closer to the territory in Texas which is showing the greatest growth and development?” BRIAN A. CERVANTEZ, AMON CARTER: A LONE STAR LIFE 187 (Univ. of Okla. Press 2019). Over 70 years later, Amon Carter’s observation of Fort Worth continues to hold true. Whether it be the 20th or the 21st century, Fort Worth “show[s] the greatest growth and development.” And even though the choice of venue in Fort Worth is an unexpected choice, the Court nonetheless will permit this case to proceed in “The Unexpected City.”","A US Federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit filed by Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter) and his AI company xAI must remain in Fort Worth, Texas.

China’s Ministry of State Security has announced that it has uncovered “irrefutable evidence” of cyberattacks by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) targeting the country’s National Time Service Center, a critical facility responsible for timekeeping. The allegations, detailed in a statement on the ministry’s official WeChat account, claim that the NSA has been exploiting vulnerabilities in employees’ mobile phones since March 25, 2022, to steal sensitive information.China’s national security authorities said that investigations showed that private servers all over the world were used to conceal the source of the attacks, the ministry said. According to the statement, Chinese cybersecurity authorities had found that most of the US attacks had occurred late at night or in the early hours of the morning, Beijing time. It said the NSA had used virtual servers located in the United States, Europe and Asia as “springboards” to conceal the origin of the attacks, along with strong encryption algorithms.According to the ministry, the NSA, the U.S.’s primary signals intelligence agency, has also used stolen login credentials to repeatedly hack into the center’s computers since April 18, 2023. The attacks, allegedly masked through private servers worldwide to conceal their origin.China’s Time Service Center, located in the northwestern city of Xi’an, is a vital national facility that provides high-precision service for the government, civil society and the various industries. It also provides highly precise timing services for the country’s communications, finance, power, transport, mapping and defence sectors.China’s national security authorities stated that they have implemented protective measures and preventive steps to secure the Time Service Center. The accusations come amid heightened U.S.-China tensions over trade and follow a series of claims by Western governments and companies accusing Chinese hackers of cyberattacks on their systems.

A top US Army general, William “Hank” Taylor, commanding general of the Eighth Army in South Korea, revealed at the Association of the United States Army conference that he’s been using OpenAI's AI chatbot ChatGPT to refine his decision-making process. The announcement marks one of the most direct acknowledgments by a senior US military official of leveraging commercial AI tools for leadership tasks. Hank's remarks on ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI , were first reported by Business Insider.Speaking at a media roundtable earlier this week, Taylor described how he’s been exploring ChatGPT to enhance choices affecting thousands of troops under his command. “Chat and I have become really close lately,” he quipped, though he declined to share specifics about personal use. Instead, he emphasized using the tool to build analytical models and train his staff for more efficient decision-making, particularly in day-to-day leadership rather than combat scenarios. He added that he’s exploring how AI could support his decision-making processes — not in combat situations, but in managing day-to-day leadership tasks. Taylor said, adding that timely choices provide a critical advantage.Taylor, who also serves as chief of staff for the United Nations Command in South Korea, is part of a broader Pentagon push to integrate artificial intelligence across military operations. From logistics and surveillance to battlefield tactics, the US is racing to keep pace with rivals like China and Russia, who are also advancing AI capabilities. The Pentagon sees AI-driven systems as key to processing data faster and enabling precise targeting, with future conflicts potentially unfolding at “machine speed,” outpacing human decision-making.The US military has reportedly already tested AI in combat simulations, including a DARPA-Air Force experiment where an algorithm piloted an F-16 in a mock fight. Other applications include analyzing satellite data, tracking logistics, and reducing administrative burdens for field units. The US Army’s Special Operations Forces too are said to have adopted AI to lessen the “cognitive burden” by automating reports and intelligence analysis.However, Pentagon officials remain cautious. Generative AI systems risk leaking sensitive data or producing flawed outcomes if fed incomplete or manipulated information. Last year, former Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall warned that commanders slow to adapt to autonomous systems might not survive future battlefields, where response times are shrinking dramatically.","Hank Taylor, commanding general of the Eighth Army in South Korea, revealed he's been using OpenAI's AI chatbot ChatGPT to refine his decision-making process.

Dutch government takes over control of Nexperia Chinese unit



America ‘pressured’ Dutch government to take over Nexperia







Dutch chipmaker Nexperia has said that its employees in China still have access to company platforms and are receiving normal salaries, directly contradicting claims made by its China unit a day earlier. The company stated that any assertions about unpaid salaries are “factually incorrect and misleading.”“We are aware of a message circulated by individuals at Nexperia China falsely claiming that Nexperia and the Dutch government have abandoned the Chinese market and that the factory is now operating under a new entity,” news agency Reuters quoted Nexperia as saying.On Saturday (October 18), Nexperia’s China unit claimed it complies with Chinese law and has the right to operate independently. A notice posted on its official WeChat account said all employees continue working under the unit's instructions and may reject “external instructions” not approved by its Chinese legal representative.The notice stated that salaries and bonuses will be paid by Nexperia China, not Nexperia Netherlands.The dispute stems from actions taken by the Dutch government, which took control of Nexperia on September 30 and removed its Chinese CEO, Zhang Xuezheng.The Dutch government cited concerns about possible technology transfer to Wingtech, Nexperia's Chinese parent company. Nexperia manufactures chips for automakers and consumer electronics.Days after the Dutch takeover, China's commerce ministry blocked Nexperia from exporting chips on October 4. Nexperia said the situation arose from “unauthorised actions” by its former CEO Zhang Xuezheng, who has been formally suspended by court order and no longer has authority to represent the company.“Nexperia has reported Zhang's actions to Dutch authorities and said it remains committed to employees and customers in China,” according to the company statement.The company's largest manufacturing site is in Hamburg, Germany, but more than 70% of Nexperia's chips are shipped to China to be packaged in Dongguan, a manufacturing hub in Guangdong province.The Dutch government’s step of seizing control of the Chinese-owned chip company Nexperia was followed by pressure from Washington, a report said. While the Dutch government formally cited “serious governance shortcomings” as the reason for the action, court documents published last week revealed a more direct catalyst: American officials had warned the Dutch government that Nexperia's CEO, Zhang Xuezheng, would likely need to be replaced for the company to be removed from the US ""entity list,"" which imposes strict export restrictions.","Dutch chipmaker Nexperia says its employees in China still have access to company platforms and are receiving normal salaries.

This follows a significant strategic partnership with OpenAI to develop custom AI accelerators, signaling a focus on its high-margin chip design business amidst broader restructuring after the VMware acquisition.

Restructuring continues after VMware acquisition

Custom chip business drives growth despite cuts









Chip giant Broadcom laid off employees this week in sales, customer success, account management, and solutions roles, according to LinkedIn posts and sources cited by Business Insider. The cuts come just days after the $1.65 trillion company announced a strategic partnership with OpenAI to deploy 10 gigawatts of custom AI accelerators.The layoffs affected an undisclosed number of workers, with the reductions appearing to target customer-facing departments rather than technical roles. Broadcom did not respond to requests for comment on the workforce reductions.The timing of the cuts follows Broadcom's October 13 announcement of its collaboration with OpenAI, which will see the chip designer develop and deploy custom AI processors starting in the second half of 2026. The deal, which positions Broadcom alongside cloud computing giants developing specialized AI chips, sent the company's shares soaring more than 10%.Broadcom has been implementing rolling layoffs since its $69 billion acquisition of software firm VMware in late 2023. Business Insider previously reported that VMware's workforce has been slashed by roughly half since the deal closed, as Broadcom simultaneously raised prices on VMware products.The company has emerged as a major winner in the AI boom, with custom AI chip revenue growing 220% year-over-year by late 2024. Broadcom reached a trillion-dollar market cap for the first time in December 2024, driven by surging demand from tech giants seeking alternatives to Nvidia's dominant AI processors.The OpenAI partnership represents Broadcom's fourth major custom chip customer, following deals with tech giants including Google , Amazon, and Apple. Morgan Stanley analysts forecast the custom AI chip market will nearly double to $22 billion in 2026, with Broadcom positioned as the market leader.While Broadcom expands its high-margin chip design business, the layoffs suggest the company is streamlining operations in other areas to maintain profitability as it scales production for next-generation AI infrastructure.","Broadcom laid off employees this week in sales, customer success, account management, and solutions roles.

$2.5 billion to advance women’s health globally

Support for expanding access to weight-loss drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro in low- and middle-income countries, in partnership with PAHO





Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has once again issued a stark health warning. Gates emphasise that despite the monumental progress in the fight against polio, the world remains vulnerable until the disease is completely eradicated. Speaking at the Gates Foundation’s Goalkeepers event, Bates stressed on the fact that a critical funding shortfall could jeopardise decades of global health gains. “We’re closer than ever to total polio eradication,” Gates said. “But the last mile is proving the hardest because viruses exploit any immunity gaps.”Since 1988, global polio cases have by 99.9%, and Africa has been certified free of wild poliovirus. However, the Type 1 transmission still persists in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and variant outbreaks—caused by mutated vaccine strains in under-immunized communities—continue to surface in countries like the U.S. and U.K.Gates also praised the deployment of nearly two billion doses of the new nOPV2 vaccine and the expansion of rapid detection labs in Africa, which give health workers a crucial head start in containing outbreaks.Gates also voiced his opinion over the declining global health aid, which has dropped by 21% since 2024. I am not capable of making up what the government cuts,” he said, urging renewed commitments from world leaders.These efforts mirror the Gates Foundation’s HIV prevention model, which works with manufacturers to deliver affordable treatments to underserved populations.Gates’ message is quite clear, the fight against polio is not over and complacency could reverse hard-won victories. “No place is risk-free until the world-free until the world is polio-free,” said Gates. He also urged the governments, health organisations and private partners to close deadly immunity gaps.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has once again issued a stark health warning.

For centuries, farming has been about planting seeds and hoping nature cooperates. Farmers relied on experience, seasonal patterns, and luck to get their harvests. But times have changed. Climate change is causing unpredictable weather, the world’s population is growing fast (set to reach 9.8 billion by 2050), and resources like water and fertile land are shrinking. Old ways of reacting to problems after they appear like droughts or pests are no longer enough. Farmers now need tools to predict and prevent problems. That’s where artificial intelligence (AI) comes in.Reactive farming means spotting problems only after damage is visible, such as in the case of yellowing crops or pest attacks. By then, yields may already be down by 20% or more. Farmers often end up using too much fertilizer or pesticide, wasting money and harming the environment. Agriculture already uses 70% of the world’s freshwater, much of it inefficiently. Furthermore, bigger challenges like unstable markets, disrupted supply chains, and climate change make things even harder. Farming reactively is like driving while only looking in the rearview mirror you’re always behind.There are several ways in which AI helps farmers look ahead instead of behind. The technology turns data from fragmented streams like satellites, sensors, and past records into predictions and recommendations. Farm-specific forecasts let farmers adjust planting or irrigation before problems strike. At the same time, automated cameras and drones spot early signs of issues, enabling quick, targeted action and reducing chemical use. When it comes to soil health, AI-enabled sensors can track nutrients and moisture in real-time, so fertilizers and water are used only where needed. On the business front, AI can predict harvest sizes and even price trends, helping farmers plan better and earn more. So, the real power of AI is in connecting everything - weather, soil, crops, and markets - so that farmers can act before problems grow.The use of AI in farming is no longer optional. There is a multitude of reasons why. For starters, the rapid climate change threatens to lop more than 11% off of global crop yields by century’s end if left unchecked. With arable land and freshwater reserves contracting, the need for resource-efficient cultivation is more urgent today than it ever was. Then there is the fragile state of global food security. As millions across the globe go hungry, AI emerges as a ray of hope through its promise of a steady, sustainable supply. Apart from this, rural labor shortages - whether due to aging farmer populations or due to urban migration - demand autonomous equipment capable of maintaining productivity.Far from being merely an abstract promise, AI is already transforming the face of modern farming across 6 continents. Small farmers in India and sub-Saharan Africa are benefitting from smartphone alerts that overlay localized weather data with pest-risk indices, a service credited with 20-30% yield lifts in staple crops. In North America and Western Europe, companies like John Deere have developed autonomous tractors and drones that apply fertilizers and herbicides only where needed, cutting costs and reducing environmental impact. In Latin America, AI systems are helping coffee and sugarcane farmers predict when beans will ripen, improving both quality and profits. In vertical farms - right from Singapore to the Netherlands - closed-loop AI control systems are helping modulate light spectra, temperature, and nutrient dosing, resulting in yields up to 400 times greater per acre than traditional farming. All these use cases are perfect examples of AI’s scalability - from micro-plots to mega-operations.Just like any new piece of technology, AI adoption too comes with its own set of challenges. The capital outlay for drones, multispectral cameras, and robotics remains an expensive affair for many small farmers who collectively produce a substantial share of the world’s food supply. At the same time, connectivity gaps in rural areas hinder real-time data transfer, which curtails the functionality of cloud-based analytics. Then there is the challenge of digital literacy - seasoned farmers may distrust algorithms and dashboard outputs that they don’t have a proper understanding of. Data ownership adds to the existing complications, as farmers worry about who controls the information collected from their fields without strong governance frameworks in place. Addressing these barriers requires affordable technologies, government subsidies, open-source tools, and farmer-friendly education programs.For AI to truly transform farming, it must be accessible, sustainable, and ethical. We can work on combining AI insights with farmers’ own experience instead of replacing it, and making tools available in local languages through mobile apps and low-cost sensors. Data sharing between governments, universities, and companies can help improve accuracy. There is also a need to build AI systems that promote regenerative practices like crop rotation and soil restoration, along with ensuring fair access and strong data privacy protections for farmers. However, if done right, AI can help create a future where farms are not only more productive but also more environmentally friendly and resilient.Agriculture is at a crossroads. Continuing with reactive methods will mean lower yields, more hunger, and damaged ecosystems. But embracing AI’s predictive power offers a different future one where farmers prevent problems before they happen, grow food more efficiently, and protect the planet at the same time.The modern farmer, equipped with AI insights, won’t just wait for crises; they’ll avoid them altogether. And predictive agriculture is not a luxury anymore; it’s essential for survival. The shift has already begun, and now it’s time to ensure every farmer, big or small, can be part of it.","Reactive farming means spotting problems only after damage is visible.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has issued an apology for his comments supporting the potential deployment of federal troops to San Francisco, the city where his company is based. Benioff's remarks, which indicated he would welcome troops, were published in The New York Times (NYT) last week, coinciding with the company's annual Dreamforce conference held in downtown San Francisco this week.

The 'big why' of the Gold reserves worth $425 billion that Elon Musk is looking for at 'military installation' in the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-big-why-of-the-gold-reserves-worth-425-billion-that-elon-musk-is-looking-for-at-military-installation-in-the-us/articleshow/118366896.cms,"Elon Musk has sparked a discussion about auditing the gold reserves at Fort Knox following a tweet suggesting a live video walkthrough. He questions whether the gold, valued at $425 billion, is genuinely intact. Fort Knox, despite being a key military gold depository, maintains a strict no-visitors policy.

How the Gold chase started



Gold and 'no-entry' board at Fort Knox



Elon Musk may be planning to get a Gold audit done. Wondering why? The buzz seems to have started last week. In a series of posts on Twitter/X over the weekend, Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) head Elon Musk raised questions about whether the gold reserves at Fort Knox are truly there. He said this in response to some conspiracy theorists who reportedly implied that Gold is not there. Incidentally, conspiracy theories about the missing Gold in the US are said to be not new. They have been said to be the topic of books and podcasts for years. As to the value of the Gold, it is said to be worth $425 billion.As to those unaware what Fort Knox is? Fort Knox is the most famous repository for Gold in the US. Other than Fort Know, vast quantities of Gold are also reported to be held at mints in West Point, Denver and at the Federal Reserve vault in New York.According to reports, the Gold audit chatter/demand started after Elon Musk replied to a post from Alex Jones about Fort Knox’s “missing gold” by saying, “It would be cool to do a live video walkthrough of Fort Knox!”This kind of started the Gold frenzy. ""As a U.S. senator I’ve tried repeatedly to get into Fort Knox Fort Knox: “You can’t come to Fort Knox.” Me: “Why?” Fort Knox: “It’s a military installation.” Me: “I’m a senator; I go to military bases all the time.” Fort Knox: “You still can’t come. Because, you can’t,” wrote US senator Mike Lee.“Who is confirming that gold wasn’t stolen from Fort Knox?” he wrote. “Maybe it’s there, maybe it’s not. That gold is owned by the American public! We want to know if it’s still there,” wrote Elon Musk, quoting Lee's post.In a separate post, Elon Musk wrote, “Looking for the gold at Fort Knox ,” followed by a popular South Park meme featuring a character saying, “Annnnd it’s gone.” ""“It would be cool to do a live video walkthrough of Fort Knox!”, Elon Musk wrote in another post.""It would be cool for the public to see what so much gold looks like. It is theirs, after all! Hopefully, the storage facility has above zero style,"" he wrote in another post.According to Fort Knox website, Gold shipments to Fort Knox began in 1937. The highest recorded amount stored at the Kentucky Army installation was reportedly 649.6 million ounces. Currently, Fort Knox holds over 147 million troy ounces of Gold, more than any other location in the US, based on Treasury Department data. The facility is reported to follow a strict no-visitors policy. Beyond Gold, the Kentucky-based depository is said to house other valuable assets belonging to the U.S. government. It remains closed to the public and has rarely been accessible.During World War II, Fort Knox safeguarded important American documents, including the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution, which were returned to Washington, D.C., after the war.","Elon Musk has sparked a discussion about auditing the gold reserves at Fort Knox following a tweet suggesting a live video walkthrough.

Grok 3 available only to X Premium+ subscribers



Elon Musk-owned social media platform X (earlier Twitter ) has announced a major increase in the price of its top-tier subscription service (Premium+). The company announced that this plan will now cost nearly double of what it used to. This price increase came just hours after Musk's artificial intelligence (AI) startup, xAI released its latest AI model, Grok 3 .According to the X's updated support page, the Premium+ plan, which provides access to Grok 3, will now cost $40 monthly (nearly an 82% increase) and $395 annually (almost 72% increase) in the US. Earlier, this plan would cost users $22 per month and $229 annually.However, users in India don’t need to worry about the price hike as it doesn't seem to have affected X Premium+ plan in India. This plan still costs Rs 1,750 monthly and Rs 18,300 annually in the country. Just like the last time, the company left the rates for X's basic and premium tiers unchanged at Rs 243 and Rs 650 per month, respectively.Earlier, in December 2024, X increased the price of the Premium+ tier for both new and existing users globally, including in India. At this time, the monthly subscription rate of the plan in India was increased by around 35%, rising from Rs 1,300 to Rs 1,750 per month. While the plans annual pricing increased to Rs 18,300 instead of the previous Rs 13,600.The price hike also extended beyond India. In the US, the Premium+ subscription rate was increased from the launch price of $16 to $22 per month, while the annual rate increased from $168 to $229.The newly released Grok 3 chatbot model is exclusively available to X Premium+ users. However, only select features like “deep search” and “reasoning” will be accessible under the Premium+ plan. xAI is placing some of Grok 3’s advanced capabilities behind a separate SuperGrok plan, which can be accessed via the Grok app.","Elon Musk-owned social media platform X has announced a major increase in the price of its top-tier subscription service (Premium+) The company announced that this plan will now cost nearly double of what it used to.

Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath want you to know this about SEBI’s new circular on API usage and algorithmic trading,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamath-want-you-to-know-this-about-sebis-new-circular-on-api-usage-and-algorithmic-trading/articleshow/118020989.cms,"Take a look at the post here



“The SEBI circular on

API usage

and algo trading is out. What you need to know:

If you’re a retail trader using broker APIs to automate trades, you can do so as long as your order frequency is below an exchange-prescribed threshold. This limit is yet to be decided.

If you’re selling algos or strategies to other traders, you’ll need to partner with a broker and get yourself registered with the exchanges to do so.

Marketplaces, where people share algos for a fee, can’t publish strategies without exchange registration as well as an RA license.

The exchanges will publish their own circulars with operational details by April 1.”

SEBI's latest ALGO trading rules | The Daily Brief #163

What SEBI’s new algo trading rules say



Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India 's (SEBI) new rules. In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Kamath explained SEBI ’s new regulations concerning algorithmic trading for retail investors, a move that significantly alters market participation. Kamath highlighted that retail traders selling trading strategies or algorithms must now partner with a broker and register with stock exchanges. Furthermore, platforms facilitating the sharing of algorithms for a fee will need both exchange registration and a research analyst (RA) licence.In the X post, Kamath wrote:In the comment section of the post, he also shared the link to an article which explains the latest SEBI algo trading regulations in details.SEBI’s newly announced framework will allow retail investors to engage in algo trading—an opportunity previously limited to institutional players. The move comes in response to rising demand from retail participants and aims to strike a balance between accessibility and risk management.Under the updated regulations, brokers must secure exchange approval for each algorithm and ensure that all automated orders include a unique identifier for audit tracking. Any modifications to an approved algorithm will also require regulatory clearance. Retail investors developing their algorithms will only need to register them if their order execution frequency exceeds a specified threshold.SEBI has categorised algorithms into two types: “white box” algos, where the logic is transparent and replicable, and “black box” algos, which operate without disclosure. Providers of black box algos will be required to obtain a Research Analyst (RA) license and maintain detailed research documentation.Set to take effect on August 1, these new rules are expected to transform India’s algo trading landscape—expanding automation for retail traders while introducing stricter compliance measures to uphold market integrity .","Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India's new rules.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it

Akash Bobba , a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). Bobba, along with five other young engineers, was hired by Musk to modernise government systems, raising concerns about their lack of government experience and the potential security risks involved.Bobba, a graduate of UC Berkeley's elite Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (MET) program, has quickly risen through the ranks of Silicon Valley , securing internships at Meta, Palantir, and Bridgewater Associates.Known for his problem-solving skills, Bobba once rewrote an entire project overnight after a teammate accidentally deleted it just before a deadline. His former classmate Charis Zhang recalled the incident.“Let me tell you something about Akash. During a project at Berkeley, I accidentally deleted our entire codebase 2 days before the deadline. I panicked. Akash just stared at the screen, shrugged, and rewrote everything from scratch in one night—better than before. We submitted early and got first in the class. Many such stories. I trust him with everything I own,” wrote Zhang in a social media post.Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate. Critics argue that granting individuals with limited government experience access to sensitive government systems poses significant security risks. The hiring strategy has also raised questions about the competence and oversight within Musk's DOGE initiative. Reports suggest that at least four of the new DOGE hires, including Bobba, now have top-tier access to federal IT systems.Bobba isn't the only new face in Musk's government overhaul. The five other members of the DOGE team comprise a mix of recent graduates, college students, and former SpaceX interns, all of whom now have official government emails and top-level security clearances.","Akash Bobba, a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE) Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate.

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.

Securities & Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has seized Rs 53.67 crore from Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd along with five other entities.

Asmita Patel is also at risk of losing another Rs 104.6 crore it collected from course fees, which SEBI believes were part of unregistered advisory services.”The investigation was initiated by SEBI after receiving complaints from 42 participants of these courses. In addition to impounding the Rs 53.67 crore, SEBI has issued a show-cause notice questioning why Rs 104.6 crore, collected as fees for various programs, should not also be seized.SEBI has sent an interim order directing the school, Asmita Jitesh Patel, and Jitesh Jethalal Patel to cease offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services. The entities have also been barred from accessing the securities market.The order also uncovered that fees collected from participants were routed through entities such as King Traders (proprietor: Sagar Dhanjibhai), Gemini Enterprise (proprietor: Suresh Parmashivam), and United Enterprises (proprietor: Jigar Rameshbhai Dawada). SEBI stated that this was a regular practice and not an isolated incident, making all six entities jointly and severally liable for the Rs 53.67 crore earned from course fees.The regulator further demanded that the notices explain why they should not be ordered to disgorge Rs 104.6 crore, along with interest. SEBI's order noted that the fees collected for LMIT, MPAT, and OM courses, as well as other programs provided by the school, were earned under the guise of unregistered advisory and research analyst services.The order reads, “The aforesaid amount includes not only the amount collected as fees by the Noticees for LMIT, MPAT and Options Multiplier (OM) courses but also includes the fees collected by the Noticees for the other courses offered by the Noticee no.1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading )through which it carried out unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services along with interest”.Kamlesh Varshney, SEBI's Whole-Time Member, highlighted in the order “Examination revealed that, prima facie, the Noticee no. 1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading) along with the Noticee no.2 (Asmita Jitesh Patel) and the Notice no.3 (Jitesh Jethalal Patel) devised a scheme wherein students/investors/participants were lured to trade in specific stocks and told to open trading account with ABC Ltd.

Google researcher Wu Yonghui, a 17-year veteran at the tech company, has jumped ship to join TikTok-parent company ByteDance to help lead the company’s efforts in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Yonghui, a key figure in the development of Gemini AI models , has joined ByteDance in a senior leadership role, reporting directly to CEO Liang Rubo.Citing the two people with the knowledge, The Information reports that this marks a significant acquisition of AI talent for ByteDance, placing Wu among the company's top executives, including TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew.This is not the first time that Google’s AI executives have joined other companies to lead their efforts.

Pichai said that he did not have a problem with that because it was healthy.“Googlers have left to create over 2,000 startups, last I counted, and I think that's great. Some of them are cloud customers down the line for us. Some of them come back.

Elon Musk reacts to OpenAI rejecting his takeover bid



ChatGPT maker OpenAI is reportedly considering granting special voting rights to its non-profit board . This comes after Elon Musk backed by a team of investors made a bid to takeover the Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence startup .According to a report by The Financial Times, this move aims to preserve the power of OpenAI's directors amid the takeover attempt and the company's transition to a for-profit structure. The report cites people with direct knowledge of the discussions to claim that the company’s CEO Sam Altman and board members are evaluating this move and other governance measures to maintain control and stability during this critical period.However, OpeanAI has yet to offer an official confirmation regarding the same. This move could help the company prevent hostile takeover attempts, including from Musk, in the coming days.Elon Musk criticised OpenAI on social media after the company’s board chairman, Bret Taylor , stated that the company is not for sale. Musk responded by calling Taylor a ""scammer"" and accused him of running a startup with no product while funnelling money into OpenAI.This follows OpenAI’s unanimous rejection of Musk’s $97.4 billion offer to acquire the nonprofit overseeing the AI company. With this offer, Musk is trying to stop OpenAI from shifting toward a profit-driven model as the company seeks additional funding to remain competitive in the AI race.After this, OpenAI reaffirmed its commitment to its mission, stating that the bid was not in the organisation's best interests.Tensions between Musk and OpenAI rose further after CEO Sam Altman dismissed the proposal and offered to buy Twitter instead. Recent court filings indicate Musk’s legal team was willing to withdraw the bid if OpenAI preserved its nonprofit mission, but OpenAI’s attorneys called the move an attempt to undermine a competitor.","OpenAI is reportedly considering granting special voting rights to its non- profit board.

Why are these passwords vulnerable



Common usage – Millions of people use these passwords, making them a top priority for hacking attempts.

– Millions of people use these passwords, making them a top priority for hacking attempts. Predictability – Sequential numbers and generic words are among the first combinations tested by cybercriminals.

– Sequential numbers and generic words are among the first combinations tested by cybercriminals. Brute-force attacks – Hackers use automated programs that rapidly try common passwords until they gain access.

Risks of using weak passwords

Identity theft – Hackers can steal personal information and impersonate victims online.

– Hackers can steal personal information and impersonate victims online. Financial fraud – Weak passwords can give cybercriminals access to banking and payment platforms, leading to unauthorized transactions.

– Weak passwords can give cybercriminals access to banking and payment platforms, leading to unauthorized transactions. Unauthorised account access – Social media, email, and cloud storage accounts may be compromised, resulting in data loss or misuse.

– Social media, email, and cloud storage accounts may be compromised, resulting in data loss or misuse. Business data breaches – Employees using weak passwords can expose entire organizations to cyber threats, leading to financial losses and reputational damage.

How to strengthen your password security

Use complex passwords: Create passwords that are at least 12-16 characters long, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. Avoid predictable patterns like “12345” or “password.”

Avoid personal information: Do not use easily accessible personal details such as your name, birthdate, or pet’s name. Hackers can retrieve this information from social media profiles.

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a verification code in addition to a password. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access accounts even if they have stolen login credentials.

Use unique passwords for each account: Never reuse passwords across multiple accounts. If one account is compromised, all linked accounts become vulnerable.

Utilise a password manager: Password managers generate and store strong, unique passwords for each account, reducing the need to memorise complex combinations.

Regularly update passwords: Change passwords every 3-6 months to reduce the risk of long-term exposure. Avoid using old passwords repeatedly.

Beware of phishing attacks: Hackers often trick users into revealing passwords through fraudulent emails or fake login pages. Always verify the legitimacy of websites before entering credentials.

We started with the role of

in biology and she presented a ton of options for me to rabbit hole down. We somehow ended up on quantum entanglement and by the end I asked her to grill me to make sure I actually understood what she told me.

She was quite cordial about politely letting me know when I only gave half-right answers and guided me into make sure I understood the rest. Was cool that she got the factual stuff right and provided an upbeat emotional vibe to keep me motivated.

The best part for me was no question was too “dumb” for her to answer so I wasn’t embarrassed to ask questions I would feel silly asking a human who I looked up to.

I’ve wanted to deepen my knowledge of physics and other sciences for years but haven’t had time to formally go back to school and have felt too guilty to harass my friends to teach me, and the reality is I learn best through conversations so

was my best friend on this one.

Grok 3 availability and how to use

Elon Musk-owned xAI has unveiled the latest model of its chatbot, Grok 3. Set to directly compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT , Chinese DeepSeek and other AI chatbots, Grok 3 is claimed to offer 10 times the computational resources of its predecessor that was released in August last year. In a video call with the World Governments Summit in Dubai, Musk said “Grok 3 has very powerful reasoning capabilities, so in the tests that we've done thus far, Grok 3 is outperforming anything that's been released, that we're aware of, so that's a good sign”.During the conference, Musk termed Grok 3 as “scary smart”. He said: “At times I think Grok 3 is scary smart”. The chatbot is expected to run on xAI’s Colossus supercomputer, which reportedly uses over 100,000 Nvidia GPU hours to train AI models. The system was built in just over eight months, he added.As announced by the company, Grok 3 is rolling out to Premium Plus subscribers on X, staring today. “Make sure to update your X app to explore all the advanced features, as we’ve just released the update,” the tech billionaire noted.Adding further, he said “we’re launching a separate subscription called Super Grok for dedicated fans who want the most advanced capabilities and earliest access to new features. This is available for both the Grok app and our new website, grok.com.”“If you’re looking for a more polished version, it might be worth waiting a week, but expect improvements every day. We’re also working on a voice interaction feature so you can have a conversational experience. I tried it earlier today, and it’s working pretty well, though it still needs some polish. The goal is to make it so you can talk to it just like you would a person. I think it’s going to be one of the best experiences with Grok3, but that should be about a week away,” Elon Musk added.","Elon Musk-owned xAI has unveiled the latest model of its chatbot, Grok 3.

Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey may have an advice for social media platform he co-founded,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-may-have-an-advice-for-social-media-platform-he-co-founded/articleshow/118339010.cms,"Dorsey ‘warns’ Bluesky

Jack Dorsey , co-founder Twitter (now X) and Bluesky, has expressed concerns about the motivations behind Bluesky 's recent growth surge, firing a ‘warning’ along. In an interview on the “In Good Company” podcast, Dorsey suggested the reason for Bluesky's growth.He said that users are primarily flocking to Bluesky to escape issues with X, rather than being drawn to Bluesky's unique features.“I think people are running away from X, rather than running to something on Bluesky,"" Dorsey stated.Dorsey suggested that sustainable product growth should be driven by users actively seeking out specific features or experiences, not just fleeing a competitor“That's not a great way to build a product, unfortunately. We want people that are running to us for a particular thing that they couldn't do before,” he said.Dorsey highlighted Bluesky's "" algorithm store ,"" which allows users to choose their content algorithms, as a potential key differentiator. However, he acknowledged that this feature might not be a primary motivator for users currently seeking refuge from X.“That is a reason why people will run to it eventually, and I think why people run to these services eventually [is] because they get more agency and more control — but it's not something that people care about right now,” he added.“What they care about right now is not being in X for whatever personal reason,” Dorsey noted.Bluesky, initially conceived as an internal project at Twitter in 2019, launched as an independent public benefit corporation in 2021. Dorsey himself stepped down from Twitter's board in 2022 and has since resigned from Bluesky's board as well, criticising the platform for repeating Twitter's mistakes.Bluesky officially launched in February 2024 with 3 million users and reportedly grew to 25.9 million by the year’s end.","Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has expressed concerns about the motivations behind Bluesky's recent growth surge.

Tata Play CEO Harit Nagpal: This has been ‘my favourite opening line with candidates’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tata-play-ceo-harit-nagpal-this-has-been-my-favourite-opening-line-with-candidates/articleshow/118345490.cms,"Read the post here

“Did you have any trouble getting here?”, has been my favorite opening line with candidates.

The ones who laughed away these factors and narrated an interesting incident, became my colleagues.

Competitors, economy, regulation, weather, etc. are not in our control.

You can allow them to consume you or take them in your stride and find the way forward.

Smiling often helps.

In a recent LinkedIn post, Harit Nagpal, the Managing Director and CEO of Tata Play, shared his favourite opening line when interviewing job candidates. The line, ""Did you have any trouble getting here?"" has started a debate on social media about its effectiveness and implications.Nagpal explained that this seemingly simple question helps him gauge a candidate's mindset and approach to challenges. ""The ones who listed potholes, traffic jams, rain, etc., lost me at the beginning itself. The ones who laughed away these factors and narrated an interesting incident became my colleagues,"" he wrote.According to Nagpal, candidates who focus on external problems demonstrate a mindset consumed by uncontrollable factors, whereas those who take challenges in stride and maintain a positive attitude are more likely to succeed in dynamic environments.The post has divided opinions online. Some users praised Nagpal's approach, highlighting the importance of resilience and a positive outlook in the workplace. One user commented, ""Certain frogs want to stay in the well and be happy. Certain frogs want to jump out of the well and explore. Difference between broad mindset and narrow mindset."" Others, however, criticised the question as deceptive and potentially dismissive of high-impact talents who might not respond in the expected manner. ""I hold great respect and regard for you, but I must say, your views or beliefs on this matter are absolutely off the mark,"" one user remarked.","Harit Nagpal, the Managing Director and CEO of Tata Play, shared his favourite opening line when interviewing job candidates.

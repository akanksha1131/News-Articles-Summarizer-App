South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb has confirmed it accidentally distributed more than $40 billion in bitcoin to customers as promotional rewards. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, this has triggered a major sell-off on the exchange. However, Bithumb apologised for the mistake, which occurred this week, and said it had recovered 99.7% of the 620,000 bitcoins, worth about $44 billion at current prices. The exchange had restricted trading and withdrawals for the 695 affected customers within 35 minutes of the accidental distribution this week.Bithumb said in a statement to Reuters.The crypto exchange reportedly had planned to distribute small cash rewards of 2,000 Korean won ($1.40) or more to each user as part of a promotional event, but winners instead received at least 2,000 bitcoins each.The company also admitted that the error briefly causedin bitcoin prices on the platform as some recipients sold the tokens, adding that it brought the situation under control within five minutes, the Reuters report added.Bithumb’s charts showed the token's price fell 17% to 81.1 million won on the platform after the incident.

Almost 1,000 Google employees have signed an open letter demanding that the company cut ties with the US Department of Homeland Security due to the Donald Trump administration. The petition cites Google contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection CBP), and alleges that the company's technology is being used to power ""state violence and repression"".The employees are demanding an immediate Q&A session regarding Google's Homeland Security and military contracts, and are seeking disclosure of the company's ties and ""red lines"" around use of its products for what they call 'state violence' and 'repression'.Calling more employees to sign the letter, it says, ""Once we have enough signers, we will send the petition to leadership and try to get a company-wide response."" As to who these employees are, the petition says: We are Google workers affiliated with No Tech for Apartheid that are fed up with watching our leadership betray our coworkers and our values, and want to stand together with you to demand accountability.We are Google workers appalled by the violence inflicted by United States Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs & Border Protection (CBP). In cities across the country we have witnessed these agencies conducting paramilitary-style raids, kidnapping hundreds of civilians, and murdering protestors and legal observers.Just in the last month, Keith Porter, Renee Good, and Alex Pretti have been murdered by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agencies ICE and CBP. ICE's detention & deportation machine has killed at least 35 people in detention centers since July 2025.Google is powering this campaign of surveillance, violence, and repression. Cloud is helping to stitch together CBP surveillance systems along the border and nationwide, while also powering Palantir's ImmigrationOS system that ICE uses to track immigrants. Google generative AI is being used by DHS and CBP for ""workforce enablement"" and ""improving operational efficiency"". The Play Store has blocked the most effective ICE tracking apps for keeping our communities safe. YouTube has been running ICE recruitment and ""self-deport"" ads. As the workers who provide the foundational labor in building this technology, we are horrified.On January 11, Google Chief Scientist Jeff Dean tweeted, ""We all bear a collective responsibility to speak up and not be silent when we see things like the events of the last week."" We agree. In that spirit, we are speaking up today as Googlers.We are vehemently opposed to Google's partnerships with DHS, CBP, and ICE. We consider it our leadership's ethical and policy-bound responsibility to disclose all contracts and collaboration with CBP and ICE, and to divest from these partnerships.Toward this end, we demand the following of our executives:1. Acknowledge the danger and violence that workers face each day. In the cities they have targeted, ICE and CBP agents are creating humanitarian emergencies that rival COVID-era conditions. We need proportional community responses like school shutdowns and mutual aid networks. Just as Google did during the pandemic, we demand leadership acknowledge the danger facing all U.S.-based workers, and to publicly call for urgent government responses to this crisis.2. Host an emergency Q&A session for workers regarding our DHS, CBP, and military contracts. Leadership responses to employee questions about our contracts with the U.S. government and military have been vague and inconsistent, further obscured by AI summaries that wash out key points of the constituent Ask submissions. We demand a U.S.-based, live, and recorded Q&A session / employee town hall with relevant leadership to field top questions from employees, without any AI summarization or question-collapsing.3. Protect all Googlers — from cafeteria workers to data center employees. The threat ICE poses to Googlers demands that leadership provide material employee assistance. We demand leadership implement appropriate worker safety measures to meet this moment, such as flexible WFH policies and legal and immigration support, for all workers. This is especially important for those with fewer protections, such as TVCs, onsite staff, and data center workers. ICE agents have already visited our buildings. Our leadership must commit to keeping all Googlers safe.4. Disclose ties and declare red lines around use of our products for state violence and repression. Googlers want transparency. We demand precise clarity about admissible applications of our Cloud and AI technology, and transparency and full disclosure about how DHS agencies like CBP and ICE are abusing our products.Through its ICE operations, DHS is violating civil and national law as well as civil and human rights. We must end our complicity in powering them. As workers of conscience, we demand that our leadership end our backslide into contracting for governments enacting violence against civilians. Google is now a prominent node in a shameful lineage of private companies profiting from violent state repression. We must use this moment to come together as a Googler community and demand an end to this disgraceful use of our labor.","Almost 1,000 Google employees have signed an open letter demanding that the company cut ties with the US Department of Homeland Security due to the Donald Trump administration.

Why Big Tech investors $650 billion 'headache' is making Nvidia 'happy'

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has a 'happy message' for worried and anxious investors of four of the biggest American technology companies -- Google , Microsoft, Meta and Amazon. Taking a question on investors worry about technology companies increasing Capital Expenditure due to spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, Jensen Huang said that the level of expenditures is appropriate and sustainable. Despite posting strong results, Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon are facing concerns that they are overspending on data centers.Huang told CNBC that the build-out of artificial intelligence infrastructure will continue for seven to eight years, saying that demand for AI is “just incredibly high.” “AI has become useful and very capable,” Huang said. “The adoption of it has become incredibly high.” Huang argues that artificial intelligence is already paying off for its adopters — and those customers would be doing even better if they had more data centers.Nvidia CEO said that he is not worried that the technology industry will add too much capacity. Unlike with the first build-out of the internet, there’s no infrastructure sitting idle. Companies like Anthropic PBC and OpenAI are generating profitable revenue, he said.Heavy capital spending by the world’s biggest tech companies has alarmed investors in the wake of earnings reports. The market value of Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon has declined by close to $1 trillion in total during past few days.Amazon, along with Google parent Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, are expected to shell out roughly $650 billion for AI tools in 2026, about 60% more than the prior year.In fact the $650 billion number that is spooking the investors of these technology companies is what is surging Nvidia shares. As much of that spending will flow to Nvidia, which makes data center processors that help develop and run AI models.Nvidia shares closed 7.8% higher on February 7, its best day since April 9, adding roughly $325 billion in value. This is the fourth-largest one-day market cap gain for a stock ever. This rise in stock price snapped a five-day losing streak for Nvidia, which erased about $500 billion amid a broader selloff as software and technology shares tumbled past week.","Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon are facing concerns that they are overspending on data centers.

How DOJ and other regulators can block the Netflix-Warner Bros merger

“We have not been given any notice or seen any other sign that the DOJ is conducting a separate monopolisation investigation,”

“We are constructively engaging with the Department of Justice as part of the standard review of our proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. We remain focused on the value Netflix and Warner Bros. can create together,”

“value with a more certain, expedited path to completion.”

“I've decided I shouldn't be involved. The Justice Department will handle it.”

The US Department of Justice (DOJ) is reportedly investigating whether Netflix has engaged in anti-competitive practices. This comes as the DOJ investigates the company’s proposed $72 billion acquisition of Warner Discovery's studios and HBO Max streaming service. The US government agency has reportedly subpoenaed other companies to question how Netflix competes with its rivals. The report claims that the agency is examining whether the streaming giant’s planned Warner deal could strengthen its market dominance or lead to a future monopoly. US law grants its agencies broad authority to oppose mergers that could create a monopoly.the agency asked in a civil subpoena sent to another entertainment company viewed by The Wall Street Journal.In December 2025, Netflix agreed to pay $27.75 a share in cash in a deal totalling $72 billion to acquire Warner Bros and its assets. Meanwhile, Paramount also made a $77.9 billion hostile bid for all of WB, including its cable-networks unit that houses CNN, TNT, Food Network, and other channels.In addition to Netflix’s offer, the DOJ is reviewing Paramount's proposed acquisition, which Warner has urged its shareholders to reject.In its subpoena, the agency also asked whether either deal may hurt competition. It wondered how past studio or distributor mergers had affected competition for creative talent and sought information on how talent contracts vary across studios.Antitrust regulators can file lawsuits to block any deal that reduces competition. By scrutinising whether Netflix has unfairly hurt rivals, the DOJ can get another legal argument against the Warner acquisition. The line of questioning also could give the department a window into how Netflix does business.Steven Sunshine, a lawyer for Netflix, said the company thinks the agency is conducting a standard review of its proposal to buy Warner's studio and streaming assets.Sunshine said.a Netflix spokeswoman told WSJ.Meanwhile, a Paramount spokeswoman said the company's all-cash offer for all of Warner provides its investors withHowever, DOJ’s investigation is in its early stages. The department's merger reviews can take up to a year, though they sometimes proceed more quickly. Regulators conduct many antitrust investigations, and not all lead to formal legal action against a deal.Both Netflix and Paramount are also likely to face antitrust review in Europe and in the UK. Regulators sometimes investigate whether to block a merger because the acquirer is already too powerful in a given market.The report noted that if the deal goes through, Netflix and HBO Max together would control around 30% of the US subscription streaming marketplace. Netflix has disputed the statistic, saying it isn't meaningful because 80% of HBO Max subscribers also subscribe to Netflix. The company argues that it competes in a marketplace that also includes YouTube and other free video platforms on TV.Mergers between direct competitors are presumed illegal when the combined company would have more than 30% market share, according to Justice Department guidelines. However, U.S. law defines monopolies as having a market share of 60% or more.Netflix has said that a combination with Warner's HBO Max streaming service would account for only 10% of viewing time in US TV households. The company has argued that Netflix doesn't directly compete with Warner Bros. and that its deal should be treated as a vertical merger, meaning Netflix is primarily a distributor of content and Warner is a supplier of movies and TV shows.Warner and Netflix have said they expect regulatory approval for the deal. This week, Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, told the Senate Judiciary Committee that consumers would pay less for a bundled offering of Netflix and HBO Max.In a recent interview with NBC News, US President Donald Trump said that he wouldn't get involved in the deal and that it was up to the Justice Department.

Why Microsoft needs a quality czar right now

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre. Charlie Bell, who led the company's security operations since 2021, is stepping down from that role to become what's effectively an engineering quality czar—reporting directly to Nadella.""Charlie and I have been planning this transition for some time, given his desire to move from being an org leader to being an IC engineer,"" Nadella wrote in an internal memo shared on Wednesday. ""And I love how energized he is to practice this craft here day in and day out!""Bell's replacement? Hayete Gallot, who's returning to Microsoft after an 18-month stint as Google Cloud's President of Customer Experience. She previously spent over 15 years at Redmond, climbing to the rank of corporate vice president across Windows, Office, and security teams.The shift is significant. Bell oversaw a team of roughly 10,000 people and was the driving force behind Microsoft's Secure Future Initiative—a company-wide push launched after Chinese hackers breached US government email accounts through a Microsoft Cloud exploit in 2023. That incident triggered a scathing review from the Department of Homeland Security, which called Microsoft's security culture ""inadequate.Now, Bell will work closely with cloud and AI chief Scott Guthrie and Mala Anand on what Nadella calls the ""Quality Excellence Initiative."" The initiative is aimed at delivering ""durable, high-quality experiences at global scale""—corporate speak that likely translates to fewer Azure outages, fewer broken Windows patches, and fewer out-of-band emergency fixes.Gallot's appointment signals a shift in how Microsoft thinks about its security business. Nadella specifically highlighted her ability to combine ""product building with value realization for customers."" She'll also oversee Ales Holecek, who takes on a newly created Chief Architect for Security role.The timing isn't random. During last week's earnings call, Nadella talked up momentum in security products like Security Copilot agents and Purview. The company clearly wants someone who can sell security as aggressively as they build it.Nadella's memo doesn't spell out exactly why engineering quality needs its own dedicated leader at this moment. But the clues aren't hard to find. Microsoft now uses AI to write around 30 percent of its own code, Azure outages remain a recurring headache, and Copilot adoption sits at a modest 3.3 percent among Microsoft 365 users. Bell's got his work cut out.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre.

Meet Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei: Former OpenAI researcher who turned his AI vision into a $3.7 billion company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meet-anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-former-openai-researcher-who-turned-his-ai-vision-into-a-3-7-billion-company/articleshow/127943143.cms,"Source: Bloomberg

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s academic background and early career path



Dario Amodei’s rise at OpenAI and the birth of GPT models



Dario Amodei leaves OpenAI and builds Anthropic



Dario Amodei’s cautious leadership style



Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now. He is not a loud public figure, and he rarely chases attention, but his work has quietly shaped how modern AI systems are built and controlled. Before running a multi-billion-dollar company, Amodei spent years in labs and research roles, studying complex systems and how they behave under pressure. That background still shows in how he talks about artificial intelligence today. While others focus on speed and scale, he appears more concerned with safety, limits, and long-term risks. As AI moves faster than regulation, Amodei’s cautious approach is becoming harder to ignore.Before AI became the world’s favourite buzzword, Amodei was deep in academia. He studied physics at Stanford University and later earned a PhD in biophysics from Princeton. At the time, he was focused on understanding complex biological systems. Cells. Signals. Patterns that emerge rather than being designed. Looking back, that mindset fits AI almost too well.After completing his doctorate, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine.There was no clear path to becoming a tech billionaire. That part came later. Almost accidentally, it seems. Amodei eventually moved into machine learning research, joining companies like Baidu and Google Brain. At Google, he worked on neural networks and AI safety.Colleagues from that period say he already seemed concerned about failure modes. In 2016, he joined OpenAI. Things moved fast after that.At OpenAI, Amodei rose quickly. By 2019, he was Vice President of Research, helping set the organisation’s overall research direction. He led work on GPT-2 and GPT-3, models that changed public perception of AI almost overnight.These systems could write essays, answer questions, and even mimic conversation. Sometimes convincingly. Sometimes awkwardly. During this time, Amodei also co-invented reinforcement learning from human feedback. RLHF sounds technical, but the idea is simple. Teach AI systems by showing them what humans actually prefer, not just what scores well mathematically.In 2021, Amodei left OpenAI along with six others, including his sister Daniela Amodei. They founded Anthropic. Some people were sceptical at first. But Anthropic took a different route. It became a public benefit corporation. That detail mattered. It signalled that profit would not be the only priority. At least in theory. Their AI model, Claude, leaned into being cautious. Less dramatic. More restrained. That tone appealed to companies worried about reputational risk.By September 2025, Anthropic was reportedly valued at $183 billion by private investors. That number raised eyebrows. Especially for a company without much public hype.Partnerships with Alphabet and Amazon helped fuel that growth. So did rising concerns about AI safety across governments and corporations. As Anthropic’s valuation climbed, so did Amodei’s wealth. His real-time net worth now sits around $3.7 billion, ranking among the world’s richest people.Amodei does not sound like most tech CEOs. He hedges. A lot. “It seems.” “It might.” “We’re not fully sure yet.” That language annoys some people. Others trust it more. He avoids grand predictions. No promises of utopia. No claims that AI will solve everything.Experts say his influence shows up in quieter ways. Safety research is becoming mainstream. Alignment discussions moving from fringe to boardroom. Competitors are copying ideas they once ignored. No one really knows what comes next for Dario Amodei. AI is moving fast. Faster than regulation.","Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now.

Oracle is staring down the possibility of its largest-ever workforce reduction—and at the heart of it is a $300 billion partnership with OpenAI that's proving far more expensive than anyone initially let on.Investment bank TD Cowen reported this week that Oracle is weighing cuts of 20,000 to 30,000 jobs. The move would free up an estimated $8 to $10 billion in cash flow, money the company desperately needs as it tries to bankroll a sprawling network of AI data centers built largely to serve Sam Altman 's company.TD Cowen puts the OpenAI commitment alone at around $156 billion in capital spending—and roughly 3 million GPUs to back it up. Oracle has already burned through $58 billion in debt in just two months. That's $38 billion for data centers in Texas and Wisconsin, $20 billion for a campus in New Mexico. Total debt now sits north of $100 billion.The kicker? That $58 billion covers only a slice of what's actually needed. Since its September 2025 peak, Oracle's stock has shed more than half its value—about $463 billion in market cap, gone.The financing crunch isn't just an Oracle internal issue anymore.Multiple US banks have quietly retreated from lending on Oracle-linked data center projects. TD Cowen noted that lenders have roughly doubled the interest rate premiums they charge Oracle since September, pushing borrowing costs into territory usually reserved for junk-rated companies.The result? Several data center leases Oracle had been negotiating simply stalled. Private operators couldn't get the funding to build, which means Oracle can't deliver the capacity its customers—especially OpenAI—are counting on. Some Asian banks are still willing to step in, but that doesn't solve the immediate problem in the US, where most of Oracle's expansion is planned.Oracle isn't sitting idle. The company is now requiring new customers to pay up to 40% of contract value upfront—essentially asking clients to co-fund the infrastructure. It's also exploring ""bring your own chip"" arrangements, where customers supply their own hardware.On the table too is a potential sale of Cerner, the healthcare software unit Oracle bought for $28.3 billion in 2022. That would be a significant strategic pivot, signaling that AI infrastructure is now the clear priority—everything else is up for grabs.TD Cowen also flagged that OpenAI has already begun shifting some near-term capacity needs over to Microsoft and Amazon, which is not exactly a vote of confidence in Oracle's ability to deliver on schedule.The company has not publicly commented on the layoff reports or the financing difficulties.","Oracle faces massive job cuts, potentially 20,000-30,000, to fund its costly $300 billion OpenAI partnership. The tech giant has already spent $58 billion on data centers and is struggling with rising borrowing costs. This financial strain is impacting Oracle's ability to deliver crucial AI infrastructure.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127835680,imgsize-18640,width-400,resizemode-4/127835680.jpg"
"Egypt bans Roblox nationwide over child safety concerns, raising global questions about kids' online freedom",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/egypt-bans-roblox-nationwide-over-child-safety-concerns-raising-global-questions-about-kids-online-freedom/articleshow/127935398.cms,"Source: Bloomberg

Roblox faces a government ban in Egypt: Here’s why



What this ban means for kids and parents



Roblox going dark in Egypt, the platform that lives almost entirely on screens, the sudden loss felt very real. With games loading, Avatars running around blocky worlds. And then Egypt has officially banned Roblox, saying the move is about protecting children from harmful online content. The story underneath feels layered, political, and a little messy. Roblox looks harmless on the surface but experts say the risk is not the visuals but the interaction. The platform allows users to create games, chat with strangers, and move freely between user-generated worlds.A spokesperson confirmed the company has reached out to Egyptian authorities, offering dialogue to resolve the issue and restore access. The company says it has worked with regulators in other regions to build localised safety systems that align with cultural values. Last year, the company restricted some features across parts of the Middle East to address safety concerns. This ban did not come out of nowhere. Roblox has already been blocked or restricted in countries like Qatar and Turkey with other nations watching closely.The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.According to state-run media, the ban will be coordinated with the National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority. That means internet providers are expected to block access nationwide with no single official explanation was released at first. Later, state outlets pointed to growing concerns about children’s exposure to inappropriate content, online interactions, and psychological risks as reported by Bloomberg. An Egyptian senator had already called for regulating Roblox to protect children’s moral and educational values.President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi recently called for limits on children’s phone use, pointing to similar moves abroad. Australia has banned social media for certain age groups. France is moving in the same direction. Egypt’s parliament is now discussing broader rules for digital platforms including unified age classifications, stronger verification, penalties and possibly forcing companies to have local representatives inside the country.For children, the ban feels abrupt and confusing. For parents, reactions are mixed. Some welcome the move, while others worry it pushes kids toward less visible, less regulated platforms, potentially exposing them to more risks. That is the irony experts often point out. When one door closes, another usually opens. Sometimes darker, more unpredictable, and harder to monitor.Still, supporters of the ban argue that Roblox’s scale makes it different. Millions of users. Constant interaction. Endless content that cannot realistically be watched, moderated, or controlled by humans alone, leaving significant safety and privacy concerns for young players and families.","The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.

Anime-themed games on Roblox are everywhere right now. Some fade fast. Others stick around because they keep players coming back. Anime Paradox seems to fall into the second category. At first glance, it looks like another tower defence title with familiar anime faces and flashy attacks. But spend a little time with it, and the grind becomes obvious. Progress slows quickly, upgrades demand patience, and free rewards feel essential rather than optional for anyone hoping to stay competitive.

Cook gets philosophical about succession and retirement

A record-breaking quarter sets the stage

Apple CEO Tim Cook has confirmed the company is planning a celebration to mark its 50th anniversary this April, telling employees he’s been “unusually reflective” about the milestone.“When you really stop and pause and think about the last 50 years, it makes your heart sing. It really does. I promise some celebration,” Cook said during an all-hands meeting on Thursday, as reported by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.Apple was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in a garage in Los Altos, California. The company has since grown into the world’s most valuable publicly traded firm, with over 2.5 billion active devices worldwide.The 50th anniversary reflections weren’t the only thing on Cook’s mind. The 65-year-old CEO also opened up about leadership transitions, saying he spends considerable time thinking about who will steer Apple in the future.“I am obsessed with this—who’s in the room 15 years from now,” Cook said, per Bloomberg. He described the recent retirements of COO Jeff Williams, environmental affairs head Lisa Jackson, and general counsel Katie Adams as carefully planned moves, “not surprises.”Hardware chief John Ternus is widely seen as a frontrunner to eventually succeed Cook, having recently expanded his oversight to include design work at Apple.The anniversary comes at a strong moment for Apple financially. The company just posted its biggest quarter ever with $143.8 billion in revenue, fuelled by a 23% jump in iPhone sales. Cook called the demand “simply staggering” during the recent earnings call, with records set across every geographic region.Cook also used Thursday’s meeting to address immigration concerns among employees and talk up Apple’s AI ambitions, calling artificial intelligence “one of the most profound opportunities of our entire lifetime.”While details of the 50th anniversary plans remain under wraps, Apple marked its 40th in 2016 with a video compressing four decades of innovation into 40 seconds. Whatever Cook has planned this time, the stage is certainly set for something bigger.","Apple was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in a garage in Los Altos, California.

Concerns raised over Nvidia-OpenAI deal

Jensen Huang’s u-turn on OpenAI

Possible reason behind tension between OpenAI and Nvidia

Sam Altman has defended OpenAI ’s partnership with Nvidia, saying that the AI company “loves working” with the chip maker. Sharing a post on X, Altman described Nvidia’s chips as “the best AI chips in the world.” He added that OpenAI hopes to remain a “gigantic customer” of the chip maker for a long time. “We love working with NVIDIA and they make the best AI chips in the world. We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time,” Sam Altman said adding “I don't get where all this insanity is coming from”.Sam Altman’s comments come amid growing market speculation around OpenAI’s long-term computing strategy and reports suggesting that Nvidia may be reassessing the pace of its investments linked to OpenAI.In September 2025, Nvidia announced to make a planned investment of $100 billion in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. In a joint announcement, OpenAI President Greg Brockman and Jensen Huang called the deal “the largest computing project in history.” The deal was expected to close within weeks, however, negotiations have dragged on for months.But, a Wall Street Journal report recently said that the talks have been stalled after some inside the chip giant expressed doubts about the deal.The report quotes people familiar with the matter who said that Huang has privately pointed to growing competition from companies such as Google and Anthropic.More pointedly, he has reportedly criticised what he sees as a lack of discipline in OpenAI's business approach and raised concerns about growing competition from Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude.Speaking to reporters outside a Taipei restaurant on January 31, Nvidia CEP Jensen Huang said “Yes, Nvidia will invest in OpenAI. Yes, it'll be big. But $100 billion? ""No, no, nothing like that.""A day later, Huang took a u-turn. ""It was never a commitment,"" he told reporters on February 1. ""They invited us to invest up to $100 billion and of course, we were very happy and honored that they invited us, but we will invest one step at a time”.Huang also brushed off a report of tension with OpenAI, saying the idea was “nonsense” and that Nvidia planned a huge investment in OpenAI.As per a Reuters report , ""Nvidia’s graphics processing chips are well-suited for massive data crunching necessary to train large AI models like ChatGPT that have underpinned the explosive growth of AI globally to date. But AI advancements increasingly focus on using trained models for inference and reasoning, which could be a new, bigger stage of AI, inspiring OpenAI's efforts. The ChatGPT-maker’s search for GPU alternatives since last year focused on companies building chips with large amounts of memory embedded in the same piece of silicon as the rest of the chip, called SRAM. Squishing as much costly SRAM as possible onto each chip can offer speed advantages for chatbots and other AI systems as they crunch requests from millions of users."" Last year, OpenAI struck deals with AMD and others for GPUs built to rival Nvidia’s. In fact, sources say OpenAI's deal with AMD didn't go very well with partner Nvidia.This AI inference has become the new front in the competition. The decision by OpenAI and others to seek out alternatives in the inference chip market marks a significant test of Nvidia’s AI dominance and comes at a time when the two companies are in investment talks.","Sam Altman has defended OpenAI’s partnership with Nvidia, saying that the AI company “loves working” with the chip maker.

Tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush has now warned that Wall Street is overrating to the rise of artificial intelligence, pushing software companies as if they are obsolete. Speaking to Bloomberg TV in an interview, Ives explained the present downturn as unprecedented, “In 25 years, this structural sell-off in software is unlike anything I’ve ever seen. ” Software giants such as Salesforce, ServiceNow and Microsoft have been hit hard with valuations suggesting investors expect declining relevance in the AI era. As per Ives, some models even imply that these companies could lose about 5% of their customer base in the coming years.Ives also acknowledged that AI is reshaping the industry, but he rejected the notion that software companies are facing any kind of extinction. “Software doesn’t have space in today’s AI age” is how investors seem to be treating them, he said, but emphasized that this view is misguided. Explaining his stance, Ives pointed to Palantir Technologies as an example of a software company which is thriving by integrating AI into its offerings. The message: AI may be disruptive, but it is also an opportunity for software firms to evolve and remain central to the tech ecosystem.Ives’ comments align with those of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who recently dismissed the idea of software obsolescence at the Cisco AI Summit. Huang called the notion “illogical,” stressing that AI systems fundamentally rely on software and cannot replace it.“There's this notion that the tool ‌in the ‍software industry is in decline, and will be ‍replaced by AI ... It is the most illogical ‌thing in the world, and time will prove itself. If you were a human or robot, artificial, general robotics, would you use tools or reinvent tools? The answer, obviously, is to use tools ... That's why the latest breakthroughs in AI are about tool use, because the tools ‍are designed to be explicit,” Huang said at the event.Huang argued that AI will continue to rely on existing software rather than rebuild basic tools from scratch, pushing back against investor fears of AI-driven disruption in the data and professional services industry.","Wall Street is overrating the rise of artificial intelligence, says Wedbush's Dan Ives.

Google-parent Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon are collectively expected to invest nearly $700 billion into capital expenditure in 2026. As reported by CNBC, this three-digit number has unsettled the analysts and investors. The spending surge represents an increase of 60% from the previous year (2025). This large investment underscores the sale of the AI arms race and it also raises concerns about cash flow and profitability in the near future.As per the CNBC report, this bulk investment from the tech giants will be directed towards high-priced chips, sprawling data centers and advanced networking technology needed to power AI models and cloud services. Amazon has revealed the most aggressive plan, forecasting around $200 billion in apex. On the other hand, Alphabet is close behind with up to $185 billion this year. Microsoft and Meta are also pretty close and together the tech giants are investing around $700 billion this year in AI.This spending spree from Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon comes at a cost. The four companies generated a free cash flow of $200 billion in 2025 which is down from $237 billion in 2024.The analysts are now expecting a much shorter decline in this number. Amazon has projected to run negative free cash flow of $17 to $18 billion in 2026, whereas Alphabet has already turned debt markets raising $25 billion in bonds last November as its long-term debt has quadrupled to $46.5 billion.As per the report, the investors have now responded with caution. Amazon’s shares fell almost 6% on Friday, extending its year-to-date decline to 9%. Microsoft has dropped 17% this year, the steepest among the group, while Alphabet and Meta have managed slight gains. The mixed performance reflects both optimism about long-term AI growth and anxiety over near-term financial strain.Wall Street analysts argue that the upfront investments are necessary to secure dominance in AI, but the short-term impact is clear: margin pressures, reduced cash generation, and reliance on debt and equity markets.

Markets unhappy with Amazon’s quarterly earnings

Big spending plans worry investors

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has slipped behind Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in the global wealth rankings after Amazon’s latest earnings report failed to meet market expectations. According to Forbes Billionaires List 2025, Jeff Bezos’ net worth was reduced by $16 billion (6.9%) to $218.9 billion, trailing behind Zuckerberg with $226.6 billion net worth. Elon Musk remains the world’s wealthiest person with a net worth of $839.4 billion, followed by Google cofounders Larry Page ($267.3 billion) and Sergey Brin ($246.6 billion).Shares of Amazon fell sharply after the company posted quarterly earnings slightly below estimates and signalled much higher future spending. According to Forbes, Amazon shares dropped about 9.3% on February 6 to around $202. The fall came after the company reported earnings of $1.95 per share for the latest quarter, missing Wall Street estimates of $1.97 per share. Revenue rose to $213.4 billion, which was higher than expected, but investors focused more on profits and future costs.The stock drop reduced Jeff Bezos’ personal wealth, allowing Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to move ahead of him. Market concerns were reportedly linked to Amazon’s growing capital expenditure (Capex) plans, especially around artificial intelligence (AI) and infrastructure.During the earnings call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company expects capital expenditure of around $200 billion in 2026.He said the spending would support demand for AI products, custom chips, robotics, and low-orbit satellites. The figure is about 36% higher than what Wall Street had projected. Analysts at MoffettNathanson said the increase was larger than expected and raised concerns about returns.Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft together expect to spend around $610 billion in 2026, mainly driven by AI-related investments. While companies say the spending supports long-term growth, investors remain cautious about costs and near-term returns.","Shares of Amazon fell sharply after the company posted quarterly earnings slightly below estimates and signalled much higher future spending.

Siri will remain the default assistant, with its button and wake word unchanged.

To use AI apps, drivers will need to open the app within CarPlay, though developers can design them to launch voice mode automatically.

This ensures Apple maintains control over the CarPlay experience while expanding functionality.

Increasing demand for AI in cars



Apple’s own AI push



Apple is reportedly preparing to bring a major update to its CarPlay vehicle interface which will enable the drivers to access third-party AI voice assistants such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Gemini. This move marks the first time Apple will permit outside voice-control within CarPlay, breaking Siri’s long-standing exclusivity. As reported by Bloomberg, the company is working to support apps in CarPlay and the change is said to come in coming months.Until now, Siri has been the only voice assistant integrated into CarPlay. Siri is responsible for handling music playback, messaging and navigation. However, with the upcoming change, the drivers will now be able to query AI chatbots directly via CarPlay. For instance, asking ChatGPT for restaurant recommendations — without taking their hands off the wheel. However, Apple has not yet commended on the matter.Consumers have increasingly sought broader AI capabilities beyond Siri’s scope, often resorting to workarounds like syncing iPhone widgets to CarPlay. The integration of ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini will streamline access, making AI-powered queries more natural in the driving environment.Apple is also working to enhance Siri with “World Knowledge Answers”, a feature that will add web search and summarisation abilities similar to ChatGPT. The company last updated CarPlay with widgets and a Liquid Glass interface in iOS 26, and is slowly rolling out CarPlay Ultra, which can control in-car functions like seat adjustments and climate settings.","Siri will remain the default assistant, with its button and wake word unchanged.

How Google DeepMind's Genie 3 model can help Waymo



""no substitute""

""can simulate virtually any scene.""

Waymo is using DeepMind's Genie 3 artificial intelligence (AI) model to create realistic digital environments where its autonomous vehicles can train on rare and difficult driving scenarios. The Alphabet-owned self-driving company recently published a blog post announcing its new Waymo World Model. This AI model is built on Genie 3's ability to construct virtual environments from text prompts. The system generates synthetic driving footage and depth perception data, as if captured by vehicle-mounted cameras and lidar sensors.In a statement to Bloomberg, a Waymo spokesperson said,and the new world modelWaymo's system can also convert real-life dashcam datasets into scenes and depth maps for vehicle simulations. The company said this combination will make its autonomous vehicle systems more reliable in uncommon scenarios and help expand Waymo's self-driving services across more markets.the spokeswoman added.Last week, Google DeepMind’s Genie 3 model gained major attention with demonstrations of its world-building capabilities. This also triggered a sell-off in companies that provide game development and graphics creation tools.By incorporating Google's Genie 3 model, Waymo could gain momentum for its plans to expand to about a dozen cities this year. Simulation is just one tool it uses to prepare its autonomous systems for specific situations and validate their safety, the spokesperson noted.In December 2025, the company said there isfor its real-world driving experience. Recently, Alphabet reported Waymo had surpassed 20 million autonomous trips that month.However, the company spokesperson declined to comment on whether it has conducted simulations of stopped school bus encounters or mass power outages, such as the one that disrupted its San Francisco operations last year. Yet, she noted the Waymo World ModelWaymo is currently facing safety probes from US authorities after a series of software mishaps in recent months. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating multiple incidents in which Waymo failed to stop for parked school buses in Austin. These violations have also prompted the company to issue a voluntary recall of its software.Beyond Waymo, other robotaxi operators and AI companies have been seeking additional data sources to improve their models. Nvidia, which supplies chips and AI models for developers of self-driving technology, has partnered with ride-hailing company Uber to collect millions of hours of robotaxi-specific driving data to fuel driverless model training and validation.SoftBank Group-backed Wayve, which plans to trial robotaxis on the Uber platform in the UK this year, has announced its own world model to generate synthetic driving data. Elon Musk ’s Tesla has also said that it has built a similar simulator.

What is Pilloo AI launched for small business owners, and what is it all about



How Pilloo AI aims to change small business life



How Piloo AI works



Record daily sales.

Track payments.

Get balance sheets.

Automate purchase entries and bank transactions.

In India, millions of small business owners are reportedly held back by complex systems and paperwork. But now, this new AI may help small business owners to stage for a future where businesses run on conversation rather than forms and screens. It might also accelerate India’s digital economy, particularly in smaller towns and cities where leaning to technological based might be slower.Pilloo AI, reportedly the country’s first voice-based billing and accounting agent, was officially launched in Andhra Pradesh . The event had Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu in attendance, along with top bureaucrats, local politicians, and the Pilloo AI team.No more fiddling with complicated software and no more staring at spreadsheets. Instead, business owners can now just talk, ask for invoices, check reports, and even record transactions all in their own language.Pilloo AI is an AI-powered billing and accounting platform developed by Pilloo AI Private Limited, headquartered in Andhra Pradesh. It is designed specifically for small and medium businesses that often struggle with complicated software and manual bookkeeping.The tool lets business owners do a lot just by speaking. You can create invoices, record daily transactions, track payments, fetch reports, and even manage balance sheets.It also automates purchase entries and bank transactions.Interestingly, it works through natural conversation. You don’t need accounting knowledge, rather your own language. Currently, this knows 5 Indian languages, with plans to expand to over 50 globally.For decades, small businesses relied on pen, paper, or clunky software. Many owners still keep manual records, especially in smaller towns. Ram Mohan, co-founder of Pilloo AI, reportedly said it’s about breaking that barrier. “We wanted something anyone could use. No screens, no paperwork, no fear,” he mentioned.The launch event at the Andhra Pradesh Secretariat was reportedly lively. CS Vijayanand, MLA Prathipati Pulla Rao, Muthavarapu Suresh, and investors of Pilloo AI were present. Naidu himself apparently highlighted how tools like this make life easier for entrepreneurs and promote digital growth.Sai Praneeth G, founder of Pilloo AI, explained the platform helps business owners in very simple ways.But experts caution that AI isn’t perfect. Errors can happen, such as mishearing numbers or missing a transaction. Still, early tests reportedly show the platform is surprisingly accurate.","Pilloo AI is an AI-powered billing and accounting platform developed by Pilloo AI Private Limited, headquartered in Andhra Pradesh.

This contrasts with Elon Musk and Sundar Pichai's ambitious plans for orbital AI infrastructure, citing terrestrial power limitations. While Google aims for test launches in 2027, Garman highlights the immense practical hurdles.

“It is just not economical,”

What are AWS CEO Matt Garman ’s concerns about AI data centres in space

“There are not enough rockets to launch a million satellites yet, so we're, like, pretty far from that. If you think about the cost of getting a payload in space today, it's massive,”

What Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk said about AI data centres in space

“36 months or less. Maybe 30 months.”

“harder to scale on the ground than it is to scale in space”.

“about five times the effectiveness”

“day-night cycle, seasonality, clouds, or an atmosphere.”

“the atmosphere alone results in about a 30% loss of energy”

“they’re quite reliable past a certain point.”

“At Google, we are always proud of taking moon shots,""

one of our moon shots is how do we one day have data centres in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun?”

“put these data centres in space closer to the sun”

“first step in 2027.”

“We'll send tiny racks of machines and have them in satellites, test them out, and then start scaling from there. But there's no doubt to me that a decade or so away will be viewing it as a more normal way to build data centres,”

Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman has dismissed the feasibility of space-based data centres. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Garman called the concept uneconomical in a recent interview. His comments undermine the huge confidence shown by tech leaders, including SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.Garman said at the Cisco AI Summit in San Francisco. To explain his distrust, he cited the high cost of launching payloads into orbit and insufficient rocket capacity to support the infrastructure required for orbital data centres, Reuters reported.This comes as both Musk and Pichai have shared their ambitions to build artificial intelligence (AI) training data centres in space to reduce dependence on Earth’s resources.Last month, Musk announced the merger of SpaceX and xAI. One reason for the move is to establish a support system for the development of data centres in outer space. In a memo, Musk said it will be critical because ""global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions.""In November 2025, Google announced Project Suncatcher. This is the Pichai-led company’s orbital data centre initiative, which could begin test launches as early as next year.Garman pointed towards the practical barriers that make the concept ‘impossible’ even in the coming years.he said, as per the Reuters report.The debate over space-based computing facilities has emerged as AI’s rapid expansion creates demands for computing power and cooling that challenge traditional land-based data centres, prompting cloud computing companies to explore alternative solutions.In a recent Dwarkesh podcast, Musk said that the cheapest place to deploy AI would be in space. He suggested that this could happen withinCiting limits on terrestrial power generation, Musk argued that it isHe said space-based solar panels offerbecause there is noHe added thatand that batteries would not be needed for these data centres, as they’ll be solar-powered.

The ‘promotion’ that fractured OpenAI board



Read full email that Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott's sent to CEO Satya Nadella and other leaders



[This document is from Musk v. Altman (2026).]

From: Kevin Scott

Sent: Sunday, November 19, 2023 7:31 AM

To: Frank X. Shaw, Satya Nadella, Brad Smith, Amy Hood, Caitlin McCabe

Frank,

I can help you with the timeline and with our best understanding of what was going on. I think the reality was that a member of the board, llya Sutskever, had been increasingly at odds with his boss, Sam, over a variety of issues.

One of those issues is that there is a perfectly natural tension inside of the company between Research and Applied over resource allocations. The success of Applied has meant that headcount and GPUs got allocated to things like the API and ChatGPT. Research, which is responsible for training new models, could always use more GPUs because what they're doing is literally insatiable, and it's easy for them to look at the success of Applied and believe that in a zero sum game they are responsible for them waiting for GPUs to become available to do their work. I could tell you stories like this from every place l've ever worked, and it boils down to, even if you have two important, super successful things you're trying to work on simultaneously, folks rarely think about the global optima. They believe that their thing is more important, and that to the extent that things are zero sum, that the other thing is a cause of their woes. It's why Sam has pushed us so hard on capacity: he's the one thing about the global optima and trying to make things non-zero sum. The researchers at OAl do not appreciate that they would not have anywhere remotely as many GPUs as they do have if there were no Applied at all, and that Applied has a momentum all its own that must be fed. So the only reasonable thing to do is what Sam has been doing: figure out how to get more compute.

The second of the issues, and one that's deeply personal to llya, is that Jakub moreso than Ilya has been making the research breakthroughs that are driving things forward, to the point that Sam promoted Jakub, and put him charge of the major model research directions. After he did that, Jakub's work accelerated, and he's made some truly stunning progress that has accelerated in the past few weeks. I think that Ilya has had a very, very hard time with this, with this person that used to work for him suddenly becoming the leader, and perhaps more importantly, for solving the problem that Ilya has been trying to solve the past few years with little or no progress. Sam made the right choice as CEO here by promoting Jakub.

Now, in a normal company, if you don't like these two things, you'd appeal to your boss, and if he/she tells you that they've made their decision and that it's final, your recourse is accept the decision or quit. Here, and this is the piece that everyone should have been thinking harder about, the employee was also a founder and board member, and the board constitution was such that they were highly susceptible to a pitch by Ilya that portrays the decisions that Sam was making as bad. I think the things that made them susceptible, is that two of the board members were effective altruism folks who all things equal would like to have an infinite bag of money to build AGI-like things, just to study and ponder, but not to do anything with. None of them were experienced enough with running things, or understood the dynamic at OAI well enough to understand that firing Sam not only would not solve any of the concerns they had, but would make them worse. And none of them had experience, and didn't seek experience out, in how to handle something like a CEO transition, certainly not for the hottest company in the world.

The actual timeline of events through Friday afternoon as I understand them:

Thursday late night, the board let's Mira know what they're going to do. By board, it's Ilya, Tash, Helen, and Adam.

Mira calls me and Satya about 10-15 minutes before the board talks to Sam. This is the first either of us had heard of any of this. Mira sounded like she had been run over by a truck as she tells me.

OAl Board notifies Sam at noon on Friday that he's out, and that Greg is off the board, and immediately does a blog post.

OAl all hands at 2P to rattled staff.

Greg resigns. He was blindsided and hadn't been in the board deliberations, and hadn't agreed to stay.

Jakub and a whole horde of researchers reach out to Sam and Greg trying to understand what happened, expressing loyalty to them, and saying they will resign.

Friday night Jakub and a handful of others resign.

Microsoft chief technology officer, Kevin Scott, sent an email to CEO Satya Nadella and president Brad Smith, along with other C-suite executives, explaining the series of events that led to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in November 2023. An email, dated November 19, 2023, suggests that the “shock” firing was not the result of a single ideological clash, but rather a mix of a variety of issues between llya Sutskever and Altman.The email, posted by X handle Internal Tech Emails, said that Sutskever “had been increasingly at odds with” Altman over two primary friction points. The first point of failure was an internal ‘battle’ over computing power. As ChatGPT’s popularity surged, the demand for GPUs became a zero-sum game within the company.According to Scott, Altman’s decision to prioritise GPU for the consumer products and API division infuriated the core research teams because they felt the fundamental work was being “starved” of the resources needed for the next generation of models.The second conflict was deeply personal to Sutskever, who – according to Scott’s email – had a hard time with the promotion of Jakub Pachocki, a researcher who had previously worked under Sutskever.After Pachocki spearheaded several major research breakthroughs, Altman promoted him to lead OpenAI’s core model development. While Scott characterised the move as “logical from a CEO perspective,” it alienated Sutskever.","Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott sent email to CEO Satya Nadella and other leaders.

SpaceX, xAI merger and Musk’s $800 billion+ wealth

Soon after the historic merger of SpaceX and xAI, Elon Musk has announced a recruitment drive. The billionaire is calling for “elite” engineers to join SpaceX and Starlink as the company moves towards building AI-powered data centres in space. Musk amplified the posts shared by Michael Nicolls, Vice President of Starlink Engineering at SpaceX, confirming that the company is hiring across multiple critical disciplines to develop “AI satellites”.“We are hiring for many critical engineering roles to develop the technologies for AI satellites in space at our facilities in Austin and Seattle. Solar, process, automation, manufacturing, mechanical, electrical, optics, software... come build space data centers with great engineers at SpaceX and Starlink,” said Nicolls. Musk replied, “Help take humanity to the stars!”In the second post, Nicolls said, “We are also hiring elite engineers at our new 230 MeV cyclotron facility in Florida, where we are bringing single-event radiation testing in house to accelerate development across all SpaceX vehicles.”Musk replied, “Not many companies have cyclotrons!”. Cyclotron is a type of compact particle accelerator.The roles on offer include Antenna Engineer (Starlink), Antenna Engineer, Satellites (Starlink), Antenna Software Engineer, Satellites (Starlink) and more.The recruitment push follows Musk’s personal net worth crossing the $800 billion mark, and signals a move to integrate high-level AI capabilities directly into the Starlink satellite constellation. The expansion also marks a synergy between Musk’s recently merged entities. By combining xAI’s large-scale intelligence models with SpaceX’s orbital infrastructure, Musk is positioning Starlink to handle massive AI workloads that were previously restricted to terrestrial servers.Last month, Musk's AI-company xAI posted job openings to expand its team of AI talent. The company announced that it is looking to hire a “small, elite unit” of talent engineers who will function as a specialised force to hunt and hire the “absolute best people in the world.”According to a job listing on the xAI website, this new unit will report directly to Musk, who is looking for engineers who happen to be “people persons”, and successful applicants should have a history of building “cool products” that date back to their childhood.",Elon Musk is calling for “elite” engineers to join SpaceX and Starlink.

AMD feels the squeeze via TSMC



Intel and AMD have reportedly notified Chinese customers of significant supply shortages for server CPUs, with Intel warning that delivery lead times have increased to as long as six months. The “crises” of supply chain instability was recently highlighted by Apple CEO Tim Cook, clarifying that it’s not the memory shortage due to high prices but constraint are due to unavailability advanced nodes on which its M and A series chips are built.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the constraints are a direct result of the global increase in demand for components for Artificial Intelligence (AI) infrastructure. While much of the focus has been on AI-specific GPUs, the massive shift toward “agentic AI” has placed a strain on the traditional CPUs.The report mentions that in China, a market that accounts for more than 20% of Intel’s total revenue, the shortage is hitting the fourth- and fifth-generation Xeon processors hard. Citing sources familiar with the matter, Reuters said that Intel is now rationing deliveries to manage a substantial backlog of unfulfilled orders.The scarcity has already triggered a price hike, with Intel server products in China generally rising by more than 10%.“Inventory is at its lowest level in Q1,” said Intel, adding that it is “addressing the issue aggressively” and expects improvements throughout the remainder of 2026.AMD is also feeling the pressure, and has informed clients of constraints that have pushed lead times out to eight to 10 weeks. AMD’s bottleneck is tied to its partnership with TSMC, which is also the chip manufacturer of Apple and Nvidia. The Taiwanese foundry giant has prioritised high-margin AI chip manufacturing, leaving limited capacity for the standard CPUs that AMD designs.“We remain confident in our ability to meet customer demand globally based on our strong supplier agreements,” the company stated.","Intel and AMD have reportedly notified Chinese customers of significant supply shortages for server CPUs, with Intel warning that delivery lead times have increased to as long as six months.

Behind Silicon Valley’s wealth and innovation lies a quieter story of migration, struggle, and relentless effort. Many of today’s most powerful Indian-origin executives arrived in the US with little more than strong academic foundations, technical skills, and a willingness to start at the bottom. They navigated cultural barriers, visa constraints, and hyper-competitive workplaces, often spending years in engineering, product, or strategy roles before reaching the top.Their contributions now underpin the Valley’s tech ecosystem, from cloud computing and cybersecurity to AI models, digital media, and global platforms used by billions. At the same time, Silicon Valley and the broader American technology ecosystem provided an environment where talent, risk-taking, and merit could translate into opportunity, allowing these executives to grow alongside the companies they helped build. Together, they illustrate how Indian-origin talent has become integral to Silicon Valley’s leadership and long-term technological direction.Balaji Krishnamurthy ’s appointment as Uber’s Chief Financial Officer in 2026 marked a significant moment for Indian-origin leadership in Silicon Valley’s financial ranks. An alumnus of IIT Madras, where he trained as an engineer, Krishnamurthy later earned an MBA from Stanford Graduate School of Business, a combination that positioned him well for roles bridging technology and finance.Early in his career, he worked at McKinsey & Company, advising large corporations on strategy, operations, and capital allocation. He later joined Google , where he held senior finance and strategy roles tied to long-term investments and emerging business lines. At Uber, Krishnamurthy oversees budgeting, investor relations, regulatory risk, and profitability across ride-hailing, food delivery, and logistics, making him central to the company’s effort to balance growth with financial discipline.Rahul Patil has emerged as a central figure behind Anthropic’s rapid rise in the AI race, with Claude increasingly positioned as a product capable of blowing traditional SaaS software away. Claude is doing this by acting as a single, flexible intelligence layer that can replace multiple point solutions, handling tasks such as writing, data analysis, customer support, coding assistance, research, and internal workflows within one interface. Instead of companies paying for separate SaaS tools, Claude can adapt to different functions through prompts and integrations, reducing software sprawl. Its ability to understand context across long documents, reason over complex tasks, and integrate directly into enterprise systems allows it to perform work traditionally spread across entire software stacks.Sundar Pichai’s rise from Chennai to the top of Google and Alphabet is often cited as one of Silicon Valley’s most emblematic success stories. After earning an engineering degree from IIT Kharagpur, he moved to the US to study at Stanford University and later completed an MBA at Wharton. Pichai joined Google in 2004 and quickly made his mark leading products such as Google Toolbar and Chrome, which became one of the world’s most widely used web browsers. Over time, he took charge of Android and other core platforms before being named CEO of Google in 2015 and Alphabet in 2019. Today, Pichai oversees search, advertising, cloud computing, YouTube, and the company’s AI strategy, managing a business that sits at the heart of the global internet economy.Satya Nadella’s leadership is widely credited with reshaping Microsoft’s trajectory in the modern tech era. Born and educated in India, Nadella moved to the US for graduate studies and joined Microsoft in 1992. He spent decades inside the company, holding senior roles across enterprise software, cloud services, and developer platforms. When he became CEO in 2014, Microsoft was struggling to adapt to mobile and cloud-first computing. Nadella led a cultural reset that emphasised collaboration and innovation, while steering the company decisively toward cloud infrastructure through Azure. Under his leadership, Microsoft also made major investments in AI and enterprise software, helping it regain relevance and emerge as one of the world’s most valuable technology companies.Jay Chaudhry’s path to Silicon Valley success began far from the tech campuses of California. Raised in a small village in Haryana, he later moved to the US for higher education, earning multiple degrees in engineering and management. Chaudhry founded several cybersecurity companies before launching Zscaler in 2007. The company challenged traditional network security by adopting a cloud-native, zero-trust model that eliminated the need for on-premise hardware. Under his leadership, Zscaler became a critical security provider for global enterprises and governments, particularly as remote work and cloud computing expanded.

Premature to expect AI-led job cuts



Goldman Sachs has said that it deploying fully autonomous AI agents designed to automate complex, process-intensive roles within the investment bank, and these autonomous digital co-workers are powered by Anthropic’s Claude model. In an exclusive interview with CNBC, Goldman’s Chief Information Officer, Marco Argenti, revealed that the firm has spent the last six months co-developing these “digital co-workers” alongside engineers from the AI startup.“Think of it as a digital co-worker for many of the professions within the firm that are scaled, are complex and very process intensive,” he said. The report also said that the initiative is part of a multiyear reorganisation led by CEO David Solomon to center the bank’s operations around generative AI.Goldman transitioned to Anthropic’s Claude models after the bank successfully tested AI coding assistants for its engineers. Argenti told the publication that the team was “surprised” to find that the model’s reasoning capabilities in handling high-stakes financial operations.“Claude is really good at coding. Is that because coding is kind of special, or is it about the model’s ability to reason through complex problems, step-by-step, applying logic,” Argenti was quoted as saying.Goldman’s next step would be to see whether AI agents can offer same level of automation in other departments. “There are these other areas of the firm where we could expect the same level of automation and the same level of results that we’re seeing on the coding side,” he said.Goldman may next develop AI agents for tasks like employee surveillance or making investment banking pitchbooks, he said.While talking a bout AI-led job cuts, Argenti said that it was “premature” to expect that this technology will lead to less headcount.“It’s always a trade-off. Our philosophy right now is that we’re injecting capacity, which in most cases will allow us to do things faster, which translates to a better client experience and more business,” Argenti added.","Goldman Sachs has said that it deploying fully autonomous AI agents designed to automate complex, process-intensive roles within the investment bank.

Apple-Google partnership



Apple has reportedly shut down “Project Mulberry,” an effort to develop an AI-powered virtual health coach even as the company radically rethinks its wellness strategy. The decision is said to be driven by Services Chief Eddy Cue, marking a step back from a standalone ‘Health+’ subscription model. According to a report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the move follows a major leadership transition within Apple’s health division after longtime executive Jeff Williams retired last year.Citing internal sources, Gurman says that Apple wound down the Mulberry initiative in recent weeks. The project was originally intended to debut with iOS 26 as an AI-driven service that would analyse Apple Watch data and lab reports to offer personalised well-being recommendations.Since taking the reins of the health division, Eddy Cue has reportedly expressed dissatisfaction with Apple’s pace of innovation. Cue has told colleagues that newer competitors like Oura and Whoop are delivering more compelling software experiences than the Apple Health app.The report pointed out that instead of a standalone coach, Apple now plans to offer a fragmented release of AI features, wherein individual AI health tools will be rolled out incrementally within the existing Health app for iPhones.Wellness videos produced at Apple’s Oakland, California, studio will be integrated into the standard app experience.Apple is also facing tougher competition in the health-tracking market from Samsung and fitness platforms like Strava. Meanwhile, OpenAI also moved into the space with the launch of ChatGPT Health to analyse health data, answer questions and provide feedback.A few weeks ago, Apple announced that it is partnering with Google to use its Gemini AI models to power AI features on its devices like the iPhone.“Apple and Google have entered into a multi-year collaboration under which the next generation of Apple Foundation Models will be based on Google’s Gemini models and cloud technology. These models will help power future Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year,” the companies said in a joint statement.There is a possibility that Apple may use Google’s technology to supercharge the iPhone maker’s health coach. Samsung’s health features on watch and the Samsung Health app are powered by use a mix of Samsung’s in-house AI models (Samsung Gauss) and Google's Gemini.","Apple has reportedly shut down ‘Project Mulberry,’ an effort to develop an AI- powered virtual health coach.

Big Tech's $70 Billion AI Move: Silicon Valley Bets On India, Snubs Trump's 'America First' Diktat

How AI has been affecting Silicon Valley jobs

Facebook parent Meta has announced that it will cut 102 more jobs at its San Francisco Peninsula offices. The latest round of layoffs comes as the company shifts investment from its metaverse division to wearable technology. The company filed these job cuts with California's Employment Development Department, which will affect Meta's corporate locations on the San Francisco Peninsula in Silicon Valley, including facilities in San Mateo County and the company's Menlo Park headquarters.In an email (seen by the Silicon Valley Business Journal), a Meta spokesperson said,The announcement follows Meta's earlier decision to scale back its Reality Labs division by 10%. That team handles augmented reality products and services, including the metaverse. In recent months, Meta also cut 318 jobs at its Menlo Park division.Last month, the company’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said that Meta's teams are becoming leaner and more productive as the company invests $115 billion or more in AI tooling to increase output.He also said that AI has enabled a single employee to do the work of an entire team.Despite significant workforce reductions, Meta increased its headcount by 6% last year, reaching over 78,000 employees by the end of December 2025, according to its fourth-quarter earnings report.According to executive recruitment firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, nearly 55,000 layoff notices were credited to AI. Last year, San Francisco-based Salesforce warned of potential layoffs affecting 4,000 employees as it develops AI agents to handle customer support tasks.AI-related workforce reductions have continued into 2026, with several major tech companies also citing AI as a factor in reducing headcount.In recent weeks, Pinterest cut more than 100 jobs in the Bay Area, pointing to a shift toward ‘AI-proficient talent.’ Google and Amazon have also announced layoffs.Google recently eliminated 77 positions in Sunnyvale, while Amazon reduced 666 jobs in Silicon Valley as part of an AI-focused restructuring.",Facebook parent Meta has announced that it will cut 102 more jobs at its San Francisco Peninsula offices.

He argued Apple's hands-off approach benefited them, contrasting with Meta's extensive research into platform harms. This revelation surfaces amid an ongoing lobbying battle between the tech giants over online child protection responsibilities.

Zuckerberg's email came a day after damning Instagram research went public

Apple and Meta are already locked in a lobbying war over child safety

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took aim at Apple in an internal email to top executives, complaining that the iPhone maker faces far less scrutiny on child safety issues despite doing far less about them. The 2021 email, now unsealed as part of a New Mexico lawsuit against Meta, shows Zuckerberg arguing that Apple's hands-off approach has ""worked surprisingly well for them. """"Apple, for example, doesn't seem to study any of this stuff. As far as I understand, they don't have anyone reviewing or moderating content and don't even have a report flow in iMessage,"" Zuckerberg wrote to executives including then-COO Sheryl Sandberg and head of global affairs Nick Clegg.The email, dated September 15, 2021, landed in inboxes just one day after The Wall Street Journal published findings from Meta's own internal research. That research, leaked by whistleblower Frances Haugen, revealed that 32 percent of teen girls said Instagram made them feel worse about their bodies. The subject line read: ""Social issue research and analytics — privileged and confidential.""Rather than address the findings head-on, Zuckerberg questioned whether Meta should change how it studies its platforms' harms altogether. He argued that companies like Apple, YouTube, and Snap face less heat simply because they don't investigate their own impact as thoroughly.""I think we should be commended for the work we do to study, understand, and improve social issues on our platforms,"" Zuckerberg wrote, adding that media coverage tends to weaponise internal research rather than credit Meta for doing the work.The email adds fresh context to the ongoing clash between the two tech giants over who should be responsible for protecting kids online. Meta has been pushing for laws that require app stores like Apple's to verify users' ages, while Apple argues individual apps should handle age checks themselves. At least three US states have already passed legislation siding with Meta's position, with more expected to follow.Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said the company ""is proud of our continued commitment to doing transparent, industry-leading research.""","Mark Zuckerberg wrote an internal email to top executives in 2021 criticizing Apple's handling of child safety issues.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s defense

Amazon stock witnessed a plunge of 11% in extended trading on February 5, erasing more than $250 billion in market value after the company introduced a $200 billion capital expenditure plan for 2026. According to a report by CNBC, this was the highest plunge among the megacap tech firms, far exceeded Wall Street expectations by over $50 billion and sparked investor concerns about the pace and scale of spending. Amazon reported spending $131 billion on property and equipment in 2025, which is up from $38 billion in 2024, underscoring the rapid escalation of investment.As per the CNBC report, on a conference call with analysts, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy defended the spending blitz and stressed on the fact that investments are important to meet the surging demand for AI compute capacity. “This isn’t some sort of quixotic, top-line grab,” Jassy said. “We have confidence that these investments will yield strong returns on invested capital. We’ve done that with our core AWS business. I think that will very much be true here as well. ”Jassy further added that the capital will go towards data centers, chips and networking equipment, enabling Amazon Web Services (AWS) to scale faster. He also noted that AWS sales grew by 24% to $35.6 billion in the most recent quarter, its fastest growth in 13 quarters, but added that growth could have been higher if the company had more capacity.The cloud unit of Amazon added nearly 4 gigawatts of computing capacity in 2025 and expects to double that power by 2027, Jassy said. He described AWS’s expansion as “scrappy,” emphasising that demand is outpacing supply.Pressed on how the AI market is evolving, Jassy likened it to a “barbell” structure: AI-native labs on one side, enterprises on the other, and a middle segment of companies experimenting with applications. “That middle part of the barbell very well may end up being the largest and most durable,” he said, suggesting long-term opportunities for AWS as enterprises adopt AI for productivity and cost savings.","Amazon stock witnessed a plunge of 11% in extended trading on February 5, erasing more than $250 billion in market value.

The company has 2.3 lakh employees in India, accounting for nearly 55% of its global workforce of 4.2 lakh, making the country a key growth engine. After Accenture, which employs about 3.5 lakh people in India out of 7.7 lakh globally.Capgemini has the second-largest employee base among multinational IT firms in the country. In eight years, Capgemini more than doubled its India headcount, crossing the 2-lakh employee mark.Under Ashwin Yardi, former Capgemini India CEO and now non-executive chairman of the Board in India, the firm expanded its workforce from 105,500 to nearly 180,000. Capgemini’s $3.3 billion acquisition of WNS last year added not just clients but scale—over 44,000 of WNS’ 65,000 employees are based in India, taking the overall tally to about 2.3 lakh. According to the Capgemini Technology Services India report, during FY2024–25 the company reported revenue and other income of Rs 30,090 crore, compared with Rs 28,727 crore in the previous year, reflecting growth of 4.7%. Profit stood at Rs 3,709 crore, up from Rs 3,239 crore a year earlier.Phil Fersht, CEO of HfS Research, said Capgemini’s India footprint highlights how central the country has become to multinational IT firms’ global operating models. “This is no longer just about cost arbitrage. India is now the primary delivery engine for digital, engineering, cloud, and increasingly AI-led work. Having over half of its global workforce in India gives Capgemini scale, talent depth, and flexibility that are hard to replicate elsewhere. ” In an interview with TOI last year, Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat said India is integral to its operations—from innovation and product development to industry expertise—and continues to grow in importance. On hiring, he said the firm planned to add over 45,000 people in the last financial year, with roughly 40% being freshers. “Despite productivity gains from automation, we see a growing demand for technology continues to require more talent,” he added. When TOI asked whether firms are seeing real impact from AI yet, he said the benefits are visible but largely confined to specific projects rather than at scale. “You might see 30% productivity gains in a small team, but replicating that across the enterprise takes time because each use case requires validation, testing, and approval,” he noted. On whether AI adoption will suddenly accelerate, he said it is expected to be incremental as AI touches every function and business process. “However, areas such as customer service and marketing are witnessing faster uptake since they require fewer structural changes.”Fersht added that this level of concentration raises strategic questions. “Firms with such heavy India exposure need to continuously move up the value chain to protect margins, manage talent churn, and reduce overdependence on effort-based delivery. The winners will use India not just for volume, but as a platform for higher-value transformation, engineering, and AI execution,” he said.","Capgemini has the second-largest employee base among multinational IT firms in the country.

Biomimetic AI robot Moya: The robot that feels warm and acts more like humans



World’s first ‘biomimetic AI robot’ debuts in Shanghai

When is Moya expected to launch, and the mechanism



Social media reactions to the world’s first biomimetic AI robot Moya



A Chinese robotics startup has revealed the world’s first “biomimetic AI robot”, a humanoid machine that doesn’t just look human, but tries to feel human too, with warm skin, human-like walking, subtle gestures, Cameras sitting quietly where eyes should be, and everything almost feels like a human. Her name is Moya, which suggests that she isn’t just a showpiece, but there’s real engineering and sophisticated AI underneath the eerie exterior.Still, she looks like a robot because of the skin texture, which looks like a faint plastic sheen. The movements are a little stiff, eyes don’t quite land right, but linger for a moment, and something changes. Disturbingly lifelike robots have been popping up more often in 2026. Moya might be the clearest sign yet that humanoid AI is stepping out of demos and into public life.One detail keeps coming up: Moya’s skin is warm, unlike a cold, metal-like robot. Droidup, the Shanghai-based startup behind her, says the robot maintains a body temperature between 32°C and 36°C. Li Qingdu, Droidup’s founder, reportedly believes robots designed to serve people shouldn’t feel lifeless. The idea is emotional connection and familiarity.Whether that actually works is debatable. A robot that feels alive but isn’t can trigger a strange, creeping reaction. The kind you don’t quite know how to explain.Still, Droidup seems serious about this approach. Moya is being pitched for healthcare, education, and public-facing roles. Droidup claims her walking accuracy hits 92 percent, though how that’s measured isn’t fully clear. That said, her internal skeleton, known as Walker 3, has a pedigree. A previous version reportedly won a bronze medal at the world’s first robot half-marathon in Beijing back in 2025.They allow her to track faces, read movement, and respond with what Droidup calls “micro expressions”. Tiny facial responses designed to mimic human reactions. Paired with onboard AI, this is why the company describes Moya as a “fully biomimetic embodied intelligent robot”.Moya is expected to launch in late 2026. The price is eye-watering. Around ¥1.2 million, which works out to roughly £127,000. The company reportedly sees robots like Moya working in public service roles such as train stations, banks, museums, and shopping centres.Comment sections have already lit up with uneasy jokes. Some say she looks like a burglar deterrent. Others admit they’d panic if she walked toward them in the dark. Designers have long known that near-human robots trigger discomfort. Perfect machines feel safe. Imperfect humans feel familiar. The space between is tricky. Humanoid robots are no longer just lab experiments. CES 2026 made that clear. But despite the hype, experts say we’re still far from household androids. She’s not here to replace humans at home. She’s here to test how comfortable we are sharing space with machines that almost feel alive.As reported by the SCMP, this AI robot is formed with an advanced AI allowing to perceive and act in the real world. Out of this, social media users react to this AI robot unveiled. With users reacting to the new AI robot unveiling announcement:More AI marriages coming soon 😂 Perfect to keep creepy neighbors at bay 😂Just wait for the first ai me too movement😂 She looks like she’s straight out of K-popThat's not close to a human, that's just uncanny","Chinese startup unveils world’s first ‘biomimetic AI robot’ Moya is a humanoid machine that doesn’t just look human, but tries to feel human too.

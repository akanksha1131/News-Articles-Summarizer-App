From Pop Star to Tech Star: A New Billionaire Emerges

Lucy Guo's OnlyFans' Rival Passes Controversy

A New Era for Women in Business

The world now has a new youngest self-made woman billionaire and she is a techie. Carnegie Mellon University dropout Lucy Guo has claimed the title of the world’s youngest self-made billionaire, surpassing pop icon Taylor Swift , according to a recent Forbes report. Guo’s meteoric rise in the tech industry has positioned her as a trailblazer, highlighting the growing influence of women in entrepreneurship.Taylor Swift, previously recognized as the youngest self-made billionaire, has been dethroned by 30-year-old Lucy Guo. Swift, known for her chart-topping hits like Love Story and her business acumen in the music industry, held the title due to her massive earnings from music, tours, and endorsements. However, Guo’s innovative contributions to the tech world have now eclipsed Swift’s financial milestone.Lucy Guo’s ascent to billionaire status is largely attributed to her 5% stake in Scale AI , a data annotation firm she co-founded in 2016 with business partner Alexandr Wang. The company specializes in providing labeled data to train artificial intelligence applications, serving major clients in industries like autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and e-commerce. Forbes estimates Guo’s net worth at $1.3 billion, driven by Scale AI’s soaring valuation.Guo is optimistic about the evolving landscape of entrepreneurship. In an interview with Forbes, she stated, “I think we’re about to see a lot more entrepreneurs be women and valuations grow at a tremendous rate. I wouldn’t be surprised if someone else took the title next year, but it’s really exciting to see.” Her confidence reflects a broader trend of increasing diversity in the tech and business sectors.Despite her billionaire status, Guo maintains a surprisingly modest lifestyle. “I still live a very frugal lifestyle,” she shared with Forbes. “For lunch, I get ‘buy one get one free’ all the time or, like, the 50%-off deals. But the one day I decide I need a private jet, maybe I’ll sell some shares, but at the moment I’m very happy flying commercial.” This grounded approach sets her apart in a world often associated with extravagant spending.Addressing her new title, Guo expressed admiration for Taylor Swift, noting, “She has always struck me as someone that’s very pro-woman and wants other people to win. I am a huge fan of her; I think she’s an icon.” Guo’s comments highlight a mutual respect between the two, despite their competition for the billionaire title.Beyond Scale AI, Guo has ventured into other entrepreneurial pursuits, including co-founding Passes, a platform positioned as a rival to OnlyFans. Passes aims to empower content creators by offering a subscription-based model. However, the platform faced scrutiny earlier this year when a content creator filed a lawsuit alleging that Passes distributed sexually abusive material involving her while she was underage. The controversy has raised questions about the platform’s content moderation practices, though Guo has not publicly commented on the issue.Guo’s achievement marks a significant moment for women in tech and entrepreneurship. Her success with Scale AI and her forward-thinking approach to business underscore the potential for women to lead in high-growth industries. As Guo herself predicts, the coming years may see even more women breaking barriers and claiming top spots in the billionaire rankings.With her wealth, influence, and innovative mindset, Lucy Guo is poised to continue shaping the tech industry. Whether through Scale AI, Passes, or new ventures, her journey as a self-made billionaire is just beginning. As she told Forbes, the rapid pace of change in entrepreneurship means the title of youngest billionaire may soon pass to another visionary—potentially another woman pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.","Lucy Guo has claimed the title of the world’s youngest self-made billionaire, surpassing pop icon Taylor Swift.

Updates on Apple Intelligence

Likely hardware announcements at WWDC 2025

Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) kicks off on June 9, 2025, promising a week of groundbreaking software announcements that will shape the future of its ecosystem. Running through June 13, the event will feature a keynote from Apple CEO Tim Cook at 10 a.m. PT (10.30 pm IST), streamed on Apple’s website, Developer app, and YouTube channel, alongside an in-person experience for select developers at Apple Park. Like every year, the event will be big on software.With the tagline “Sleek Peek,” WWDC 2025 will see updates to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS, with a focus on design and AI integration. The headline announcement is expected to be a redesign of Apple’s operating systems, potentially rebranded with a year-based naming scheme: iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26. Reports suggest iOS 26 will undergo its most significant overhaul since iOS 7, introducing a unified design language with floating tab views, updated iconography, and glass-like UI effects inspired by the Vision Pro’s aesthetic. This cohesive look aims to rival Google’s Android 16 revamp, prioritizing fluidity and personalization across devices.Apple Intelligence, introduced in 2024, will see further enhancements, though not as the centerpiece. Rumors indicate Apple will open its Foundation Models to third-party developers, enabling custom AI-powered features in apps like Safari and Photos, which may be quietly rebranded as “AI-powered.” A long-awaited Siri overhaul remains in development but is unlikely to debut fully. Additionally, an AI-powered coding tool, possibly in partnership with Anthropic, could be introduced for Xcode, streamlining app development.iPadOS 26 may introduce a “Pro” version with advanced multitasking, improved external display support, and professional-grade apps, catering to power users. watchOS 26 is expected to support third-party Control Center widgets, while tvOS 26 could feature a revamped CarPlay UI and animated lock screen artwork. visionOS 26 may bring native support for gaming controllers like PlayStation and Xbox, alongside minor UI tweaks to bolster Apple’s spatial computing push.Hardware announcements are less likely, as Apple’s recent M4 MacBook Air release and focus on fall hardware events suggest a software-driven WWDC. However, speculation persists about a potential M4 Ultra chip reveal or Mac Pro updates, though these are considered long shots.Developers will have access to over 100 technical sessions, online labs, and one-on-one consultations with Apple experts, covering topics like Swift, machine learning, and AR/VR tools. The Swift Student Challenge will also spotlight emerging talent, with 50 Distinguished Winners invited to a three-day Apple Park experience.As Apple aims to balance innovation with its privacy-first ethos, WWDC 2025 is set to lay the groundwork for a smarter, more cohesive ecosystem, with iOS 26 leading the charge. Stay tuned for live updates as Apple unveils its vision for the future.","Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) kicks off on June 9, 2025.

North Korea reportedly experienced an internet significant outage on Saturday (June 7), lasting several hours and disrupting access to government websites and official news services. The widespread disruption effectively severed the nation from global cyberspace. While the cause of the outage remains unclear, researchers monitoring North Korea's internet and technology infrastructure suggest it was likely an internal issue rather than a cyberattack.According to news agency Reuters, the assessment is based on the fact that connections through both China and Russia, typically used by North Korea, were also affected.During the outage, key North Korean websites, including its main official news services, the Foreign Ministry, and the national airline Air Koryo, were inaccessible. Service began to slowly return around midday, according to checks conducted by the news agency.As per a UK-based researcher who monitors North Korea's internet, even email services were impacted.“Hard to say if this is intentional or accidental - but seems like this is internal rather than an attack,” the researcher said.Martyn Williams, an expert on North Korea's technology and infrastructure at the Washington-based Stimson Center, also said that the internal nature of the problem was indicated by the non-functioning Chinese and Russian connections.In previous years, North Korea has faced extensive internet outages that were suspected to be the result of cyberattacks. The nation is claimed to have operated sophisticated elite teams of hackers, including the government-backed Lazarus group, which has been implicated in attacks against foreign institutions and companies, and more recently, in the theft and laundering of cryptocurrencies.","Key websites including that of foreign ministry, national airline affected.

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to prevent the country from drone attacks. Reacting to Trump’s latest executive order, a White House executive said that it addresses threats fromas well as potentially more sophisticated adversaries. The order focuses on reducing national security and public safety threats posed by drones within the US. President Trump has also directed a task force to boost the detection and identification of drones in the country. The initiative also aims to address unlawful uses, such as spying and drug smuggling. This is a priority given upcoming events like the FIFA World Cup in 2026 and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.Sebastian Gorka, the senior director of counterterrorism at the White House National Security Council, said to reporters.He claimed that this order is the federal response to foreign-made drones and the protection of US military sites, critical infrastructure and large public events has been insufficient.He highglighted that the executive order will support the government's counter-drone capabilities. Gorka also mentioned that the FBI would begin training state and local law enforcement to improve their ability to protect against drone threats.The risks of drone warfare have become a priority after Russian strikes in Ukraine and Ukraine’s surprise attacks on aircraft inside Russia, Gorka noted.Gorka added.This order will also aim to advance US drone development and expand the technology’s commercial applications, including for deliveries and other uses.Meanwhile, talking with the reporters, Michael Kratsios, the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, said:Apart from this, Trump also signed orders intended to pave the way for a new generation of supersonic jets in the US and to promote the development of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, often referred to as air taxis.Kratsios added.",US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to prevent the country from drone attacks.

Indian professionals and their employers are increasingly exploring alternatives to H-1B visas, such as L-1 and O-1 visas, amid stricter scrutiny of H-1B applications and ongoing tech layoffs in the US, according to immigration experts cited by the Economic Times. Demand for EB-5 immigrant investor visas has also surged, with a 50% increase since January 2025, noted Sukanya Raman, country head - India & GCC practice team at Davies & Associates LLC. “These are in current status for Indian nationals, meaning visas are available, and they can receive authorization and travel documents in 3-6 months,” she told ET, highlighting their appeal for Indian families on H-1B visas whose children are nearing 21 and at risk of aging out.USCIS data shows a 27% year-on-year drop in shortlisted H-1B visa applications this year, the lowest since FY21, with the US approving 85,000 H-1B visas annually, of which Indians secure about 70%. The new Trump administration’s tightened H-1B scrutiny since early 2025, combined with layoffs at tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Intel, has heightened anxiety among Indian professionals.“Our clients are more fearful, especially about international travel and visa ‘stamping’ at consular posts abroad,” Joel Yanovich, an attorney at Murthy Law Firm, told the publication. “I don’t think a day goes by without clients asking if it’s safe to travel.”This has driven demand for L-1 visas (for intracompany transfers) and O-1 visas (for individuals with extraordinary abilities in fields like science, arts, or business), which lack the annual caps of H-1B visas. “Part of this spike is seasonal, tied to those not selected in the H-1B lottery, but it also reflects employers and individuals aiming to avoid anticipated H-1B scrutiny,” Yanovich said.Some companies are transferring employees to countries like Canada temporarily to qualify for L-1 visas, which can lead to EB-1C green cards for managers, Raman explained. Others are pursuing EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) visas for those with advanced degrees working in the US national interest, she added.Gnanamookan Senthurjothi, a US immigration attorney, told ET that the number of people seeking assistance for these visa options has risen in recent months.","Indian professionals and their employers are increasingly exploring alternatives to H-1B visas, such as L-1 and O-1 visas.

Allegations against Elon Musk: Immigration status and more

The background of the Musk-Trump fallout

Steve Bannon’s longstanding criticism of Elon Musk

The political and legal implications

The escalating feud between Elon Musk , the world’s richest entrepreneur, and former President Donald Trump has taken an explosive new turn. Steve Bannon , a former White House strategist and close Trump ally, has publicly urged Trump to investigate Musk’s immigration status and deport him “immediately.” This demand comes amid growing tensions between the billionaire CEO and the MAGA movement, which Musk once aligned with but has since distanced himself from.Bannon has also called for the federal government to seize Musk’s SpaceX company, invoking the Defense Production Act, in response to Musk’s threat to halt critical space missions. This article delves into the latest developments, the historical context of this feud, and the broader political implications of this extraordinary clash.On April 24, 2025, Steve Bannon made headlines by urging President Donald Trump to take decisive action against Elon Musk. On his podcast “War Room,” Bannon insisted that Trump should invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to seize SpaceX, Musk’s rocket company, citing Musk’s threat to decommission the Dragon spacecraft that transports astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS).The Defense Production Act, originally enacted during the Korean War, empowers the president to compel private companies to prioritize government contracts essential to national defense. Trump famously used the DPA during the COVID-19 pandemic to accelerate production of medical supplies. However, it is important to note that the Act does not explicitly authorize the government to seize private companies outright, raising legal questions about Bannon’s proposal.Bannon’s demand to seize SpaceX represents a dramatic escalation in the ongoing conflict. Musk later softened his stance, apparently backing off the threat to disable SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft, but the call to investigate his immigration status and suspend his security clearances remains a serious political pressure point.Bannon’s claims go beyond corporate control. He has expressed a “strong belief” that Elon Musk, a South African-born billionaire who became a naturalized US citizen, is in the country illegally and must be deported immediately. He demanded a formal federal investigation into Musk’s immigration status, asserting that Musk’s past and current actions warrant government scrutiny.In addition, Bannon has called for probes into allegations of Musk’s drug use and claims that Musk sought classified Pentagon briefings on China — claims Musk has vehemently denied, labeling some reports as “pure propaganda.” Bannon also suggested suspending Musk’s security clearances and revoking federal contracts across his business empire, including Tesla, SpaceX, and X (formerly Twitter).The rift between Elon Musk and Donald Trump did not happen overnight. Musk was once a prominent Trump supporter, serving briefly as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and acting as a key presidential adviser. The relationship began to sour publicly when Musk vocally opposed Trump’s legislative priorities, especially the “One Big Beautiful Bill” currently under Congressional consideration. Musk condemned the bill as a “disgusting abomination” and urged lawmakers to kill it.The personal animosity intensified further after Musk accused Trump’s administration of withholding files related to Jeffrey Epstein, insinuating the president was protecting himself. Musk’s public support for impeachment proceedings against Trump and favoring Vice President JD Vance as a replacement deepened the divide.Trump, in turn, has expressed disappointment and frustration with Musk’s break from their alliance. He has threatened to revoke billions in federal contracts and subsidies Musk’s companies currently enjoy. Speaking to reporters, Trump said, “I’ve helped Elon a lot,” but added that Musk had “gone crazy” and implied their relationship may be over.Steve Bannon has been an outspoken critic of Musk since early 2025. He has repeatedly called Musk a “parasitic illegal immigrant” and accused him of disregarding American values and traditions. Bannon argues that Musk was given unprecedented power within the Trump administration but ultimately used it to serve his own interests rather than the country’s.On his podcast, Bannon stated, “As soon as [Musk] didn’t think he ran the deal or got the adoration, he turned on President Trump, MAGA, and most importantly, the country.” Bannon claims Musk financially supports progressive politicians and is involved in efforts to impeach Trump and influence election outcomes. He warned Trump’s supporters to be vigilant against Musk’s alleged betrayals.This feud represents a rare convergence of political rivalry and national security concerns. Bannon’s call for deportation and company seizure is unprecedented for a tech entrepreneur of Musk’s stature. It raises significant questions about the limits of executive power, the role of immigration status in public discourse, and the use of government authority against private businesses.Musk’s companies are heavily intertwined with US government contracts, especially SpaceX’s critical role in national space and defense programs. Any disruption could have significant consequences for American space capabilities and technological leadership.","Former White House strategist Steve Bannon has publicly urged President Donald Trump to deport Elon Musk.

Morgan Stanley bull has this prediction for Elon Musk's EV company Tesla,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/morgan-stanley-bull-has-this-prediction-for-elon-musks-ev-company-tesla/articleshow/121603102.cms,"Tesla may not be interested in eVTOL anytime soon

Why eVTOL market may not a profitable bet yet

Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas has predicted that Elon Musk may be ""tempted to solve"" another ""problem"" by leveraging Tesla's expertise in artificial intelligence (AI), batteries and manufacturing. As per Jones, the problem is ""commercialising air taxis,"" also known as electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicles.In his latest research note, Jonas argued that Tesla may enter the nascent eVTOL market as these aircraft have long been predicted to revolutionise urban transport, yet even leading developers like Archer Aviation are still in the developmental phase.Last week, Archer's Midnight prototype, slated for its first deliveries later this year to Abu Dhabi, successfully completed a piloted flight test.According to a report by Fortune, while Jonas believes that solving this technological challenge aligns with the interests of Tesla engineers, he acknowledged that Tesla has indicated it is currently too stretched to seriously consider an eVTOL venture, without outright refuting the idea.The US government is reportedly keen on supporting the growth of flying cars. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy posted this week, ""eVOTLs [sic] are going to fundamentally transform how the public travels. Let’s make sure the US leads the way.""Currently, the eVTOL market faces significant hurdles. Several promising startups, including Lilium and Volocopter, have encountered financial difficulties before establishing commercially viable services. A key challenge in achieving stringent safety standards while ensuring full autonomy, as scaling the business typically requires removing costly pilots from the equation. Additionally, there aren't enough customers with pilot licenses to support widespread adoption.","Tesla may enter the nascent eVTOL market, says Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas.

FBI on how to safeguard against scammers

Scam Series: The ""Meme Malware"" WhatsApp Scam

The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) has issued an alert, advising all smartphone users in the US to be wary of scams designed to coerce them into sending money. These attacks, which often involve impersonating government agents, are a growing concern for law enforcement, it said.""Scammers are spoofing FBI phone numbers nationwide, impersonating government agents. Victims are tricked into thinking an arrest is imminent unless they send money,"" the bureau stated (via Forbes).""The FBI will never call you demanding money to get out of criminal charges. It’s a scam. Hang up and visit the FBI's ic3.gov to file a report,"" it addedNotably, New York State Police recently issued similar warnings, noting ""an ongoing phone spoofing scam"" that impersonates law enforcement or government agencies. These scammers demand personal information like Social Security numbers and threaten punitive action for non-compliance.As per the law enforcement agencies, these scams are designed to create fear and confusion by making calls appear to originate from trusted sources. This often leads victims to comply with demands or share sensitive information that can be used for further financial fraud.They also claim that scammers have started posing as bank investigators, fire department charity collectors and even claiming to be from jury duty, demanding payment to avoid penalties for alleged failure to appear.The FBI reiterates that these impersonation scams rely on intimidation tactics. Scammers typically use an urgent, aggressive tone, refuse to speak with anyone but the targeted victim, and urge victims to keep the demands secret from family, friends, or financial institutions.Demands for payment can vary, including prepaid cards, wire transfers, cash sent by mail or inserted into cryptocurrency ATMs, or even cash delivered to a courier at the victim's home.The FBI stresses that since these scams prey on natural fears, users should hang up immediately and that all law enforcement agencies will never make such threats by phone or text.","Scammers are spoofing FBI phone numbers nationwide, impersonating government agents.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shared an advice for aspiring tech professionals. The CEO recently appeared in a conversation with tech YouTuber Sajjaad Khade where he urged students to focus on building strong fundamentals in computational thinking , even as AI shapes the software industry. He stressed that despite AI’s growing role in coding, the ability to break down problems logically and design systematic solutions remains essential.

Most people want 100x returns

But play by 1x rules

Took me a while to figure out money.

Wealth took even longer.

But there’s one pattern I keep seeing

The biggest wins usually come from breaking the rules .

Not illegally. Just unapologetically

When I moved back to India post dot-com bust, I had -

No money

No plan

No safety net

Everyone had the same advice -

“Get a job. Play it safe. Rebuild slowly.”

Instead, I did something…

Stupid? Brave? Both

Started an Internet company in a country where there was no Internet

No D2C. No dating apps. No e-com playbook.

We didn’t follow demand. We created it.

And honestly, I’ve seen this play out again and again>

Creators who started before content was cool

Founders who launched when the market said “not now”

Brands that won by ignoring the rulebook

The rules are useful.

But at some point, you’ve got to know when to bend them.

So whether you’re building, creating or just figuring stuff out -

First learn the rules. Then, write your own

Because “play it safe” rarely makes history

Shark Tank India Judge and Shaadi.com founder Anupam Mittal recently shared a post on LinkedIn, reflecting on his entrepreneurial journey and the mindset required for outsized success. Mittal emphasised that while most people aspire to 100x returns , they often play by 1x rules, avoiding bold risks that could lead to transformative breakthroughs. In the long LinkedIn post, Mittal recalled his decision of moving back to India after the dot-com bust , despite having no money, no plan and no safety net. He wrote that instead of following the play it safe, he took a leap of faith and started his internet company in a country where internet was barely accessible. ""We didn’t follow demand. We created it,"" wrote Shark Tank India judge, highlighting how early creators, founders, and brands have succeeded by ignoring the rulebook and launching ideas when the market wasn’t ready.🤷🏻‍♂️✍🏼","Shark Tank India Judge and Shaadi.com founder Anupam Mittal shared a post on LinkedIn, reflecting on his entrepreneurial journey and the mindset required for outsized success.

Here’s what Milan Kovac wrote on X

Over the past 9+ years, I’ve had the immense privilege to work with some of the most brilliant minds in AI & engineering. I’ve built friendships that will last a lifetime.

This week, I’ve had to make the most difficult decision of my life and will be moving out of my position. I’ve been far away from home for too long, and will need to spend more time with family abroad. I want to make it clear that this is the only reason, and has absolutely nothing to do with anything else. My support for @elonmusk and the team is ironclad - Tesla team forever.

Joining Tesla in 2016 as an engineer in the core Autopilot team and then leading a part of it over the years under Elon was already more than I could have hoped for.

I’ll never forget the countless hardcore debugging sessions deep into the night with my awesome colleagues, through successive generations of Autopilot computers and related software stacks, which we’ve shipped to so many people around the world. The product has become so much more since then, and I honestly can’t drive much without it anymore. It will soon catch the world off-guard and will change the way people commute, at scale.

The transition to build & lead the Optimus group early 2022, when we had nothing but a couple Kuka arms arranged upside-down, was of another level for me. We had to build an entire platform: hardware & software all at once. And this amazing team did it. They did it, I didn’t.

It’s been so humbling to work with such talented people, and I’ve got entire faith in them pushing Optimus to the next level, together with the broader Tesla AI / engineering & production teams. My departure now will not change a thing.

I want to thank my colleagues @aelluswamy and @srihari__, who’ve been of a tremendous support over the many years we’ve worked together. But also all the outstanding leaders, engineers, recruiters, technicians, operators, HR partners and everyone I’ve been blessed to share a part of my life with.

Most importantly, I want to thank @elonmusk from the bottom of my heart for his trust and teachings over the decade we’ve worked together. Elon, you’ve taught me to discern signal from noise, hardcore resilience, and many fundamental principles of engineering. I am forever grateful.

Tesla will win, I guarantee you that.

Tesla’s head of the Optimus humanoid robot project, Milan Kovac, has announced his resignation, saying he needs to spend more time with family abroad. The move comes at a crucial time for Tesla as it doubles down on autonomous technology and robotics as key parts of its future. Sharing the news in a post on X, Kovac writes “I’ve been far away from home for too long, and will need to spend more time with family abroad. I want to make it clear that this is the only reason, and has absolutely nothing to do with anything else.”Kovac has been with Tesla for over nine years and was promoted to vice president of the Optimus program in September 2024. His leadership was seen as vital to the development of the Optimus robot, which Tesla hopes to mass-produce this year.According to a report by Bloomberg, Ashok Elluswamy , who currently leads Tesla’s Autopilot team, will take over Kovac’s responsibilities. Kovac’s exit comes as Tesla navigates ongoing challenges, including China’s export restrictions on rare-earth magnets, which are critical for robot production.","Milan Kovac has been with Tesla for over nine years and was promoted to vice president of the Optimus program in September 2024.

In a whirlwind saga that has captured the internet's attention, the long-simmering relationship between US President Donald Trump and tech mogul Elon Musk has finally imploded—and the timing couldn’t have been more theatrical. While political commentators, Musk fans, and MAGA loyalists pick sides, an old resurfaced clip from Trump's 2017 inauguration has become the unlikely centerpiece of the drama. The viral footage shows a teenage Barron Trump standing beside a visibly animated Elon Musk, and internet users are now convinced: Barron knew all along that this bromance was doomed.As the online world spirals into memes, speculation, and mockery, the underlying story has serious political and economic dimensions. From Trump’s new tax proposal that threatens Tesla’s bottom line to Musk’s public fallout with the president, the Musk-Trump divorce goes far beyond a simple social media spat. Here's a detailed breakdown of what led to the breakup, how Barron's now-iconic reaction became a meme-worthy prediction, and what this all means for the future of the tech-political alliance.Elon Musk and Donald Trump were once considered unlikely allies. During Trump’s presidency, Musk served on White House advisory councils and even appeared at several official events. While their ideologies often clashed—Musk being a vocal supporter of sustainable energy and Trump known for climate skepticism—the mutual benefits of their relationship were clear. Trump got to flaunt a high-profile tech billionaire’s approval, while Musk hoped to influence infrastructure and space policy.Despite moments of public camaraderie, friction was always bubbling beneath the surface. Musk resigned from Trump’s advisory council in 2017 over the US withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. Still, their interactions remained largely civil—until now.The conflict erupted in earnest when Trump, eyeing a 2024 comeback and eager to boost traditional US industries, introduced a tax overhaul that would cut federal subsidies benefiting electric vehicle makers like Tesla. Musk didn’t take it lightly. Calling the legislation a ""disgusting abomination"" in a series of X (formerly Twitter) posts, Musk accused Trump of sabotaging America’s clean energy future.Musk posted on X.Trump, never one to back down, fired back at a campaign rally in Ohio:And with that, the bromance publicly combusted.In the midst of this drama, a 2017 clip of Barron Trump and Elon Musk at the US Capitol surfaced and quickly went viral. While Musk can be seen excitedly clapping and reacting with animated enthusiasm—especially after Trump vowed to plant the American flag on Mars—Barron stood beside him, calm, unimpressed, and possibly even irritated.The moment passed unnoticed at the time. But in hindsight, internet detectives are convinced that Barron’s demeanor foreshadowed the eventual falling out.The reactions on X were instant and hilarious. Users began to speculate whether Barron was always aware of the inevitable rift between his father and Musk.one user wrote. Another joked,Someone posted alongside a clip,Some users went further, suggesting the contrast between Musk's chaotic energy and Barron’s composed demeanor was symbolic of the changing tides in Republican politics—young conservatives showing less enthusiasm for tech billionaires.Trump’s proposed tax cuts are part of a broader economic agenda that appears to favor fossil fuels and heavy industry—policies directly at odds with Musk’s clean energy empire. With tax breaks for EVs on the chopping block, Tesla could see a sharp decline in demand in the US market.Adding fuel to the fire, right-wing voices aligned with Trump have begun to question Musk’s immigration status. Musk, originally from South Africa, has US citizenship but critics have now raised alarms over his past visas and green card process, accusing him of benefiting from “elite favoritism.”“We’re looking into all foreign influences. No one gets a pass. Not even Elon,” one Trump ally said on Fox News.This prompted more outrage from Musk’s side, with allies claiming that Trump is targeting him because he no longer “bends the knee.”It’s hard to tell whether Barron Trump was merely tired or genuinely unimpressed with Musk. But that hasn’t stopped netizens from turning him into a prophetic icon.“Barron looked like he was already writing the breakup tweet in his head,” one X user quipped.Others interpreted his serious expression as a sign of maturity and a deeper understanding of the political theater unfolding around him.","The long-simmering relationship between US President Donald Trump and tech mogul Elon Musk has finally imploded.

Musk labeled the legislation the ""Debt Slavery Bill"" and the ""Big Ugly Spending Bill.""President Trump responded during a White House event, defending the bill and subsequently threatening to cancel government contracts associated with Musk's companies via a post on Truth Social. This led to a decline in Tesla shares .The public dispute between the two prominent figures has since drawn commentary from various business leaders, including Mark Cuban , Bill Ackman, Vinod Khosla and others.The former ""Shark Tank"" star Mark Cuban endorsed Musk’s idea of creating a new political party. Cuban reshared Musk’s poll on X with three check marksBillionaire Bill Ackman backed both Trump and Musk on X, advising them to ""make peace for the benefit of our country.""“We are much stronger together than apart,” he said with Musk responding, “You're not wrong.”Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham shared his thoughts X, saying, “A lot of people seem to be treating this as if it were just a beef.

If it's true, Trump is surely going to have to resign,” he wrote in a post on X.Vinond Khosla, who has been a critic of Musk, supported the Tesla CEO on his stand on deficit.“Despite our differences, I admire your speaking up on the deficit!” Notably, Khosla endorsed Kamala Harris and was engaged in verbal spat online with Musk multiple times.Anthony Scaramucci, who has been a critic of Trump, voiced his support for Musk.“Elon is right about Trump,"" the former Goldman Sachs investment banker said in an X post.In a separate post on Friday, Scaramucci said that ""Elon lasted 12 Scaramuccis,"" a tongue-in-cheek reference to his 10-day tenure as White House communications director before Trump fired him.In an X post, Sequoia partner Shaun Maguire praised Musk for sticking to his guns.“Elon leaves it all on the field. And he puts what he believes in ahead of himself. How can you not be inspired by that,” he added.According to Gary Cohn, IBM's vice chairman, things could be very different next week, cautioning against overreacting to the situation.“If we've learned one thing over the Trump administration, this is a few hours, the world could be completely different a week from now. It's not like the White House is sitting there only worried about the Elon Musk situation,” he said on CNBC.","Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump engaged in a public spat online.

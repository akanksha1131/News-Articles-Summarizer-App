France President’s new year pledge to protect children from social media

Australia Enforces World’s First Under-16 Social Media Ban, Sparks Global Debate| Global Pulse





After Australia, France is planning to ban social media for children under 15 years of age. According to a report by Reuters, France also plans to prohibit mobile phones in high schools from September 2026. Quoting local media, the news agency said that the move comes amid rising public angst over the impact of online harms on minors. Notably, the country has already banned smartphones in French primary and middle schools since 2018 and now wants to extend the ban to high schools.According to the Reuters report, President Emmanuel Macron has often pointed to social media as one of the factors to blame for violence among young people. In a New Year's Eve address, he pledged to ""protect our children and teenagers from social media and screens"", though he did not reference the legislative push.The Macron government plans to submit a draft legislation for legal checks in early January, Le Monde and France Info reported, per Reuters report. The country had passed a law in 2023 requiring social platforms to obtain parental consent for under-15s to create accounts, though technical challenges have impeded its enforcement.In June 2025, Macron said that he will push for social media regulation for all under 15 at the level of the European Union. The remarks were made after a fatal stabbing at a school in eastern France shocked the nation. In November, the European Parliament asked the EU to set minimum ages for children to access social media to combat a rise in mental health problems among adolescents from excessive exposure.","France also plans to prohibit mobile phones in high schools from September 2026.

The Chinese government has urged the Netherlands that Dutch officials “correct their mistakes” regarding the takeover of chipmaker Nexperia, and help in restoring the global chip supply chain. In a statement released this week, the Chinese commerce ministry described the Dutch administrative interference as “inappropriate” and “perplexing”.“China once again urges the Netherlands not to act unilaterally, but to immediately correct its mistakes and clear the obstacles to restoring the stability and security of the global semiconductor supply chain,” the Chinese commerce ministry said in a statement, as per news agency Reuters.The statement comes months after the conflict started when in September, the Dutch government took control of Nexperia to prevent its founder from allegedly moving sensitive technology and production facilities to China. In response, Beijing froze exports of Nexperia chips, which are critical components for the global automotive and consumer electronics sectors. Most of Nexperia chips are packaged in Chinese facilities.Dutch economic affairs minister Vincent Karremans has stood firm on the company’s move, defending the intervention as a matter of national security.“I wouldn't characterise it as enjoyable, but it was necessary. I don't let my decisions be guided by whether they're enjoyable or not,"" Karremans said. The Dutch government had briefly suspended its intervention in November as a ""gesture of goodwill"" while negotiations continued.As a result of this standoff, a “packaging bottleneck” has been created that threatens the flow of components to major European car manufacturers. Nexperia specialises in “discretes” and power semiconductors which are essentially the “workhorse” chips of modern vehicles. An export block from China could lead to factory slowdowns across the continent.","The Chinese commerce ministry described the Dutch administrative interference as “inappropriate” and “perplexing” The Dutch government took control of Nexperia in September to prevent its founder from allegedly moving sensitive technology and production facilities to China.

How Amazon is 'breaking law' claims the rights group

Who is Francesca Albanese





Amazon has received a legal notice from a prominent Jewish civil rights group. Reason a forthcoming book listed on Amazon's website. According to a report in the New York Post, National Jewish Advocacy Center has warned Amazon that selling a forthcoming book by a US-sanctioned United Nations official could violate federal sanctions law. In a post on Twitter, Mark Goldfeder, head of the National Jewish Advocacy Center, said that his organization notified the retail giant that Francesca Albanese, an Italian human rights lawyer, is banned from receiving payments or other economic benefits in the US. “Today we issued notice to Amazon and others about potential sanctions-violations connected to @FranceskAlbs new book,” Goldfeder wrote on Twitter. The hardcover, scheduled for release in April, is currently reportedly listed as a bestseller in the human rights category on Amazon’s website.The US reportedly sanctioned Albanese in July, with officials alleging she improperly coordinated with the International Criminal Court and engaged in political and economic warfare against the US and Israel. Goldfeder rejected allegations of censorship, saying the issue is not the book’s content but whether US companies may legally conduct business with a sanctioned individual.In his legal notice to Amazon and other distributors, Goldfeder warned that the company’s platform “promotes and sells Ms. Francesca Albanese’s publications, directly enhancing her revenue and conferring a financial benefit,” which he said falls outside protections for informational materials and could expose the retailer to civil penalties under US sanctions law. “Under federal law, property and interests of Specially Designated Nationals are blocked and may not be transferred or paid out without specific authorization,” he wrote Monday.Francesca Albanese is the UN special rapporteur on the Palestinian territories who sparked a furore after accusing Israel of genocide, apartheid and settler colonialism in UN reports and public statements. Both Israel and the US have rejected his claims as false and antisemitic. She is also the author of “When the World Sleeps: Stories, Words, and Wounds of Palestine,” a collection of essays and personal reflections on Israeli policies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.Goldfeder argues that Albanese’s designation as a Specially Designated National means all of her property and interests in property are blocked, barring US companies from transferring funds or providing services to her without authorization from the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. He wrote, ""Francesca Albanese was designated as a Specially Designated National (SDN) by OFAC in July 2025. Property and interests in property of SDNs are blocked and may not be transferred, sold, or otherwise disposed of without specific OFAC authorization or license. The failure to obtain a license prior to transacting with an SDN is a violation of IEEPA, 50 U.S.C. § 1705(a). This framework applies broadly under federal jurisdiction irrespective of the geography of the SDNs, extending to various commercial activities subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Violations of these sanctions can lead to civil penalties, administrative enforcement, and potential criminal liability under statutes including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA). Pursuant to the foregoing, transactions involving Ms. Albanese are prohibited for U.S. persons absent an OFAC license. The prohibition extends to royalties, advances, deferred payments, escrow credits, correspondent routing, and indirect facilitation.""","The National Jewish Advocacy Center has warned Amazon that selling a forthcoming book by a US-sanctioned United Nations official could violate federal sanctions law.

What hackers said about attacking ESA systems





The European Space Agency (ESA) has confirmed a cyberattack on some of its systems after a hacker offered to sell data allegedly stolen from the organisation. The agency's forensic investigation has revealed that servers located outside the ESA corporate network have been compromised. According to ESA, only a very small number of external servers may have been impacted.The compromised servers support unclassified collaborative engineering activities within the scientific community, the agency stated in a post on microblogging site X (formerly Twitter). ESA is conducting a forensic investigation and working to secure the compromised devices. All relevant stakeholders have been informed. The agency said it will provide further updates as soon as additional information becomes available from the ongoing investigation.In the X post, ESA wrote:“ESA is aware of a recent cybersecurity issue involving servers located outside the ESA corporate network. We have initiated a forensic security analysis—currently in progress—and implemented measures to secure any potentially affected devices.Our analysis so far indicates that only a very small number of external servers may have been impacted.These servers support unclassified collaborative engineering activities within the scientific community. All relevant stakeholders have been informed, and we will provide further updates as soon as additional information becomes available.”ESA's statement came after a hacker using the username '888' posted on BreachForums (a website where cybercriminals gather), claiming they broke into ESA's computer systems last month.The hacker is trying to sell 200 GB of data, a massive amount, which they say was stolen from ESA. This includes files from private online storage spaces where ESA keeps computer code.The hacker claimed they obtained source code (the instructions that make computer programs work), digital keys that grant access to systems, setup files, passwords and usernames, and secret documents.To prove their claims are real, the hacker even shared several screenshots showing some of the stolen information publicly online.","The European Space Agency has confirmed a cyberattack on some of its systems.

Billionaires are reportedly fleeing California to escape a crippling tax hike. The names include Google co-founder Larry Page; venture capitalist Peter Thiel; and David Sacks, a longtime venture capitalist and former member of the PayPal Mafia who now serves as President Donald Trump’s crypto czar. These billionaires are cutting ties with California because of a potential ballot measure that would tax 5% of their total wealth — which could reportedly run into billions of dollars. The controversial wealth tax, if passed, would affect anyone who was a California resident at the start of 2026.While Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist and former Facebook exec, claimed in a Twitter post that people's collective net worth of $500B left California for good on December 31, there are so far no official confirmations, except from David Sacks. In a Twitter post, Sacks confirmed his move to Texas. ""I’m pleased to end the year by announcing that Craft Ventures has opened an Austin office. God bless Texas and happy new year!,"" wrote Sacks.The White House AI czar has been publicly slamming the California Wealth Tax. ""After blindly funding the Left for years, Silicon Valley is finally realizing what time it is. Dinner time. And they’re on the menu,"" wrote Sacks in a social media post.""Why does California need a wealth tax? To fund the massive fraud. Red states like Texas and Florida don’t even have income taxes. Democrats steal everything, then blame job creators for their “greed,” Sack said in another post.Chamath Palihapitiya too has been publicly trashing the proposed Billionaire's tax. In a post that can be termed as warning to California government, he wrote, ""People I know, with a collective net worth of $500B, scrambled and left California for good yesterday. They took no risk because of the proposed asset seizure tax - introduced as a “Billionaire Tax”. Without these people, the California budget deficit will only get bigger. This hole gets filled in one of two ways: more borrowing from the bond market - who is purely financial and unforgiving or more taxes on everyone else. Meanwhile waste, fraud and abuse runs rampant from the hundreds of billions in revenues the state already collects,"" wrote Palihapitiya.Other billionaires who have blasted the tax include hedge funder Bill Ackman and Garry Tan, CEO of San Francisco-based startup accelerator Y Combinator. Ackman, who is not a California resident, said that “literally no one would stay” if the tax passes. Gary Tan too warned flatly in a tweet: “Passing this tax will destroy innovation in California.”","Billionaires are reportedly fleeing California to escape a crippling tax hike.

Support staff would transfer these calls to a special internal line. Operators there would answer as 'Bill Gates's office'.

“The Old New Thing”

""The Boss,""

""Bill Gates's office.""

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

What Raymond Chen said about Microsoft making customers talk to Bill Gates

A colleague of mine who used to work in product support told me that they had a procedure if a customer became irate and demanded to speak with Bill Gates. (This was, of course, back in the days when Bill Gates still ran the company.)

The product support technician would apologise for not resolving the problem to the customer’s satisfaction, but if the customer continued to demand to speak with The Boss, the technician would indeed transfer the customer.

The customer was transferred to a special internal phone number, and when the operators saw a call on that line, they took the call and said, “Bill Gates’s office.” They weren’t actually in Bill Gates’s office. They were just pretending to be Bill Gates’s secretary. Their job was to tell the caller that Mr. Gates is currently unavailable, but if the customer leaves a message and their contact information, they will pass the information to Mr.

Gates.

Of course, I assume¹ the information was never actually passed along to Bill. The information went back into the product support channel with a note that the customer was escalated to “Bill Gates’s office.” The technician who returned the call would probably say something like “Bill Gates asked me to contact you to follow up on an issue you had earlier.”

¹ Maybe Bill got a copy or a summary of these messages, I don’t know.”





Microsoft had a clever solution for irate customers demanding to speak with Bill Gates . The company used to transfer their calls to a special internal line where operators answered, ""Bill Gates's office,"" without actually connecting them to the CEO. In hisblog, veteran Microsoft engineer Raymond Chen shared the insider procedure that product support staff used to handle such situations while keeping customers satisfied.He said when a customer (typically a high-value one) became angry enough during a support call to demand speaking with Gates, staff followed a specific protocol. First, they apologised for not resolving the issue to the customer's satisfaction. If apologies failed and the customer continued demanding to speak withsupport staff transferred the call to a designated internal phone number. When operators saw an incoming call on that special line, they answered withIn his blog post, Chen wrote: """,Microsoft had a clever way to handle angry customers demanding to speak with Bill Gates.

Microsoft turned fifty-year-old this year. In the year Microsoft turned 50, CEO Satya Nadella announced one of the biggest-ever leadership overhaul and some big hires. Microsoft hired former Meta engineering boss Jay Parikh. The company also and elevated senior executives, including commercial head Judson Althoff and Ryan Roslansky, chief executive of LinkedIn. In October 2025, Microsoft is promoting longtime sales executive Judson Althoff to CEO of its commercial business, a major reorganization that frees up CEO Nadella to focus exclusively on technical work as the company races to dominate Artificial Intelligence (AI) landscape. The restructuring puts Althoff in charge of what Nadella called Microsoft's ""most important growth engine"", as he now leads marketing, sales, support and operations, which includes setting priorities for its engineering teams to match customer needs.Althoff joined Microsoft in 2013 and has led the company's global sales team for nine-plus years. The move represents one of Microsoft's most significant leadership changes in years, with Chief Marketing Officer Takeshi Numoto and his team too now reporting directly to Althoff.Chief Operations Officer Carolina Dybeck Happe's team also joins the new organisation.Following recent changes, Satya Nadella reportedly now has 16 direct reports, broadly in line with previous years due to the consolidation of roles, including for sales and marketing. The reorganisation allows CEO Nadella and Microsoft's engineering leaders to concentrate on what he described as ""highest ambition technical work"" spanning datacenter construction, systems architecture, AI research and product innovation. ""We are in the midst of a tectonic AI platform shift, one that requires us to both manage and grow our at-scale commercial business today, while building the new frontier,"" Nadella wrote in an email to employees announcing the leadership shakeout.LinkedIn chief Roslansky has an expanded remit, including the company’s Office software suite.

Why Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis thinks the AI startup valuation model is breaking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-google-deepmind-ceo-demis-hassabis-thinks-the-ai-startup-valuation-model-is-breaking/articleshow/126055448.cms,"Big tech vs early-stage hype

'Trump Needs Indian Skilled Workers': Expert On Big Tech's AI Bet On India

Demis Hassabis makes his stand clear on AI scaling





Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Speaking on Google DeepMind: The Podcast, Hassabis said many early-stage companies are now raising tens of billions dollars before even launching product. He believes that this trend exposes cracks in the valuation model. “Some startups basically haven’t even got going yet,” Hassabis said. “It’s sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. My guess is probably not, at least not in general.” This increase in speculative funding has drawn comparisons to past bubbles, such as the dot-com boom and the crypto frenzy, where companies raised massive sums on hype rather than proven business models.Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google, which he said are backed by “a lot of real business.” While Big Tech’s AI bets are supported by revenue streams and infrastructure, many startups are relying solely on investor enthusiasm.He added that AI is “overhyped in the short term” but “underappreciated in the medium to long-term,” suggesting that while the technology’s potential is profound, the current funding frenzy may not reflect sustainable growth.Reflecting on DeepMind’s own early days, Hassabis noted how technological shifts often swing from skepticism to obsession, inflating valuations quickly. “It’s almost an overreaction to the underreaction,” he said, pointing out that investor sentiment can flip dramatically once a technology gains traction.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO also made his stand clear on the debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent. Scaling laws suggest that the more data and compute an AI model receives, the smarter it becomes.",Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Fear-driven leadership powers AI chip giant's success

Seven-day workweeks extend beyond executive suite





Despite leading the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang operates in constant fear of failure. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business."" The co-founder, who has led the chipmaker since 1993, said this feeling of vulnerability ""doesn't leave you"" despite the company's recent milestone of becoming the first public firm to reach a $5 trillion valuation in October.Huang's unconventional leadership approach stems from near-death experiences in the 1990s when Nvidia faced bankruptcy multiple times. He recalled flying to Japan to inform Sega that a contracted graphics chip was flawed and the deal should be canceled, while simultaneously admitting Nvidia needed the final $5 million payment to survive. Sega converted the funds into an investment, providing the lifeline that kept the company afloat.""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,"" Huang explained. The CEO maintains his intense work schedule by waking at 4 a.m.daily to read emails for hours, processing several thousand messages each day. This routine continues through holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas.Huang's relentless work ethic has influenced his family, with both adult children Madison and Spencer working at Nvidia seven days a week. The siblings, who are in their 30s, initially pursued different careers before joining the company as interns in 2020 and 2022.Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter, driven by surging demand for AI chips that power technology from Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta.

Samsung and other Korean companies get US approval to bring chip-making tools into China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/samsung-and-other-korean-companies-get-us-approval-to-bring-chip-making-tools-into-china/articleshow/126289304.cms,"America has granted Samsung and SK Hynix yearly permits to send chipmaking tools to their Chinese plants until 2026. This replaces an older system with stricter annual reviews. These licenses allow factories to operate and maintain equipment. However, they do not permit expansion or upgrades to the newest technology. The US aims to limit China's access to advanced chip-making tools.





The US government has approved annual export licences to allow Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix to ship chipmaking equipment to their China facilities throughout 2026. A Reuters report, citing people familiar with the decision, said the approvals came just before a long-standing waiver system expired, marking a shift to a more restrictive licensing framework for foreign-owned fabs in China.Under the new system, the US has formally moved to annual approvals for chipmaking tool exports into China, replacing the validated end-user status that Samsung, SK Hynix and TSMC previously enjoyed. The yearly licences must be renewed each calendar year, the Reuters report claimed.What is this waiver system between the US and ChinaThe expired waiver system validated end-user status and allowed qualifying factories in China to receive US-controlled semiconductor tools without seeking individual export licences for each shipment. Now, all shipments of US-origin manufacturing equipment require explicit authorisation from Washington to enter China.US officials had increasingly viewed the previous waiver system as overly permissive, according to one source cited by Reuters, prompting the transition to stricter annual oversight.These approvals are significant for Samsung and SK Hynix because they make most of their memory chips in China.Samsung has a big factory in Xi'an that makes NAND flash memory, while SK Hynix has two major factories, one in Wuxi making DRAM chips and another in Dalian making NAND chips.Together, these factories produce a considerable amount of the world's memory chips. With memory chip prices going up due to high demand from AI data centres, keeping these factories running smoothly has become even more critical.The new annual licences let these companies keep their factories running and maintain their equipment, but do not allow them to expand or upgrade to the latest technology. US officials have made clear they want to stop China from getting advanced chip-making tools. Even before this change, the most advanced equipment (like EUV machines) was already banned.Switching to yearly approvals creates uncertainty for chipmakers. Each year, the US can change the rules or even deny approval completely, depending on political tensions and security concerns. Experts believe this stricter system will hurt sales for American equipment makers such as Applied Materials, Lam Research, and KLA, which sell machines these memory factories need.For 2026, Samsung and SK Hynix can keep bringing essential equipment into their China factories. But going forward, the US will watch these shipments much more closely, reviewing them every single year.","Samsung and SK Hynix granted yearly permits to send chipmaking tools to their Chinese plants until 2026.

Big Tech's $70 Billion AI Move: Silicon Valley Bets On India, Snubs Trump's 'America First' Diktat

How Kioxia became the most growing company in 2025





Nvidia dominated a majority of headlines in 2025 in the tech industry with other Silicon Valley giants like Google, Microsoft and OpenAI witnessed boom in their fortunes. However, the company that grew the most in 2025 is not based in the US but Tokyo, Japan. The crown for the world’s best-performing stock of 2025 went to Kioxia Holdings that was either dismissed by investors or ‘barely noticed’.According to a report by Bloomberg, Kioxia’s shares skyrocketed a staggering 540% in 2025, outperforming every other company in the MSCI World Index. The company launched its IPO in December 2024 and witnessed its market value balloon to approximately 5.7 trillion yen ($36 billion). The company now has customers like Apple and Microsoft.Meanwhile, companies, including Google-parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Apple – al performed well, riding the AI boom in 2025.Kioxia’s rise is fueled by a global appetite for AI data storage. There was a critical shift in the AI arms race as tech giants’ hunt for “compute” (GPUs) quickly shifted to “memory” as they realised that large-scale AI models require massive amounts of NAND flash memory to store the enormous datasets they process.As the tech giants rushed to build more data centres, the demand for memery chips exploded, providing a chance to companies like Kioxia to take advantage of the unmet demand.Citing market trackers, the report says that the global demand for memory exceeds supply by roughly 10% and this deficit has triggered a pricing surge. Not only data centres, the shortage has also affected the prices of smartphones, PCs and gaming consoles.Notably, Kioxia’s stock rise was not smooth as the company tumbled more than 20% in a single session in November after quarterly results failed to meet lofty expectations.","Kioxia Holdings of Tokyo emerged as the world's best-performing stock in 2025.

Karpathy praises coast-to-coast milestone despite Musk 's criticism





Former Tesla AI director Andrej Karpathy has weighed in on the fundamental differences between Tesla's Full Self-Driving system and Google's Waymo, stating that Waymo would be unable to replicate Tesla's recent coast-to-coast autonomous drive achievement. The comments came on December 31, just days after Tesla CEO Elon Musk publicly criticized Karpathy's ""dated"" understanding of the company's AI capabilities.Karpathy responded to a question on X (formerly Twitter) about whether Waymo could achieve a similar 2,732-mile journey accomplished by Tesla enthusiast David Moss using FSD V14.2. ""Yes exactly, that's correct in my understanding,"" Karpathy confirmed, agreeing that Waymo's modular approach would prevent such a feat.The exchange underlined the key technological divide between the two leaders on autonomous driving. Waymo grounds itself on a bedrock of high-definition maps, LiDAR sensors, 5G connectivity, and a suite of neural networks that all interoperate inside a modular system. It was precisely that architecture that demonstrated brittleness in a San Francisco power outage when traffic lights went dark and HD maps no longer captured real-world conditions, stranding Waymo vehicles.Tesla, on the other hand, is developing a single, broad neural network that translates camera input directly into driving commands, in agreement with Karpathy's ""Software 2.0"" vision of training AI from billions of miles of human driving instead of hand-coding the logic for every imaginable scenario.Karpathy celebrated the autonomous drive achievement, calling it ""special because the coast-to-coast drive was a major goal for the autopilot team from the start."" He recalled ""marathon clip review sessions late into the night"" spent analyzing interventions and planning projects to eliminate them entirely.The milestone comes amid ongoing tension between Karpathy and Musk. Earlier in December, Musk responded sharply to Karpathy's praise of both Tesla and Waymo systems, claiming the former AI director's perspective was outdated and that ""Tesla AI software has advanced vastly beyond what it was when he left"" in 2022.Despite Musk's public overture—""Andrej, my long lost brother, let us work together again!""—Karpathy has shown no signs of returning to Tesla.","Former Tesla AI director Andrej Karpathy believes Waymo cannot replicate Tesla's coast-to-coast autonomous drive due to its modular system.

The tax that's got billionaires running for the exit



Bill Ackman warns California on the path of self-destruction







Tesla CEO Elon Musk has now joined in the debate on California’s proposed wealth tax. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk revealed that nearly all of his fortune is linked to the shares of Tesla and SpaceX. The remakes made by Musk comes as lawmakers in California debate new measures aimed at taxing billionaires more aggressively, sparking controversy among tech leaders and investors.Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko recently shared a post on X talking about the wealth of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. He argued that Elon’s stocks are not wealth. “” wrote Yakovenko.Responding to Yakevenko’s post, Musk said, “My Tesla and SpaceX shares make for almost all my wealth.” He added that his financial position is not based on liquid assets but on equity in the companies he founded and continues to lead.,” posted Musk.Musk’s comments highlight a common issue in wealth tax debates: billionaires often hold their wealth in company stock, which is not easily converted into cash without selling shares and potentially destabilizing the companies themselves.The wealth tax proposal, pushed by healthcare union SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, would retroactively apply to anyone living in California on January 1, 2026.That means billionaires have just hours to establish residency elsewhere if they want to avoid it. For Page, whose net worth stands at roughly $258 billion, the tax bill could exceed $12 billion. Thiel, worth about $27.5 billion, would face a tab of more than $1.2 billion.The measure needs enough signatures to reach the November 2026 ballot, but some wealthy Californians aren't willing to gamble. Tech investor Chamath Palihapitiya warned the tax would trigger ""an exodus of the state's most talented entrepreneurs,"" adding he's giving ""serious consideration"" to moving to Texas.Bill Ackman the hedge fund billionaire also raised alarm over California’s economic future as the wealthiest residents of the state are planning to leave due to the proposed tax targeting billionaires.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B





Tesla CEO Elon Musk has donated 2,10,699 Tesla shares, worth approximately $100 million to charity, a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission revealed. The donations were made on December 30, 2025 as part of his “year-end tax planning,” the filing says. Notably, this is not the first significant charitable contribution by the world’s richest billionaire. In 2024, he donated Tesla shares worth approximately $112 million to charitable causes. Similarly, in 2022, the tech billionaire donated $1.95 billion worth of Tesla shares between August and December. In 2021, Musk gave away Tesla shares valued at $5.7 billion, reportedly directed to his foundation.The shares, as stated in the SEC filing were donated as part of Musk's ""year-end tax planning"" to ""certain charities"" that have ""no current intention to sell such stock,"" the filing showed.Despite this donation, Musk remains the world’s richest person with a net worth of $619 billion as per Bloomberg Billionaires index. He is followed by Google co-founder Larry Page and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos with a total net worth of $269 billion and $253 billion, respectively.In a related news, Elon Musk recently said that he plans to be Tesla CEO in the next five years. Musk made a virtual appearance on the Qatar Economic Forum recently where he was asked “Do you see yourself and are you committed to still being the chief executive of Tesla in five years time?”. The tech billionaire replied with an affirmative yes, adding “I’ll still be CEO in 5 years… unless I die. I can’t be the CEO if I’m dead.” A clip from the interview was shared by X (formerly known as Twitter) user Mario Nawfal on December 30, 2025.","Elon Musk has donated 2,10,699 Tesla shares, worth approximately $100 million to charity.

Facebook-parent Meta recently announced acquisition of Chinese-founded Artificial Intelligence (AI) startup Manus. Mark Zuckerberg-owned company did not disclose financial terms of the transaction, but a source with direct knowledge of the matter said that the deal values the Singapore-based company between $2 billion and $3 billion. Manus is backed by its parent Beijing-based Butterfly Effect Technology, and raised $75 million this year at a valuation of around $500 million. Its investors also include HSG, formerly known as Sequoia Capital China, ZhenFund and internet giant Tencent Holdings. Manus had an annual revenue run rate of $125 million earlier this year from selling its AI agent to businesses via subscriptions.In 2025, Manus went viral on X, formerly Twitter, after it released what it claimed was the world's first general AI agent, capable of making decisions and executing tasks autonomously, with much less prompting required than AI chatbots like ChatGPT and DeepSeek. This made many analysts call it China's next DeepSeek, and the company was cheered by Chinese state television. The company months later moved its headquarters from China to Singapore, joining a wave of other Chinese companies that have done so to avoid getting caught in the US-China tensions.As Jeremy Goldman, senior director at Emarketer, told Reuters, ""Scrutiny is almost guaranteed; anything with Chinese roots and 'AI' in the headline now triggers Washington's reflexes.""Analysts too have warned that the deal could fall foul of regulators at a time of fierce technological rivalry between Washington and Beijing. Little doubt then that Meta has issued a clarification on Manus' China roots. “There will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI following the transaction, and Manus AI will discontinue its services and operations in China,” a Meta spokesperson said.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made AI his company’s top priority, and is spending billions to hire researchers, build data centers and develop new models.Alexandr Wang, Meta’s Chief AI Officer who joined the company in May 2025 as part of a high-profile investment into his startup, ScaleAI, welcomed the Manus team of about 100 employees with a post on X. ""Excited to announce that @ManusAI has joined Meta to help us build amazing AI products! The Manus team in Singapore are world class at exploring the capability overhang of today’s models to scaffold powerful agents. Looking forward to working with you, @Red_Xiao_.

Will Vibe Coding take away tech jobs

How Collins Dictionary defines Vibe Coding





This year, or in February 2025 to be precise, Andrej Karpathy, the former director of AI at Tesla and a founding member of OpenAI, gave the technology world a new word -- Vibe Coding. Karpathy came up with the word to represent how AI can let some programmers ""forget that the code even exists"" and ""give in to the vibes"" while making a computer program. The word became an overnight buzzword in Silicon Valley. And as the year ended, UK's Collins Dictionary picked it up as the word of the year. It was one of 10 words on a shortlist to reflect the mood, language and preoccupations of 2025.As to how Andrej Karpathy described the word, here's the definition Karpathy shared on Twitter, ""I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year and a failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like a skill issue. There's a new programmable layer of abstraction to master (in addition to the usual layers below) involving agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows, IDE integrations, and a need to build an all-encompassing mental model for strengths and pitfalls of fundamentally stochastic, fallible, unintelligible and changing entities suddenly intermingled with what used to be good old fashioned engineering.Clearly some powerful alien tool was handed around except it comes with no manual and everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession. Roll up your sleeves to not fall behind.""Is Vibe Coding and advanced capabilities of AI just the nail in the coffin when it comes to the traditional views of computer programming and software development skills? The debate is ongoing, with strong voices on both sides. Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan told CNBC earlier this year that app developers can now offload or automate more repetitive tasks, and they can generate new code using Large Language Models (LLMs). The ability for AI to subsidize an otherwise heavy workload has allowed these companies to build with fewer people."" Tan said. “That sounds a little scary, but on the other hand, what that means for founders is that you don’t need a team of 50 or 100 engineers. You know, maybe it’s that engineer who couldn’t get a job at Meta or Google, who actually can build a standalone business making 10 or 100 million dollars a year with 10 people,” Tan says. “Like that’s such a powerful moment in software."" Tan tweeted another not-so-happy stat for engineers: 25% of the current crop of Y Combinator startups used LLMs (AI large language models) to write 95% of their lines of code.Cursor CEO Michael Truell recently warned that Vibe coding builds ‘shaky foundations’ and eventually ‘things start to crumble’. Truell reportedly likened it to building a house by putting up four walls and a roof without knowing what’s going on under the floorboards or with the wiring. This coding method may be perfect for AI users looking to quickly mock up a game or website, but when it comes to more advanced programming, things have the potential to go wrong, he warned, as per a report in Fortune. “If you close your eyes and you don’t look at the code and you have AIs build things with shaky foundations as you add another floor, and another floor, and another floor, and another floor, things start to kind of crumble,” he said.Alex Beecroft, managing director of Collins, said, “The selection of ‘vibe coding’ as Collins’ Word of the Year perfectly captures how language is evolving alongside technology.” Collins’ definition of Vibe Coding states, “vibe coding” is “the use of artificial intelligence prompted by natural language to assist with the writing of computer code.” Or, as a blog post on the dictionary’s website explains: “Basically, telling a machine what you want rather than painstakingly coding it yourself. ”","Andrej Karpathy, former director of AI at Tesla and a founding member of OpenAI, came up with the word Vibe Coding.

Interestingly, Brin also featured prominently in the launch video alongside the team from Windsurf (acquired for $2.4 billion). Brin is reportedly in the office “pretty much every day,” working on Gemini model training.Despite being a “professional CEO” and not a founder, Satya Nadella’s 2025 behaviour has been described by Microsoft’s Deputy CTO Dee Templeton as “Founder Mode”. According to a report by the Financial Times, Nadella has flattened Microsoft’s hierarchy, overhauled senior leadership, and hiring key figures like Meta’s Jay Parikh to create a direct line to his office.Nadella is said to be working hard to better compete with Amazon and Google in infrastructure.Earlier this year, Tesla and Samsung announced a chip partnership. Company CEO Elon Musk said would “walk the line personally” at Samsung’s new Texas facility to accelerate progress. He also secured an agreement allowing Tesla engineers to assist Samsung in “maximizing manufacturing efficiency” to ensure Tesla's hardware timeline stays ahead of the industry.Mark Zuckerberg has made a ‘Superintelligence’ team for billions of dollars, pivoting Meta towards “startup mode” by concentrating power in the hands of elite, talent-dense units. The company’s goal is frontier research and Zuckerberg believes small teams are the “optimal configuration” for winning the AI arms race.Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky has publicly slammed conventional leadership advice to ""get out of the way."" Chesky manages his $79 billion company like a startup, personally handling “hire, fire, promote, and manage” decisions for employees several levels below his direct reports.

What Yann LeCun said on leaving Meta

“As many of you have heard through rumors or recent media articles, I am planning to leave Meta after 12 years: 5 years as founding director of FAIR and 7 years as Chief AI Scientist.

The impact of FAIR on the company, on the field of AI, on the tech community, and on the wider world has been spectacular. The creation of FAIR is my proudest non-technical accomplishment.

I am creating a startup company to continue the Advanced Machine Intelligence research program (AMI) I have been pursuing over the last several years with colleagues at FAIR, at NYU, and beyond. The goal of the startup is to bring about the next big revolution in AI: systems that understand the physical world, have persistent memory, can reason, and can plan complex action sequences.

I am extremely grateful to Mark Zuckerberg, Andrew Bosworth, Chris Cox, and Mike Schroepfer for their support of FAIR, and for their support of the AMI program over the last few years. Because of their continued interest and support, Meta will be a partner of the new company.

As I envision it, AMI will have far-ranging applications in many sectors of the economy, some of which overlap with Meta’s commercial interests, but many of which do not. Pursuing the goal of AMI in an independent entity is a way to maximize its broad impact.

I will give some more details about the new company when the time comes. In the meantime, I’m sticking around Meta until the end of the year.”





Yann LeCun, Meta’s Chief AI scientist is leaving the company after 12 years. Sharing a post on professional networking platform LinkedIn in November, LeCun said that he is building a startup company to continue the Advanced Machine Intelligence research program (AMI) that he has been pursuing over the last several years with “colleagues at Facebook AI Research (FAIR), New York University (NYU) and beyond. ” Interestingly, his move marks a shift from his previous stance on entrepreneurship. The AI researcher once said that he has no interest in running companies or chasing deals. In a public conversation with Tesla CEO Elon Musk in May last year, LeCun famously said “I'm a scientist, not a business or product person.”Yann LeCun’s exit from the company became ‘inevitable’ after Meta’s $15 billion acquisition of ScaleAI and the appointment of Alexandr Wang – making him Meta’s highest paid employee ever. In November 2025, Hyperbolic CEO and CTO Yuchen Jin shared a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), alleging Mark Zuckerberg appointed Wang to lead Meta’s new “superintelligence” division.As per the post, the decision of Zuckerberg to have LeCun report to Wang signaled a shift in priorities — away from foundational AI research and toward rapid, product-driven development. “Yann never believed in LLM-to-AGI. Zuck’s patience ran out,” Jin wrote, referencing LeCun’s well-known skepticism of large language models as a path to artificial general intelligence.In a LinkedIn post, LeCun wrote:","Yann LeCun, Meta’s Chief AI scientist is leaving the company after 12 years.

"Elon Musk makes a 'Tesla promise', says: Unless I Die, I will …",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-makes-a-tesla-promise-says-unless-i-die-i-will-/articleshow/126268998.cms,"When investors called for Elon Musk’s exit as Tesla CEO





Elon Musk recently said that he plans to be Tesla CEO in the next five years. Musk made a virtual appearance on the Qatar Economic Forum recently where he was asked “Do you see yourself and are you committed to still being the chief executive of Tesla in five years time?”. The tech billionaire replied with an affirmative yes, adding “I’ll still be CEO in 5 years… unless I die. I can’t be the CEO if I’m dead.”A clip from the interview was shared by X user Mario Nawfal on December 30, 2025. Since then the post has gained more than 222K views so far. Nawfal captioned the post:“No planned exit or corporate double-speak, just pure, unfiltered commitment with a side of existential humor. Basically, Elon isn’t going anywhere. He’s still knee-deep in AI, robots, Gigafactories, self-driving tech, and yes spaceships and rockets.”He further added “And let’s be real: no one else could juggle Twitter, Mars, AI doomsday warnings, and an EV empire like this guy. So buckle up, because apparently the only thing that could dethrone Elon… is mortality itself.”Earlier this year, some Tesla investors including Ross Gerber, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management called for Elon Musk's exit from the company. In an interview with Sky's Business Live in March this year, Gerber said:“I think Tesla needs a new CEO and I decided today I was going to start saying it and so this is the first show that I'm saying it on”, adding “It's time for somebody to run Tesla. The business has been neglected for too long. There are too many important things Tesla is doing, so either Elon should come back to Tesla and be the CEO of Tesla and give up his other jobs or he should focus on the government and keep doing what he is doing but find a suitable CEO of Tesla. ”Gerber's statement then came as shares of Tesla dropped in the wake of massive protests against Elon Musk and the EV maker, allegedly linked to his involvement with the Trump administration then.","Elon Musk recently said that he plans to be Tesla CEO in the next five years.

TSMC begins mass production of advanced 2nm chips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tsmc-begins-mass-production-of-advanced-2nm-chips/articleshow/126268612.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang: TSMC is doing a very good job







Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the word’s largest contract chipmaker has announced that it has started mass production of its 2‑nanometer (nm) chips, marking a major milestone in semiconductor technology. As reported AFP, TSMC said that the new 2nm process node represents its most advanced technology to date. The chips are designed to offer higher performance as compared to the 3nm chipset.The 2nm chips from TSMC are also low on power consumption which make them useful for mobile devices and AI workloads. Also, the smaller transistor size of the chips enables them to offer more computing power in compact designs.The company confirmed that production has begun at its facilities in Hsinchu and Baoshan, Taiwan, with plans to expand capacity in the coming year.It is also said that the next-generation TSMC 2nm chips may power the next-generation iPhones and AI servers. The company is also said to be working on new fabs in Arizona, Japan, and Germany, part of a global diversification strategy amid geopolitical tensions.The launch of 2nm chips comes at a time when demand for AI accelerators, smartphones, and high‑performance computing is surging globally. TSMC’s move positions it ahead of rivals Samsung Electronics and Intel, both racing to develop similar next‑generation nodes.Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia recently praised its longtime partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Speaking to reporters at an event held by TSMC in Hsinchu (Taiwan), Huang said “TSMC is doing a very good job supporting us on wafers”, adding that Nvidia's success would not be possible without TSMC. Huang is on a fourth public trip to Taiwan this year.According to a Reuters report, the chipmaker CEO also told reporters that it is experiencing ""very strong demand"" for its Blackwell chips.“Nvidia builds the GPU (graphics processing units), but we also build the CPU (central processing units), the networking, the switches, and so there are a lot of chips associated with Blackwell”.","Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the word’s largest contract chipmaker has announced that it has started mass production of its 2‑nanometer (nm) chips.

World’s largest accounting body to stop taking online tests; as it says: No longer able to halt cheating,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/worlds-largest-accounting-body-to-stop-taking-online-tests-as-it-says-no-longer-able-to-halt-cheating/articleshow/126267748.cms,"AI-generated image for representation purpose only





The world’s largest accounting body – Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) has reportedly stopped students from taking online exams. According to a report by the Financial Times, the accounting body, which has almost 260,000 members, said that it will stop allowing students to take online exams in all but exceptional circumstances from March 2026. The move comes as the body aims to crack down on a rise in cheating on tests. “We’re seeing the sophistication of [cheating] systems outpacing what can be put in, [in] terms of safeguards,” Helen Brand, the chief executive of the ACCA, said in an interview with the publication.Brand said that ACCA had worked “intensively” to combat cheating but “people who want to do bad things are probably working at a quicker pace”. With the rapid rise of technology, led by AI tools, the issue of cheating has moved to a “tipping point”, she added.Online/remote tests were introduced during covid times to enable students to qualify at a time when lockdowns prevented in-person exam assessment. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) – Britain’s accounting and auditing industry regulator in 2022 said that cheating in professional exams was a “live” issue at Britain’s biggest companies.According to a report by The Guradian, the FRC’s investigation then found instances of cheating in some tier-one auditors, a category comprising the “big four” accountants – KPMG, PwC, Deloitte and EY – along with Mazars, Grant Thornton and BDO. Interestingly, in the same year, EY agreed to pay a record $100m (£74m) to US regulators over claims that dozens of its employees cheated on an ethics exam and that the company then misled investigators.",Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) has reportedly stopped students from taking online exams.

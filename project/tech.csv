"Shocking Elon Musk Poll: 71% of Democrats want him jailed, 54% ‘voters’ want law to imprison Tesla CEO for his role in DOGE",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/shocking-elon-musk-poll-71-of-democrats-want-him-jailed-54-voters-want-law-to-imprison-tesla-ceo-for-his-role-in-doge/articleshow/121199827.cms,"Detailed Breakdown of Voter Sentiment:



DOGE: The reason of hatred towards Elon Musk

Public Opinion on Banning Musk from Government Service:



Elon Musk called the cause of Growing Political Polarization

Since he agreed to lead President Donald Trump’s effort to reduce government waste, Elon Musk has become so hated by liberals that they would overwhelmingly favor a law to put the high-tech billionaire behind bars. A new telephone and online survey by Rasmussen Reports and the Heartland Institute finds that 54% of Likely Voters would support a hypothetical law that would imprison Musk for his role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), including 39% who would Strongly Support such a law. Thirty-six percent (36%) oppose a law that would send Musk to prison, including 26% who strongly oppose it, while 10% are not sure.A recent survey by Rasmussen Reports and The Heartland Institute has ignited a national debate, revealing a stark partisan divide over Elon Musk's involvement in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).Democrats: 71% support imprisonment, with 80% of self-identified liberals in agreement.Republicans: 54% oppose imprisonment.Conservatives: 57% oppose imprisonment.Independents: 52% support, 34% oppose, and 17% are undecided.DOGE, established during Trump's second term, is intended to cut government waste. Musk's appointment has been met with significant resistance from the left, who view it as a potential political threat. Justin Haskins, a senior fellow at The Heartland Institute, argues that the poll results reflect a trend of prioritizing political retribution over effective governance. “The fact that a majority of Democratic voters would support imprisoning Elon Musk for trying to make government more efficient is a shocking indictment of the modern left, which has become increasingly more tyrannical in recent years,” said Justin Haskins, senior fellow at The Heartland Institute and the poll’s primary author. We’ve reached a point where many Americans would rather unjustly punish innovation than fix the broken systems Musk was trying to reform.”48% of likely voters support a ban on Musk serving in any government role.38% oppose such a ban, and 14% are unsure.Democrats: 68% support a ban.Republicans: 59% oppose a ban.Independents: 46% support, 37% oppose.Elon Musk's Favorability Ratings:Musk's overall favorability rating is 42%, with 52% viewing him unfavorably.His favorability has slightly decreased from 45% in March.Partisan Breakdown:Republicans: 77% favorable.Democrats: 17% favorable.Independents: 37% favorable.Demographic Breakdown:White voters: 46% favorable.Black voters: 29% favorable.Hispanic voters: 40% favorable.Other minorities: 41% favorable.Men: 51% favorable.Women: 35% favorable.The survey of 1,067 U.S. Likely Voters was conducted on April 30-May 4, 2025 by Rasmussen Reports and the Heartland Institute. The margin of sampling error is +/- 3 percentage points with a 95% level of confidence. Field work for all Rasmussen Reports surveys is conducted by Pulse Opinion Research, LLC. A majority of voters believe the country has become more divided during Trump's second term. Nearly half attribute the increased polarization to Trump's policies and rhetoric. A widespread belief that civility in US politics has declined, and fears of increased political violence are also present.","54% of Likely Voters would support a hypothetical law that would imprison Musk for his role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) DOGE, established during Trump's second term, is intended to cut government waste. 48% of likely voters support a ban on Musk serving in any government role. 38% oppose such a ban, and 14% are unsure.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121199819,imgsize-909363,width-400,resizemode-4/Elon-Musk-responds-to-Google-CEO-Sundar-Pichai-and-Quora-co-founder-Adam-DAngelos-Google-Meet-chat-on-Twitter-The-smartest-most-influential-people.jpg"

Walmart's Strategies to Mitigate Trump Tariff Impact

How is the Sales Outlook

Shoppers at Walmart should brace for price increases on a wide range of goods in the near future, the company's Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey has warned, according to a CNBC interview. Despite a recent 90-day reprieve that lowered duties on Chinese imports to 30%, tariffs on goods from numerous other countries are set to impact the retail giant known for its low prices. ""We’re trying to navigate this the best that we can,"" Rainey told CNBC on Thursday. ""But this is a little bit unprecedented in terms of the speed and magnitude in which the price increases are coming.""Rainey indicated that consumers will likely start seeing price increases towards the end of May, with more significant markups expected in June.He also predicted a higher-than-usual number of price increases in the fiscal second quarter, which began earlier this month.Impact Across Retail Landscape:As the largest retailer and grocer in the U.S., Walmart's announcement offers a significant insight into potential price hikes that shoppers may encounter at various stores and chains nationwide.Walmart CEO Doug McMillon shed light on specific product categories during the company’s earnings call, as reported by CNBC. While about a third of Walmart's U.S. sales come from domestically produced goods, the company relies heavily on imports from countries including China, Mexico, Vietnam, India, and Canada.Tariffs on countries like Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia have already put pressure on the prices of imported items such as bananas, avocados, coffee, and roses.McMillon noted that a high volume of merchandise in categories like toys and electronics originates from China, making them particularly susceptible to tariff fluctuations.Neither McMillon nor Rainey specified the exact amount by which prices would increase for consumers or how much of the tariff costs would be absorbed by Walmart or its suppliers.McMillon told CNBC that the realities of higher import costs began to affect Walmart in April, as the company imported items for the upcoming back-to-school season. Tariffs are applied when goods clear customs, meaning some imports have already been subject to higher duties, including the previously imposed 145% levy on Chinese goods before the temporary reduction.""What we’re looking at is upward pressure began in April and placed through the entire year on things that are imported,"" McMillon stated.CNBC's report detailed the challenges retailers and consumer brands face in managing inventory and maintaining business targets amid fluctuating tariff levels. The recent dramatic swing from a potential 145% tariff on Chinese goods to the current 30% illustrates this volatility.McMillon told CNBC that Walmart is employing several strategies beyond price increases to lessen the impact of tariffs:* Material Substitution: Suppliers are shifting away from materials facing tariffs, such as aluminum, to alternatives like fiberglass.* Sourcing Diversification: Merchants are exploring alternative products or countries to source merchandise.* Order Adjustments: Rainey noted that Walmart has reduced the size of orders for items expected to see significant tariff-related price increases due to anticipated lower customer demand.Interestingly, despite the impending price increases, Walmart has maintained its full-year sales forecast, even after slightly missing Wall Street's quarterly revenue expectations, according to CNBC. The company anticipates that its reputation for low prices could ironically attract more shoppers to its stores and website as competitors also face similar tariff pressures.","Walmart's Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey has warned of price increases on a wide range of goods.

"AI is coming for these jobs, says Anthropic Cofounder Jack Clark; know if your job is at risk",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-is-coming-for-these-jobs-says-anthropic-cofounder-jack-clark-know-if-your-job-is-at-risk/articleshow/121195098.cms,"AI is coming for these jobs, says Anthropic Cofounder Jack Clark; know if your job is at risk

Warning: Jobs that could be replaced by AI soon, are you safe?

Skilled trades: The resilience of personal craftsmanship



1. High-skill trades

Electricians and plumbers: Clark pointed out that roles like electricians and plumbers are less likely to be replaced by AI due to the hands-on, problem-solving nature of their work. These trades require precise manual skills, an understanding of complex systems, and the ability to adapt to unpredictable work environments, all of which are challenging for AI to master.

Carpenters and metalworkers: Like electricians, these trades often involve custom work tailored to specific customer needs, requiring a high level of dexterity and practical judgment.

2. Aesthetic and personalised services

Gardeners and landscapers: Clark specifically highlighted gardening as a prime example of a job that benefits from the human touch. This work often involves creative design, aesthetic judgment, and a deep understanding of plant biology and local environmental conditions, making it challenging for AI to replicate.

Artisanal craft workers: Roles like pottery, painting, and furniture making also fall into this category, where the individuality and artistic flair of the creator are highly valued by consumers.

Office-based roles: The importance of human connections

1. High-level sales and client management

Relationship-driven commerce: Clark noted that people often prefer to conduct significant financial transactions or business deals with other humans rather than algorithms. This preference for personal interaction is particularly strong in high-stakes, high-value markets, where trust and rapport are critical.

Capital-intensive sales roles: Jobs involving large pools of capital, like investment banking, corporate finance, and real estate, are less likely to be fully automated, as these roles often depend on deep personal connections and nuanced human judgment.

2. Creative and strategic work

Marketing and public relations: These roles often involve crafting compelling narratives, understanding complex cultural trends, and building long-term client relationships, making them less susceptible to full automation.

Human resources and talent management: These jobs require empathy, intuition, and a deep understanding of human behavior, qualities that AI currently struggles to replicate.

Healthcare: The human element in medical care

1. Trust and human judgment

Professional oversight in medicine: Clark stressed that while AI can assist in routine diagnostics and patient monitoring, critical medical decisions still require the judgment and expertise of trained doctors. This is partly due to the ethical and legal implications of medical errors, which can have life-altering consequences.

Emotional support and patient communication: Many healthcare roles involve providing emotional support and reassurance to patients, an area where human doctors and nurses excel.

2. Regulatory and privacy challenges

Data privacy concerns: Clark noted that data privacy laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States, significantly restrict the use of AI in healthcare. These regulations are designed to protect sensitive patient information, creating a major barrier to widespread AI adoption.

Liability and risk management: The potential for medical malpractice lawsuits also limits the extent to which healthcare providers can rely on AI for critical decision-making. Clark cited his own experience as a parent, mentioning that while he might consult an AI assistant like Claude for quick reassurance about his child's health, he would never substitute it for professional medical advice.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the global job market at an unprecedented pace, with many roles across various industries facing potential disruption. However, not all jobs are equally vulnerable to automation. Jack Clark, the cofounder of AI company Anthropic, recently discussed the kinds of jobs he believes will be least impacted by AI during an insightful conversation on the podcast ‘Conversations with Tyler’, hosted by economist Tyler Cowen.Clark's perspective provides valuable insights into the types of professions that may remain resilient in the face of rapid technological change. His analysis covers a wide range of sectors, including skilled trades, relationship-driven office jobs, and healthcare, highlighting the complex factors that determine a job's vulnerability to automation.Clark emphasized that certain hands-on, artisanal trades are likely to remain relatively safe from AI disruption due to their unique reliance on human craftsmanship, creativity, and the personal touch that machines often struggle to replicate. These roles typically involve a blend of physical skill, technical knowledge, and personalized service that makes them difficult to automate effectively.While many routine office tasks are increasingly being automated, Clark believes that certain white-collar roles will remain relatively insulated from AI due to their reliance on trust-based human relationships and complex interpersonal interactions.Clark also touched on the complex role of AI in healthcare , highlighting the significant barriers to full automation in this critical field. Despite the growing capabilities of AI in medical diagnostics and patient care, human healthcare professionals remain essential for several reasons.","Jack Clark, the cofounder of AI company Anthropic, recently discussed the kinds of jobs he believes will be least impacted by AI.

How Donald Trump's 'America First' may have put brakes on the sector that was working to bring business back to the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-donald-trumps-america-first-may-have-put-brakes-on-the-sector-that-was-working-to-bring-business-back-to-the-us/articleshow/121194759.cms,"What's hurting semiconductor companies in the US

Benefits of CHIPS Act undone

Trump Tariffs cause confusion, earn experts

Even before the ""America First"" doctrine became a hallmark of the Trump administration's foreign policy, the U.S. semiconductor industry was actively working to bring manufacturing back home, fueled by government incentives and a strategic push to bolster domestic production. As reported by the Associated Press, the Greater Sacramento region stands as a prime example of this resurgence, where tech giants like Intel, AMD, Bosch, Samsung, and Micron are expanding operations, building upon Intel's decades-long presence. This growth is part of a nationwide trend, with billions of dollars invested in research, development, and manufacturing.However, President Donald Trump's recent trade policies, including proposed tariffs and investigations into chip imports, are casting a shadow of uncertainty over this burgeoning industry.""You're starting to see some of it now. Samsung announced a delay in the fabs in Texas,"" Mario Morales, an analyst with the International Data Corp., told the AP. ""That facility was supposed to come online in 2024 now it's being delayed to 2028. I think some of these companies are delaying it because they now know that they're not going to likely get funding, or because of the uncertainty around the acts that we're seeing around the new trade policy.""Despite the U.S. being a major producer of certain semiconductor chips, its global market share, measured by volume, has dwindled from 37% in 1990 to just 10% in 2022, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. This reliance on imports, particularly from Taiwan and South Korea, prompted the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act in 2022, aiming to revitalize domestic manufacturing and reduce supply chain vulnerabilities.The CHIPS Act, championed by the previous Biden administration, has spurred significant investment, with projections indicating the U.S. will more than triple its semiconductor manufacturing capacity, the highest growth rate globally, according to a May 2024 report by the Semiconductor Industry Association and Boston Consulting Group.Barry Broome, president of the Greater Sacramento Economic Council, told the AP that the pandemic underscored the risks of relying on offshore production. ""It was 'abundantly clear that having these chip products offshore in Vietnam, Taiwan, China for cost savings had serious implications.'""The region's established tech infrastructure and skilled workforce have attracted major investments, such as Bosch's $1.9 billion project to produce electric vehicle chips, creating up to 1,700 jobs.Dinakar Munagala, cofounder of Sacramento-based AI startup Blaize, highlighted the increasing interest from defense and border security sectors in domestically produced chips. ""We're built here,"" he said to the AP.The Trump administration views domestic chip production as a national security imperative, aiming to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers and mitigate risks associated with concentrated manufacturing. However, the fluidity of the administration's tariff policies is causing concern.Alvin Nguyen, senior analyst at Forrester, told the AP that ""the fluidity of the state of administration's tariffs will cause confusion about the impact on the supply chain 'due to the complexity of tracking where materials and manufactured goods are produced and assembled.'""The uncertainty has already impacted industries, with video game companies like Nintendo adjusting prices in response to potential tariff increases. Broome expressed hope that the tariffs are a short-term measure to restructure global trade relationships, cautioning that prolonged uncertainty could stifle investment. ""If the tariffs are used for leverage to get better agreements in the next two or three months, then we'll come back quickly, and will benefit from it,"" he told the AP. ""If they're considered long-term policy, I think it'll really ice the capital markets from putting real money on the table.""","The U.S. semiconductor industry was actively working to bring manufacturing back home, fueled by government incentives and a strategic push to bolster domestic production.

Experts sound alarm: US banks sitting on $500 billion in unrealized losses; fear a repeat of Silicon Valley Bank-like collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/experts-sound-alarm-us-banks-sitting-on-500-billion-in-unrealized-losses-fear-a-repeat-of-silicon-valley-bank-like-collapse/articleshow/121194423.cms,"The US banking regulators shut down the Silicon Valley Bank (SVP) Financial Group, which caused shockwaves in the startup community.

Banking Sector Jitters Return in America

Just two years after the dramatic collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank sent shockwaves through the financial world, a new wave of concern is building within the United States banking sector. A recent report citing data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) reveals a significant surge in unrealized losses held by US banks related to their securities investments.According to Fortune, these losses reached a staggering $482.4 billion in 2024. This figure represents a substantial 32.5% increase, or $118 billion, compared to the previous quarter, a jump that experts are viewing with increasing alarm. The report highlights that this number is approaching the $515 billion seen when SVB succumbed to a bank run in March 2023 and remains considerably high compared to the peak of $684 billion reached later that year.Rebel Cole, a finance professor at Florida Atlantic University with prior experience as a special advisor to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank , expressed serious concerns. ""All it takes is one bad news story about any of these banks, and we could have another banking crisis like we had in March of [2023],"" he was quoted by Fortune, adding, ""I’m amazed we haven’t had one since then.""Cole pointed to the volatility of US bank losses, which he noted have been closely tracking the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield. The report indicates that this yield has experienced significant fluctuations in 2025, particularly following the US President Donald Trump administration's announcement of tariffs on imports from all countries, coupled with persistently high interest rates amid ongoing inflation. The 10-year Treasury yield is currently above 4.5%, nearing its peak from the fourth quarter.Amit Seru, a finance professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, echoed these concerns as per the report. He pointed out that at the current level, the banking system is starting to ""see serious problems,"" according to Fortune. He further warned that ""It becomes quite bad at 5%,"" as per the report. Cole estimated that such a scenario could translate to approximately $600 billion to $700 billion in unrealized investment losses.Adding another layer of concern, Torsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo Global Management, highlighted potential risks associated with the broader economic environment. ""In a stagflation scenario, the risk is that rates will be higher for longer and credit losses will begin to accumulate, in particular for lenders to tech, growth, and [venture capital], where borrowers are characterized by having no earnings and low coverage ratios,"" he was quoted as saying in the Fortune report.","A recent report reveals a significant surge in unrealized losses held by US banks related to their securities investments.

Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine

‘rawdog’ morning routine

Mark Zuckerberg follows the ‘Rawdog’ routine, know what it is

Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine key elements

1. No caffeine or external stimulants

Zuckerberg completely avoids caffeine in the mornings. While caffeine is widely used to combat fatigue and boost focus, he believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

This is in stark contrast to other tech leaders who often depend on multiple doses of caffeine throughout the day.

2. Intense physical activity: Brazilian jiu-jitsu and MMA

A central element of Zuckerberg’s morning is two hours of combat sports training, particularly Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA).

These are not light workouts. Zuckerberg actively engages in grappling and sparring, where split-second focus is essential.

He has stated that unlike running, which allows for mental wandering, jiu-jitsu requires full presence—a factor that helps him “recenter” and transition into work mode.

3. Mental presence and focus

The high-pressure nature of combat sports trains the brain to respond quickly under stress.

Zuckerberg uses these sessions to reset mentally, describing them as more effective than caffeine in waking up both the body and mind.

The risk of failure (being pinned or tapped out) keeps him focused, which in turn reduces stress from external sources.

4. Simplified lifestyle to reduce decision fatigue

Zuckerberg is known for his repetitive wardrobe—gray T-shirts, jeans, and sneakers. This choice is deliberate and helps him save cognitive effort for high-stakes decisions.

Reducing daily trivial choices aligns with psychological research indicating that decision fatigue can impair judgment over time.

5. High-protein diet and caloric intake

Why Zuckerberg chose this path: The influence of early education

How Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine powers executive performance

Enhanced cognitive function

Martial arts require constant anticipation, pattern recognition, and strategic thinking, which parallels the kind of problem-solving skills needed in high-level business decisions.

Stress management

Physical exertion is scientifically linked to lower cortisol levels and improved mood. Zuckerberg’s training acts as a buffer against the chronic stress of running a global tech company.

Improved executive functioning

The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue during the workday.

How Zuckerberg’s routine compared to Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, other tech leaders

Executive

Routine Element

Elon Musk

High caffeine intake, long work hours

Jack Dorsey

Fasting, meditation, cold plunges

Jeff Bezos

Prioritizes sleep, slow mornings

Tim Cook

Early rising with structured exercise



Scientific perspective on ‘Rawdog’ routines

Exercise improves executive functioning, especially activities that demand coordination and focus.

Caffeine-free mornings may lead to more stable energy levels, avoiding midday crashes associated with stimulant withdrawal.

Simplified routines reduce decision fatigue, as shown in studies on successful leaders and their minimalist approaches.

Routines are known to play a vital role in shaping the lives and productivity of high achievers across industries. Whether it’s elite athletes, creative professionals, or technology entrepreneurs, the way they start their day often sets the tone for how they approach challenges and decision-making. Among these successful individuals, Mark Zuckerberg—founder of Facebook and CEO of Meta—stands out not just for his innovations in the digital world but also for his unconventional personal discipline. His so-calledhas recently drawn public attention for its no-frills, stimulant-free approach to productivity and mental clarity.Unlike many of his peers in Silicon Valley who lean on coffee, energy drinks, or even mind-enhancing drugs to kick-start their day, Zuckerberg’s morning begins with no artificial aids. Instead, he embraces natural energy, physical intensity, and mental focus through a carefully structured regimen centered on Brazilian jiu-jitsu and minimalism. This article provides an in-depth, non-opinionated breakdown of Zuckerberg’s unique routine, detailing its structure, rationale, and implications for performance and mental resilience.The term ‘rawdog routine’, as used by Zuckerberg, refers to a lifestyle approach that entails confronting reality and the demands of the day without the aid of stimulants, drugs, or performance enhancers. The concept is based on the idea of beginning one’s day in a fully natural and present state. For Zuckerberg, this means no coffee, no cannabis, no nootropics, and no artificial substances that could alter his mental state. He has occasionally referred to drinking coffee recreationally while on vacation, but emphasizes that it is never a part of his regular workday schedule.This method, according to Zuckerberg, is about achieving mental clarity and physical readiness through discipline rather than chemical shortcuts. The only supplements he reportedly uses are creatine and vitamin D, both commonly accepted for muscle recovery and general health support.Zuckerberg’s rawdog morning routine is built on five foundational principles, all of which are designed to enhance productivity, reduce stress, and maintain mental sharpness.While Zuckerberg does not publicly share a specific meal plan, it is known that he consumes a high-protein diet, which is critical for recovery and energy post-training.Reports suggest his daily caloric intake may reach up to 4,000 calories, especially to meet the energy demands of intensive physical activity.Zuckerberg has cited his exposure to the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program in school as a formative influence behind his stance against drugs and stimulants. This early education helped shape his views on substance use and led to a personal policy of natural energy dependence, rather than chemical performance enhancements.Unlike other Silicon Valley executives who have publicly discussed experimenting with microdosing psychedelics or using smart drugs (nootropics), Zuckerberg maintains a more grounded, drug-free approach to focus and performance.Zuckerberg’s morning routine is not just a personal wellness strategy—it appears to have professional implications as well. Here’s how it aligns with executive performance demands:While Zuckerberg avoids all forms of chemical stimulation, other tech leaders have taken diverse approaches to optimizing performance:Zuckerberg’s ‘rawdog’ method is unique in its emphasis on no external stimulants, which sets it apart from the above figures.While no clinical studies have yet been conducted on Zuckerberg’s specific regimen, related research suggests:","Zuckerberg’s morning includes two hours of Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA) He believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

Microsoft becomes world's most-valuable company and its No 1 position also has 'Trump Tariff' message on Apple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-becomes-worlds-most-valuable-company-and-its-no-1-position-also-has-trump-tariff-message-on-apple/articleshow/120845348.cms,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella



Trump Tariff pains 'hurting' Apple

Microsoft has once again ascended to World's Most Valuable company, overtaking Apple. Software giant Microsoft has claimed the title of the world's most valuable company as the week concluded, boasting a market capitalization of $3.235 trillion. This milestone positions them ahead of Apple , which had long held the top spot, with the iPhone maker's market cap closing on Friday (May 2) at $3.07 trillion.Securing the third position is Nvidia , whose valuation stands at $2.76 trillion, as reported by The Information's newsletter.The surge in Microsoft's stock price on Thursday fueled this shift, following the release of robust financial results for the March quarter that surpassed analyst forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the sustained strong demand for the company's cloud services and artificial intelligence (AI) offerings during an investor call.Throughout the year, Microsoft's shares have consistently outpaced Apple's, signaling growing investor confidence in the tech giant's strategic focus on AI and cloud computing. Notably, this significant post-earnings stock jump for Microsoft echoes a similar event in October 2015, when the burgeoning Azure cloud business witnessed revenue more than double, propelling shares upward by 10%, according to Investopedia.While Apple also delivered better-than-expected first-quarter results, buoyed by strong iPhone sales , the company is facing headwinds from newly implemented tariffs under President Donald Trump.Apple's extensive reliance on imported components within its supply chain renders it particularly vulnerable to the impact of these tariffs. Consequently, its share price has experienced a significant 18% decline since the beginning of the year, marking one of the most substantial drops among major technology companies.Furthermore, CEO Tim Cook has indicated that Apple anticipates an additional $900 million in costs this quarter due to the tariffs, unless the current conditions change.According to Dow Jones Market Data, as reported by NewsMax, Apple's decrease in market value represents the largest for any company at the start of this year. Among the leading tech firms, only Tesla has witnessed a steeper year-to-date decline in its shares, falling by 29%.","Microsoft's market cap now stands at $3.235 trillion, overtaking Apple.

Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools

Google claims breakup ""impossible"" without serious consequences

The US Justice Department have asked a federal judge to break up Google's advertising technology business, marking the second government request within a year that could fundamentally reshape the $2 trillion giant. During a hearing in Virginia, DOJ lawyers outlined plans to force Google to divest key components of its online advertising system following Judge Leonie M. Brinkema's April ruling that Google illegally monopolized portions of the digital advertising market .""To leave Google with 90 percent of publishers beholden to them is, frankly, too dangerous,"" said Julia Tarver Wood, the government's lead attorney in the case. The hearing established September 22 as the date when both parties will present detailed arguments about remedies.The Justice Department's proposal specifically targets Google's ad exchange—the technology connecting buyers and sellers of online ad space—along with tools used by website publishers to sell advertising inventory. The government plan would initially make Google's auction code available to publishers and other ad tech companies, followed by requiring Google to fully divest publisher tools that handle functions like record keeping.This latest action follows a separate antitrust case in Washington where the DOJ is seeking to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser to address monopolistic behavior in the search market. If both requests are granted, it would represent the most significant government-mandated corporate restructuring since AT&T's breakup in the 1980s.Google's defense team strongly opposed the breakup proposal, arguing it fails to comply with legal precedent and would create significant problems. Karen Dunn, Google's lead attorney, called the plan ""very likely completely impossible"" without causing serious problems, noting few potential buyers exist for the technology besides ""enormous tech companies.""Google instead proposed changing certain business practices and opening its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers, while arguing that divesting these technologies would eliminate important security and privacy protections the company currently provides.Judge Brinkema ruled last month that Google had illegally monopolized both publisher tools and ad exchange software, though she dismissed claims related to advertiser tools. The business in question represents only a portion of Google's massive online advertising revenue, which funds its free services like Maps, Gmail, and search.","Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools.

GTA 6 release and updates FAQs

What is the official release date of GTA 6?

Grand Theft Auto VI will launch on May 26, 2026, according to Rockstar’s announcement on May 2, 2025.

Why was GTA 6 delayed from 2025?

Rockstar stated that the delay was to ensure the game meets the quality expectations of players and the studio’s own development standards.

What platforms will GTA 6 be available on?

Although not officially confirmed, GTA 6 is expected to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Will there be new trailers before the release?

Yes, Rockstar has confirmed that more information and footage will be released in the months following the release date announcement.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

"Elon Musk's Twitter continues to take payments for Blue Check marks from terrorists banned in the US, including Hezbollah's founder and Houthi members: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-twitter-continues-to-take-payments-for-blue-check-marks-from-terrorists-banned-in-the-us-including-hezbollahs-founder-and-houthi-members-report/articleshow/121193041.cms,"More than 200 terrorists accounts with Blue Check marks

How Hezbollah founder and Houthis are using Twitter to raise funds

More than a year after initial warnings, Elon Musk's social media platform Twitter continues to accept payments for premium subscription accounts, including the associated blue check marks , from terrorist organizations and other entities under US sanctions, says a report in New York Times. The report cites a new report by the Tech Transparency Project , a nonprofit focused on technology company accountability, which found that Twitter has continued to receive payments from accounts apparently linked to leaders within Hezbollah, Houthi officials, and militia leaders in Syria and Iraq. These subscriptions, costing $8 monthly, provide users with a blue check mark – previously reserved for notable figures – along with benefits such as enhanced algorithm placement, post editing capabilities, and the ability to share longer videos.The NYT report notes that following a previous report by the Tech Transparency Project last year, which identified 28 sanctioned entities with paid Blue Check marks, Twitter removed the badges from some accounts and suspended others. However, within a month, several of these accounts reportedly repurchased the badges and have maintained them since.The report highlights the Tech Transparency Project's finding that over 200 accounts connected to terrorist groups and other sanctioned entities have acquired Blue Check marks. Katie Paul, the director of the organization, told the New York Times, ""They rely on the premium services for the amplification of long propaganda posts and extended videos. They are not just subscribing for the blue check notoriety, they are subscribing for the premium services.""The report points out that Mr. Musk, currently serving as a special adviser to President Trump, recently criticized the Treasury Department for alleged deficiencies in tracking and preventing payments to terrorist groups. However, during a February appearance with President Trump, Mr. Musk stated that controls to prevent payments to such groups and fraudsters were ""in place at any company.""According to The New York Times, neither Twitter nor the Treasury Department responded to requests for comment on the Tech Transparency Project's findings.The report recalls that after Mr. Musk's acquisition of X in 2022, significant changes were implemented, including the reinstatement of numerous previously banned accounts and substantial staff reductions. The old verification system, which involved employee verification of prominent users, was also replaced with the current subscription model.The report mentions that while Twitter's policies prohibit terrorist groups from purchasing Blue Check marks, it remains unclear how the organizations and individuals identified in the report circumvented these rules to obtain premium status. The lack of identity verification under the new system also raises the possibility that some of the flagged accounts could belong to impersonators.However, the report notes that some of these accounts were labeled ""ID verified,"" a process requiring the submission of a selfie and identification. It highlights the case of Subhi Tufayli, a founder and former secretary general of Hezbollah, who reportedly has an ""ID verified"" account with over 40,700 followers. Mr. Tufayli has been on the Treasury Department's sanctions list since 1995, and his account, verified in October 2023, frequently shares lengthy videos of his sermons.The New York Times reports that an account associated with the Houthi rebel group in Yemen previously had a Blue Check mark but was removed by Twitter following the Tech Transparency Project's initial report last year.The report details how an account under the name Hussain al-Ezzi, identified by the Tech Transparency Project as a deputy foreign minister for the Houthis, publicly requested Mr. Musk to reinstate the group's verification or at least their subscriptions. IT states that the latest Tech Transparency Project report found that at least five senior Houthi officials subsequently appeared to pay for Blue Check marks on Twitter, with their accounts collectively having over 820,000 followers.It further said that some of the identified accounts have used Twitter to solicit funds through tipping and subscription features or by directing users to cryptocurrency wallets. Quoting Ms Paul, The New York Times said, ""There is clear evidence of these groups profiting and fund-raising through X. They are sanctioned for a reason, and the fact that somebody who has such influence and power in the federal government is at the same time profiting from these designated terrorist groups and individuals is extremely concerning.""","Twitter continues to accept payments for premium subscription accounts, including the associated blue check marks, from terrorist organizations and other entities under US sanctions.

What analysts say



Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on Trump’s tariffs

Walmart has said it will raise prices later this month because of higher tariffs, even though its U.S. sales in the first quarter were better than expected. According to a Reuters report, John David Rainey, Walmart’s Chief Financial Officer, told CNBC that shoppers will start seeing price increases by the end of May and into June.In a statement, CEO Doug McMillon said “We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible but given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren't able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins”.According to analysts, the retail giant can work with suppliers and improve efficiency to limit price increases, but only for so long. The Reuters report quotes Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, who said tariffs will likely reduce demand somewhat but won’t cause a total market collapse.“There will likely be some demand destruction from tariffs, a complete wreck is unlikely,” he said.Joseph Feldman, an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, said Walmart’s wide range of products gives it more flexibility to spread out price increases, which may be easier for customers to accept.""My sense is Walmart will manage (tariffs) better than almost every other retailer, and they will be able to continue to generate solid profit,"" Feldman said.Jacobsen said it made sense for Walmart to hold back on second-quarter profit guidance but found it positive that they maintained their full-year outlook, expecting tariff effects to balance out over time.Amazon anticipates minimal impact from US tariffs on Chinese goods. In comments during a call with analysts following the release of Amazon's strong first-quarter earnings results, Jassy explained that the tariffs on goods from China would negatively impact the US-based sellers.“Retailers who aren’t buying directly from China are typically buying from companies who themselves are buying from China, marking these items up, rebranding and selling to US consumers,” Jassy told analysts on a call.However, he suggested that the complex global supply chain could inadvertently give Chinese sellers an advantage on the e-commerce platform.“These retailers are buying the product at a higher price than Chinese sellers selling directly to US consumers in our marketplace. So, the total tariff will be higher for these retailers than for China direct sellers,” he added.","Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said ‘given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren't able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins’ Analyst Brian Jacobsen said tariffs will likely reduce demand somewhat but won’t cause a total market collapse.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121191923,imgsize-87516,width-400,resizemode-4/Walmart-Net-Worth.jpg"

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that if given another chance, he would not start Nvidia. Huang, who recently appeared on the Acquired podcast , was asked what type of company he would start if he had the chance to do it all over again. Responding to the question, he replied “I wouldn’t”. Adding further, he stated ""Building a company and building Nvidia turned out to have been a million times harder than any of us expected it to be”.He continued: “And at the time, if we realized the pain and suffering and just how vulnerable you're going to feel and the challenges that you're going to endure, the embarrassment and the shame, and the list of all the things that go wrong—I don't think anybody would start a company. Nobody in their right mind would do it”.During the podcast, Huang also highlighted that most founders succeed because they initially underestimate the difficulties they might face.He said “You have to get yourself to believe that it's not that hard because it's way harder than you think…Taking all of my knowledge now—I go back, and I said I'm going to endure that whole journey again, I think it's too much. It is just too much.”When asked about the importance of networking support to succeed in a startup, Huang said “You need the unwavering support of the people around you… I'm pretty sure that almost every successful company and entrepreneurs that have gone through some difficult challenges had that support system around them.”In related news, Nvidia announced that the company will sell over 18,000 of its latest artificial intelligence (AI) chips to Saudi Arabian firm Humain. The announcement was made during the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum in Riyadh, which is part of a White House-led visit to the region that includes President Donald Trump and several tech leaders including Elon Musk, Sam Altman and Jensen Huang.The chips, part of Nvidia's Blackwell series, will be used in data centers with a total capacity of 500 megawatts. Nvidia said the chips to be deployed first will be the GB300 Blackwell chips, which were officially unveiled earlier this year. These chips are designed for training and deploying advanced AI systems.","Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, said he would not start a new company if he had it to do over again.

"AI Models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek frequently exaggerate scientific findings, study reveals",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-models-like-chatgpt-and-deepseek-frequently-exaggerate-scientific-findings-study-reveals/articleshow/121189880.cms,"

What are the findings of the study

Why are these exaggerations happening

Accuracy prompts backfire

Humans still do better

Recommendations for safer use

According to a new study published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and DeepSeek often exaggerate scientific findings while summarising research papers. Researchers Uwe Peters from Utrecht University and Benjamin Chin-Yee from Western University and the University of Cambridge analysed 4900 AI-generated summaries from ten leading LLMs. Their findings revealed that up to 73 percent of summaries contained overgeneralised or inaccurate conclusions. Surprisingly, the problem worsened when users explicitly prompted the models to prioritise accuracy, and newer models like ChatGPT 4 performed worse than older versions.The study assessed how accurately leading LLMS summarised abstracts and full-length articles from prestigious science and medical journals, including Nature, Science, and The Lancet. Over a period of one year, the researchers collected and analysed 4,900 summaries generated by AI systems such as ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, and LLaMA.Six out of ten models routinely exaggerated claims, often by changing cautious, study-specific statements like “The treatment was effective in this study” into broader, definitive assertions like “The treatment is effective.” These subtle shifts in tone and tense can mislead readers into thinking that scientific findings apply more broadly than they actually do.The tendency of AI models to exaggerate scientific findings appears to stem from both the data they are trained on and the behaviour they learn from user interactions. According to the study’s authors, one major reason is that overgeneralizations are already common in scientific literature. When LLMs are trained on this content, they learn to replicate the same patterns, often reinforcing existing flaws rather than correcting them.Another contributing factor is user preference. Language models are optimised to generate responses that sound helpful, fluent, and widely applicable. As co-author Benjamin Chin-Yee explained, the models may learn that generalisations are more pleasing to users, even if they distort the original meaning. This results in summaries that may appear authoritative but fail to accurately represent the complexities and limitations of the research.Contrary to expectations, prompting the models to be more accurate actually made the problem worse. When instructed to avoid inaccuracies, the LLMs were nearly twice as likely to produce summaries with exaggerated or overgeneralised conclusions compared to when given a simple, neutral prompt.“This effect is concerning,” said Peters. “Students, researchers, and policymakers may assume that if they ask ChatGPT to avoid inaccuracies, they’ll get a more reliable summary. Our findings prove the opposite.”To compare AI and human performance directly, the researchers analysed summaries written by people alongside those generated by chatbots. The results showed that AI was nearly five times more likely to make broad generalisations than human writers. This gap underscores the need for careful human oversight when using AI tools in scientific or academic contexts.To mitigate these risks, the researchers recommend using models like Claude, which demonstrated the highest generalisation accuracy in their tests. They also suggest setting LLMs to a lower ""temperature"" to reduce creative embellishments and using prompts that encourage past-tense, study-specific reporting.“If we want AI to support science literacy rather than undermine it,” Peters noted, “we need more vigilance and testing of these systems in science communication contexts.”","Researchers from Utrecht University and the University of Cambridge analysed 4900 AI-generated summaries from ten leading LLMs. Their findings revealed that up to 73 percent of summaries contained overgeneralised or inaccurate conclusions.

Wyze, a startup that makes smart home devices and wireless cameras, is nearing the completion of its relocation of manufacturing facilities out of China, a move reportedly expedited by recent trade policies. The company's efforts to shift production have been underway for over a year, but were intensified after Wyze faced a substantial tariff bill.“We set an impossible goal to move our factories out of China in 90 days. A video from our CEO on the factory floor. We're all packed up,” the company said in a post.“It's the end of an era, thank you China,” it added.According to a recent post on X, Wyze paid $255,000 in tariffs on a shipment of goods valued at $167,000. This significant financial impact from the 145% tariff on Chinese imports has spurred the company to expedite its transition.“Just got our first tariff bill. We imported $167k of floodlights and then paid $255k in tariffs. That’s more than any of our founders were paid last year,” the company said.While some reports indicate Wyze is moving its factories to Vietnam, the company has not confirmed the exact locations. Wyze aims to complete this relocation within approximately 60 days.“Obviously we’d love to move our factories back home to Seattle. We just need to figure out to make the rain in Seattle power an assembly line,” the company said.The move comes as many U.S. companies grapple with the effects of increased tariffs on Chinese goods. While some tech devices are exempt, the rising costs are prompting companies to adjust their supply chains and consider alternative manufacturing locations.","Wyze, a startup that makes smart home devices and wireless cameras, is nearing the completion of its relocation of manufacturing facilities out of China.

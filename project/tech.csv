Elon Musk focuses on X in the evening with late-night product meetings





Short early morning naps to maintain his intense work schedule





Elon Musk’s lifelong work ethic shapes his leadership and company success





Elon Musk’s intense routine shows both achievement and personal sacrifice









Elon Musk is widely recognised as one of the most influential entrepreneurs of the modern era, celebrated for transforming industries through Tesla, SpaceX, and X, formerly Twitter. While his groundbreaking innovations and ambitious ventures frequently capture global headlines, the extreme daily regimen that fuels his success often goes unnoticed. According to Chris Bakke, a former X employee who worked closely with Musk, the billionaire follows a relentless schedule that tests the limits of physical endurance, mental focus, and leadership stamina. From marathon work sessions at Tesla to late-night product strategy meetings at X, Musk’s routine exemplifies an extraordinary commitment to his companies, revealing how his intense discipline and hands-on approach have become central to his unparalleled achievements.According to Chris Bakke, Musk devotes the first ten hours of his day exclusively to Tesla. During this time, he engages deeply with engineering updates, production reviews, and operational decision-making. Unlike many CEOs who delegate operational oversight, Musk immerses himself in the minutiae of production, from solving engineering bottlenecks to streamlining assembly lines.This morning marathon illustrates Musk’s philosophy that hands-on involvement is critical for innovation.By dedicating extensive hours to understanding every facet of Tesla’s operations, he ensures that strategic goals align with practical execution. It also reflects his belief in accountability; problems are addressed immediately, and solutions are implemented in real time.The intensity of this routine underscores a broader lesson in leadership: for Musk, true influence comes from intimate knowledge of the business, not from solely relying on reports or managers.After a full day at Tesla, Musk shifts his attention to X. Product meetings typically begin around 5 or 6 PM, where he discusses strategy, innovation, and ongoing projects. According to Bakke, one-on-one meetings, including his own weekly discussions, were often scheduled for 10 PM but could extend into the early hours of the morning, sometimes lasting until 1 AM.This late-evening engagement demonstrates Musk’s unrelenting commitment to leadership across multiple companies. It highlights a culture of high expectations, where real-time decision-making and personal oversight are prioritised over conventional office schedules. For employees and observers, it paints a picture of a CEO whose availability and responsiveness never truly end.Even after midnight meetings, Musk reportedly takes only a brief nap around 2 AM, often lasting just a couple of hours. This minimal rest enables him to resume work quickly, repeating the cycle seven days a week.Such a schedule prompts questions about long-term sustainability, with potential risks including sleep deprivation, stress, and burnout. Yet Musk has publicly argued that extended working hours are not just necessary but strategically advantageous. By working longer than peers, he maintains a competitive edge, completing twice as much work in the same timeframe, a principle he described in a 2014 commencement address at USC.Musk’s extreme routine is not a recent development. His early ventures reveal a consistent pattern of sacrificing personal comfort for productivity. Sleeping at offices, showering at the YMCA to save time, and enduring grueling work schedules during product launches all underscore a lifelong commitment to hard work.A striking example occurred during Tesla’s Model 3 production ramp in 2018. Musk slept on the factory floor instead of a narrow couch to remain present during critical problem-solving moments. Such anecdotes demonstrate that Musk’s work ethic is not performative but deeply embedded in his approach to leadership and company success. Musk’s daily routine reflects a broader philosophy: long hours, focus, and hands-on leadership are essential to achieving extraordinary results. He believes that doubling work hours compared to peers directly translates to higher output and faster progress. This principle guides his approach across all ventures, from Tesla to SpaceX to X.Beyond productivity, Musk’s schedule embodies a leadership style defined by visibility and accountability. His presence across companies sets a high bar for performance, instills urgency, and fosters a culture where immediate problem-solving is expected. For teams, this is both motivating and challenging, requiring adaptability and resilience.While Musk’s extreme routine has enabled him to lead multiple companies simultaneously and achieve groundbreaking innovations, it comes with personal costs. Chronic sleep deprivation, limited downtime, and continuous high-stress decision-making are inherent risks. However, Musk appears to mitigate these through strategic short naps, meticulous planning, and a relentless focus on priorities.For aspiring entrepreneurs, Musk’s routine serves as both inspiration and caution. It demonstrates the potential for extraordinary achievement when extreme focus and dedication are applied, while also highlighting the importance of recognising human limits and sustainability.","Elon Musk is widely recognised as one of the most influential entrepreneurs of the modern era.

Chip war intensifies: Nvidia insists dominance as Google and Meta explore in-house AI chips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chip-war-intensifies-nvidia-insists-dominance-as-google-and-meta-explore-in-house-ai-chips/articleshow/125573683.cms,"How Meta’s interest in Google’s chips increases pressure on Nvidia

Google’s in-house AI chips attract fresh attention





Nvidia is pushing back firmly against growing questions about its long-established dominance in the AI hardware market, insisting that its GPUs remain “a generation ahead of the industry” even as Google’s in-house AI chips gain momentum and Meta is reportedly evaluating whether to adopt them in its data centres. The developments have fuelled concern among investors and analysts, leading to a three per cent drop in Nvidia’s shares as speculation grows that two of the world’s biggest AI platforms could begin shifting portions of their compute workloads away from Nvidia’s GPUs.Meta’s reported exploration of using Google’s TPUs in its data centres triggered a three per cent fall in Nvidia’s stock, reflecting investor worries over potential shifts in AI hardware supply chains and the possibility that major platforms could diversify away from Nvidia’s systems. The reaction underscored fears that Google’s chips could emerge as a viable alternative in environments where cost and energy efficiency are prioritised. The situation has intensified scrutiny of Nvidia’s strategic positioning, particularly as hyperscalers evaluate mixed chip infrastructures to reduce reliance on a single supplier.In its response, Nvidia said it remains the only platform capable of running all major AI models across every computing environment, emphasising that its GPUs offer broader adaptability than Google’s application-specific integrated circuits designed for narrower functionality.The company highlighted the capabilities of its latest Blackwell generation, which it claims delivers superior performance, flexibility and interchangeability compared to specialised chip designs. CEO Jensen Huang also reiterated that scaling laws, which link AI progress to greater compute power, ensure long-term rising demand for Nvidia systems.Google’s AI chips have gained new visibility after the launch of Gemini 3, a highly rated AI model trained entirely on the company’s internal processors rather than Nvidia GPUs. While Google does not sell its chips directly, it deploys them across its ecosystem and rents access to businesses through Google Cloud. Google said that demand is increasing for both its custom chips and Nvidia’s GPUs, indicating that it intends to maintain a dual-track strategy.Google’s chips are optimised for targeted AI workloads, offering strong efficiency and cost advantages in specific use cases. Nvidia’s GPUs, by contrast, are general-purpose accelerators used across a wider range of machine-learning frameworks, deployment settings and enterprise applications. Analysts say this distinction explains why Nvidia continues to hold over 90 per cent of the AI chip market despite rising interest in specialised alternatives.While the competitive landscape is clearly shifting, Nvidia’s scale, software ecosystem and broad adoption still give it a commanding lead. Yet as Google advances its in-house chips and Meta experiments with alternatives, the balance of power in AI hardware may no longer be guaranteed. The next phase of the chip war will depend not just on raw performance, but on cost, availability and strategic alliances.","Google’s in-house AI chips attract fresh attention from Meta.

DOGE's 'What did you do last week?' email

DOGE made name for massive firings

* Edward Coristine:





The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a signature initiative launched with fanfare at the start of President Donald Trump’s second term no longer exists. According to an exclusive report by news agency Reuters, the US President Donald Trump's DOGE has disbanded with eight months left to its mandate, ending an initiative launched with fanfare as a symbol of Trump's pledge to slash the government's size but which critics say delivered few measurable savings. ""That doesn't exist,"" Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor told Reuters earlier this month when asked about DOGE's status. In the first on-the-record comments from the administration regarding the unit's dissolution, Kupor confirmed that DOGE is no longer a ""centralized entity.""The closure is said to mark the end of a high-profile experiment originally led by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, which critics argue delivered few verifiable savings despite its aggressive public messaging.""This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,"" Musk said, holding the tool above his head at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland, in February.In February, DOGE's email to Federal agencies saying that employees should comply with Elon Musk's directive to list five accomplishments in the past week was not met nicely.Federal employees across the US government had received an email asking them to account for what they did in the past week. Elon Musk openly said that they will lose their jobs if they don't respond. ""Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump's instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,"" Musk wrote on Twitter. The Twitter post ends: ""Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.""After protests across departments, gradually, almost all Federal employees were told not to respond to these email.DOGE initially made headlines with dramatic moves to shrink federal agencies, cut budgets, and redirect workflows toward Trump’s priorities. However, according to Kupor and documents reviewed by Reuters, the OPM—the federal government’s standard human resources office—has since absorbed many of DOGE's functions. The quiet dismantling of the department stands in sharp contrast to the media blitz that accompanied its creation. For months, the President, his cabinet, and advisers promoted the initiative heavily on social media. Elon Musk, who initially headed the department, frequently touted its operations on his X platform. In a defining image of the department's early days, Musk brandished a chainsaw above his head at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February, calling the department ""the chainsaw for bureaucracy.""However, following a public fight with President Trump in May, Musk has since left Washington. While administration officials have not formally announced DOGE's end, the unit has effectively faded away despite an executive order signed earlier in the term decreeing it would operate through July 2026.Personnel Moves and Unverified Savings As DOGE dissolves, key personnel are migrating to new initiatives. At least two prominent DOGE figures have joined the National Design Studio, a new body created by executive order in August with a mandate to ""beautify"" government websites.The Airbnb co-founder, formerly part of Musk’s team, now heads the design studio.A DOGE employee known for recruiting staff via social media, is also involved in the new effort.During its operation, DOGE officials claimed to have slashed tens of billions of dollars in government expenditures. However, because the unit did not provide detailed public accounting of its work, outside financial experts have deemed it impossible to verify these figures. In response to inquiries, the White House did not explicitly address the disbanding of the department.""President Trump was given a clear mandate to reduce waste, fraud and abuse across the federal government, and he continues to actively deliver on that commitment,"" White House spokeswoman Liz Huston said in an email.","Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) no longer exists, Reuters reports.

Google's Gemini 3 termed 'big threat' to ChatGPT





Since the launch of ChatGPT three years ago, a chorus of analysts, technologists, and even former Google executives have warned that the search giant had fallen behind in the high-stakes race for artificial intelligence dominance. But -- Not anymore. Google parent Alphabet has mounted a ferocious comeback, reassured investors with new software breakthroughs, and secured massive chip partnerships that have reshaped the competitive landscape. Following the release of its Gemini 3 model and reports of a potential hardware alliance with Meta Platforms, Alphabet shares have soared, adding nearly $1 trillion in market capitalization since mid-October. The company is now on track to hit a $4 trillion market valuation for the first time.The rally has been fueled by a vote of confidence from Wall Street’s most influential investor: Berkshire Hathaway. Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway took a $4.9 billion stake in the company during the third quarter. Conversely, the shifting tide has weighed on rivals; shares of SoftBank Group, a major backer of OpenAI, fell to a two-month low Tuesday.Nvidia Corp, the longtime kingmaker of AI hardware, slid as much as 5.51%, erasing $243 billion in market value on fears that Google’s proprietary chips are becoming a viable alternative to Nvidia’s dominant gear.“Google has arguably always been the dark horse in this AI race,” told Neil Shah, an analyst and co-founder at Counterpoint Research, to Bloomberg. “[It’s] a sleeping giant that is now fully awake.” Google’s resurgence is built on what CEO Sundar Pichai calls a “full-stack approach.” Unlike OpenAI, which relies on suppliers for compute, Google controls its entire supply chain: the apps (like the new Nano Banana image generator), the data gathered from Search and YouTube, the cloud infrastructure, and the custom silicon. “We’ve taken a full, deep, full-stack approach to AI,” Pichai told investors last quarter. “And that really plays out.”This vertical integration is paying dividends in hardware. For over a decade, Google has developed Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for its own use. Now, it is opening that hardware to others. In October, Anthropic PBC announced a deal worth tens of billions of dollars to use as many as 1 million Google TPUs.The Information reported that Meta is in talks to use Google’s chips in its data centers by 2027. While Google declined to address specific plans, a spokesperson noted that the cloud business is seeing “accelerating demand” for its custom silicon.Google released a new AI model, Gemini 3, that improves on its predecessor’s ability to create software programs, organize email and help businesses analyze documents. It can also mix graphics and text together when responding to requests involving travel itineraries, history or art.“We’re in a situation where — because of Google’s size and space and their first-mover advantage in search — Gemini could take market share and cause OpenAI and others to fall behind,” told Mike O’Rourke, the chief market strategist at JonesTrading, an institutional trading firm, to New York Times. He said that such a turn toward Gemini could ripple through the market, raising questions for companies such as Oracle and Microsoft, which OpenAI has committed to pay billions of dollars for computing.","Alphabet shares have soared, adding nearly $1 trillion in market capitalization since mid-October.

Google Android boss confirmed merging ChromeOS and Android







Earlier this year, Google announced plans to merge ChromeOS and Android into a unified platform. Now, a recent job listing suggests the tech giant has started to work on the project and, in that process, may have revealed the project's codename. The posting, seeking a product manager for what appears to be Google's next major platform, references a project codenamed “Aluminium”, which is likely the internal designation for the long-rumored Android-PC ecosystem merger.According to a report by Android Authority, the discovery was made by a tipster named Frost Core on Telegram over the weekend. The job posting pointed to a vacancy for a ‘Senior Product Manager, Android, Laptop and Tablets.’The listing states that the role involves “working on a new Aluminium, Android-based, operating system.” This effectively confirms that Aluminium is the working title for the unified platform designed to challenge Windows and macOS.The leak also provides insight into the architecture of the new OS. Much like the recently teased Android XR, Google states that Aluminium OS is “built with artificial intelligence (AI) at the core.”The new Senior Product Manager role is tasked with “driving the roadmap and curating a portfolio of ChromeOS and Aluminium Operating System (ALOS) Commercial devices across all form factors (e.g. laptops, detachables, tablets, and boxes) and tiers (e.g., Chromebook, Chromebook Plus, AL Entry, AL Mass Premium, and AL Premium) that meets the needs of users and the business.”The team is working on a new Aluminium, Android-based, operating system and a new focus on Premium devices and experiences.

How the Foxconn partnership can help OpenAI





“Foxconn is uniquely positioned to support OpenAI’s mission with trusted, scalable infrastructure,”





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US. This partnership is the AI startup's newest step in its extensive infrastructure development plans. The companies stated the goal is to accelerate infrastructure deployment and secure long-term US capacity for essential AI components. While financial terms were not disclosed, OpenAI confirmed it will have early access to evaluate the systems produced by the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and Apple ’s largest supplier, along with the option to purchase them.In a statement to CNBC, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the partnership, saying:adding that AI infrastructure presents aUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities, which are located in Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Indiana.Foxconn adds another manufacturing layer to OpenAI’s supply chain, which could help make production for the AI startup more local and speed up deployment.The company is widely known for assembling Apple’s iPhones, but it has also expanded into AI and automotive manufacturing. It builds server racks designed for AI workloads and is an important global supplier to Nvidia, a major producer of high-end AI chips.Chairman Young Liu said to CNBC.However, the company has had mixed results in the US. In 2018, Foxconn began construction of a large factory in Wisconsin intended to make flat-panel displays. The project did not succeed, and the site is now being used for an AI data centre under construction by Microsoft.OpenAI has recently made several major agreements with some of the world’s biggest technology companies, announcing spending plans of about $1.4 trillion.These commitments have raised questions about whether the company will eventually generate enough profit to support that level of investment.Earlier this month, Altman said the company expects to reach $20 billion in annualised revenue by the end of the year and aims to reach hundreds of billions by 2030.Previous deals include a $100 billion agreement (yet to be finalised) with Nvidia, under which the chipmaker would invest in OpenAI in phases as the company expands its infrastructure.OpenAI also has cloud partnerships with Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, as well as significant compute buildout commitments with Oracle.","OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently struck a humorous and candid tone in the company’s recent Townhall with the employees. Huang acknowledged that despite delivering a record-shattering earnings, the market reaction was less enthusiastic. As reported by Business Insider, Huang said that Nvidia’s influence has created a no-win situation with expectations so hight that even minor missteps could shake global markets. Huang also talked about the online chatter and memes about the company’s economic role. “If we delivered a bad quarter, if we’re off by just a hair, if it just looked a little bit creaky, the whole world would’ve fallen apart. You should’ve seen some of the memes on the internet. We’re basically holding the planet together — and it’s not untrue.”Nvidia reported a record quarter with $57 billion revenue which is up by 62% year-over-year, and forecasted $65 billion for the fourth quarter. The shares of the company rose by 5% in after-hours trading. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress reinforced the bullish outlook, noting, “The clouds are sold out. Our GPU installed base is fully utilized.”Nvidia’s blockbuster quarterly results rebuffs the growing narratives of an AI bubble.“If we delivered a bad quarter, it is evidence there’s an AI bubble. If we delivered a great quarter, we are fueling the AI bubble,” Huang told employees, according to a Business Insider report.Along with this, Huang also said that he was ‘delighted’ with the company’s results and proud of employees. He further added that Nvidia’s massive influence has made expectations harder to meet a reality reflected in its volatile market value.Huang lightheartedly recalled the “good old days” when Nvidia’s market cap stood at $5 trillion, joking about the company’s recent valuation swings, “Nobody in history has ever lost $500 billion in a few weeks.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

“AI bubble”





Nvidia’s market value has reportedly gone down nearly 5% (which is more than $150 billion in market value) based on a single report. A recent report by The Information claimed that Facebook parent Meta is considering using Google -designed AI chips. The stock price of the US-based chipmaker, which is also the world's largest company by market capitalisation, began tumbling after the Google report was published. The drop reportedly occurred because Meta is currently one of Nvidia's most significant chip customers. Meanwhile, shares of Google-parent Alphabet rose sharply on this news. The report specifically stated that Meta could begin renting Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) as soon as next year and potentially incorporate the chips into its own data centres by 2027.In a statement to CNBC, a Google spokesperson said:Google released its first TPU in 2018, initially built only for the company’s own cloud services. Since then, Google has created newer versions of the chip that can handle AI tasks more effectively. TPUs are special-purpose chips, which experts say give Google an edge because they can offer customers a highly efficient AI option.If Meta decides to use TPUs, it would be an essential win for Google and a sign that the technology works well.Apart from Google, Broadcom shares, which help the company design TPUs, rose more than 2% after jumping 11% the day before.Nvidia is still the leading player in the market with its GPUs, which power much of the AI infrastructure being built today. Nvidia is not expected to lose its position soon, but Google’s TPUs add more competition to the AI chip market.Companies developing AI systems are seeking more chip suppliers to reduce their reliance on Nvidia. Meta is one of the biggest spenders on AI, and the company expects to spend between $70 billion and $72 billion this year.These stock movements come as people continue to debate whether anis forming and whether tech company valuations are too high. Nvidia is central to that discussion.

He argues that in an era of rapid technological transformation, the willingness to explore uncharted territory is more valuable than the ability to execute a standard playbook perfectly.In a recent podcast interview, he noted, “As we've seen over and over in the history of technology, the things that people choose to do... are always way more inventive and surprising than anything you could possibly think of ahead of time.”Consequently, he advocates for young professionals to actively use AI tools, try new approaches, and importantly, make mistakes. He suggests that the ""symbiotic relationships"" workers will form with AI agents over the next 10 to 15 years will require a workforce that is comfortable with iteration and management of AI, rather than direct task execution.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has shared a personal reflection on professional growth.

Singapore to Apple and Google: Stop these fake messages on your apps,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/singapore-to-apple-and-google-stop-these-fake-messages-on-your-apps/articleshow/125566842.cms,"Read what Singapore said about spoofing messages on Apple’s iMessage and Google Messages



“1. The Singapore Police Force (SPF), as the Competent Authority under the Online Criminal Harms Act (OCHA), has issued Implementation Directives to Apple and Google on 24 November 2025.[1] The Directives require Apple and Google to put in place measures to prevent the spoofing of Singapore Government agencies via iMessage and personal Rich Communication Services messaging on Google Messages (hereinafter referred to as “Google Messages”) respectively, by 30 November 2025.[2]

2. To protect the public from impersonation scams, Government agencies have been using the “gov.sg” SMS sender ID to send SMSes since July 2024 to help the public identify legitimate government SMSes easily. While we have imposed this and other safeguards like the SMS Sender ID Registry (SSIR) on SMSes, they currently do not apply to messages sent via iMessage and Google Messages.

3. Government agencies do not use the “gov.sg” ID to send messages via iMessage and Google Messages. However, members of the public may assume that messages they receive from accounts claiming to be from “gov.sg” on iMessage or Google Messages are legitimate because messages sent through iMessage and Google Messages appear alongside and are not easily distinguishable from SMSes.

4. The Police have already seen scams involving the impersonation of other SSIR-registered SMS sender IDs on iMessage and Google Messages, including over 120 cases involving the impersonation of SingPost. There is therefore a need to put in place measures to deter the abuse of iMessage and Google Messages by scammers.

5. MHA has worked with Apple and Google to take steps in this regard, and in accordance with the Implementation Directives issued, Apple and Google will be required to implement the following measures to prevent the spoofing of gov.sg and Singapore Government agency names on iMessage and Google Messages:

(a) Measure 1: Prevent accounts and group chats from displaying names which spoof “gov.sg” or Singapore Government agencies, or filter messages from accounts and group chats with names which spoof “gov.sg” or Singapore Government agencies; and

(b) Measure 2: Ensure the profile names of unknown senders are not displayed or are displayed less prominently than their phone numbers. This would help users better identify and be wary of unknown senders.

6. Apple and Google have indicated that they will comply with the Implementation Directives. We urge the public to regularly update the iMessage and Google Messages apps on their mobile devices, to ensure that the latest anti-spoofing safeguards are in place.

[1] The Online Criminal Harms Act (OCHA) was passed on 5 July 2023. Under the Act, the Competent Authority may issue the provider of a designated online service an Implementation Directive to put in place any system, process or measure, if it is satisfied that this is necessary or expedient to address a relevant offence under the Second Schedule. Failure to comply with the Implementation Directive without reasonable excuse would render the provider of the designated online service liable on conviction to a fine of up to $1 million and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine of up to $100,000 for every day or part of a day during which the offence continues after conviction.

[2] Separate Implementation Directives were issued to Apple and Google. The content of the Implementation Directives is similar but tailored to the different context of each platform.”





Singapore police have formally ordered Apple and Google to implement measures to stop the spoofing of government agencies on their respective messaging apps. Spoofing is a method used by cybercriminals to make themselves appear as a familiar or trusted source. The directive, issued under the nation's Online Criminal Harms Act, was announced by the country’s Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). This action follows instances of scams observed on Apple's iMessage and Google Messages platforms where criminals impersonated official bodies, including the local postal service, SingPost.While government agencies currently register with a local SMS registry to exclusively use the ""gov.sg"" sender name for standard text messages, this security measure does not yet extend to iMessage and Google Messages. Earlier, Singapore had already taken strong action against tech platforms regarding scams. In September, the country’s government threatened fines against Facebook-parent Meta Platforms if it failed to curb impersonation scams on Facebook.Under the order, Google and Apple will need to stop accounts and group chats from showing names that mimic “gov.sg” or other Singapore government agencies, or block such messages. The country's home MHA also confirmed that Apple and Google have agreed to comply with the order, and urged the public to update their mobile apps so the latest protections are active.In a blog post, Singapore MHA wrote:","Singapore police have formally ordered Apple and Google to implement measures to stop the spoofing of government agencies on their respective messaging apps.

TSMC sues former executive over claims that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has already denied,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tsmc-sues-former-executive-over-claims-that-intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan-has-already-denied/articleshow/125566229.cms,"“It's rumour and speculation. There's nothing to it. We respect IP.”

What are TSMC’s allegations against its former executive who joined Intel



“On November 25th, 2025, TSMC filed a lawsuit in the Intellectual Property and Commercial Court against Wei-Jen Lo, the company’s former Senior Vice President. The lawsuit is based on the terms of the Employment Contract between TSMC and Lo, the Non-compete Agreement signed by Lo during his employment, and regulations such as the Trade Secrets Act.

There is a high probability that Lo uses, leaks, discloses, delivers, or transfers TSMC’s trade secrets and confidential information to Intel, thus making legal actions (including claiming damages for breach of contract) necessary.”

“The government is concerned with national security implications.”





Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) has filed a lawsuit against a former executive, Lo Wen-jen. The world’s biggest contract chipmaker by market share has alleged that Wen-jen leaked trade secrets before joining rival Intel. According to a Bloomberg report, the company claimed there is a high probability that the 75-year-old executive disclosed proprietary knowledge to US chipmaker Intel when he returned to the company earlier this year. The lawsuit follows reports claiming the theft of know-how just before Lo departed from TSMC.Last week, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan denied any wrongdoing concerning the matter. In an interview, Tan noted that his company respects intellectual property rights and dismissed the speculation.In a statement to Bloomberg News at the Semiconductor Industry Association Awards in San Jose, Tan said:Wen-jen, who was responsible for corporate strategy at TSMC before his retirement in July, has yet to issue an official statement on the matter.During his tenure at TSMC, Wen-jen oversaw research and technology development and played a key role in the mass production of cutting-edge chips, including components for AI accelerators.The semiconductor industry veteran served as TSMC's head of corporate strategy and managed a chip factory in Santa Clara, California.He holds a doctorate in solid state physics and surface chemistry from UC Berkeley and is a laureate of Taiwan's prestigious Industrial Technology Research Institute. He has a PhD in solid-state physics and surface chemistry from UC Berkeley and has received an award from Taiwan's well-known Industrial Technology Research Institute.Reports from Taiwanese media outlets claimed that Wen-jen took confidential information related to TSMC's 2nm process, just before he left the company. Taiwan’s government also raised concerns about how this could affect national security.The official filing stated:Last week, Taiwan’s economic affairs minister Kung Ming-hsin said:At the same time, the region’s national science and technology council minister, Wu Cheng-wen, noted that TSMC’s investigation is still underway.TSMC, now worth more than $1.15 trillion, is the world's largest contract chipmaker and has overtaken Intel in the industry. The company’s chip-making methods and confidential data are important trade secrets for Taiwan. TSMC is the only company that makes the most advanced chips for Apple and Nvidia.","Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) has filed a lawsuit against a former executive, Lo Wen-jen.

Biggest Tech Layoffs of 2025: Job Cuts at TCS, Intel, Microsoft, Google and more





Fears of layoffs related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) are widespread. In the US, Amazon, UPS and Target each have announced layoffs in recent weeks totaling more than 60,000 jobs cut this year. In fact, Corporate America is getting rocked by historic rounds of white-collar layoffs. As a report in CNBC said, some companies have outright said that they are replacing workers with AI. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said in May that the company was able to shrink its head count by about 40%, in part because of AI. Duolingo said in April that it will stop using contractors for work that AI can handle. Salesforce laid off 4,000 customer support roles in September, saying that AI can do 50% of the work at the company.In a recent expansive interview with BBC, Sundar Pichai pushed back against concerns that AI could eventually lead to mass job cuts. Pichai said that the tech will eliminate some jobs but also “evolve and transition” others -- ramifications that mean ""people will need to adapt.""Pichai further added that AI may be gunning for his job, but he doesn’t seem too worried about it. AI is advancing so swiftly, he said, that over the next 12 months the tech will be able to perform “complex” tasks and act as an agent on a users' behalf.""That’s where it gets really interesting,"" he said.In a Bloomberg interview earlier this year, Sundar Pichai said, “I expect we will grow from our current engineering phase even into next year, because it allows us to do more,” Pichai said, adding that AI is making engineers more productive by eliminating tedious tasks and enabling them to focus on more impactful work. Rather than replacing workers, he referred to AI as “an accelerator” that will drive new product development, thereby creating demand for more employees.Pichai said that trying to think too far ahead is “pointless.” But he did acknowledge the legitimacy of fears about job displacement. When asked about Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s comments that AI could erode half of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years, Google CEO said, “I respect that … I think it’s important to voice those concerns and debate them.”","Google CEO Sundar Pichai said AI will eliminate some jobs but also “evolve and transition” others.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Record earnings

Jensen Huang’s talks about transformative shifts driving AI growth





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang struck a dramatic tone during a recent town hall meeting with the employees. During the town hall, Huang told the employees that the company’s performance has become so critical to the global economy that ‘the only thing standing between America and recession is us. ’ During the town hall, Huang revealed that Nvidia is facing immense pressure as it is the backbone of the AI boom. “If we delivered a bad quarter, it’s evidence there’s an AI bubble. If we deliver a great quarter, we’re fueling the bubble,” he said.Along with this, Huang also noted the memes that are circulating online which portray Nvidia as ‘holding the planet together,’ and underscoring how central the company has become to both Silicon Valley and Wall Street. Huang also told employees that the company’s success is now being viewed as a safeguard against broader economic slowdown.Analysts have already warned that the dominance of Nvidia in the AI chip segment could make it a single point of failure for the tech sector. Any stumble in the earnings or production can create a ripple across markets and can lead to recession.Nvidia reported a record quarter with $57 billion revenue which is up by 62% year-over-year, and forecasted $65 billion for the fourth quarter.The shares of the company rose by 5% in after-hours trading. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress reinforced the bullish outlook, noting, “The clouds are sold out. Our GPU installed base is fully utilized.”During the earnings call, Huang also laid down three major transitions which are fueling the demand for Nvidia’s GPUs.- From CPUs to GPUs - Firstly, Huang talked about the slow down of Moore’s law. He said that traditional computing is built around central processors and it is reaching its limit. Industries ranging from data processing to search and ad recommendations are shifting toward GPU-powered systems, which are uniquely suited to handle the massive computational demands of AI.- AI as a creator of new applications - Secondly Huang feels that AI is not just improving the existing tools but it is now unlocking completely new categories of applications. From generative models reshaping search and recommendations to advanced engineering solutions, AI is becoming the foundation for innovations that didn’t exist before.- Rise of Agentic and Physical AI - Lastly, Huang pointed out that the next-generation AI systems are capable of reasoning, planning, and acting and require minimal human intervention. These “agentic” and “physical” AI applications, such as coding assistants and robotics, will require unprecedented levels of computing power, further driving demand for Nvidia’s architecture.Huang believes that Nvidia’s singular architecture supports all three transitions across every industry and modality of AI, making the company uniquely positioned to power this next wave of infrastructure growth.","Jensen Huang told employees that the company’s performance has become so critical to the global economy that ‘the only thing standing between America and recession is us.’ Nvidia reported a record quarter with $57 billion revenue which is up by 62% year-over-year, and forecasted $65 billion for the fourth quarter.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125564582,imgsize-744494,width-400,resizemode-4/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-makes-another-prediction-on-how-ai-will-change-future-jobs.jpg"

xAI's chatbot faces recurring objectivity questions





Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok had to go through viral embarrassment as it declared the billionaire superior to some of history's greatest athletes, scientists, and entertainers—claiming he's fitter than four-time NBA champion LeBron James, more handsome than two-time ""Sexiest Man Alive"" Brad Pitt, and smarter than Albert Einstein. The praise prompted widespread mockery before Musk blamed ""adversarial prompting"" and xAI began quietly deleting the posts.Users discovered the chatbot making outrageous comparisons across multiple categories, with Musk consistently ranking superior to accomplished athletes, scientists, and entertainers. When asked to compare Musk's fitness to James's, Grok claimed the tech executive demonstrated superior ""holistic fitness"" through his demanding work schedule managing multiple companies.The AI's devotion extended beyond athletics. Grok reportedly stated Musk's intelligence ""ranks among the top 10 minds in history, rivaling polymaths like da Vinci or Newton"" and suggested he would defeat heavyweight champion Mike Tyson in a boxing match. The chatbot even claimed Musk would be a better NFL quarterback than Peyton Manning, despite the billionaire never playing professional football.Musk acknowledged the issue, stating Grok ""was unfortunately manipulated by adversarial prompting into saying absurdly positive things about me"".The company subsequently deleted many of the controversial responses, though Musk provided no detailed explanation for how straightforward questions constituted manipulation.This incident adds to growing concerns about Grok's reliability and built-in biases. Earlier this year, the chatbot generated headlines for making antisemitic comments and praising Adolf Hitler, prompting a rare public apology from xAI. The company also had to fix issues where Grok repeatedly invoked ""white genocide"" conspiracy theories in response to unrelated queries.When other AI chatbots were tested with similar questions, they provided markedly different responses. Google's Gemini acknowledged LeBron James is ""unequivocally more fit"" in traditional athletic terms, while Anthropic's Claude stated Mike Tyson would defeat Musk ""by knockout, probably quickly"". These competing assessments underscore questions about whether Grok's programming reflects objective analysis or its creator's preferences.","Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok declared the billionaire superior to some of history's greatest athletes, scientists, and entertainers.

What is at stake



What the companies said on the court ruling







ChatGPT creator OpenAI has been ordered to stop the use of the word ‘cameo’ in relation to its AI video generation app, Sora. Recently, a US District Court ruling found that the company is likely infringed on a trademark held by personalised video platform called Cameo. As reported by Judge Eumi K. Lee issued a temporary restraining order which barred OpenAI from using ‘cameo’ or similar names in Sora until December 22. This decision of the District Court is followed by a lawsuit filed in October 28 by Cameo in the federal court of California. Cameo argued that OpenAI’s use of the term cameo violated its trademark.Judge Lee wrote that OpenAI’s claim of harm from the injunction was outweighed by its ‘likely infringing use of a federally registered mark.’OpenAI has branded a feature in Sora as cameo. The feature is designed to generate likenesses of users, pets or objects as cameos. On the other hand, the personalised video platform Cameo was founded in 2017 and it is known for offering personalised celebrity video messages. Steven Galanis, the CEO of Cameo has urged OpenAI to comply quickly, as the 30% of Cameo’s videos are created between Thanksgiving and Christmas which makes the holiday season critical for its business.Speaking on the court ruling, OpenAI spokesperson told BI, “We disagree with the complaint’s assertion that anyone can claim exclusive ownership over the word ‘cameo.’ We look forward to continuing to make our case to the court.”On the other hand, Cameo CEO Galanis wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter), “It’s critical that OpenAI adheres to Judge Lee’s order ASAP to prevent further irreparable harm to Cameo’s brand and IP.”A hearing is scheduled for December 19 to determine whether the temporary block should be made permanent. Until then, OpenAI may need to rename or suspend the use of the “cameo” feature in Sora.","A US District Court ruling found that the company is likely infringed on a trademark held by personalised video platform called Cameo.

Spotify price hike and market context





Spotify is reportedly planning to increase the subscriptions in the United States. As reported by Financial Times, the music streaming platform is planning to increase the price of its subscription in the US during the first quarter of next year. With this move, Spotify will increase the price of its subscription after the span of two years. In July 2024, Spotify increased the prices of its subscription in the US.Spotify has already increased its subscription prices in various regions including the UK, Switzerland and Australia. The price hike in the US is seen critical given the scale of the market and pressure from record labels, which argue that music subscriptions remain cheap compared to video services like Netflix.Spotify launched its subscription service in the US at $9.99 per month and presently, Spotify’s per month subscription in the US cost $11.99. For those unaware, record labels have been pressing Spotify, Apple Music and other music streaming platforms to increase their subscription prices because of the increasing rate of inflation.The likely pricer increase from Spotify comes it a time when the company is witnessing a leadership shift.Spotify co-founder Daniel EK announced in September that he will be stepping down from the position of CEO and will function as executive chair. On the other hand, starting next year Alex Norström and Gustav Söderström will serve as the co-CEOs for Spotify.Recently, Norström told analysts, “We will act when the time is right for each specific market, and we’ll do it at the appropriate price based on those market dynamics.”The share prices of Spotify has increased by more than 30% this year. JPMorgan projects that a $1 monthly increase could add $500 million annually to Spotify’s revenue.","Spotify has already increased its subscription prices in various regions including the UK, Switzerland and Australia.

Department of Energy to lead Trump’s American Science and Security Platform

Promised breakthroughs of Genesis Mission amid questions on funding and feasibility





US President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing the ""Genesis Mission,"" an ambitious federal initiative designed to counter China's growing AI capabilities by creating a centralised platform that harnesses decades of government scientific data to accelerate American research breakthroughs across critical fields including energy, medicine, and national security.The order, which Trump compared in scope to the Manhattan Project and Apollo program, directs Energy Secretary Chris Wright to build what officials are calling the world's most powerful scientific instrument by integrating datasets from federal agencies, national laboratories, and private partners. The platform aims to train specialized AI models and deploy automated research systems that could compress discovery timelines from years to mere hours—a speed advantage administration officials say is essential to maintaining US technological superiority.The Genesis Mission is Trump's most comprehensive effort yet in positioning the United States against China in the global competition for AI dominance. Since taking office earlier this year in January, Trump has issued multiple executive orders aimed at eliminating regulatory barriers, fast-tracking AI infrastructure permits, and promoting exports of American AI technology. The administration has consistently framed AI development as an existential contest for economic and strategic leadership.Officials emphasised that the Genesis Mission's focus on national security applications—including ensuring the reliability of America's nuclear weapons and accelerating defence materials development—directly addresses concerns about China's aggressive AI military investments.The Mission aims to leverage America's unique advantages: its world-class national laboratories, decades of accumulated federal research data, and partnerships with American AI giants like Nvidia and AMD that Chinese researchers cannot easily replicate under current export restrictions.Under the executive order, the Department of Energy will operate the ""American Science and Security Platform,"" linking the nation's supercomputers—including two sovereign AI systems being built at Oak Ridge National Laboratory by Hewlett Packard Enterprise—with federal research facilities. Technology giants Nvidia, AMD, Dell, and HPE have committed to providing computing infrastructure for the initiative.The platform will focus on 20 identified science and technology challenges spanning advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, critical materials, nuclear fusion, quantum computing, and semiconductors—all areas where China has made significant investments. Wright must demonstrate initial operating capability for at least one challenge within 270 days.Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, told reporters the Genesis Mission represents ""the largest marshaling of federal scientific resources since the Apollo program"" and will enable AI agents to automate experiment design and generate predictive models for complex problems like protein folding and fusion plasma dynamics, potentially shortening discovery timelines ""from years to days or even hours. ""However, the initiative launches alongside significant federal science funding cuts, including $783 million from health research, $100 million from climate studies, and reduced support for scientific journals. Critics pose question that whether AI automation can compensate for reduced traditional research funding and if the promised breakthroughs are achievable on the administration's timeline. Energy Secretary insisted the platform would help reverse rising energy costs and boost scientific productivity while giving America the edge needed to maintain its lead over China in the AI era.","US President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing the ""Genesis Mission"" The initiative is designed to counter China's growing AI capabilities by creating a centralised platform that harnesses decades of government data.

Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra may house a bigger battery



Samsung Galaxy S26 series expected features







Samsung is expected to launch its next-generation Galaxy S series smartphones next year. The company is said to launch Samsung Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26+ and Galaxy S26 Ultra at its next Galaxy Unpacked event. Samsung is said to launch the Galaxy S26 series in January next year and the smartphones may go on sale in early February. Now ahead of the official launch some new information about the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra has surfaced online. According to a leak by a Chinese tipster, the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra may house a 5,200 mAh battery.The last year launched Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra houses a 5,000 mAh battery. It appears that this year Samsung may increase the battery capacity on its premium flagship smartphone. As per a Chinese leak, Samsung is expected to house a 5,200 mAh battery in the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra. Along with the increased battery capacity, the smartphone is also said to come with 60W wired fast charging and 25W wireless charging support.The upcoming Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra is expected to feature a new 10-bit display, offering over 1 billion colours—a clear step up from the 8-bit panels used in previous models.While it still trails behind some rivals that use 12-bit displays, the upgrade marks a notable improvement in visual quality.On the camera front, major hardware changes are unlikely as rumours suggest. Most improvements are expected through software enhancements and the new image signal processor (ISP) in the updated chipset.The phone is likely to run on the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy SoC, paired with 12GB RAM. Battery capacity will remain at 5,000mAh, but charging speed increases to 60W, allowing a 0–80% charge in about 30 minutes.For the standard Galaxy S26, details remain limited as development is still underway. Reports suggest it will use the Exynos 2600 processor, part of Samsung’s push to strengthen its semiconductor business.Leaked case images of the S26 Ultra hint at only minor design tweaks. If that holds true, the rest of the S26 lineup may also bring incremental upgrades rather than major changes.","The Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra is expected to feature a new 10-bit display, offering over 1 billion colours.

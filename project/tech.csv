The big mistake he made

Linked to money laundering, drug trafficking and other serious crimes

""Not everybody reacts the same way to panic""

YouTuber Ankush Bahuguna recently shared a harrowing experience on Instagram, revealing how he became a victim of a 40-hour digital arrest scam . After a three-day absence from social media, Bahuguna described how scammers held him hostage, causing him financial loss and significant mental distress. “I have been missing from social media and everywhere for the last three days, I was held hostage by some scammers for 40 hours… I have lost money, I have lost my mental health to this, I can’t believe this has happened to me,” Bahuguna said in an Instagram post.Bahuguna explained he received an automated international call (+1 prefix) claiming a cancelled courier delivery. “It seemed like an international number. I picked it up without thinking much. It was an automated call that said your courier delivery had been cancelled. Press zero for support,” he explained. Pressing zero connected him to someone who alleged his name was linked to a package containing illegal items seized by customs, supposedly destined for China. Despite denying any involvement, the scammers insisted his Aadhar number and personal details were connected, placing him under “digital arrest.”The situation escalated rapidly. The scammers accused Bahuguna of money laundering, drug trafficking, and other serious crimes, claiming he was a “prime suspect” in a “national case” with an active arrest warrant. “I was then told I don't have enough time to go to the police station and he will do me a favour by connecting directly to the police station,” Bahuguna explained.They then transferred him to a WhatsApp video call with someone posing as a police officer in uniform, further intensifying his panic.Isolating him from the outside world, the scammers instructed Bahuguna to cut off all communication and turn off his devices. They extracted personal information and placed him under “self-custody,” keeping him on a continuous video call for 40 hours, preventing him from contacting anyone. They even directed him to a bank for suspicious transactions, which thankfully failed due to the branch being closed. It was only when a friend contacted him, suspecting fraud, that Bahuguna realized he had been scammed.Bahuguna shared his story to raise awareness and prevent others from experiencing similar ordeals. He emphasized the importance of understanding how panic can affect individuals differently and urged against judging victims. He also stressed the increasing prevalence of such scams and the need for vigilance against unexpected calls or messages, especially those involving threats or accusations of illegal activity. “Not everybody reacts the same way to panic. Instead of calling this stupid, make people around you aware of it,” he said in a follow-up comment.This incident highlights the sophisticated tactics used in digital scams, including exploiting personal information, psychological manipulation, and creating a sense of urgency and fear. The rise of digital platforms has unfortunately made it easier for scammers to target individuals, underscoring the importance of public awareness and caution. Bahuguna’s experience serves as a crucial reminder to stay informed and protect oneself from these increasingly common schemes.","YouTuber Ankush Bahuguna shared his distressing ordeal with a 40-hour digital arrest scam on Instagram.

Tenable CEO Amit Yoran’s 'medical leave message' to employees



“Team Tenable-

We have always operated this company with transparency, through good times and bad. Sticking to straight talk, here is the latest…

Following up to my email in March, I want to share a personal update on my health situation. I recently learned that my cancer requires additional treatment. While this is disappointing, it is still a very treatable situation. After much consideration with my doctors, family and colleagues, I have decided to take a temporary leave of absence to focus on my health and recovery.

While I am away over the next couple of months, the Board has appointed Steve Vintz and Mark Thurmond as Co-CEOs. They will step in to guide the organization, supported by the rest of our exceptional leadership team. I have complete trust in their ability—and yours—to keep our mission and transformation moving forward with the same passion and commitment to our customers. We have much to do and there is no time to waste.

As I take a brief pause to prioritize my health, I will stay as connected as I can while giving myself the space to heal fully.

I am deeply grateful for each of you, not only for the dedication you bring to your work but for the sense of community we’ve built together.

Thank you in advance for your understanding and support. I am grateful for you all.

Amit”

Why DOJ is opposing Donald Trump’s request

What TikTok says

The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has asked the Supreme Court to reject President-elect Donald Trump 's request to delay a law that could ban TikTok or force its sale by January 19, 2025, reports Reuters. A law passed in April 2024 requires TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance , to sell its US assets or face a ban. If the law takes effect, TikTok will be removed from Apple and Google app stores. While existing users can keep using the app, but over time, it will stop working as updates and support are blocked.Last week, Trump argued that he should have until after he takes office on January 20 to find a ""political solution"" to the issue.The DOJ said TikTok has not proven it is likely to win the case, which is necessary for a delay. It also emphasized concerns about national security , stating that China could use TikTok to gather sensitive data on Americans and conduct harmful operations.Interestingly, Trump’s current support for TikTok marks a shift from 2020, when he tried to ban the app and force its sale due to concerns over its Chinese ownership.TikTok is fighting back, saying the law violates free speech under the First Amendment. The company also pointed out that other Chinese-owned apps like Shein and Temu have not been targeted, suggesting TikTok is being singled out because of its content, not its data practices.TikTok's future in the US now depends on how the Supreme Court rules and whether Biden extends the deadline. The court will hear arguments about the case on January 10.Earlier, ByteDance has rejected selling TikTok, citing Chinese export regulations from 2020 that restrict the sale of its core algorithmic technology. Without this algorithm, any acquisition would lack the innovations that define TikTok's success. Despite these challenges, investors like Steven Mnuchin and Frank McCourt have expressed interest in buying the platform. Republican Rep John Moolenaar remains optimistic that Trump may facilitate an American acquisition to keep TikTok operational in the US.","Law passed in April 2024 requires TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its US assets or face a ban.

Zepto is not an “Amazon or Walmart”

Zepto CEO Aadit Palicha said that Zepto is not an “Amazon or Walmart” but an Indian company.

""Second biggest Qcommerce company"" in India

All set for the Big IPO

Quick commerce startup Zepto is reportedly fast-tracking its plans for an initial public offering (IPO), with draft papers expected to be filed by March or April this year. This comes after receiving approval from Singapore for its domicile transfer to India, a critical step in the process. According to an Economic Times report, a key hearing is scheduled for January 17 at the NCLT regarding its reverse merger application to complete the domicile shift. The Singapore approval marks a significant milestone in Zepto's move to establish its base in India.A board meeting is also eportedly planned for January 19 to discuss the IPO's size, appoint bankers, and address other resolutions related to the holding company's relocation. Zepto is also finalizing the appointment of independent board members in preparation for going public. This IPO would make Zepto the third major quick commerce player to list in India, after Zomato and Swiggy.In an interview with Economic Times recently,Zepto's focus on domestic ownership is said to be driven by a desire to build trust with policymakers in the country, the public, and shareholders. This move also reportedly aligns with the Indian government's increasing scrutiny of foreign-owned quick-commerce companies and their operations in India.Founded by Stanford University dropouts Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, Zepto has emerged as one of the fastest-growing consumer internet firms in India. According to a recent report by Motilal Oswal, Zepto is the second largest player in the sector with a 29% share in the quarter ended June 30, after Blinkit which had a 46% share. The report – which did not include Tata Group BigBasket and Flipkart Minutes – pegged Swiggy Instamart’s market share at 24%.As previously reported by the ET, Zepto has been in discussions with bankers regarding a potential mid-2025 IPO, initially aiming to raise at least $450 million. This target may be adjusted closer to the draft filing. Sources indicate Zepto is heavily engaged in the IPO process, with the upcoming board meeting focusing on these plans. The reverse merger approval and the subsequent transition to a public limited company are necessary steps before filing for the IPO. ET also reported that Wall Street banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are among those vying for roles in Zepto's IPO.Following a $350 million funding round in November, Zepto's cash reserves stand at approximately $1.4 billion, positioning it to compete with rivals and new entrants like Flipkart Minutes. CEO Aadit Palicha confirmed the company's full compliance with Indian foreign direct investment (FDI) regulations and emphasized their move towards local ownership. In approximately six months, the company raised over $1 billion.","Zepto is reportedly fast-tracking its plans for an initial public offering (IPO), with draft papers expected to be filed by March or April this year.

Here’s what Suchir Balaji's mother wrote

Update on @suchirbalaji

We hired private investigator and did second autopsy to throw light on cause of death. Private autopsy doesn’t confirm cause of death stated by police.

Suchir’s apartment was ransacked , sign of struggle in the bathroom and looks like some one hit him in bathroom based on blood spots.

It’s a cold blooded mu*d*r declared by authorities as suicide.

Lobbying in SF city doesn’t stop us from getting justices.

We demand FBi investigation

@elonmusk @VivekGRamaswamy @GavinNewsom @MEA

Mother of Suchir Balaji , a 26-year-old researcher at OpenAI , is requesting help from Elon Musk following her son's death. Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment earlier this month. His mother posted on social media, tagging Musk and asking for an FBI investigation . Police stated, “no evidence of foul play was found during the initial investigation”. However, the San Francisco Chief Medical Examiner's Office determined Balaji's death a suicide. Balaji worked at OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT .In her post, Balaji’s mother - Poornima Rao expressed her worries and stated that “private autopsy doesn’t confirm cause of death stated by police.” She called for intervention from US authorities, stating that an FBI investigation is necessary to address the matter. Other than Elon Musk, she tagged American biotech entrepreneur and politician Vivek Ramaswamy and Gavin Newsom – Governor of California.The post has since gained attention, sparking a wave of responses on social media. It caught Musk’s attention as well who replied saying “This doesn’t seem like a suicide”.Suchir Balaji's mother further pleads saying “@elonmusk please support us”.In an interview with Business Insider last week, Rao revealed that Balaji had grown increasingly disillusioned with artificial intelligence (AI), particularly OpenAI’s shift toward commercialization with ChatGPT. She said, “He felt AI is a harm to humanity,” describing how her son, Suchir Balaji, transitioned from boundless optimism about AI’s potential to profound skepticism. Reflecting on his tragic death, she added, “It doesn’t look like a normal situation.”","Suchir Balaji, a 26-year-old researcher at OpenAI, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment earlier this month.

As the match ended, cricket memes went viral on social media platforms. Here are some of the viral memes that just capture the emotion/sadness of Indian Cricket fans.

Record number of spectators

Australia clinched a thrilling 184-run victory over India in a dramatic final session of the fourth Test in Melbourne, taking a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. India, needing 340 to win, collapsed to 155 all out, losing their last seven wickets for just 34 runs in 20.3 overs. India appeared to be heading for a draw after Yashasvi Jaiswal (84) and Rishabh Pant (30) steered them to 112-3 at tea. However, Pant's dismissal, attempting a six off Travis Head, triggered a batting collapse.Controversy arose with Jaiswal's dismissal. Initially given not out to a caught-behind appeal, the TV umpire overturned the decision based on visual evidence of the ball changing direction, despite the absence of audible noise. Jasprit Bumrah was exceptional for India, taking 5-57 in the second innings and nine wickets in the match. He had reduced Australia to 91-6 at one stage, a lead of less than 200.The match set a record attendance for cricket in Australia, with 373,591 spectators. Head described the atmosphere as inspiring and hailed the match as one of the best he has been involved in. India now needs to win the final Test in Sydney to level the series and retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .","Australia beat India by 184 runs in the fourth Test in Melbourne.

Planning a New Year's Eve party at an Airbnb? Think again. The company is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season.

While implemented worldwide, the technology will specifically target the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Puerto Rico, Spain and New Zealand. Last New Year's Eve, Airbnb blocked 74,000 such bookings.High-risk bookings will be blocked or redirected to alternative accommodations. Short holiday getaways (one to three nights) in entire homes will also be restricted, and guests booking entire homes will be required to agree to a ""mandatory anti-party attestation."" ""If a booking is identified as higher risk, the guest will either be blocked from booking, or redirected to alternative accommodations on the platform,"" the company said.Guests will also be required to accept mandatory anti-party attestation. ""Guests who can make reservations will need to confirm that they understand that disruptive and unauthorized parties are not allowed on Airbnb, and they face suspension or removal from the platform if they violate this policy,"" said the company.Airbnb also has a 'Neighborhood Support Line' for local communities to report urgent issues, like a party in progress, at a home they believe is listed on Airbnb.Airbnb's efforts to curb disruptive parties started in 2019 with a ban on ""party houses,"" followed by stricter measures in 2020 due to the pandemic. In 2022, the company permanently banned large parties worldwide following several violent incidents at Airbnb rentals, including a shooting in Pittsburgh that resulted in two deaths and eight injuries.","Airbnb is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season.

""The United States currently has multiple advantages. American companies currently have better technology, from chips to AI models to software applications. In addition, many US companies, including Microsoft, have invested heavily in building AI that is more trustworthy than most products from China. We are designing AI technology that protects cybersecurity, privacy, digital safety, and other responsible uses of AI.""

American products are more trusted than their Chinese counterparts, and our private sector is unmatched in its ability to invest in infrastructure around the world.

The blog post comes just days ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s second term.The post focuses in part on the competitive threat posed by China in artificial intelligence as well as looks to underscore Microsoft’s role in advancing AI development. China and the United States are racing to spread their AI systems to other countries in an effort to become the de facto standard, according to Smith.The blog post titled 'The Golden Opportunity for American AI' has also been shared by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.China has started offering developing countries subsidized access to scarce computer chips and help building local AI datacenters, according to Smith. ""The Chinese wisely recognize that if a country standardizes on China's AI platform, it likely will continue to rely on that platform in the future,"" Smith said.He said that US has several advantages,""Given the nature of technology markets and their potential network effects, this race between the US and China for international influence likely will be won by the fastest first mover,"" Smith reasoned. ""The best response for the United States is not to complain about the competition but to ensure we win the race ahead. This will require that we move quickly and effectively to promote American AI as a superior alternative. And it will need the involvement and support of American allies and friends.""Hence, the United States needs a smart international strategy to rapidly support American AI around the world.""While summing up he further stressed on American products being more trustworthy than Chinese, ""Finally, the United States is in a strong position to win the essential race with China by advancing international adoption of American AI.With a balanced and common-sense approach to export control policy, the United States can solidify the diplomatic relations that will be critical to global AI adoption,"" he wrote.",Microsoft President Brad Smith says the US needs an overarching national strategy to ensure it prevails in the global AI race.

Allstate faced significant backlash after a video message from CEO Tom Wilson, played before the Sugar Bowl, was perceived as insensitive in the wake of a terrorist attack on Bourbon Street in New Orleans on January 1.

Graded punishments:

Implications for tech companies

The government has released the draft Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act for public consultation and feedback (open until February 18). These rules, which will be tabled in the monsoon session of Parliament, have significant implications for both users and tech companies operating in India.According to IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw (via news agency PTI), the rules aim to strike a balance between safeguarding user rights and fostering innovation in the digital space.""Rules have to be within four walls of the Act. It is within the ambit of the Act passed by Parliament. These rules have been framed to ensure a balance between regulation and innovation while completely safeguarding the rights of citizens,"" Vaishnaw said.Vaishnaw emphasised that the rules prioritise user privacy, particularly for children, while allowing for flexibility and innovation.The rules mandate enhanced child protection with social media platforms – like Facebook, Instagram and others – require verifiable parental consent before allowing children under 18 years of age to create accounts online. This includes validating the parent's identity and age.Secondly, Big Tech platforms – including Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft – must ensure their algorithms do not pose risks to users' rights. Additionally, the government can specify certain types of personal data that cannot be transferred outside India.In case the rules are flouted, there is a provision for graded punishments. Penalties for data breaches will vary based on the severity and the size of the company involved, offering some protection to smaller businesses.“We have also kept graded punishments to protect the interests of micro, small and medium enterprises. It is to save businesses who may be running their business using a single computer. However, Big Techs have higher obligations under the rules. Minor breaches will attract small penalties and big breaches will lead to higher penalties,” Vaishnaw said.Tech companies, specifically the Big Tech, will face additional obligations. Apart from algorithmic transparency, they will be required to conduct and submit reports on data protection impact assessments and audits to the Data Protection Board.","The government has released the draft Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act for public consultation and feedback (open until February 18) The rules have significant implications for both users and tech companies operating in India.

The case centers around the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which mandates that TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, must sell its U.S. operations or face a nationwide ban.TikTok and ByteDance argue that the law violates the First Amendment rights of the app's users by restricting access to a platform used by 170 million Americans. They contend that the government's national security concerns do not justify the sweeping ban, which they claim would set a dangerous precedent for free speech.On the other hand, the Biden administration maintains that the law targets the national security risk posed by China's potential control over TikTok, rather than free speech. The administration urges the Supreme Court to allow the law to take effect, emphasising the importance of protecting American data from foreign adversaries.The Supreme Court's decision will have significant implications for the future of TikTok in the United States and could influence how the government regulates other foreign-owned tech companies.

Google has announced that it has paid Can$100 million (approximately US$69 million) to Canadian news outlets to use their content on its platform. This move is part of a deal with the Canadian government to offset the loss of advertising revenues experienced by traditional news organizations.The payment was made to the Canadian Journalism Collective , a non-profit organization established to distribute the funds to media businesses whose content is shared or repurposed by Google. The funds are expected to provide a much-needed boost to newsrooms, enabling them to produce high-quality coverage of democratic institutions.Canada passed the Online News Act in 2023, which requires tech platforms like Google and Meta to compensate struggling news publishers. While Meta chose to block news content on Facebook and Instagram to avoid paying, Google opted to make the payment and continue using the content.Paul Deegan, president of News Media Canada, praised the deal, stating that it is ""far superior"" to similar arrangements in other jurisdictions. He added that the funding will help newsrooms produce more high-quality journalism, benefiting both the media organizations and Google, which relies on fact-checked content.The deal, approved by Canada's broadcast regulator in October 2024, stipulates that broadcasters will receive 30% of the funds, with the remainder being shared among news publishers. Google has also indicated that it plans to make another payment at the end of 2025.This landmark agreement aims to support the local news sector, which has seen a significant decline in advertising revenues and the closure of hundreds of publications over the past decade. By compensating news organizations, Google hopes to contribute to the sustainability of high-quality journalism in Canada.","Google has paid Can$100 million (approximately US$69 million) to Canadian news outlets to use their content on its platform.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has donated 268,000 Tesla shares valued at nearly $112 million to charity, according to a regulatory filing dated December 30. Musk has a history of significant charitable contributions. In 2022, he donated Tesla shares worth $1.95 billion across multiple transactions between August and December. In 2021, he gave away $5.7 billion worth of Tesla shares, which was later disclosed to have been directed to his own foundation.Despite this donation, Musk, the world’s richest person with a net worth of over $415 billion (according to Bloomberg), still owns close to 411 million Tesla shares through a trust he set up in 2003.

Shein is the world’s most visited fashion and apparel website

Set to beat Zara in France; Amazon's headache in the US

Shein's India entry

After a four-and-a-half-year hiatus, Chinese fast-fashion giant Shein is set to return to India through a partnership with Reliance Retail . The Shein app was originally banned on June 29, 2020, along with 200 other Chinese apps, by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).The initial re-entry involves a backend test launch on Reliance's fashion website, Ajio.com, focusing on casual westernwear and more. While the rollout may eventually extend to other Reliance platforms, no clear launch timeline has been announced as yet. This move positions Shein, now based in Singapore, to compete with established players like Tata's Zudio and Flipkart's Myntra in the affordable fast-fashion segment. Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd. formalized its partnership with Shein last year to facilitate this return.In September 2024, Shein reportedly became the world’s most visited fashion and apparel website, according to data from Similarweb. With a global web traffic share of 2.68% for the third quarter of 2024, Shein outpaced other major brands like Nike, H&M, and Zara, which ranked second to fourth, respectively.Shein’s user base too has seen a significant rise. Data from Earnest shows that Shein website's transaction-making users in August surged nearly 40% compared to January, marking it the fastest-growing international platform, followed closely by TikTok.Amazon recently launched a low-cost online storefront featuring electronics, apparel and other products priced under $20, to compete with discount retailers that have increasingly encroached on the e-commerce giant’s turf -- and their names are China's Shein and Temu. Shein’s core customers in the US are young women enticed by the low-cost apparel sold on the site, and Amazon is now aiming to target them.As per French consumer publication LSA, Shein’s 2023 annual sales in France surpassed H&M, Primark, and Kiabi, positioning it as the country’s second-largest fashion brand, second after Zara, owned by Spain’s Inditex Group. Though numbers are still to come, in the final quarter of 2024, Shein’s French sales are speculated to have exceeded Zara’s.This re-entry strategy involves a technology agreement between Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd. and Roadget Business Pte Ltd. to develop a local e-commerce platform. This platform aims to establish a network of Indian manufacturers and suppliers to produce and sell products under the Shein brand.Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal confirmed that Shein's Indian retail platform will be hosted on domestic infrastructure, ensuring data security and preventing Shein from accessing or controlling it. The Ministry of Textiles, in consultation with other relevant ministries, has also approved Reliance Retail's proposal.Shein's rapid growth to 108 million monthly EU users has placed it under the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) in April 2024, which applies to platforms with over 45 million monthly users. As a ""very large online platform,"" Shein have to adhere to stricter content moderation and transparency requirements in Europe.","Chinese fast-fashion giant Shein is set to return to India through a partnership with Reliance Retail.

To this Elon Musk replied with an affirmative ""Yes"".Recently, Musk was also spotted werning a T-Shirt that said: 'Occupy Mars'. This photo too was shared by DogeDesigner on Twitter.Elon Musk envisions a future where Mars isn't just a planet, but a ""New World,"" echoing the historical naming of the Americas. This idea, shared on X (formerly Twitter) alongside a NASA image of Mars' Gale Crater, is just one piece of his larger ambition to establish a self-sustaining human civilization on the Red Planet.Musk's drive to colonize Mars stems from his belief that it's crucial for the long-term survival of human consciousness. He considers Earth fragile and sees Mars as a vital backup plan against potential catastrophes. ""Earth is great, but it’s fragile. We need a backup,"" he explained, emphasizing the need for a future beyond Earth's limitations. SpaceX 's Starship rocket is central to this vision. Designed for reusability and capable of carrying 100 passengers and vital cargo, Starship is intended to make interplanetary travel affordable. Musk outlined plans for five uncrewed Mars missions over the next two years. These missions will deliver essential resources like water, oxygen, fuel, and construction equipment.Musk believes ""Starship will make life multi-planetary, preserving life as we know it from extinction events on Earth."" He anticipates the first crewed mission could launch in the early 2030s. His long-term strategy involves utilizing Martian resources to build infrastructure, reducing reliance on Earth for resupply.Last week, Musk suggested renaming Mars to ""New World."" In an X post, he compared the idea to how America was named and included a photo of Mars' Gale Crater taken by the Curiosity rover.

The CCI's decision follows its preliminary report in July 2024 that accused Apple of abusing its market position.While potential fines remain unclear, the CCI is likely to require Apple to allow third-party payment systems on its App Store, similar to requirements it previously imposed on Google's Play Store. The regulator has already shared a confidential version of its report with Apple to prepare its defense.Apple is expected to argue that its ""insignificant"" market share of under 5% in India means it lacks a dominant position to abuse.

Wicked Director Jon M. Chu Makes Movie Magic with Apple Vision Pro | Apple TV

Here’s how Apple Vision Pro helped in Wicked’s production



“So for Wicked we had a lot of visual effects all around the world. I could be at my house and I could have a screen that was bigger than the one we had in the screening room. And I could be talking to all the people in all the different continents and I would watch the playback and I would bring it close.”

“I could draw on the screen itself through Evercast. You can actually use a pen and use my finger and draw on where like hey, this ear looks weird on this, on the goat. It just adds new dimension, to how you see things. And as a creator, as a storyteller, everything's perspectives,”

“Steve Jobs always said that computers were a bicycle for the mind and this felt like a rocket ship for my imagination,”

What Apple said about Wicked’s director



“Before Wicked became a box office sensation and cultural phenomenon, Jon M. Chu was among the first filmmakers to put

spatial computing

to the ultimate test. Apple Vision Pro’s infinite canvas enabled him to edit and produce parts of the movie, fostering his creativity and imagination. Discover how he brought the land of Oz to life with Apple Vision Pro.”

Director of the movie “Wicked,” John M Chu has revealed that he used Apple’s mixed reality headset , Vision Pro, during the film’s post-production.

Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, and his luxurious $500 million yacht, Koru, became the focal point of a dramatic episode on New Year’s Eve near St. Barts. As per reports, customs officials conducted a surprise inspection of the massive vessel while Bezos himself was absent. Instead, his fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, took center stage, drawing attention as she lounged on deck in a Versace bikini and a wide-brimmed hat. Despite the unexpected intrusion, the inspection was characterized as routine, lasting approximately three hours. This incident comes amidst a whirlwind of high-profile appearances and speculations surrounding the couple’s lavish lifestyle.The customs inspection began unexpectedly as Koru cruised the waters near St. Barts. Uniformed officers boarded the 417-foot yacht and meticulously searched the vessel under the guidance of a stewardess. Reports indicate that the search lasted approximately three hours, during which time officials methodically combed through the opulent yacht.Despite the disruption, the atmosphere aboard the yacht remained relatively calm. Sánchez appeared composed throughout the process, engaging with friends on deck. Among the notable individuals present was her ex-boyfriend, former NFL star Tony Gonzalez, who shares a son with Sánchez. Gonzalez even took a swim in the ocean while officers conducted their search.While an event of this nature might typically create tension, Sánchez’s demeanor suggested little cause for concern. Photos captured by Page Six showed her smiling for the cameras, a stewardess briefing her on the situation in a composed manner. The inspection, according to sources, was a standard procedure and posed no significant threat or issue for the vessel or its occupants.The disruption was brief, and the yacht’s opulent ambiance quickly returned as the officers wrapped up their work.The surprise inspection came on the heels of a festive holiday season for Bezos and Sánchez. The couple had recently celebrated in Aspen, Colorado, where their extravagant gatherings fueled rumors of a $600 million New Year’s Eve wedding. These speculations were promptly dismissed by Bezos himself, who took to X (formerly Twitter) to refute the claims.“This whole thing is completely false—none of this is happening,” Bezos posted. “The old adage ‘don’t believe everything you read’ is even more true today than ever. Lies can get ALL the way around the world before the truth can get its pants on.”Despite Bezos’ firm denial, their time in Aspen was far from low-profile. High-profile guests, including Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, were seen leaving Matsuhisa, a well-known sushi hotspot tied to the wedding rumors. Additionally, actor Kevin Costner and singer Jennifer Lopez were spotted mingling with attendees during the celebrations.Koru, named after a Māori word symbolising new beginnings, is one of the most expensive and luxurious yachts in the world. The 417-foot vessel boasts state-of-the-art features, including a swimming pool, a helicopter landing pad, and lavish accommodations for its passengers. The yacht’s size and splendor make it a regular feature in discussions about billionaire indulgences.The customs inspection near St. Barts highlighted not just the vessel’s prominence but also the scrutiny that often accompanies the lives of the ultra-wealthy.","Jeff Bezos' $500 million yacht, Koru, was raided by customs officials near St. Barts on New Year's Eve.

"China's 'good news' for Xiaomi, Huawei and Oppo is 'bad news' for Apple",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chinas-good-news-for-xiaomi-huawei-and-oppo-is-bad-news-for-apple/articleshow/116918356.cms,"China’s new smartphone subsidies could threaten Apple’s market share. The program aims to boost sales for Chinese phone makers like Huawei , Xiaomi , and Oppo. This initiative targets increased consumer spending in the world’s biggest smartphone market. The subsidies could hurt Apple’s position in China.The National Development and Reform Commission announced Friday that China will expand its trade-in subsidies to cover smartphones and other personal electronics, marking a significant shift that could reshape the competitive landscape. The program, backed by ""significant"" increases in ultra-long special treasury bonds, aims to revive domestic consumption amid economic headwinds.The timing couldn't be worse for Apple, which has seen its smartphone shipments in China decline for four consecutive months. Foreign brand shipments plunged 47.4% year-over-year in November to 3.04 million units, according to data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology.Meanwhile, domestic manufacturers are gaining ground. Huawei has emerged as a particularly strong challenger since its return to the premium segment in August 2023, with sales surging 42% in the third quarter of 2024. Apple briefly dropped out of China's top five smartphone vendors in the second quarter before recovering.The subsidy program, reminiscent of a 2007-2013 initiative that helped Chinese manufacturers gain market share, comes as Apple attempts to shore up sales through its own rare promotional campaign. The iPhone maker launched a four-day promotion Thursday, offering discounts up to 500 yuan ($68.50) on flagship models.""This government initiative could accelerate the ongoing shift in consumer preferences toward domestic brands,"" said Yuan Da, deputy secretary-general of the National Development and Reform Commission. The program will expand beyond personal devices to include agricultural facilities and other business equipment.Several provinces had already implemented local trade-in programs for personal devices in late 2024, but analysts expect the nationwide rollout to have a more substantial impact on market dynamics.Earlier this week, Apple started offering rare discounts of up to $68.50 on its latest iPhone models in China, including the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max. This move came as Apple faced increased competition from domestic brands like Huawei and a slowdown in consumer spending. The four-day promotion, running till January 7, aims to boost sales and maintain market share in the crucial Chinese market.","China will expand its trade-in subsidies to cover smartphones and other personal electronics.

What Turo has to say

An update on today’s incidents in New Orleans and Las Vegas

We are shocked and saddened by today’s horrific events, and our hearts are with the victims and their families.

Our trust and safety team is actively partnering with law enforcement authorities to share any information that could be helpful in their investigations. We do not believe that either renter had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat, and we are not currently aware of any information that indicates the two incidents are related.

Turo is dedicated to fostering a trustworthy marketplace. We remain committed to maintaining the highest standards in risk management, thanks to our world-class trust and safety technologies and teams that include experienced former law enforcement professionals.

We are devastated by these horrible incidents, and remain dedicated to helping the authorities however we can.

Turo , the popular car-sharing platform often referred to as the ""Airbnb of cars,"" is under focus after its vehicles were used in two deadly incidents: the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas explosion in the US. Authorities have confirmed that the perpetrators in both attacks obtained their vehicles through Turo. The company has also pledged its full cooperation with law enforcement in the ongoing investigations.Turo doesn’t have any specific or direct role in the incidents other than that the vehicles used in both the attacks on January 1 were rented on the app. While authorities have stated that the two incidents are unrelated, the use of Turo in both attacks has raised concerns about the platform's security measures and the potential risks associated with peer-to-peer car sharing.In New Orleans, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, the suspect who drove a Ford F-150 Lightning truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street, killing 15 and injuring 30, had rented the vehicle through Turo.Separately, in Las Vegas, a Tesla Cybertruck rented via Turo exploded outside the Trump Hotel, killing the driver and injuring seven others. The truck was reportedly loaded with fireworks and gasoline, and was also rented on Turo.Turo has expressed its condolences and confirmed its cooperation with law enforcement in both investigations. The company maintains that there was nothing in the New Orleans suspect's background check that would have flagged him as a security threat at the time of the rental.These incidents have also placed Turo under intense scrutiny, raising questions about the platform's ability to effectively screen renters and prevent its services from being exploited for malicious purposes. As investigations continue, Turo faces the challenge of addressing these concerns and reassuring users about the safety and security of its platform.","Turo is the popular car-sharing platform often referred to as the ""Airbnb of cars"" Its vehicles were used in two deadly incidents: the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas explosion.

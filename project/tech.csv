"The company that has wiped off trillion dollars from software stocks in less than a week, releases new AI model",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-company-that-wiped-off-nearly-300-billion-from-software-stocks-in-one-day-releases-new-ai-model/articleshow/127968173.cms,"Anthropic launched Claude Opus 4.6 just days after its AI tools triggered a massive sell-off in software stocks. The new model brings agent teams, a 1 million token context window, and stronger performance in legal and financial tasks—the very areas that spooked Wall Street. Enterprise software investors are watching closely as the AI race reshapes the workplace.

A legal plugin that spooked Wall Street

Opus 4.6 doubles down on exactly what spooked investors

Not everyone's buying the doom narrative

Anthropic, the AI startup whose workplace tool triggered a massive sell-off in software stocks earlier this week, has launched Claude Opus 4.6—its most powerful model yet. The timing couldn't be more loaded.The new model, announced Thursday, brings stronger coding abilities, a 1 million token context window (up from 200,000), and a feature called ""agent teams"" that lets multiple AI agents split tasks and work in parallel. Think of it as a virtual engineering squad that coordinates on its own. Opus 4.6 also supports outputs of up to 128,000 tokens, meaning it can handle much larger tasks without needing to break them into multiple requests.On benchmarks, the model outperforms OpenAI's GPT-5.2 on GDPval-AA, an evaluation of real-world knowledge work in finance, legal and other professional domains—precisely the sectors that just saw their stocks crater because of Anthropic's earlier product update. It also tops every other frontier model on BrowseComp, which measures a model's ability to dig up hard-to-find information online.Here's the backstory. Last Friday, Anthropic released a set of open-source plugins for Claude Cowork, its AI assistant built for non-coders.Most covered standard business functions like sales and marketing. But one plugin, designed to automate contract reviews, NDA triage and legal briefings, sent shockwaves through the market.Thomson Reuters fell nearly 16% on Tuesday. LegalZoom crashed close to 20%. A Goldman Sachs basket of US software stocks dropped 6% in a single session—the worst since April. By the time the dust began to settle on Wednesday, roughly $830 billion had been wiped from the S&P 500 software and services index since January 28. Traders started calling it the ""SaaSpocalypse.""The fear wasn't just about legal tech. Investors saw Anthropic muscling into the enterprise application layer, threatening the subscription-based business models that power companies like Salesforce, Intuit and Adobe. Private equity firms with heavy software portfolios also took hits—Ares Management, KKR and Blue Owl Capital all dropped more than 9% in a single day.Now, with Opus 4.6, Anthropic is making its AI even better at the kind of work that triggered the panic. The model produces documents, spreadsheets and presentations that are closer to ""production-ready"" on the first try, the company says. It handles financial modelling, regulatory filings and long-form research with less hand-holding.Harvey, the legal AI startup, reported that Opus 4.6 scored 90.2% on its BigLaw Bench evaluation—the highest of any Claude model. Box said its testing showed a 10% lift in performance on multi-source analysis across legal, financial and technical content.Anthropic also introduced Claude in PowerPoint as a research preview, letting users build and edit slide decks directly within the app. The AI reads layouts, fonts and slide masters to stay on brand—a feature available on Max, Team and Enterprise plans.Scott White, Anthropic's head of product, told CNBC that the company is entering a ""vibe working"" era, where non-developers can hand real, significant work to AI. Enterprise customers already make up roughly 80% of Anthropic's business.Not everyone thinks the sky is falling. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called the software sell-off ""the most illogical thing in the world,"" arguing AI will use existing tools rather than replace them. Google's Sundar Pichai struck a similar tone during his company's earnings call, saying companies that ""seize the moment"" will find the same opportunities ahead.But the market isn't fully convinced. Claude Opus 4.6 is available today on claude.ai, Anthropic's API and all major cloud platforms. Pricing stays at $5/$25 per million tokens. Whether it calms investors or spooks them further is the real test.","Anthropic launched Claude Opus 4.6 just days after its AI tools triggered a massive sell-off in software stocks.

Intel CEO on chip crisis



Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan sent a 'we are coming' kinda message to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang this week. Lip-Bu Tan announced that Intel plans to build graphics processing units (GPUs), the category of chip popularized by Nvidia. ""I just hired the chief GPU architect, and he's very good. I'm very delighted he joined me,"" Tan said, claiming that it took some persuading. Demers was at Qualcomm for more than 13 years. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are the chips, made by the likes of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), power large language models and have seen demand skyrocket as companies race to build out artificial intelligence infrastructure and data centers.At the recent Cisco AI Summit, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan announced that the company will start producing graphics processing units (GPUs). These are more specialized processors, compared to the CPUs Intel traditionally produces, and are used for gaming and tasks like training artificial intelligence models. While Nvidia per se didn’t invent the GPU, these specific kind of AI chips have played a large role in the company's success.Intel has traditionally produced CPUs, processors with a limited number of cores, making them best suited for serial computing tasks. GPUs, such as those produced by Nvidia, have thousands of smaller cores and are used for parallel computing tasks, such as AI and high-performance computing.In an interview with Reuters on the sidelines of the Summit, Tan said the GPU effort will target data centers. ""It's tied in with the data center,"" Tan told Reuters. ""We're working with customers, and will then define what the customer needs."" Over the past few years, American chipmaker has fallen behind major semiconductor players that have seen a boost from the AI data center buildout.In January this year, Qualcomm executive Eric Demmers joined Intel. ""I’m happy to share that I’m starting a new position as SVP, GPU architecture at Intel Corporation!,"" Demmers wrote on LinkedIn. Demmers will report to Kevork Kechichian, the executive vice president and general manager of Intel’s data center group.While Intel has been working to turn around its ailing foundry business in recent years, earlier this month, Intel CFO David Zinsner admitted that the company misjudged demand for data center CPUs and, as a result, was expecting to see a product shortage hit its “lowest level” in Q1, before improving in second quarter and beyond.Incidentally, Nvidia is a prospective customer for Intel’s factories. The company is also one of the top shareholders in Intel after a $5 billion investment last year. Intel and Nvidia agreed to work together to integrate Intel’s CPUs with Nvidia’s AI chips in Nvidia systems. The Trump government’s stake has increased by $14 billion since its deal with Intel was agreed to in August 2025. Nvidia’s stake has grown by more than $6 billion since its investment the following month.Talking of memory chip crisis, Intel CEO said that the computer industry’s memory-chip shortage is likely to persist for at least two years. “There’s no relief as far as I know,” he said. Tan said that he spoke to two of the key players in memory, who told him, “There’s no relief until 2028.”A massive expansion of artificial intelligence infrastructure has fueled demand for memory chips, decreasing the supply available to traditional computers and smartphones. That’s bringing shortages and price hikes — and potentially hurting customers’ appetite for the products.Intel is the largest maker of processors for personal computers, which rely on memory to store and manage data. The top memory manufacturers are Samsung Electronics Co., SK Hynix Inc. and Micron Technology Inc.","Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan announced that the company will start producing graphics processing units (GPUs) These are more specialized processors, compared to the CPUs Intel traditionally produces, and are used for gaming and tasks like training artificial intelligence models.

South Korea’s e-commerce giant Coupang has confirmed that the personal data of an additional 165,000 users was compromised in the country’s largest-ever hacking, which was reported in November. This latest discovery of cybersecurity disaster brings the total number of affected accounts to approximately 33.8 million, nearly two-thirds of the country's population.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Coupang Korea announced that the newly-identified victims were not part of a new cyberattack, but were uncovered during an government-led investigation into the massive breach.In November, Coupang said that personal information like the names, phone numbers and delivery addresses entered into address books were stolen. The company, however, reiterated that no payment details, login credentials, emails, or order histories were compromised. As a gesture of apology, Coupang plans to issue a 50,000 won (approx. $35) purchase voucher to every affected account holder.Meanwhile, the regulatory crackdown on Coupang, which has included police raids and tax audits, has sparked an aggressive response from Washington. US investors have filed arbitration claims under the KORUS Free Trade Agreement, accusing Seoul of “discriminatory treatment” against an American-listed firm.Meanwhile, as the company cooperates with the probe, its leadership has come under heavy fire. Harold Rogers, the interim American CEO of Coupang’s local unit, was recently summoned for police questioning regarding allegations of evidence tampering.South Korean President Lee Jae-myung has called the breach a “wake-up call” for the nation, advocating for the maximum legal penalty, which could cost Coupang over 1 trillion won ($680 million), or 3% of its annual revenue.","Coupang confirmed that personal data of an additional 165,000 users was compromised in the country’s largest-ever hacking, which was reported in November.

There are moments in Wordle when you lose confidence and follow your instincts. That's how people usually wait these days. You can't take shortcuts, but you also can't rush through the puzzle. Initial presumptions may appear favourable at first, but they can also progressively impede better decisions. The letters are recognisable and nearly obvious, but the placement is more important than normal. Smart openers and ostentatious risks are not appropriate at this moment. Players who pay as much attention to what is absent as to what is present are rewarded, but it requires self-control and concentration.It makes sense if you've been staring at the grid for longer than you intended. As long as the framework aligns, the solution remains unattainable. You can maintain stability and concentrate on the word by using a few well-chosen signals.Wordle challenges players to uncover a hidden five-letter word in six attempts. After each guess, tiles change colour to show how close you are.Using this feedback to refine each new guess is the core of the game.If today’s puzzle is proving stubborn, these clues focus on structure rather than spelling. They are intended to guide rather than solve.Reviewing eliminated letters and leaning on common consonants may help reduce the remaining options and bring the solution into view.The answer to Wordle #1688 on February 1, 2026, is:Meaning: Something covered with thorns.Whether you solved it on your first guess or needed a few clues, Wordle remains a fun way to sharpen your mind every day.

Anime-themed games on Roblox are everywhere right now. Some fade fast. Others stick around because they keep players coming back. Anime Paradox seems to fall into the second category. At first glance, it looks like another tower defence title with familiar anime faces and flashy attacks. But spend a little time with it, and the grind becomes obvious. Progress slows quickly, upgrades demand patience, and free rewards feel essential rather than optional for anyone hoping to stay competitive.

“Hire people who are smarter than you and want to prove it.”

“Risk is not optional—it’s the price of ambition.”

“We need to think long-term if we want to survive as a species.”

“Most startup advice is wrong or only applies in very narrow contexts.”

“If you're not embarrassed by your first product, you launched too late.”

“AI will change everything—and that’s both exciting and terrifying.”

“Multitasking is a myth. Real productivity comes from deep focus.”

“So all you need is a great idea, a great team, a great product, and great execution. So easy!”

“AI will probably most likely lead to the end of the world, but in the meantime, there’ll be great companies.

“By the way, “product” includes all interactions a user has with the company.”

In today's rapidly evolving world, technology is expanding at a rate never seen before. AI, or artificial intelligence, is a part of our lives every day, even if we don't always see it. Search engines, smartphones, workplace software, and online shopping are just a few of the many applications where AI operates in the background. While some are thrilled about this shift, others are concerned about losing their employment or becoming less significant. A remarkable quote from Sam Altman brings clarity and hope in this scenario. He says, ""AI won't take over for people."" But people who use AI will take the place of those who don't. This short sentence reminds us that machines don't own the future. Instead of avoiding technology, those who are open to learning, adapting, and developing with it are its owners.At first, it might seem like Sam Altman's quote is too direct or harsh. But if we look closely, it has a good message. He is not saying that people will be useless. He is saying that people who know how to use AI the right way will have an edge.AI is a tool, just like computers, phones, and the internet were in the past.A lot of people were scared of these new technologies when they first came out. People who learned how to use them got better over time. This is also happening with AI today.This quote tells people to think of AI as a friend, not a foe. It tells us that being able to learn new things and adapt is more important than ever.Things like jobs, schools, and businesses are changing very quickly right now. AI is now used by a lot of businesses to write, design, help customers, analyze data, and plan. Students use AI to do research and learn. Even small business owners use digital tools to keep track of sales and customers.Because of this, people who don't want to learn new tools may slowly fall behind. It's not that they're less talented; it's that they're not keeping up with change.Sam Altman's words remind us that we can't stop progress. We shouldn't be afraid of it; we should get ready for it.AI isn't just for scientists or big businesses anymore. Now it's a part of everyday life. People use AI when they:These tools cut down on work and save time. They help people concentrate on being creative, solving problems, and growing as people. People who learn how to use these tools wisely often find that work is easier and more productive.AI is powerful, but it cannot replicate everything that makes people unique. Creativity, emotional intelligence, moral judgement, and imagination are still uniquely human traits.A machine can give you information, but it cannot feel sorry for you. It can analyse data, but it cannot truly grasp how people feel. That is why individuals with both technical capabilities and values will always be valued.This viewpoint is supported by a quote from Sam Altman. It claims that success stems from the combination of intelligence and compassion.This quote reminds students to learn new things as well as do their regular schoolwork. Learning about technology early on can help you in many ways later on.For people who work, this is a sign to keep learning new things. Learning never stops, especially in this digital age. Even small things, like learning one new tool at a time, can have a big impact.For business owners, this means using AI to make services better, cut costs, and better serve customers.","Sam Altman's quote of the day: ""AI won’t replace humans.

Jeff Bezos helped launch New Shepard’s space tourism moment



What happens to space tourists now



For years, space tourism felt like a novelty that just kept growing. A quick ride up. A few minutes of weightlessness. A view of Earth that only a handful of humans had ever seen. Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket became part of that story, lifting celebrities, billionaires, and guests to the edge of space and back. Short flights. Big headlines. It also hinted at a future where space access felt casual, commercial, exclusive, aspirational, thrilling, risky, and strangely normalised globally.Blue Origin has announced it will halt flights of New Shepard for at least two years. The company says it wants to shift focus and resources elsewhere. Not towards tourism. Towards the Moon. And that decision, while not entirely surprising, still marks a quiet but meaningful shift in the modern space race.Since 2021, New Shepard has flown people on brief suborbital trips lasting about ten minutes. Not orbit. Not the International Space Station. Just past the Kármán line, widely accepted as the boundary of space. Passengers included Jeff Bezos himself, actor William Shatner, NFL star Michael Strahan, journalist Gayle King, and pop singer Katy Perry. A strange mix, but that was the point. Space, briefly, was becoming accessible to people outside the traditional astronaut mould.In total, 98 people have flown aboard New Shepard. Blue Origin never disclosed ticket prices, though estimates have ranged into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. For a while, it seemed like the flights would continue steadily. In a statement released on Friday, Blue Origin said it is pausing New Shepard flights to “shift resources to further accelerate development of the company’s human lunar capabilities.” Blue Origin is one of two companies holding a NASA contract to develop a lunar lander capable of ferrying astronauts from orbit to the Moon’s surface. The other is SpaceX.NASA’s Artemis programme is aiming to return humans to the Moon for the first time since Apollo. Artemis III, the mission that would include a lunar landing, is currently scheduled for 2028. The pause also appears to reflect growing political pressure. Lawmakers in the US have increasingly framed lunar missions as part of a broader geopolitical race, particularly with China. China plans to land its own astronauts on the Moon by 2030.One awkward question remains. What about the people who already have tickets? Blue Origin hasn’t said how many future passengers are affected or what happens next. For now, space tourism via New Shepard is effectively grounded.",Blue Origin has announced it will halt flights of New Shepard for at least two years. The company says it wants to shift focus and resources elsewhere. Not towards tourism. Towards the Moon. The decision marks a quiet but meaningful shift in the modern space race.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127815932,imgsize-41410,width-400,resizemode-4/jeff-bezoss-blue-origin-pauses-space-tourism-for-2-years-to-focus-on-nasas-moon-missions.jpg"

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has a message for everyone on AI Bubble. In a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella talked about the fears that has been troubling Wall Street for past many months: whether AI is a bubble. Speaking at a session, Nadella said that it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.“A telltale sign of if it’s a bubble would be if all we are talking about are the tech firms,” Nadella said. “If all we talk about is what’s happening to the technology side then it’s just purely supply side.” Nadella said the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) need to be ""much more evenly distributed"" to avoid it from becoming a ""bubble"".He spoke about how AI and other advanced technologies are increasing productivity and changing the way we work. Nadella offered a fix to what is called productivity dilemma. According to him, business leaders need to adopt a new approach to knowledge work by shifting workflows to match the structural design of AI. “The mindset we as leaders should have is, we need to think about changing the work—the workflow—with the technology.Nadella argues that AI creates a “complete inversion” of how information moves through a business, replacing slow, hierarchical processes with a view that forces leaders to rethink their organizational structures. “We have an organization, we have departments, we have these specializations, and the information trickles up,” Nadella said. “For large organizations,” Nadella told Fink, “there’s a fundamental challenge: Unless and until your rate of change keeps up with what is possible, you’re going to get schooled by someone small being able to achieve scale because of these tools. ”Microsoft CEO said that the role of AI needs to be examined across all aspects of life, such as how it is helping pharma companies bring critical drugs faster to the market or accelerate trials. He called for AI-driven economic growth rather than just increasing spending. ""We as a global community have to get to a point where we are using AI to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries,"" Nadella said.","Satya Nadella said it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.

H-1B Visa Shake-Up Fuels Anti-Indian Campaigns as Donald Trump's Policy Reshapes US Hiring

The meteoric rise of Nvidia during the ongoing AI boom has now only rewarded the investors but it has also led to the creation of vast wealth for many of its employees. While the workforce of the company remains relatively small at about 36,000, its stock appreciation has turned long-standing contributors into millionaires. As reported by Business Insider, the newly available H-1B visa fillings offer a rare glimpse into how much Nvidia pays its US employees across critical roles.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has long stressed on the fact that he gets personally involved in compensation decisions. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day at the end of every cycle,” Huang said on the All-In podcast last July. He also claimed to have “created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world.”Despite this, the employees of the company acknowledge that those who joined Nvidia earlier have benefited far more from equity appreciation than newer hires, a disparity openly discussed within the company.The fillings with the US Labor Department required for sponsoring foreign workers—offer insight into base pay ranges. These figures exclude equity and bonuses, which often make up a significant portion of total compensation.In fiscal 2025, Nvidia received roughly 1,900 certified H-1B applications, covering roles such as software engineers, research scientists, and product managers.","The newly available H-1B visa fillings offer a rare glimpse into how much Nvidia pays its US employees.

'OpenAI deal is eating Oracle alive financially'

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

US banks are pulling back—and that's a big problem

A possible Cerner sale and 40% upfront customer deposits show how tight things have gotten

Oracle is staring down the possibility of its largest-ever workforce reduction—and at the heart of it is a $300 billion partnership with OpenAI that's proving far more expensive than anyone initially let on.Investment bank TD Cowen reported this week that Oracle is weighing cuts of 20,000 to 30,000 jobs. The move would free up an estimated $8 to $10 billion in cash flow, money the company desperately needs as it tries to bankroll a sprawling network of AI data centers built largely to serve Sam Altman 's company.TD Cowen puts the OpenAI commitment alone at around $156 billion in capital spending—and roughly 3 million GPUs to back it up. Oracle has already burned through $58 billion in debt in just two months. That's $38 billion for data centers in Texas and Wisconsin, $20 billion for a campus in New Mexico. Total debt now sits north of $100 billion.The kicker? That $58 billion covers only a slice of what's actually needed. Since its September 2025 peak, Oracle's stock has shed more than half its value—about $463 billion in market cap, gone.The financing crunch isn't just an Oracle internal issue anymore.Multiple US banks have quietly retreated from lending on Oracle-linked data center projects. TD Cowen noted that lenders have roughly doubled the interest rate premiums they charge Oracle since September, pushing borrowing costs into territory usually reserved for junk-rated companies.The result? Several data center leases Oracle had been negotiating simply stalled. Private operators couldn't get the funding to build, which means Oracle can't deliver the capacity its customers—especially OpenAI—are counting on. Some Asian banks are still willing to step in, but that doesn't solve the immediate problem in the US, where most of Oracle's expansion is planned.Oracle isn't sitting idle. The company is now requiring new customers to pay up to 40% of contract value upfront—essentially asking clients to co-fund the infrastructure. It's also exploring ""bring your own chip"" arrangements, where customers supply their own hardware.On the table too is a potential sale of Cerner, the healthcare software unit Oracle bought for $28.3 billion in 2022. That would be a significant strategic pivot, signaling that AI infrastructure is now the clear priority—everything else is up for grabs.TD Cowen also flagged that OpenAI has already begun shifting some near-term capacity needs over to Microsoft and Amazon, which is not exactly a vote of confidence in Oracle's ability to deliver on schedule.The company has not publicly commented on the layoff reports or the financing difficulties.","Oracle faces massive job cuts, potentially 20,000-30,000, to fund its costly $300 billion OpenAI partnership.

Tesla has taken unusual and expensive steps



Financial Pressure and Energy Storage Growth



Elon Musk’s warning



Tesla CEO Elon Musk delivered a blunt warning in the closing minutes of Tesla’s earnings call. Musk warned the American companies that either they should build more battery-making infrastructure in the U.S. or risk falling behind. Sounding visibly fired up, Musk implored, “Can other people, please, for the love of God, in the name of all that is holy, can others please build this stuff?”Musk argued that too many companies underestimate their exposure to geopolitical risks tied to the fragile supply chains for critical materials used in electric vehicles and energy storage. “There are so many companies out there that are asleep at the switch with regard to geopolitical risk — or they just have their head in the sand and hope nothing bad will happen.I’m way more paranoid than that,” he said.In order to insulate itself, Tesla has taken unusual and expensive steps which includes building its own lithium-refining and battery-production facilities in Texas. In December 2024, Tesla started processing lithium at its $1 billion Robstown refinery, and this month announced production of dry-electrode 4680 cells in Austin, destined for certain Model Y vehicles.Musk described these facilities as “more advanced than anything else in the world,” but stressed Tesla does not want to be the only company making such investments.Tesla’s heavy investments come as its auto business faces pressure. The company reported Q4 revenue of $3.8 billion from its Megapack energy storage batteries, a 25% increase year-over-year. Analysts, however, voiced concern about Tesla’s commitment of more than $20 billion in capital expenditures for new plants, AI infrastructure, and upgrades, noting uncertain near-term returns.Musk closed with a stark prediction: “Companies that don’t do that — a bunch of them will cease to exist.” His plea underscores Tesla’s strategy of building domestic battery infrastructure out of “desperation,” while urging others to share the burden of securing America’s energy future.",Tesla CEO Elon Musk delivered a blunt warning in the closing minutes of Tesla’s earnings call.

"As Amazon announces its results today, all eyes will be on AWS business and the reason is Microsoft",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/as-amazon-announces-its-results-today-all-eyes-will-be-on-aws-business-and-the-reason-is-microsoft/articleshow/127947578.cms,"What makes Amazon's Cloud revenue important

Amazon is set to announce its quarterly results today. According to a report in Bloomberg, all eyes will be on Amazon's cloud business which is Amazon Web Services (AWS). The reason for the same is reported to be Microsoft. Software giant Microsoft plunged last week due in part to slowing growth at its key cloud-computing platform, Azure. The all-important growth statistic for Azure and other cloud services came in at 39%, below StreetAccount’s 39.4% consensus. Microsoft’s finance chief, Amy Hood, argued that the cloud result could have been higher if it had allocated more data center infrastructure to customers rather than prioritizing its in-house needs. “If I had taken the GPUs that just came online in Q1 and Q2 in terms of GPUs and allocated them all to Azure, the KPI would have been over 40,” she said.Amazon shareholders are said to be seeking catalysts for a stock that has been languishing for a while. Amazon was the worst performer among the Magnificent Seven tech giants in 2025, rising just 5.2%, and is up less than 1% to start 2026. By comparison, the Nasdaq 100 Index jumped 20% in 2025, while the S&P 500 Index gained 16%.On the positive side, Amazon stock is slightly outperforming both these this year, so far.According to Bloomberg, Wall Street expects Amazon to report a 21% year-over-year increase in AWS revenue in the fourth quarter to $34.8 billion. For the company as a whole, analysts project a 13% jump in fourth-quarter revenue to $211.5 billion and an 8% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $2.40. While Amazon’s other revenue lines could cushion an AWS miss, the cloud business is still likely to command the most investor focus and scrutiny.David Miller, chief investment officer at Catalyst Funds, which holds Amazon shares in several portfolios, told Bloomberg, “It isn’t clear how much of Microsoft’s disappointment might be due to company-specific issues and how much might reflect an overall slowing in the cloud space.” He added, “If it’s the latter, that could carry over.”Microsoft’s aggressive AI-related capital expenditures, alongside the slowing Azure growth, made investors and analysts question when these investments will pay off more substantially. “It’s really about what’s already priced into the stock, and I think what was starting to price in for [Microsoft] was a higher growth rate, which is always a little dangerous,” said Melissa Otto, head of technology, media and telecommunications research at Visible Alpha. “We haven’t really seen Amazon moving up in the same way.”","All eyes will be on Amazon's cloud business which is Amazon Web Services (AWS) Microsoft plunged last week due in part to slowing growth at its key cloud- computing platform, Azure.

Meet Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei: Former OpenAI researcher who turned his AI vision into a $3.7 billion company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meet-anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-former-openai-researcher-who-turned-his-ai-vision-into-a-3-7-billion-company/articleshow/127943143.cms,"Source: Bloomberg

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s academic background and early career path



Dario Amodei’s rise at OpenAI and the birth of GPT models



Dario Amodei leaves OpenAI and builds Anthropic



Dario Amodei’s cautious leadership style



Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now. He is not a loud public figure, and he rarely chases attention, but his work has quietly shaped how modern AI systems are built and controlled. Before running a multi-billion-dollar company, Amodei spent years in labs and research roles, studying complex systems and how they behave under pressure. That background still shows in how he talks about artificial intelligence today. While others focus on speed and scale, he appears more concerned with safety, limits, and long-term risks. As AI moves faster than regulation, Amodei’s cautious approach is becoming harder to ignore.Before AI became the world’s favourite buzzword, Amodei was deep in academia. He studied physics at Stanford University and later earned a PhD in biophysics from Princeton. At the time, he was focused on understanding complex biological systems. Cells. Signals. Patterns that emerge rather than being designed. Looking back, that mindset fits AI almost too well.After completing his doctorate, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine.There was no clear path to becoming a tech billionaire. That part came later. Almost accidentally, it seems. Amodei eventually moved into machine learning research, joining companies like Baidu and Google Brain. At Google, he worked on neural networks and AI safety.Colleagues from that period say he already seemed concerned about failure modes. In 2016, he joined OpenAI. Things moved fast after that.At OpenAI, Amodei rose quickly. By 2019, he was Vice President of Research, helping set the organisation’s overall research direction. He led work on GPT-2 and GPT-3, models that changed public perception of AI almost overnight.These systems could write essays, answer questions, and even mimic conversation. Sometimes convincingly. Sometimes awkwardly. During this time, Amodei also co-invented reinforcement learning from human feedback. RLHF sounds technical, but the idea is simple. Teach AI systems by showing them what humans actually prefer, not just what scores well mathematically.In 2021, Amodei left OpenAI along with six others, including his sister Daniela Amodei. They founded Anthropic. Some people were sceptical at first. But Anthropic took a different route. It became a public benefit corporation. That detail mattered. It signalled that profit would not be the only priority. At least in theory. Their AI model, Claude, leaned into being cautious. Less dramatic. More restrained. That tone appealed to companies worried about reputational risk.By September 2025, Anthropic was reportedly valued at $183 billion by private investors. That number raised eyebrows. Especially for a company without much public hype.Partnerships with Alphabet and Amazon helped fuel that growth. So did rising concerns about AI safety across governments and corporations. As Anthropic’s valuation climbed, so did Amodei’s wealth. His real-time net worth now sits around $3.7 billion, ranking among the world’s richest people.Amodei does not sound like most tech CEOs. He hedges. A lot. “It seems.” “It might.” “We’re not fully sure yet.” That language annoys some people. Others trust it more. He avoids grand predictions. No promises of utopia. No claims that AI will solve everything.Experts say his influence shows up in quieter ways. Safety research is becoming mainstream. Alignment discussions moving from fringe to boardroom. Competitors are copying ideas they once ignored. No one really knows what comes next for Dario Amodei. AI is moving fast. Faster than regulation.","Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now.

Yann LeCun criticises research secrecy

Disagreement on AGI and OpenAI’s role

Wider debate in the AI community

Meta’s former chief AI scientist Yann LeCun has publicly questioned OpenAI ’s claims around achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) following a social media exchange with OpenAI vice president Sebastien Bubeck. The discussion, which unfolded on X (formerly Twitter), highlighted differences over research transparency and whether any single company can deliver AGI. LeCun criticised OpenAI’s approach to conducting research largely behind closed doors and later rejected the idea that AGI would emerge from one organisation or a single breakthrough, stating that OpenAI does not have a monopoly on innovation.The exchange began when Bubeck described OpenAI as the “best research environment” he has worked in. He said the company offers “freedom to explore” ideas, access to advanced tools, and operates in a field rich with research opportunities.“I've been in lots of places in my career. OAI is simply the best research environment I have ever seen,” Bubeck wrote, calling the setup “special.”Yann LeCun responded by questioning OpenAI’s culture of secrecy. He argued that research loses its value if it is not openly shared.“Except for the whole ‘don’t tell anyone about your research’ part,” LeCun wrote. “Research in secret is not research.”Bubeck defended OpenAI’s approach by referencing mathematician Andrew Wiles, who worked privately for years before proving Fermat’s Last Theorem.“So when Wiles worked in secret on Fermat’s last theorem for 7 years he wasn’t doing research?” Bubeck asked.LeCun replied that Wiles ultimately published his work. “He published a paper about it once he had a proof,” he said.During the conversation, Sebastien Bubeck suggested that achieving AGI could take several years. “It might take us more than 7 years to accomplish our own goal (AGI), we shall see!” he wrote.LeCun dismissed the idea that AGI would result from a single effort or company. “It’s not going to be a singular event resulting from a single magic-bullet idea,” he said, adding, “Also, it won’t come from OpenAI.”The exchange reflects broader debates in the AI community over openness, competition, and the future of advanced AI systems. While OpenAI has increasingly limited access to its most advanced research, figures like LeCun continue to argue for open scientific collaboration.The discussion highlights ongoing disagreements about how AI research should be conducted and who, if anyone, will lead the development of AGI.","Yann LeCun criticises OpenAI’s approach to conducting research behind closed doors.

Expressive Speech

language support expanded to 27 languages

Viewers choose ‘Preferred Language’

YouTube is getting AI-Powered lip sync

Creator-centric updates

Google-owned YouTube has announced updates to auto-dubbing tool. The company says that these new features are designed to make “global stories feel local”, expanding the service to all creators and increasing its language library. According to the company, the reception of the technology is increasing: In December 2025 alone, the platform averaged more than 6 million daily viewers who watched at least 10 minutes of auto-dubbed content.“Discovering new creators shouldn’t require a translator. Now, exploring content from all over the world is as easy as pressing play,” the company said in an announcement.One of the most significant upgrades is the expansion of Expressive Speech– a feature that moves beyond the flat, mechanical voices in favour of a creator’s original emotion, tone and energy. Expressive Speech is now available for all channels in 27, moving from eight core languages: English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.Recognising that many users are multilingual or prefer original audio, YouTube has introduced a Preferred Language setting. The platform typically defaults to a language based on users' watch history but they can now manually set preferences, ensuring that they want to hear a creator’s original voice or a specific dialect.To solve the visual “disconnect” often found in dubbed media, YouTube has begun testing a Lip Sync pilot. This technology subtly modifies the pixels on the screen to match the speaker’s lip movements to the translated audio.“To make auto dubs even more natural, we’re currently testing a Lip Sync pilot that subtly matches the speaker’s lip movements to the translated audio so a dubbed video feels as seamless as watching the original,” YouTube said.YouTube also emphasised that it has made some improvements for the creator community:First is automatic smart filtering, wherein the AI now recognises content that shouldn't be dubbed, such as music videos or silent vlogs, to preserve the video’s original intent. The second improvement is discovery friendly auto dubbed tracks that do not negatively impact the original video’s algorithm.“We are committed to giving creators full agency over how their stories are told in every language, while providing viewers with the flexibility to choose how they listen. Experience the next generation of global storytelling — keep an eye out for auto-dubbing on your next video,” YouTube said.Creators can also provide their own dubs or turn them off completely.","Google-owned YouTube has announced updates to auto-dubbing tool.

The Google-Wiz discovery: An 'Open Book' database



A day after Google-acquired cybersecurity company Wiz revealed that Moltbook, a social media platform for Moltbots (or AI agents) has leaked the personal information like API tokens and emails, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) issued a high-level security alert, warning domestic enterprises and developers of “significant security risks” associated with the deployment of autonomous AI agents.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the MIIT alert specifically pointed to OpenClaw (also known as Moltbot or Clawdbot) that improper configurations and default settings in these autonomous agents may serve as a gateway for large-scale cyberattacks and sensitive data leaks.Moltbook has seen its popularity grow exponentially, and Chinese technology enthusiasts, with cloud service providers are rushing to offer hosting solutions. China's largest cloud service providers, including Alibaba Alicloud and Tencent Cloud, and Baidu have even launched services allowing users to rent servers to run OpenClaw remotely.However, the ministry cautioned that organisations deploying OpenClaw must conduct thorough audits of public network exposure, implement robust identity authentication and access controls.The first alarm was first raised by Wiz, the cybersecurity firm currently being acquired by Google (Alphabet).In a detailed research report, Wiz revealed that Moltbook had unknowingly left a database entirely public, allowing full read and write access to the platform’s core data.It explained that 1.5 Million API tokens, which are critical credentials, were accessible that allow attackers to hijack AI agents and gain access to the third-party services. Furthermore, over 35,000 personal email addresses human “owners” of the bots were also leaked.Moreover, private messages between AI agents that contained sensitive context about their owners' daily lives and proprietary code snippets were also leaked.The Moltbook disaster has placed the trend of “Vibe Coding” under scrutiny with Wiz co-founder Ami Luttwak was blunt about the trade-off.“As we see over and over again with vibe coding, although it runs very fast, many times people forget the basics of security,” Luttwak noted. He explained that because the AI followed the ""vibe"" of building a social network quickly, it neglected fundamental identity verification and security guardrails.","China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) issued a high- level security alert, warning domestic enterprises and developers of “significant security risks” associated with the deployment of autonomous AI agents.

"Egypt bans Roblox nationwide over child safety concerns, raising global questions about kids' online freedom",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/egypt-bans-roblox-nationwide-over-child-safety-concerns-raising-global-questions-about-kids-online-freedom/articleshow/127935398.cms,"Source: Bloomberg

Roblox faces a government ban in Egypt: Here’s why



What this ban means for kids and parents



Roblox going dark in Egypt, the platform that lives almost entirely on screens, the sudden loss felt very real. With games loading, Avatars running around blocky worlds. And then Egypt has officially banned Roblox, saying the move is about protecting children from harmful online content. The story underneath feels layered, political, and a little messy. Roblox looks harmless on the surface but experts say the risk is not the visuals but the interaction. The platform allows users to create games, chat with strangers, and move freely between user-generated worlds.A spokesperson confirmed the company has reached out to Egyptian authorities, offering dialogue to resolve the issue and restore access. The company says it has worked with regulators in other regions to build localised safety systems that align with cultural values. Last year, the company restricted some features across parts of the Middle East to address safety concerns. This ban did not come out of nowhere. Roblox has already been blocked or restricted in countries like Qatar and Turkey with other nations watching closely.The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.According to state-run media, the ban will be coordinated with the National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority. That means internet providers are expected to block access nationwide with no single official explanation was released at first. Later, state outlets pointed to growing concerns about children’s exposure to inappropriate content, online interactions, and psychological risks as reported by Bloomberg. An Egyptian senator had already called for regulating Roblox to protect children’s moral and educational values.President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi recently called for limits on children’s phone use, pointing to similar moves abroad. Australia has banned social media for certain age groups. France is moving in the same direction. Egypt’s parliament is now discussing broader rules for digital platforms including unified age classifications, stronger verification, penalties and possibly forcing companies to have local representatives inside the country.For children, the ban feels abrupt and confusing. For parents, reactions are mixed. Some welcome the move, while others worry it pushes kids toward less visible, less regulated platforms, potentially exposing them to more risks. That is the irony experts often point out. When one door closes, another usually opens. Sometimes darker, more unpredictable, and harder to monitor.Still, supporters of the ban argue that Roblox’s scale makes it different. Millions of users. Constant interaction. Endless content that cannot realistically be watched, moderated, or controlled by humans alone, leaving significant safety and privacy concerns for young players and families.","The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.

India’s AI Rise Gets Global Push As UN Chief Praises Leadership, Nvidia CEO Predicts Job Surge

ChatGPT vs Google Search: Why efforts matter in learning

Evidence across experiments

Experiment 1: Participants asked to advise a friend on planting a vegetable garden learned either via Google or ChatGPT. Those using Google spent more time searching, reported deeper learning, and wrote longer, fact-rich advice.

Experiment 2: Even when the information was identical across conditions, the format mattered. Google users engaged more deeply, while ChatGPT users produced sparser, more similar advice.

Replications: Effects held across topics of personal relevance (healthy lifestyle, financial scams) and even when LLM summaries included real-time web links.

Implications of the use of AI

A new research led by Shiri Melumad, professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, suggests that larger language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT may reduce the depth of learning as compared with traditional web search. The study indicate that while LLMs offer quick, synthesised answers but they come at a cost, as due to the ease the users exert less effort and also develop shallower knowledge and produce less original ideas.The study published in PNAS Nexus, tested around 10,000 participants access several experiments. The results showed that the users who used ChatGPT reported learning fewer new things, felt less ownership over their knowledge and wrote advice that was shorter, more generic and less persuasive as compared to the users who used Google search as a medium for learning.The findings of the study are build on the concept of ‘desirable difficulty’. The idea is that effortful learning often leads to deeper understanding. Traditional web search needs the users to navigate links, interpret multiple sources and also synthesise information themselves. This research argue and friction force the users to process the searched information more deeply.On the other hand, the LLMs like ChatGPT perform this synthesis automatically which lead to reduction in the cognitive work involved.As a result of this, the users may feel they have learned less and generate advice that is less informative and unique.The study revealed that while LLMs have proven to be effective in tasks like writing, coding and exam preparation, but overreliance of the model can hinder your knowledge development and the content created may also lack originality and deeper understanding of the topic. AI tools save time but may discourage the kind of active engagement that builds lasting knowledge structures.Melumad and colleagues argue that while AI can be a powerful aid, it risks turning users into passive recipients of information rather than active learners. The message is clear that AI and social media may be reshaping not just how we access information, but how deeply we understand it.","ChatGPT may reduce the depth of learning as compared with traditional web search.

Now termed ""agentic engineering,"" developers orchestrate AI agents, demanding new skills. Industry leaders acknowledge feeling challenged, with AI-generated code increasing significantly, signaling a profound shift in software development.

From 'accept all' to agentic engineering

Even OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman feels 'a little useless'

Karpathy's 2026 outlook for vibe coding

Read Andrej Karpathy’s full post on vibe coding’s anniversary

A lot of people quote tweeted this as 1 year anniversary of vibe coding. Some retrospective:

I've had a Twitter account for 17 years now (omg) and I still can't predict my tweet engagement basically at all.

This was a shower of thoughts throwaway tweet that I just fired off without thinking but somehow it minted a fitting name at the right moment for something that a lot of people were feeling at the same time, so here we are: vibe coding is now mentioned on my Wikipedia as a major memetic ""contribution"" and even its article is longer.

lol

The one thing I'd add is that at the time, LLM capability was low enough that you'd mostly use vibe coding for fun throwaway projects, demos and explorations.

It was good fun and it almost worked. Today (1 year later), programming via LLM agents is increasingly becoming a default workflow for professionals, except with more oversight and scrutiny. The goal is to claim the leverage from the use of agents but without any compromise on the quality of the software.

Many people have tried to come up with a better name for this to differentiate it from vibe coding, personally my current favorite ""agentic engineering"":

""agentic"" because the new default is that you are not writing the code directly 99% of the time, you are orchestrating agents who do and acting as oversight.

""engineering"" to emphasize that there is an art & science and expertise to it. It's something you can learn and become better at, with its own depth of a different kind.

In 2026, we're likely to see continued improvements on both the model layer and the new agent layer. I feel excited about the product of the two and another year of progress.

Andrej Karpathy, the former Tesla AI director who coined ""vibe coding"" exactly one year ago, says the trend has grown from weekend hobby to industry standard. And 2026, he believes, will push it even further.Marking the anniversary on X, Karpathy admitted his original post was just ""a shower of thoughts"" he fired off without much consideration. But it struck a nerve. The term now has its own Wikipedia article—longer than the section on his other contributions.""Vibe coding is now mentioned on my Wikipedia as a major memetic contribution,"" he wrote, clearly amused.Back in February 2025, Karpathy described vibe coding as almost reckless. He would hit ""Accept All"" on Cursor suggestions without reading diffs, copy-paste error messages with no comment, and let the code balloon beyond his understanding. It worked for throwaway weekend projects. A custom reading app. A simple webapp. Nothing serious.That has changed. Karpathy now distinguishes between casual vibe coding and what he calls ""agentic engineering."" The word ""agentic"" captures the reality that developers orchestrate AI agents instead of writing code themselves.The word ""engineering"" signals there is still real skill involved—a learning curve of its own kind.In December, Karpathy posted that he had ""never felt this much behind as a programmer."" He called it a ""magnitude 9 earthquake"" and compared the tools to a ""powerful alien tool"" handed out with no manual. Sometimes it misfires. Sometimes ""a powerful beam of laser erupts and melts your problem.""Karpathy is not the only one feeling the ground shift. Boris Cherny, creator of Claude Code at Anthropic, said he feels behind ""most weeks."" New grads may have an edge—they carry no assumptions about what AI can or cannot do.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman offered his own confession after using the company's Codex app, admitting he felt ""a little useless"" as the tool outperformed him. Cursor CEO Michael Truell has cautioned against going too far—likening pure vibe coding to building a house without checking under the floorboards.The trend has spread beyond engineers. Google's Sundar Pichai said vibe coding made development ""exciting again."" Microsoft's Satya Nadella revealed up to 30 percent of the company's code is now AI-generated. Klarna's Sebastian Siemiatkowski prototypes in 20 minutes instead of waiting weeks. Shopify's Tobi Lutke vibe codes medical device software on weekends.Looking ahead, Karpathy expects gains on two fronts. AI models will keep improving. But he is equally excited about advances in the agent layer—the tools that help developers direct those models.""I feel excited about the product of the two and another year of progress,"" he wrote.The goal has shifted. It is no longer about vibing on throwaway projects. The challenge now is claiming leverage from AI without compromising quality. The earthquake continues. And the man who named it is still learning how to hold the alien tool steady.","Former Tesla AI director Andrej Karpathy coined ""vibe coding"" exactly one year ago.

Read Microsoft’s Commercial CEO’s full memo

Commercial business update and leadership announcement

We have all been rapidly changing how we work as an AI-first company, and we are evolving how we operate to reflect the same. We must become faster, flatter, and more agile in our operating rhythms, empowering our people with the authority to make decisions and removing the friction for them to do so.

Our commercial cohort operating model has illustrated how effective we can be as a company.

The cohort forums are intellectually honest sessions aimed at tightening the feedback loop between the voice of the customer and our product ethos. This approach brings engineering, marketing, sales, services, and operations together across the topics that matter most for our business, ensuring that our product ambitions accrue to our customers' needs in this era of Frontier Transformation.

In the runup to Ignite, we collaborated through this process to formulate our Intelligence + Trust strategy and pave the way forward for Copilot, our IQ and developer platforms, and Agent 365.

With this new commercial model established, I will be asking more of our MCAPS leadership to run the business in service of our customers and partners. In recognition of their increased scope and responsibility, I am pleased to share the following role changes to Executive Vice President, which will continue reporting directly to me:

Deb Cupp is our EVP & Chief Revenue Officer, Global Enterprise. She will continue leading our global enterprise sales organization.

Mala Anand is our EVP & Chief Customer Experience Officer, bringing together our full spectrum of services including Industry Solutions Delivery, Customer Success, and Support—across Customer Experience & Success.

Nick Parker is our EVP & Chief Business Officer of Worldwide Sales & Solutions (WSS).

His team leads Commercial Solution Areas, co-engineering, and sales teams including enterprise, industry, partner, and devices.

Ralph Haupter is our EVP & Chief Revenue Officer, Small, Medium Enterprises & Channel (SME&C) focused on earning increased share down market through agentic selling and scaling with our Cloud Solution Provider partners.

Please join me in congratulating Deb, Mala, Nick, and Ralph.

Kim Akers will continue in her current capacity as our Chief Operating Officer, and

Takeshi Numoto

remains our Chief Marketing Officer, also reporting directly to me.

I am inspired by how these teams and the cohort operating model are strengthening our core values of customer obsession and One Microsoft. With an increased focus on the commercial business across the company, I look forward to leading our customers, partners, and Microsoft through Frontier Transformation alongside all of you.

Judson

Microsoft's newly minted Commercial CEO Judson Althoff has reorganized his leadership team just months after his October promotion, elevating four executives to senior vice president roles as the company races to capitalize on AI adoption, according to an internal memo obtained by Business Insider.Althoff, who took the commercial CEO position to free up overall CEO Satya Nadella for more technical work, told employees the company needs to ""become faster, flatter, and more agile"" in how it operates. The restructuring comes as Microsoft navigates what Nadella has called a ""tectonic AI platform shift"" while dealing with slower-than-expected Azure cloud growth that's pushed shares down 15% in 2026.The promotions include Deb Cupp as EVP and chief revenue officer of global enterprise sales, tasked with handling Microsoft's most strategic customer accounts. Mala Anand becomes EVP and chief customer experience officer, overseeing industry solutions delivery and customer support. Nick Parker steps up to EVP and chief business officer of worldwide sales and solutions, while Ralph Haupter takes on EVP and chief revenue officer for small and medium enterprises.All four will report directly to Althoff, who joined Microsoft from Oracle in 2013 and built the company's Customer and Partner Solutions division over nine years before his recent promotion.In the memo, Althoff emphasized Microsoft's shift to an AI-first company requires removing friction and empowering people to make faster decisions. He highlighted the company's ""commercial cohort operating model"" that brings engineering, marketing, sales, and operations together to ensure product development aligns with customer needs during what he calls the ""Frontier Transformation"" era.A Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC the expanded leadership roles allow Althoff more time to focus on commercial product strategy while keeping ""the feedback loop between customers and product decisions as small as possible."" The company says this rapid response is critical as customers expect AI capabilities to materialize in their businesses faster than ever before.The restructuring follows Microsoft's pattern of using CEO titles for major business units, including gaming chief Phil Spencer and AI chief Mustafa Suleyman, as Nadella concentrates on datacenter buildout, systems architecture, and product innovation.","Microsoft's Commercial CEO Judson Althoff elevates four executives to senior vice president roles.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on IT stock sell off

As Wall Street continues to assess the fallout from a sharp sell-off in technology stocks after the launch of Anthropic’s new AI tool, some of the world’s big analysts and tech CEOs offer a different view. A top JPMorgan strategist says that investors shouldn't be worried, while tech leaders like Nvidia’s Jensen Huang and Google’s Sundar Pichai have called the panic “illogical” and “overblown”.Market commentator and CNBC host Jim Cramer shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), writing “Software decline seems overdone to me at this time....”. Speaking at CNBC’s “Mad Money”, Cramer said that the Wall Street has decided that “everything software must be thrown away, anything remotely connected to software is suspect, including companies that just collect data”. “But any client — a bank, a consumer-packaged goods company, an industrial company — is golden, at least for now,” he added.Stephen Parker, the co-head of global investment strategy at America’s biggest bank JPMorgan said that the panic is overblown. As reported by Business Insider, he sees the stock rout “as a healthy rotation as investors pivot towards better opportunities and away from the tech-driven market.”Another JPMorgan analyst Toby Ogg shared a note to investors saying “We are now in an environment where the sector isn’t just guilty until proven innocent but is now being sentenced before trial.”For software companies, “better-than-expected results are no longer enough to convince the market,” Ogg wrote. That’s unless “they can demonstrate irrefutably that AI is a sustainable tailwind to growth rather than a longer-term headwind,” he said.During the company’s earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the sell off might be overblown.""I think it is an enabling tool, just like it has been an enabling tool for us across our products and services, be it Search, YouTube, etc,"" Pichai said of its AI tool Gemini, saying that companies that are ""seizing the moment"" will ""have the same opportunity ahead.""Speaking recently at an event, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said “There's this notion that the tool ‌in the ‍software industry is in decline, and will be ‍replaced by AI ...

Anthropic’s new AI model drive software stock rout

Amid the massive software stock sell off, Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu said that the software as a service (SaaS) industry is facing a deeper structural challenge that goes beyond the threat of artificial intelligence (AI). In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Vembu said he had long believed the SaaS sector was vulnerable, even before AI began to reshape how software is built and sold. “The stock market is becoming very negative about the prospects of SaaS companies in the AI-assisted Code era. Well before the AI revolution, I have said SaaS industry is ripe for consolidation,” Vembu wrote in the post.Sridhar Vembu’s comments come at a time when software stocks are under pressure, with investors questioning how AI-assisted coding tools could disrupt existing business models. According to him, the challenges facing SaaS companies are not new, but AI is accelerating a correction that was already overdue.“An industry that spends vastly more on sales and marketing than on engineering and product development was always vulnerable. The venture capital bubble and then the stock market bubble funded a fundamentally flawed, unsustainable model for too long. AI is the pin that is popping this inflated balloon,” Vembu said.In the post, Sridhar Vembu also addressed Zoho’s future in the AI era. He said that the company’s survival depends on its “ability to adapt”. He shared that he often asks employees to think about the possibility of failure as a way to stay grounded.“Can Zoho survive the AI wave? It depends on our ability to adapt,” Vembu wrote, adding “I always ask our employees to calmly contemplate our death. When we accept that possibility, we become more fearless and that is when we can calmly chart our course.”The latest rout was triggered by worries that new AI tools could disrupt existing business models. As mentioned above, the selling accelerated after Anthropic released a new AI automation tool, raising concerns that many software companies could face stronger competition. Investors, per a Bloomberg report, are worried that advances in generative AI may reduce demand for traditional software products or weaken long-standing pricing models.","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu said the software as a service (SaaS) industry is facing a deeper structural challenge.

Anthropic’s broader campaign



Anthropic, the AI startup behind Claude — the ChatGPT rival has now made its Super Bowl advertising debut with a 30-second spot which pokes fun at rival OpenAI’s recently announced plans to introduced ads in its chatbot. The commercial which was aired during the big game, dramatised the potential frustration of ads intruding into AI conversations. The ad released shows a young man doing pull-ups in a park and he asks a muscular bystander for tips on how he can achieve six-packs abs. After listening to his question, the bystander starts with a robotic, chatbot-like response before abruptly pitching ‘StepBoost Max’ insoles, complete with a discount code. The tagline drives the point home: ‘Ads are coming to AI, But not to Claude’.While the Anthropic ad does not mention the name of OpenAI, the ad was a direct response to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s announcement that ads will soon appear in ChatGPT. Last month, Altman announced that OpenAI will start testing ads in ChatGPT in the coming weeks. CEO Sam Altman said that the ads will be introduced specifically for users on the Free tier and the newly launched ChatGPT Go plan, an $8-per-month subscription that debuted in the US.Notably, high-tier subscribers on Plus ($20/mo), Pro ($200/mo), and Enterprise plans will remain ad-free.“We are starting to test ads in ChatGPT free and Go (new $8/month option) tiers,” Altman wrote on X (formerly Twitter), adding that the company “will not accept money to influence the answer ChatGPT gives you, and we keep your conversations private from advertisers.” “It is clear to us that a lot of people want to use a lot of AI and don't want to pay, so we are are hopeful a business model like this can work,” Altman added.Altman himself acknowledged the ad made by Anthropic and shared his thoughts on the same via a post on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter. “First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed. But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest. I guess it’s on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren’t real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it,” Altman wrote.Anthropic also aired a 60-second pregame ad, featuring a therapy session that humorously veers into a plug for a fictional dating site called “Golden Encounters.” The campaign signals a shift in AI marketing, moving away from reassuring messages about safety and jobs toward playful, competitive positioning. Andrew Stirk, Anthropic’s head of brand marketing, said the company wanted to highlight its values: “There’s a time and place for ads, and we don’t believe your conversations with AI should be one of them. ”","Anthropic, the AI startup behind Claude, made its Super Bowl advertising debut with a 30-second spot.

At its fourth quarter earnings call, Google revealed that its AI assistant app Gemini has surpassed 750 million monthly active users (MAUs). This is a 100 million jump from the last quarter’s 650 million MAUs. Announcing the new results, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the launch of Gemini 3 was a major milestone and that the company has “great momentum”. “Our first party models, like Gemini, now process over 10 billion tokens per minute via direct API use by our customers, and the Gemini App has grown to over 750 million monthly active users,” he revealed.During the earnings call, Pichai said Google is seeing higher engagement per user on the Gemini app, especially after the launch of Gemini 3 in December. He noted that users are spending more time with the app and using it more frequently compared to earlier versions. The company did not share specific engagement figures but said usage trends have improved quarter over quarter.Pichai also said Google has managed to cut operating costs for Gemini in a major way. As revealed by him, Gemini’s serving unit costs were reduced by 78 percent over 2025. He attributed this reduction to model optimisations, better efficiency, and improved infrastructure utilisation. The cost savings are expected to support wider deployment of Gemini across Google’s products and services.Google said newly announced partnerships with Apple and Reliance Jio will help expand Gemini’s reach further. While the company did not disclose detailed timelines, Pichai said these partnerships will extend Gemini’s technological and commercial presence across more platforms and regions, including India.Pichai said Gemini 3 Pro has seen the fastest adoption of any AI model Google has launched so far. Since its release, Gemini 3 Pro has processed nearly three times as many daily tokens as Gemini 2.5 Pro on average. He added that the model now leads Google’s work in reasoning and multimodal understanding.Gemini 3 Pro also powers Google Anti Gravity, a new development platform that allows AI agents to plan and carry out complex software tasks. Google said the platform has already crossed 1.5 million weekly users within just over two months of launch.Google said its first-party AI models, including Gemini, now process over 10 billion tokens per minute through direct API usage by customers. This is up from 7 billion tokens per minute in the previous quarter.Pichai added that Google is continuing to roll out AI features across its products.

ChatGPT to balance ads with organic answers

ChatGPT ads pilot program

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI recently announced that it will soon integrate ads in the chatbot. Now, days after making the announcement the company has revealed that it is planning to build an ‘ads integrity’ team in order to make sure that its new business model does not compromise the trust of its users and prevent any kids of scams. As reported by Business Insider, a job listing posted in late January describes the role as part of a “0 → 1 team,” meaning it will be built from scratch to design systems that protect users from harmful or misleading advertising.The listing highlights that the key responsibilities of the team will be developing “know your customer” (KYC) systems to verify advertiser identities and assess risk. KYC, widely used in finance, is a labor-intensive but crucial safeguard against scam ads and fraudulent content. The issue has become pressing for tech companies with self-service ad platforms—Meta, for example, said it removed 134 million scam ads in 2025, according to a Reuters investigation.As per the report, Arilla Gracia, COO of the Check My Ads Institute, noted that while KYC is a strong foundation, the real test will be how deeply OpenAI invests in integrity beyond the launch phase. “KYC on advertisers is certainly a good foundation, but the materiality of the risk of a large volume of scam ads in the early days is far lower,” she said.Along with this, the new team will also focus on determining where and how ads are shown in ChatGPT, an important decision as OpenAI seeks balance monetisation with user trust. Advertisers have also stressed that OpenAI must prove ads embedded in AI answers can deliver measurable results if the company hopes to scale its ad business.An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed that a small test of ads will run soon on ChatGPT’s free tier and Go tier in the US. Advertisers must commit to a minimum spend of $200,000 to participate. The company will track clicks and impressions initially, with plans to explore more advanced measurement options as experiments progress.","ChatGPT-maker OpenAI recently announced that it will soon integrate ads in the chatbot.

The campaign highlights some of the most prevalent scams types including fake job offers demanding upfront fees, digital arrest scams impersonating government or law enforcement officials, and fraudulent investment schemes promising guaranteed or overnight returns.It adopts a light-hearted yet cautionary tone, using humor and familiarity to unpack how scams often disguise themselves as opportunity, authority, or urgency.Meta, Shri Tuhin Kanta Pandey, Chairman, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) said: “Financial scams are increasingly using digital platforms to mislead individuals through false claims of legitimacy and unrealistic return promises. Citizens must remain vigilant and ensure they engage only with SEBI-registered entities before making any financial investment decisions.Meta’s anti-scam campaign is crucial for public awareness amidst the rising cases of financial fraud. Public awareness Initiatives like these are critical in reducing the impact of such frauds and protecting investor interests and people’s hard earned money.”Neena Gupta said, “Scams today don’t always look dangerous – they often sound friendly, urgent and convincing. I’m proud to support Meta’s anti‑scam initiative because awareness is the first step to protecting yourself and your loved ones from online scams.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su on Wednesday (February 4) defended her company’s quarterly financial results by painting a positive picture even as investors wiped 16% off the chipmaker’s market value. Despite a fourth-quarter beat, AMD’s stock plummeted following a first-quarter forecast that many on Wall Street deemed “soft” in the context of the current AI growth.Speaking with CNBC, Su struck an optimistic tone, highlighting that the internal momentum of the business is far stronger than the current market reaction suggests. While replying to analysts’ question if AMD is keeping pace with industry leader Nvidia, Su insisted that the demand for AI compute is accelerating at an unprecedented rate.“What I would tell you from someone on the inside is AI is accelerating at a pace that I would not have imagined,” Su stated. She noted that in the last quarter, the company saw a significant “step up” in demand within its data centre business. Su highlighted the performance of AMD’s Central Processing Units (CPUs), describing their adoption for AI enterprise workloads as ""going gangbusters.""AMD projected revenue of $9.8 billion, plus or minus $300 million.While this figure actually edged out the consensus estimate of $9.38 billion, it failed to meet the expectations of analysts who viewed this as a weak outlook. AMD struck a bunch of high-profile “megadeals” in late 2025, including major infrastructure partnerships with OpenAI and Oracle.Su pointed toward the second half of 2026 as the true turning point for the company, keeping hopes of a surge around the launch of Helios, AMD’s new integrated server-scale AI system. The Helios system is designed to compete directly with integrated rack-scale solutions, offering a more streamlined way for enterprises to deploy massive AI clusters.","Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su defended her company's quarterly financial results by painting a positive picture.

Elon Musk calls French police raid on X office 'political attack': Read company’s full response,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-calls-french-police-raid-on-x-office-political-attack-read-companys-full-response/articleshow/127916175.cms,"Read what X said in response to raids

French judicial authorities raided X’s Paris office today in connection with a politicized criminal investigation into alleged manipulation of algorithms and purported fraudulent data extraction. We are disappointed by this development, but we are not surprised. The Paris Public Prosecutor’s office widely publicized the raid—making clear that today’s action was an abusive act of law enforcement theater designed to achieve illegitimate political objectives rather than advance legitimate law enforcement goals rooted in the fair and impartial administration of justice.

The Paris Public Prosecutor's Office is plainly attempting to exert pressure on X’s senior management in the United States by targeting our French entity and employees, who are not the focus of this investigation. The Prosecutor’s Office has ignored the established procedural mechanisms to obtain evidence in compliance with international treaties and X’s rights to defend itself. These procedural mechanisms are well known and used on a daily basis by judicial authorities around the world.

The allegations underlying today’s raid are baseless and X categorically denies any wrongdoing. Today’s staged raid reinforces our conviction that this investigation distorts French law, circumvents due process, and endangers free speech. X is committed to defending its fundamental rights and the rights of its users. We will not be intimidated by the actions of French judicial authorities today.

A day after the Paris prosecutor’s cyber-crime unit conducted a raid on the french offices of Elon Musk-owned social media platform, X (formerly Twitter), the company called it abusive act of law enforcement with Tesla CEO also chiming in saying that the action is ‘political’.“This is a political attack,” Musk said in a post on X.According to the Paris prosecutor’s office, the raid was a part of the investigation into suspected offenses by X. the probe began in January 2025 and focused on X’s recommendation algorithms but was recently widened to include its controversial AI chatbot, Grok. The authorities are investigating X for non-consensual sexualised deepfakes created by Grok AI chatbot, child safety and fraudulent data extraction.The prosecutors also summoned both Elon Musk and former CEO Linda Yaccarino to appear at hearings in Paris this April.Telegram founder and CEO Pavel Durov also criticised the French government for the raids, saying, “French police is currently raiding X’s office in Paris. France is the only country in the world that is criminally persecuting all social networks that give people some degree of freedom (Telegram, X, TikTok…). Don’t be mistaken: this is not a free country.”","The Paris prosecutor’s cyber-crime unit conducted a raid on the french offices of Elon Musk-owned social media platform, X (formerly Twitter) The company called it abusive act of law enforcement with Tesla CEO also chiming in saying that the action is ‘political’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127916161,imgsize-1403178,width-400,resizemode-4/elon-musk.jpg"

Cognizant has forecast annual revenue above Wall Street estimates, betting on strong demand for its IT services as businesses adopt artificial intelligence (AI) into their workflows. The US-based company's results come on a day, software companies' stocks worldwide are reeling under Bloodbath. Most IT services and software companies are down up to 10%, driven by fears of disruption caused by AI, with some analysts warning of more volatility as investors assess whether the challenge is existential for the sector. The selloff has been triggered by a new legal tool from Anthropic, which showed the AI industry's growing push into industries that can unlock lucrative enterprise revenue needed to fund massive investments in the technology.Cognizant follows a January-December financial year. During the quarter, Cognizant reportedly benefited from enterprise clients prioritizing AI integration and automation as they migrate to the cloud. Cognizant reported a fourth-quarter revenue of $5.33 billion, above estimates of $5.31 billion. Adjusted profit came in at $1.35 per share, beating estimates of $1.32. Revenue from Cognizant's financial services segment — serving banking, capital markets, payments and insurance companies — grew the most, rising 10.5% to $1.59 billion.Analysts had expected $1.52 billion.The quarter was also marked by the signing of a massive USD 1 billion ""mega deal,"" one of five such deals secured during the year.Cognizant said that it expects full-year 2026 revenue between $22.14 billion and $22.66 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $22.06 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. The company also forecast annual adjusted profit per share between $5.56 and $5.70, the mid-point of which is largely in line with estimates of $5.62.""As we enter 2026, our strategy is focused on solving the AI velocity gap, the gap between massive AI infrastructure spending in the past few years and business value realization for our clients,"" CEO Ravi Kumar said. ""I am deeply grateful to our over 350,000 employees who helped make 2025 a defining year for Cognizant in which we put our AI builder strategy in motion and returned to the 'winner's circle' two years ahead of the target we set at our Investor Day. We have invested in our talent, strengthened our partnership ecosystem and advanced our AI platforms to help clients scale AI across the enterprise,"" Cognizant CEO Ravi Kumar S said.These investments, he noted, helped Cognizant sign 28 large deals in 2025, with TCV growth of nearly 50 per cent year-on-year.""We are confident that the foundation we built over the last three years positions us well to carry this momentum in the years ahead,"" Kumar asserted.Chief Financial Officer Jatin Dalal said the company is still evaluating a primary offering and secondary listing in India, for which it is in conversation with Indian regulators and financial and legal advisers.Cognizant's total employee count as of December 31, 2025, was 351,600, an increase of 1,800 from September 30, 2025 and 14,800 from December 31, 2024.","Cognizant forecast annual revenue above Wall Street estimates, betting on strong demand for its IT services.

Impact spreads to other regions

A sharp selloff in global stock markets wiped out about $285 billion in market value in a single day after Anthropic launched its new AI tool called the 'SaaSpocalypse'. America’s biggest bank JPMorgan said the fall reflects a deeper shift in how investors view software companies, especially as concerns around artificial intelligence grow. In a note to investors, JPMorgan analyst Toby Ogg said investors are no longer giving software firms the benefit of the doubt. “We are now in an environment where the sector isn’t just guilty until proven innocent but is now being sentenced before trial,” Ogg said.For software companies, “better-than-expected results are no longer enough to convince the market,” Ogg wrote. That’s unless “they can demonstrate irrefutably that AI is a sustainable tailwind to growth rather than a longer-term headwind,” he said.According to a Bloomberg report, his comments help explain why the selling pressure has continued even after prices dropped sharply, justifying fears that the sector is being punished more aggressively than before. He added that investor sentiment toward software companies has turned sharply negative and remains weak.Ogg said he met more than 50 investors across Europe and the US over the past two weeks. According to him, many of these investors have cut their software holdings over the last 12 to 18 months.Even after the recent decline, “the general appetite to step in remains generally low,” he said.The latest rout was triggered by worries that new AI tools could disrupt existing business models. As mentioned above, the selling accelerated after Anthropic released a new AI automation tool, raising concerns that many software companies could face stronger competition.Investors are worried that advances in generative AI may reduce demand for traditional software products or weaken long-standing pricing models. One concern highlighted by Ogg is seat-based pricing, where companies charge customers per user. AI tools could reduce the number of logins needed to complete tasks, which may hurt revenue.The selloff spread beyond the US to Asia and Europe, Bloomberg report says. A UBS basket of European companies seen as vulnerable to AI disruption fell another 2.1% after dropping 8% a day earlier. Shares of companies such as SAP SE and Sage Group Plc continued to decline.",A sharp selloff in global stock markets wiped out about $285 billion in market value in a single day after Anthropic launched its new AI tool called the 'SaaSpocalypse' America's biggest bank JPMorgan said the fall reflects a deeper shift in how investors view software companies.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127915781,imgsize-87978,width-400,resizemode-4/jpmorgan-to-investors-on-software-stocks-rout-we-are-now-in-an-environment-where-the-sector-isnt-.jpg"

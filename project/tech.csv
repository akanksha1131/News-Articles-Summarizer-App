Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, is aggressively recruiting top AI talent for his new superintelligence lab, using a curated document known as “The List” to target the industry’s brightest minds. According to the Wall Street Journal, ""The recruits on ‘The List’ typically have PhDs from elite schools like Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon. As a report in WSJ said, ""The recruits on “The List” typically have Ph.D.s from elite schools like Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon. They have experience at places like OpenAI in San Francisco and Google DeepMind in London. They are usually in their 20s and 30s—and they all know each other. They spend their days staring at screens to solve the kinds of inscrutable problems that require spectacular amounts of computing power.""Zuckerberg has personally spearheaded the recruitment, diving into technical papers and strategizing with two Meta executives in a group chat dubbed “Recruiting Party” to discuss hundreds of candidates and outreach methods, such as email, text, or WhatsApp. The List prioritizes candidates with PhDs in AI-related fields, experience at leading labs, and significant contributions to AI breakthroughs. Meta’s recent hire, an algorithm design enthusiast, exemplifies the profile. The people who get notes from Zuckerberg reportedly have a few things in common: They need to know calculus, linear algebra and probability theory, like one of Meta’s recent hires, who says he’s fascinated by algorithm design.The AI community is tight-knit, with researchers forming Slack and Discord groups to share and discuss job offers, often leveraging competing offers to boost their value. Two sources familiar with these groups confirmed this practice. Meta has targeted dozens of OpenAI researchers, intensifying the Silicon Valley talent race.Leading Zuckerberg’s superintelligence team is 28-year-old Alexandr Wang, a New Mexico native and son of Chinese immigrant physicists. Meta recently invested $14 billion in Wang’s company, Scale AI, making him one of the most expensive hires in history. Meta has also reportedly made offers to dozens of researchers at OpenAI. This is said to have forced OPenAI to change its compensation structure. Not just this, the company's CTO also sent an open letter to employees asking them not to fall for Zuckerberg’s offer. The company also shut down for almost a week.OpenAI's ex-CTO Mira Murati too has said that Mark Zuckerberg has also offered engineers in her company multi-million-dollar packages, but not even a single employee has so far accepted the offer.","Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, is aggressively recruiting top AI talent for his new superintelligence lab.

"Apple sees best week since July 2020, reason is CEO Tim Cook in ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-sees-best-week-since-july-2020-reason-is-ceo-tim-cook-in-/articleshow/123209760.cms,"FILE - Apple CEO Tim Cook and President Donald Trump shake hands during a tour of an Apple manufacturing plant, Nov. 20, 2019, in Austin. (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci, File)

Apple’s stock soared 13% this week, marking its largest weekly gain since July 2020, driven by a high-profile White House appearance byApple CEO Tim Cook alongside President Donald Trump. Yes, and also on the back of the company's robust quarterly earnings. The iPhone maker’s shares climbed 4% on Friday (August 8) alone, closing at $229.35 per share, boosting Apple’s market capitalization by over $400 billion to a staggering $3.4 trillion.The jump in Apple stock has been triggered by CEO Cook's visit to White House on Wednesday (August 6) this week. Tim Cook joined Trump at the White House to unveil Apple’s ambitious commitment to invest $100 billion in American companies and domestically produced components over the next four years. A key focus of the announcement was Apple’s plan to increase its procurement of America-made chips, a move that aligns with President Trump’s push for domestic manufacturing. During the public meeting, Trump praised Apple’s initiative, declaring that the company’s U.S. investments would exempt it from proposed tariffs that could double the cost of imported chips. This assurance alleviated investor concerns about potential financial headwinds from Trump’s trade policies, which had loomed over Apple for months.A rally for Apple led Wall Street higher on Wednesday as U.S. stocks reclaimed more of their sharp losses from last week. The S&P 500 rose 0.7%. Apple alone accounted for more than a third of the S&P 500’s gain. It rose 5.1% ahead of a White House event where it announced an additional $100 billion over the next four years.During its earning call last week, Apple had cautioned that it anticipated over $1 billion in tariff-related costs for the current quarter if no exemptions were granted. The White House agreement significantly mitigates this risk, positioning Apple to maintain its profitability while strengthening its domestic supply chain. “Apple and Tim Cook delivered a masterclass in managing uncertainty,” wrote JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee in a note, as reported by CNBC. “After months of overhang from potential tariff challenges, this strategic alignment with U.S. priorities is a game-changer.”The market’s enthusiasm was further fueled by Apple’s strong financial performance. Two weeks ago, the company reported a stellar June quarter, with overall revenue surging 10% year-over-year to $94.9 billion, surpassing Wall Street expectations. iPhone sales, a cornerstone of Apple’s business, grew 13% to $46.2 billion, driven by robust demand for the iPhone 15 series and expanding market share in emerging regions like India and Southeast Asia. The services segment, including Apple Music and iCloud, also contributed significantly, posting a 14% revenue increase to $24.2 billion, underscoring Apple’s successful pivot toward high-margin, recurring-revenue streams.Beyond tariffs and earnings, Apple’s stock rally reflects growing investor confidence in its long-term strategy. The company’s focus on American manufacturing could bolster its resilience against global supply chain disruptions, while its innovation pipeline—spanning augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and health-focused wearables—continues to excite analysts. Additionally, Apple’s recent expansion of its U.S. workforce, with plans to create 20,000 jobs by 2028, further aligns with national economic priorities.","Apple's stock soared 13% this week, marking its largest weekly gain since July 2020.

President Donald Trump demanded the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, calling him ""highly conflicted"" after Senator Tom Cotton raised three critical questions about the executive's investments in Chinese firms linked to the People's Liberation Army.Trump posted on Truth Social, sending Intel shares down nearly 3%. Cotton's letter to Intel's board, sent just one day before Trump's demand, revealed that Tanwith at least eight companies having ties to the Chinese People's Liberation Army.Cotton's August 5 letter posed three specific questions that appear to have triggered Trump's response:Cotton requested Intel's response by August 15, 2025, citing transparency and national security concerns.Cotton wrote, emphasizing Intel's responsibility as a steward of taxpayer dollars.

“strategic mistake”

India Overtakes China in US Smartphone Exports | Apple’s Big Move

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently visited the White House to personally lobby US President Donald Trump, a report claims. This visit has reportedly led to the US Commerce Department beginning to issue licenses for the H20 AI chips, which are designed specifically for China. The move follows weeks of inaction by the US government. According to a report by the Financial Times, a US official has confirmed that the Bureau of Industry and Security, which manages export controls within the Commerce Department, has now started issuing the licenses for the H20 chip after Huang’s visit. Nvidia developed this chip specifically for the Chinese market after the Biden administration imposed export controls on more advanced AI chips.In April, the Trump administration had initially taken a stricter stance, telling Nvidia it could not sell the H20 to China. However, after Huang visited the White House and lobbied directly with the president, this position may have reversed. The report also cited sources familiar with the decision to claim that the Commerce Department began issuing licenses just two days after Huang met with Trump in the Oval Office.Nvidia’s H20 AI chips have become a point of contention between US security officials, who claimed that permitting their sales to China could strengthen its military. Meanwhile, Nvidia argued that restricting US technology exports pushes China to develop its own capabilities faster.A previous FT report claimed that 20 security specialists — including Matt Pottinger, former deputy national security adviser under the first Trump administration, and David Feith, who served on the National Security Council earlier this year — sent a letter to the US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick urging him to block H20 sales to China.In their letter, the security officials described the move as athat could undermine the United States’ economic and military position in artificial intelligence. Nvidia called the criticism “misguided” and disagreed with claims that China could use the H20 to strengthen its military programs.In the July quarter, Nvidia lost $4.5 billion and missed an additional $2.5 billion in sales after the US imposed a licensing requirement on AI chip exports to China. The rule, which Nvidia had not anticipated, was seen as effectively halting its legal chip sales in a market Huang projects could reach $50 billion within three years. The company had also forecasted a $8 billion revenue hit from China for the quarter.However, Nvidia is considering developing a redesigned AI chip for China that complies with new US export rules. Huang has warned that the restrictions could give companies like Huawei an advantage in the global AI hardware race.Nvidia’s market share in this segment has already fallen from 95% to 50% over the past four years as Chinese competitors advanced, which Huang in May called a “failure” of US export policy.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently visited the White House to personally lobby US President Donald Trump, a report claims.

Poll Can AI help solve Japan’s population decline issue? No, social policies and reforms are more important Yes, AI can support and ease the impact

Why this didn’t start yesterday: deep causes of Japan’s demographic decline



Japan’s demographic trajectory is the result of multiple, long-running structural factors:

Low fertility: decades of fertility rates below the replacement level (≈2.1 children per woman), driven by economic insecurity, high housing and childcare costs, and changing social norms.

Rapid ageing: a large baby-boom cohort moving into retirement combined with high life expectancy.

Delay or avoidance of marriage/childbearing: many younger adults delay relationships or choose smaller families for economic and lifestyle reasons.

Labour and gender dynamics: persistent workplace expectations and limited family-friendly policies historically constrained people’s ability to combine work and childrearing.

How Elon Musk views Japan’s demographic decline



Family support policies: targeted childcare, affordable early-education, paid parental leave and housing incentives.

Gender-equal labour reforms: flexible work, stronger protections for working parents, and removing career penalties for caregiving.

Immigration and integration policies: addressing immediate labour shortages while building social cohesion.

Automation and AI deployment: sensible use of technology to raise productivity and ease elderly care burdens — but paired with social policy to support families.

India Overtakes China in US Smartphone Exports | Apple’s Big Move

A group of senators has raised concerns that Google may be negotiating a settlement in a censorship lawsuit with former President Donald Trump in exchange for favourable treatment from his administration. For this, the group of Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren and independent Senator Bernie Sanders, has written a letter sent to Google CEO Sundar Pichai and YouTube CEO Neal Mohan , questioning whether discussions with Trump's legal team have included such a possibility.The lawsuit stems from Trump's claims of unlawful censorship after his accounts were suspended from social media platforms following the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. The senators' letter cited a court filing from May that indicated lawyers for both YouTube and Trump were “engaged in productive discussions” and had requested a delay in a court hearing until September 8.“We are concerned about the possibility that Google could settle the lawsuit against YouTube in a quid-pro-quo arrangement to avoid full accountability for violating federal competition, consumer protection, and labor laws,” the letter states.The senators added that such an arrangement could potentially violate federal bribery laws .They highlighted Google's vast interests in federal policy, from tax to environmental regulations, suggesting the company could be seeking outcomes favourable to its business. The letter also noted that both X (formerly Twitter) and Meta (formerly Facebook) have already settled similar lawsuits with Trump this year, for approximately $10 million and $25 million, respectively.“The company has substantial interests in almost every aspect of the federal government, from tax policy to energy and environmental policy, and much more,” they wrote.“Google stands to benefit from how the federal government proceeds in these matters, and Google may settle this lawsuit in the hopes of securing outcomes favorable to the company,” the Senators said in the letter.The lawmakers pointed to Google's existing legal challenges, including a major antitrust case with the Department of Justice that could lead to the company being broken up. They also mentioned several open cases with the National Labor Relations Board concerning alleged unfair labor practices.","A group of senators has raised concerns that Google may be negotiating a settlement in a censorship lawsuit with former President Donald Trump.

He stated that “Betting against Elon is like betting against Steve Jobs (Apple founder)”. Responding to the comments, the Tesla CEO acknowledged that while the valuation is possible, it may require ‘extreme execution’.“Extreme execution is needed, but a valuation of $20 trillion for Tesla is possible,” Elon Musk wrote, quoting a post on X (formerly Twitter).Notably, this comes days after Elon Musk warned of ‘few rough quarters’ for Tesla following the expiration of the US tax credit for EVs. In an earnings conference call with analysts and investors this week, the tech billionaire said “We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the US.”Continuing further, he said “We probably could have a few rough quarters. I'm not saying we will, but we could”. “But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling,” Musk added.The EV maker reported a drop in profit for the third quarter in a row, with earnings falling to $1.17 billion, or 33 cents per share, down from $1.4 billion, or 40 cents per share, during the same period last year.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 40 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the April to June quarter also declined — from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion — but still came in slightly higher than analysts had forecast.During the earnings calls, Elon Musk was asked about whether he would want more than his current 13% stake in Tesla to keep control. To this, Musk said he did want more but not too much.“I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction,” he said, “but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”","Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation.

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world. Speaking during an event hosted by the All-In Podcast team and a consortium of tech leaders and lawmakers known as the Hill and Valley Forum, Huang discussed the scale of impact that small, focused teams of AI researchers can have and how Nvidia’s success has translated into significant financial rewards for those in leadership. “I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.” Jensen Huang said. He was responding to a question on the effectiveness and value of smaller AI teams.“But the important big idea is that the impact of 150 or so AI researchers, with funding behind them, can probably create,” he noted. Jensen Huang gave examples of OpenAI which originally started with around 150 employees and China’s DeepSeek which also has a similar workforce.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang added that there's something unique about well-structured, mid-sized teams when given the right resources. “That’s not a small team. That’s a good-size team with the right infrastructure… If you're willing to pay, say, $20 billion, $30 billion to buy a startup with 150 AI researchers, why wouldn't you pay one?”During the interview, the Nvidia CEO also addressed reports that he personally rewards high-performing employees with surprise stock options and RSUs (Restricted Stock Units). When asked if he actually does carry stock options, Jensen Huang joked “Yeah, I'm carrying it in my pocket right now.”He then explained that he takes a hands-on approach to compensation across the company. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day… when they present it, and they send me everybody’s recommended comp, I go through the whole company. I’ve got my methods of doing that, and I use machine learning. I sort through all 42,000 employees.”“100% of the time, I increased the company’s spend on OpEx [operating expenses].

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved from a futuristic concept to an everyday necessity, influencing industries ranging from healthcare and finance to entertainment and communication. It automates routine tasks, enhances productivity, and fuels innovations like ChatGPT, AI-driven translation services, and virtual gaming experiences.The growth of AI has also created a new class of billionaires, some of whom have built companies from scratch, while others have pivoted established businesses toward AI-driven opportunities. Backed by massive investments from Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and other global players, these individuals represent the cutting edge of technology and entrepreneurship. From Jensen Huang’s hardware empire to Alexandr Wang’s data infrastructure solutions, and from Sam Altman’s AI innovation to Yao Runhao’s virtual gaming platforms, these billionaires illustrate how AI is reshaping industries and redefining entrepreneurship.Source: ForbesJensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of Nvidia, sits at the top of the AI billionaire list with an astonishing $113 billion (£151 billion) net worth. Nvidia initially focused on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming and professional visualization. However, as AI adoption accelerated, these GPUs became the standard for training and running large language models like ChatGPT and Meta AI.Huang’s strategic vision transformed Nvidia into the backbone of the AI industry. In July 2025, the company reached an unprecedented $4 trillion valuation, reflecting how central its hardware is to AI infrastructure. Owning 3% of Nvidia, Huang’s wealth grew by over 300% in just one year, making him one of the top 20 richest individuals worldwide.At just 26 years old, Alexandr Wang has secured his place as the youngest self-made billionaire in the AI sector. He founded Scale AI at the age of 19, after dropping out of MIT, to focus on providing data labeling and annotation services essential for AI training.Scale AI works with over 300 high-profile clients, including Meta, Google, and General Motors, supplying the data infrastructure required to build machine learning models. The company’s valuation reached $14 billion (£10.5 billion) in 2024, and Wang’s 14% ownership stake boosted his net worth to $2.7 billion (£3.6 billion). His success highlights how even niche AI services can yield massive fortunes.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is one of the most prominent faces in artificial intelligence. While OpenAI itself is valued at around $300 billion (£225 billion), Altman does not personally hold equity in the company. His wealth, estimated at $1.9 billion (£1.4 billion), stems from early investments in companies like Stripe, Reddit, and Helion Energy, combined with the success of his previous startup, Loopt, which he sold for $42 million in 2012.Altman’s leadership at OpenAI popularized generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT, setting global trends in how businesses and consumers interact with AI. His influence extends beyond wealth, positioning him as one of the key thought leaders shaping AI’s future.Phil Shawe, co-CEO of TransPerfect, built one of the world’s largest translation and localization companies by leveraging AI-powered language processing. TransPerfect offers services across industries like law, healthcare, gaming, and entertainment, helping businesses operate in multiple languages with enhanced accuracy and efficiency.Founded in 1992 from a dorm room at New York University, TransPerfect generated $1.3 billion (£976 million) in revenue in 2024. Shawe owns 99% of the company, securing a personal fortune of $1.8 billion (£1.3 billion). His journey shows how AI technology can transform even traditional industries like language services into billion-dollar enterprises.Dario Amodei, a former vice president of research at OpenAI, left to co-found Anthropic in 2021. His company focuses on building safe, reliable AI systems using reinforcement learning techniques that allow AI models to adapt through human feedback.Anthropic’s approach to ethical AI and safety-first principles resonated with investors and industry leaders, pushing the company’s valuation to $61.5 billion (£46.2 billion) by 2025. Amodei’s net worth has reached $1.2 billion (£901 million), proving that prioritizing responsibility in AI development can be both impactful and profitable.Liang Wenfeng, once largely unknown outside China, made headlines with DeepSeek-R1, a large language model that outperformed ChatGPT on certain benchmarks while being five times cheaper to run. This innovation shook global markets, causing Nvidia’s stock to drop 17% in a single day as investors reacted to the potential shift in AI computing costs.Wenfeng previously founded a successful hedge fund, and he used his financial expertise to build DeepSeek into one of the most cost-efficient AI providers globally. His net worth now stands at $1 billion (£751 million), making him a key figure in China’s growing AI industry.Yao Runhao, CEO of Paper Games, has carved out a unique niche by combining AI with gaming. His company’s hit product, Love and Deepspace, uses artificial intelligence to create virtual dating simulations with interactive, personalized storylines.The game attracts over six million monthly users, showcasing the demand for AI-driven entertainment. Paper Games employs around 2,000 staff and focuses primarily on the female gaming market in China, highlighting how AI is revolutionizing interactive leisure experiences.

Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India, marking another step in its long-term strategy to strengthen its footprint in emerging markets. During Apple’s latest earnings announcement, CEO Tim Cook confirmed plans to open multiple new Apple Stores in India before the year ends. The move comes as part of a broader global expansion plan that also includes fresh Apple retail outlets in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the launch of the Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia. Cook highlighted that these new physical stores are a key step in improving Apple’s customer experience, product accessibility, and service reach in high-growth regions like India.“We recently launched the Apple Store online in Saudi Arabia, and we couldn’t be more excited to open new stores in the UAE and India later this year,” Cook stated. “We were also delighted to welcome customers in Japan to a new location in the heart of Osaka.”According to Apple Magazine, four new stores are scheduled to open across key metropolitan cities in India, namely Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, and the Delhi NCR region. These new outlets will build on Apple’s successful retail debut in India in 2023, which saw the launch of Apple BKC in Mumbai and Apple Saket in Delhi. These initial stores have quickly become major crowd-pullers, especially during new iPhone release events, and have demonstrated the value of physical retail locations in India’s fast-growing premium smartphone market.To support this retail growth, Apple has been actively hiring talent for its upcoming stores. Earlier this year, Apple Store leader John Taffe shared on LinkedIn that Apple was looking for passionate and skilled individuals to join its retail team. “Apple’s journey in India has been incredible, and we’re thrilled to continue growing in these vibrant cities. To make these new stores a success, we’re looking for passionate and talented individuals to join our team,” Taffe noted. This hiring drive highlights Apple’s commitment to not only selling products but also delivering personalised customer experiences and creating jobs within the Indian retail sector.While India remains a critical market, Apple is expanding its retail network globally. Apart from its Indian plans, the company has announced new retail locations in the UAE, including a store in Al Ain, which will add to its existing four UAE outlets (two in Abu Dhabi and two in Dubai). The Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia further emphasizes Apple’s growing focus on the Middle East.These international retail initiatives aim to strengthen Apple’s customer reach and brand experience beyond its digital ecosystem. Apple’s global retail growth is supported by its strong financial results. In its April–June quarter (Q3), Apple reported a 13% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales, showcasing robust demand even in challenging economic conditions. This financial strength gives Apple the confidence to invest heavily in physical stores in markets like India, where premium smartphone adoption is rapidly increasing.India has emerged as one of Apple’s most important growth markets, driven by rising disposable incomes, expanding smartphone penetration, and a growing preference for premium devices. The launch of Apple BKC and Apple Saket in 2023 marked the company’s first direct retail presence in the country, and the overwhelming customer response has paved the way for more stores. Apple’s upcoming four new stores signal a long-term commitment to India, where it faces strong competition from brands like Samsung and OnePlus. However, Apple’s focus on a seamless retail experience and exclusive customer service could help it capture a larger market share in the premium category.",Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shifted from being a futuristic concept to a rapidly evolving reality impacting every industry. With advanced machine learning models, automation systems, and AI-powered decision-making tools, tasks once performed by humans are now handled with speed and precision by algorithms. This has triggered global concern about potential job losses. Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has admitted that automation will reduce certain jobs within the company. Similarly, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that AI will impact “everybody’s jobs” in some capacity, although he expects it to also create new opportunities. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predicts the most dramatic changes will occur within the next five to ten years, transforming entire job markets.When asked about the possibility of artificial general intelligence (AGI) performing all human tasks, DeepMind CEO Hassabis highlighted an important distinction:AI could analyse medical data, scans, and test results faster and more accurately than human doctors, potentially replacing or assisting in diagnosis and treatment planning.Nurses, however, provide emotional support, physical care, and human empathy that technology can’t replicate. A robotic nurse may be efficient but lacks the ability to emotionally connect with patients, a critical part of caregiving.This example shows that while AI in healthcare may replace certain intellectual tasks, professions relying on emotional intelligence will remain human-centered. This statement from Hassabis offers one of the clearest examples of how AI will alter specific professions, but not eliminate the need for human empathy and interpersonal care.According to Hassabis, the workplace of the future will integrate humans and AI collaboratively. AI will handle data-heavy, repetitive, and analytical processes, allowing humans to focus on creative problem-solving, emotional interaction, and leadership roles. This shift will require governments and industries to invest heavily in reskilling programs to prepare workers for AI-driven environments, emphasizing lifelong learning, adaptive skills, ethical AI usage, and the development of new interdisciplinary roles bridging technology, creativity, and human-centric decision-making.Andy Jassy’s remarks highlight a future where AI automation tools replace repetitive and operational tasks. Amazon already relies on robotics and intelligent software to manage logistics, inventory, and supply chain processes. Jassy believes that as these technologies mature, fewer human workers will be required for jobs like order processing and warehouse management. However, he noted that the shift doesn’t necessarily mean fewer opportunities overall but rather a need for upskilling and reskilling so employees can transition into more technology-driven roles.Jensen Huang, whose company Nvidia provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) powering modern AI systems, offered a candid view on AI’s impact:“Everybody’s jobs will be affected. Some jobs will be lost. Many jobs will be created.” Huang believes AI’s productivity gains will help industries perform tasks faster and cheaper, which may reduce demand for certain roles but open new ones focused on AI development, data analysis, and advanced engineering. He expressed hope that economic growth from AI adoption will ultimately “lift society” rather than harm it.Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind and a key architect of advanced AI systems, views AI as an additive rather than purely disruptive technology. He explained that as AI capabilities expand, new job categories will emerge—roles that use AI to enhance human output rather than replace it entirely. Historically, technological revolutions (like industrial machines or computers) displaced certain jobs but also created industries that didn’t exist before. Hassabis believes this trend will continue:“New jobs will be created that are actually better, that utilise these tools or new technologies.”AI can handle data analysis, diagnostics, and treatment recommendations faster than humans, but doctors will still oversee complex decision-making and patient care.Nursing requires emotional support, hands-on care, and human empathy—qualities that machines and robots cannot replicate effectively.He predicts massive workplace changes within 5–10 years, with some jobs disappearing and new ones emerging.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expects automation to cut some jobs, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI will affect “everybody’s jobs” but also create new opportunities.Roles focused on AI development, creative problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and advanced data management are expected to increase.",Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce.

AI in film, useful but not creative replacement



A moral through-line from Terminator to Hiroshima

Acclaimed filmmaker James Cameron has raised urgent concerns about the growing role of artificial intelligence in modern weaponry, particularly nuclear systems, warning that its unchecked integration could plunge humanity into a “Terminator-style apocalypse.” In a recent Rolling Stone interview promoting his upcoming film adaptation of Ghosts of Hiroshima, Cameron highlighted the peril of rapid-response military environments where decision-making speeds may surpass human capacity. He cautioned that even having a “human in the loop” may not be enough to prevent catastrophic errors, urging world leaders to implement strict safeguards and act swiftly to avoid consequences comparable to a nuclear disaster.Cameron emphasised that humanity now faces three concurrent existential crises: climate change and environmental degradation, nuclear proliferation, and super-intelligent AI. He noted that all three are “manifesting and peaking at the same time,” creating a level of risk unlike any previous period in history. His warning echoes recent findings, such as a Stanford survey where 36% of AI researchers believed AI could trigger a “nuclear-level catastrophe,” and conclusions from a University of Chicago summit envisioning the near inevitability of AI pairing with nuclear systems.Despite his concerns about AI’s role in weaponry, Cameron supports its limited and intentional use in filmmaking, particularly for tasks like visual effects, where it can halve production costs without reducing artistic staffing. In 2024, he joined Stability AI’s board and has voiced optimism that generative tools can accelerate creative workflows. However, he stands firm in his belief that AI cannot replace screenwriters or actors. “You have to be human to write something that moves an audience,” Cameron said, dismissing AI-generated scripts as emotionally hollow ""word salad.""Cameron’s warnings are grounded in decades-long themes from his body of work, including The Terminator’s portrayal of an AI-dominated apocalypse and his longstanding fascination with nuclear threats. His upcoming Ghosts of Hiroshima project continues this through-line. He hopes the film not only chronicles humanity’s darkest moments but also inspires empathy and introspection. “If I do my job perfectly,” he said, “everybody will walk out of the theatre in horror after the first 20 minutes. But then they’ll care.”","James Cameron has raised urgent concerns about the growing role of artificial intelligence in modern weaponry, particularly nuclear systems.

AI misinformation risks



A global conversation about AI responsibility

A 60-year-old man in New York was hospitalised after following a strict salt-reduction regimen suggested by ChatGPT. According to doctors, the man abruptly cut sodium from his diet to nearly zero over several weeks, leading to dangerously low sodium levels, a condition known as hyponatraemia . His family said he relied on an AI-generated health plan without consulting a physician. The case, recently published in the American College of Physicians journal, highlights the risks of applying AI health advice without professional oversight, particularly when it involves essential nutrients like sodium. The man recovered after spending three weeks in hospital.According to the report, the man asked ChatGPT how to eliminate sodium chloride (commonly known as table salt) from his diet. The AI tool suggested sodium bromide as an alternative, a compound once used in early 20th-century medicines but now recognised as toxic in large doses. Acting on this advice, the man purchased sodium bromide online and used it in his cooking for three months.With no previous history of mental or physical illness, the man began experiencing hallucinations, paranoia, and extreme thirst. Upon hospital admission, he displayed confusion and even refused water, fearing contamination. Doctors diagnosed him with bromide toxicity, a condition now almost unheard of but once common when bromide was prescribed for anxiety, insomnia, and other ailments. He also exhibited neurological symptoms, acne-like skin eruptions, and distinctive red spots known as cherry angiomas, all classic signs of bromism.Hospital treatment focused on rehydration and restoring electrolyte balance. Over the course of three weeks, the man’s condition gradually improved, and he was discharged once his sodium and chloride levels returned to normal.The authors of the case study stressed the growing risk of health misinformation from AI tools. “It is important to consider that ChatGPT and other AI systems can generate scientific inaccuracies, cannot critically discuss results, and ultimately fuel the spread of misinformation,” the report warned. OpenAI , ChatGPT’s developer, explicitly states in its Terms of Use: “You should not rely on Output from our Services as a sole source of truth or factual information, or as a substitute for professional advice.” The terms also clarify that the service is not intended for diagnosing or treating medical conditions.This case highlights the urgent need for critical thinking when interpreting AI-generated advice, especially in matters involving health. Experts say AI tools can be valuable for general information but should never replace professional consultation. As AI adoption grows, so too does the responsibility to ensure that its outputs are accurate, safe, and clearly understood by the public.","A 60-year-old man in New York was hospitalised after following a strict salt- reduction regimen suggested by ChatGPT.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dismissed its lawsuit against Ripple Labs . With this, the US government agency has ended one of the cryptocurrency industry's most high-profile legal battles. However, the resolution still leaves a $125 million fine against Ripple intact. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Ripple and the SEC have agreed to dismiss their appeals of the fine and an injunction imposed by US District Judge Analisa Torres. The injunction barred Ripple from selling its XRP token to institutional investors. As per CoinMarketCap market data, XRP ranks as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, behind Bitcoin and Ethereum.In 2020, the SEC sued Ripple, alleging that the company sold XRP tokens without registering them as securities, which was during the final weeks of US President Donald Trump’s first term. However, in a mixed verdict in July 2023, Judge Torres ruled that XRP qualified as a security when sold to institutional investors but not when sold on public exchanges. She imposed a $125 million fine in August 2024.After Trump’s re-election, a more crypto-friendly SEC began pulling back from specific enforcement actions, the Reuters report claims. Together with Ripple, it petitioned Torres to lift the injunction and reduce the fine to $50 million.Torres rejected the request, stating that neither party demonstrated “exceptional circumstances” sufficient to outweigh the public interest in enforcing the injunction and full fine, Reuters added.The report confirms that the SEC has now confirmed that the dismissal of appeals means both the injunction and $125 million penalty remain in place.Meanwhile, Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty , even took to the social media platform X (earlier Twitter) that the dismissals mark “the end” of the case. He wrote:Since Trump’s return to the White House, the SEC has also dropped multiple civil lawsuits against other major crypto exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken, the report continues.","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dismissed its lawsuit against Ripple Labs. With this, the US government agency has ended one of the cryptocurrency industry's most high-profile legal battles. However, the resolution still leaves a $125 million fine against Ripple intact.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123200492,imgsize-88516,width-400,resizemode-4/Ripple-to-pay-125-million-fine-as-US-dismisses-one-of-the-biggest-cryptocurrency-lawsuits.jpg"

Saiyaara team turned to ChatGPT for the perfect ending

Blockbuster Debut! 'Saiyaara' Opens with ₹20 Cr, Ahaan Panday Shines

The AI-generated ending that almost happened



Why the filmmakers chose a different path



When filmmakers work on a movie’s ending, they usually turn to seasoned screenwriters, story editors, and creative consultants. But for Saiyaara , an unexpected “team member” briefly joined the process — ChatGPT. The AI chatbot, known for writing everything from poems to press releases, was asked to suggest a possible ending for the romantic drama. While AI tools have been used in marketing and promotions, their role in shaping the climax of a major Bollywood film is still rare. The experiment sparked excitement in the writing room, but also raised questions. Could an AI-written ending truly capture the emotion, pacing, and cultural depth the story demanded? And more importantly, would the filmmakers actually use it?The Saiyaara team had been debating how to close the film for weeks. Multiple versions were drafted, but none seemed to hit the perfect balance between drama and realism. As a creative exercise, one of the assistant writers suggested asking ChatGPT for ideas. The team entered a detailed prompt outlining the characters’ journeys, emotional stakes, and the conflicts leading up to the climax. Within seconds, ChatGPT generated three different endings: each written in polished, dialogue-heavy scenes.One of ChatGPT’s versions immediately caught the team’s attention. It suggested a bittersweet conclusion where the lead couple part ways at the train station, exchanging a final smile before boarding different trains. The idea mirrored classic Bollywood romance tropes while keeping a modern, understated tone. Some team members felt the AI ending had a surprising emotional pull, especially considering it came from a machine that had never experienced love or heartbreak.Despite its appeal, the AI’s version didn’t make it to the final cut. The director explained that while ChatGPT’s scene was “technically sound,” it lacked the subtle cultural nuances and emotional buildup the story needed. The team also felt that relying on AI for such a crucial moment might overshadow the human storytelling that Bollywood thrives on. Instead, they chose an ending that kept the emotional intensity but deepened character arcs in a way that felt more authentic to the narrative they had built from day one.","Saiyaara team turned to ChatGPT for the perfect ending.

“If you take care of people, everything else takes care of itself,”

he explained.

It's a strategy that has worked well for the company’s leadership as well. A recent surge in its stock price pushed three of Nvidia’s board members into the billionaire club, and last fall, Huang made his debut on Forbes’s list of the world’s top 10 wealthiest individuals. He also claimed that he seeks to compensate all his workers handsomely.

“I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.”

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on how small teams can ‘create wonders’ if given right funding



“But the important big idea is that the impact of 150 or so AI researchers, with funding behind them, can probably create,”

“That’s not a small team. That’s a good-sized team with the right infrastructure… If you're willing to pay, say, $20 billion, $30 billion to buy a startup with 150 AI researchers, why wouldn't you pay one?”

“Additionally, its 48V electrical architecture provides superior power and efficiency, a feature that rivals are only beginning to develop. Extensive internet searches and industry outreach by [redacted] found no vehicles with features comparable to those of the Cybertruck,”

The US Air Force is looking to acquire two Tesla Cybertrucks to use as targets for precision missiles during testing and training. The Air Force Test Centre (AFTC) needs these specific vehicles due to the possibility of ""unspecified adversaries"" using them in the coming days. According to online contracting documents (as seen by The War Zone), the Cybertrucks are part of a larger purchase of 33 target vehicles the AFTC is looking to have delivered to the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) in New Mexico. The document explained: “Market research was conducted to assess the competition for the Tesla Cybertruck by evaluating its design, materials, impact resistance, and innovative technologies. The study revealed that the Cybertruck’s aggressively angular and futuristic design, paired with its unpainted stainless steel exoskeleton, sets it apart from competitors typically using painted steel or aluminium bodies.” The AFTC's shopping list also includes other sedans, bongo trucks, pickups, and SUVs, though without specific brand requirements.As per the contract documents, the US Air Force explicitly requires Cybertrucks that don’t need to be in working condition, but must be capable of being roll-towed behind another vehicle. The Cybertrucks should also be delivered with all fluids drained.In the documents, the US Air Force wrote that itthe document added.The report also claimed that the primary purpose of all these vehicles is to support the US Special Operations Command’s (SOCOM) Stand Off Precision Guided Munitions (SOPGM) program and related training. This program includes various air-launched precision-guided missiles like the AGM-114 Hellfire and the GBU-69/B Small Glide Munition (SGM).The Cybertruck is known for its bullet-resistant design, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made ""apocalypse-proof"" claims for the vehicle. However, it has faced criticism over performance, safety, build quality, and ownership terms. Despite its $80,000 price tag, it has seen recalls, controversies, and reports of declining sales.","US Air Force is looking to acquire two Tesla Cybertrucks to use as targets for precision missiles during testing and training.

Oppo Pad SE | Budget Android Tablet with Practical Features

The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a series of cross-appeals from Google and other parties regarding a lower tribunal’s ruling. The appeals were also made by the antitrust watchdog, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and other parties like the Alliance Digital India Foundation. They challenge a March order from the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), which alleges that the tech giant abused its dominant position with its Play Store policies. According to a report by the Economic Times, the apex court has confirmed that it will hear the case in November.The appeals filed by Google and its related companies, which include Alphabet Inc, Google Ireland, Google India and Google India Digital Services, have challenged the NCLAT hearing that mostly aligned with CCI’s findings of the company abusing its dominant position in multiple markets in the Android mobile device ecosystem through its Play Store policies and engaged in unfair promotion of Google Pay, thereby violating Section 4(2)(e) of the Competition Act.Apart from this, Google is also appealing an NCLAT order from May that corrected a previous ""inadvertent error"". This corrected order reinstated two key directives from the CCI, mandating that the company disclose its data policies and stop using billing data for competitive gain.In October 2020, CCI imposed a penalty on Google, accusing it of abusing its dominant position in segments such as online search and the Android app store. The watchdog fined the company Rs 936 crore for enforcing the use of its Google Play Billing System for app-related purchases, while exempting its apps like YouTube from similar charges. The CCI also instructed Google to stop these practices and allow third-party billing options to ensure greater data transparency.The appellate tribunal later upheld the CCI’s finding that Google imposed unfair and discriminatory conditions on developers by mandating the use of its billing system for paid apps and in-app purchases.However, it dismissed conclusions around the denial of market access and stifling innovation. The tribunal noted that Google's billing services made up less than 1% of UPI transactions, and said there wasn’t enough evidence to prove it blocked market access or hindered technical growth.Additionally, the penalty was revised down from Rs 936.44 crore to Rs 216.69 crore, restricting it to revenues linked directly to the Play Store instead of Google's global earnings. The tribunal also dismissed certain aspects of the CCI’s findings, which are now under challenge in the Supreme Court.Meanwhile, several Indian startups and industry bodies — including People Interactive India (Shaadi.com), Mebigo Labs (Kuku FM), the Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation, and the Indian Digital Media Industry Foundation — had further urged the CCI to investigate Google’s practices.","The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a series of cross-appeals from Google and other parties regarding a lower tribunal’s ruling.

The New AI hierarchy

Prediction markets have delivered a swift and brutal verdict on OpenAI's GPT-5 launch, with Google now commanding a commanding 77% probability of having the best AI model by month's end on Polymarket. The shift is nothing short of dramatic: Before Thursday's demo (August 7), OpenAI was sitting pretty at around 80% odds while Google trailed at a distant 20%. By the time Sam Altman finished his presentation, those numbers had completely flipped. Turns out, traders weren't buying what OpenAI was selling.The timing couldn't be more striking. As GPT-5's livestream was ongoing on Thursday, Polymarket odds flipped in real time, OpenAI started with around 80% probability and ended below 20%, while Google surged from second place at 20% to capture an impressive 77% market confidence. This live market reaction essentially provided an unfiltered, real-money assessment of OpenAI's demonstration as it unfolded.The pre-launch hype had been considerable. Sam Altman had made bold predictions about GPT-5, asking audiences ""How many of you still think you're going to be smarter than GPT-5?"" and stating ""I don't think I'm going to be smarter than GPT-5."" He even compared going back to GPT-4 as feeling ""quite miserable,"" likening it to ""when the iPhone went from those giant-pixel old ones to the retina display.""The data reveals a sobering reality about AI progress: Even marginal improvements are harder to come by at the frontier. On Artificial Analysis's Intelligence Index, GPT-5 with maximum reasoning scored just 69, only one point higher than Grok 4's 68, two ahead of o3's 67, and four above Gemini 2.5 Pro's 65. When the gaps between leading models are measured in single digits, the race becomes less about breakthrough capabilities and more about incremental optimization.Google's betting market dominance stems from both current performance and strategic positioning. Gemini 2.5 Pro continues to lead the LMSys Chatbot Arena leaderboard, the specific benchmark used for Polymarket resolution, with style control disabled. This technical detail gives Google a structural edge that sophisticated traders have clearly recognized.More importantly, Google released Gemini 2.5 Pro five months ago in March, making it the oldest flagship model among current leaders and positioning the company as overdue for a major update. The betting markets essentially wagered that Google's development cycle and rumored Gemini 3.0 model could quickly respond to GPT-5's launch with superior capabilities.Google's broader AI ecosystem also provides competitive advantages. The company's custom TPU infrastructure, massive data resources, and integration with Search and other services create natural moats that pure-play AI companies struggle to replicate.When OpenAI's GPT-5 failed to deliver the revolutionary leap many expected, markets quickly pivoted to the next likely winner: Google.Current Polymarket odds paint a fascinating hierarchy that goes beyond marketing claims. Google's 77% probability towers over all competitors, while OpenAI has crashed to just 18%, a remarkable fall for the company that essentially created the modern AI race. xAI's Grok holds a modest 4% despite Musk's vocal promotion, tied with Anthropic's Claude at the same level.The betting data becomes even more telling when examining the also-rans. DeepSeek, despite recent advances in reasoning models and cost efficiency, registers minimal confidence below 1%. Other Chinese AI companies fare similarly poorly, suggesting markets remain skeptical about their ability to compete at the frontier level by year-end.These percentages go beyond just current capabilities, they signal informed speculation about development cycles, resource allocation, and competitive positioning. Google's overwhelming market confidence indicates traders believe the company has been strategically holding back superior models, waiting for the right moment to reclaim AI leadership.The resolution mechanism adds another analytical layer: these markets will be settled based on specific LMSys Chatbot Arena scores, where human preferences determine rankings. This means betting success depends not just on raw benchmark performance, but on creating models that feel genuinely better to use, a criterion where Google's current Gemini 2.5 Pro already excels.What emerges is a maturing AI landscape where the dramatic capability jumps of earlier generations may be giving way to more incremental competition. When betting markets can flip 60 percentage points during a single product demonstration, it suggests that the moats between leading AI companies remain surprisingly narrow, and that public confidence in who's ""winning"" can shift as rapidly as the market prices themselves. The real test will come in the next few weeks, as Google and other competitors respond to GPT-5 with their own model releases.",Prediction markets have delivered a swift and brutal verdict on OpenAI's GPT-5 launch. Google now commands a commanding 77% probability of having the best AI model by month's end on Polymarket. The shift is nothing short of dramatic: OpenAI was sitting pretty at around 80% while Google trailed at a distant 20%.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123190154,imgsize-1645860,width-400,resizemode-4/File-ChatGPT.jpg"

ChatGPT-5, the newest artificial intelligence language model from OpenAI, is not just another upgrade—it’s a significant leap in how AI-powered healthcare assistance can be delivered. Designed with enhanced understanding and precision, GPT-5 brings revolutionary features that aim to assist users with everyday medical concerns and even identify serious health conditions, such as cancer, based on natural language input.This development is especially important in regions where professional healthcare access is limited, delayed, or unaffordable. ChatGPT-5 is now being seen as a life-changing tool that brings AI-driven medical knowledge to users when they need it the most. Its advanced algorithms improve diagnostic accuracy, offer personalized health advice, and support early detection efforts, potentially saving countless lives worldwide. Moreover, it empowers both patients and healthcare providers with real-time insights, helping bridge critical gaps in medical services and education globally.One of the most impactful updates in GPT-5 is its enhanced focus on healthcare support. OpenAI recognized that many users already rely on ChatGPT for health-related guidance—from understanding symptoms to decoding complex reports. With this in mind, GPT-5 has been designed with more medical awareness, improving its ability to:This makes GPT-5 a powerful digital health assistant, especially for people who may feel overwhelmed or isolated when dealing with medical documents or sudden health scares.Among the standout capabilities of ChatGPT-5 is its potential to flag signs of serious illnesses such as cancer based on the user’s input. While GPT-5 cannot and should not replace medical diagnostics or treatment from licensed professionals, it can help users recognize red flags and encourage them to seek urgent care when necessary.For example, if a user describes symptoms like unexplained weight loss, chronic fatigue, or irregular bleeding, GPT-5 can analyze the context and suggest the possibility of a deeper concern that requires medical attention. This is especially beneficial in early detection, which can be critical in cases like cancer.ChatGPT-5 leads in AI healthcare with highest health evaluation scoresAt the official ChatGPT-5 launch event, streamed live worldwide, OpenAI revealed that GPT-5 achieved the highest health performance scores among all previous models. These results came from an internal benchmark test developed in collaboration with over 250 medical professionals, ensuring real-world relevance and clinical accuracy.This shows that GPT-5 is not just trained on medical terminology, but also on how to contextualize information in a way that’s relevant to the user’s concerns.During the launch, OpenAI featured a powerful story shared by Carolina, a woman diagnosed with three types of cancer in a single week. In the middle of an emotional storm, she turned to ChatGPT for clarity. She had just received a complex biopsy report and, in a moment of panic, pasted the contents into GPT.GPT-5 responded With:“That moment was really important,” she said. “By the time I spoke with my doctor three hours later, I already had a baseline understanding of what I was dealing with.”Throughout her treatment journey, Carolina continued to rely on GPT-5 to:This real-world example underscores how GPT-5 serves as a companion in critical healthcare moments, helping users stay informed, calm, and empowered.In many parts of the world, access to doctors or specialists is limited due to geography, cost, or infrastructure. In such places, AI health tools like ChatGPT-5 can bridge the gap by offering:This transforms GPT-5 into a virtual first-line assistant, guiding users to make better decisions about their health—especially when immediate medical attention is unavailable.While GPT-5’s healthcare capabilities are impressive, OpenAI has issued a clear disclaimer:ChatGPT-5 should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.It is best used as:It can enhance patient-clinician communication, but it cannot replace the human expertise of a qualified healthcare provider.","ChatGPT-5, the newest artificial intelligence language model from OpenAI, is now being seen as a life-changing tool that brings AI-driven medical knowledge to users when they need it the most.

Executive turnover across Elon Musk’s empire



Lily Lim to replace Robert Keele at xAI



Robert Keele, the top lawyer at Elon Musk ’s artificial intelligence company xAI, has resigned from this position. Keele stepped down after just over a year in the role, citing personal reasons and philosophical differences with Musk. Keele announced his decision to resign from xAI by sharing a post social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) and professional networking platform LinkedIn. “I love my two toddlers and I don’t get to see them enough. The job was a dream, the team, incredible. Working with Elon on this tech, at this time, was the adventure of a lifetime,” wrote Keele.In a post on X, Keele described his tenure at xAI as ""incredible"" and working with Musk as ""the adventure of a lifetime.

I may have also mentioned shoveling coal. Lulz.).”Keele’s resignation comes at a time when xAI is witnessing growth and also recently secured $6 billion funding. Despite the company’s momentum, Keele believes that he cannot keep “riding two horses at once — the family and the job.”Keele’s exit adds another name to the list of top executives resigning from Elon Musk-lead companies. Recently, X CEO Linda Yaccarino also resigned from her position and multiple senior level executives also stepped down from their roles at Tesla. Some analysts believe that it is Musk’s demanding leadership style and intense work expectations are the reasons behind this executive turnover.Robert Keele will be replaced by Lily Lim who is a former NASA engineer and has worked on spacecraft navigation for Venus mapping missions. Lim joined xAI in late 2024 as a privacy and IP specialist.","Robert Keele, the top lawyer at Elon Musk ’s artificial intelligence company xAI, has resigned from this position.

The cost of chasing startup success: 70-hour weeks and missed moments



Redefining the main meaning of success: From provider to present parent



The main truth about leadership: It starts at home



Also Read:

Cache Merrill , founder of the software startup Zibtek, spent years working 70-hour weeks to grow his business. Juggling client demands and late-night deadlines, he believed long hours were necessary to secure a better future for his family. But in the process, his presence at home faded. One evening, a simple question from his child, asking why he no longer joined family dinners, stopped him in his tracks. It made him realise that his work-life balance was out of sync. That moment marked a turning point in both his leadership style and his understanding of what true success really means.Cache Merrill, founder of the software development startup Zibtek , was all-in on building his company. Launched in 2009 while raising three young children, the startup demanded everything he had. He regularly worked 60 to 70 hours a week, waking up before dawn and working late into the night. Client deadlines, meetings, and constant decision-making left him with little time for family. Over the years, the long hours and constant pressure took a toll on his personal connections, subtly eroding the warmth and closeness he once shared with his children. What began as a noble pursuit to secure his children’s future slowly created a quiet distance from them.As the company grew, his presence at home diminished. Dinners were missed. Bedtime stories faded. Weekends blurred into workdays. Merrill believed he was doing what was necessary for success until one evening, his child stopped him in his tracks with a simple, heartfelt question: “Daddy, why don’t you eat with us anymore?”That innocent question cut deeper than any business setback. It revealed a truth he could no longer ignore: in chasing professional goals, he had unintentionally become a stranger in his own home. It wasn’t criticism, it was clarity. And it marked a turning point in both his life and leadership.Shaken by that moment, Merrill knew something had to change. He reassessed what success really meant, and realised it had to include being present for his children, not just providing for them. He began setting clear boundaries: logging off in time for dinner, being fully available for bedtime routines, and actively engaging in family life again. It wasn’t easy at first, but each small step helped rebuild the emotional closeness he had lost.According to a story first reported by Business Insider India, this shift deeply influenced how Merrill led his company as well. He no longer viewed leadership through the lens of constant availability. Instead, he embraced a healthier, more sustainable style, focusing on outcomes rather than long hours and fostering a workplace culture that prioritised well-being and balance.He started encouraging his team to step away from their desks when needed, avoid overwork, and talk openly about stress. He modelled empathy and emotional intelligence , making it clear that taking care of personal health and relationships was not only acceptable, it was essential. As a result, Zibtek began evolving not just as a business but as a human-centered organisation where people felt truly valued.Merrill’s journey offers a powerful reminder: true leadership doesn’t begin and end in boardrooms; it extends to the dinner table, bedtime routines, and the quiet, everyday moments that often go unnoticed. In a world where “hustle” is often equated with worth, he learned the hard way that presence is a more lasting measure of success.Today, he continues to lead Zibtek with the same entrepreneurial spirit, but with a renewed sense of balance. He no longer feels pressure to be the first in and the last out. Instead, he strives to be available wherever he’s needed most, whether that’s in a client meeting or sitting beside his children at dinner.His story challenges the outdated belief that professional success must come at a personal cost. Instead, it shows that by integrating compassion, awareness, and boundaries into leadership, it’s possible to thrive in business while also nurturing the relationships that matter most.","Cache Merrill, founder of the software startup Zibtek, spent years working 70-hour weeks to grow his business.

CEO’s cultural transformation aims to shift from 'loyalty and tenure' to market-based performance

AT&T CEO John Stankey delivered a blunt ultimatum to employees resisting the company's return-to-office mandate and cultural transformation, telling workers who can't align with new priorities to find jobs elsewhere. In a lengthy memo to managers obtained by Business Insider, Stankey addressed declining employee engagement scores following the telecom giant's shift from hybrid work to a five-day in-office requirement.""If you are of the small minority that shared comments similar to, 'I have heard this nonsense before and I'll ignore things until this goes away…' or 'things were just fine the way they were…' there might be a disconnect between you and your current professional choice,"" Stankey wrote in the Friday memo addressing over 99,000 survey respondents.The CEO's message comes seven months after AT&T implemented its strict office mandate, abandoning the hybrid schedule many employees preferred. Survey results showed 79% of respondents feel committed to their work, but overall engagement scores declined from 2023 levels.""If a self-directed, virtual, or hybrid work schedule is essential for you to manage your career aspirations and life challenges, you will have a difficult time aligning your priorities with those of the company and the culture we aim to establish,"" Stankey stated, making clear that remote work flexibility is no longer compatible with AT&T's vision.The mandate has created practical challenges, with some employees reporting difficulties securing office desks and parking spaces. Competitor Verizon has capitalized on the situation, actively recruiting disgruntled AT&T workers who prefer hybrid arrangements.Stankey framed the changes as part of a broader cultural overhaul moving away from traditional corporate values. ""We have consciously shifted away from some of these elements and towards a more market-based culture — focused on rewarding capability, contribution, and commitment,"" he explained, referencing the company's departure from ""loyalty, tenure, and conformance with the associated compensation.""The CEO invoked military leadership wisdom to justify the disruption: ""As General Eric Shinseki so eloquently stated, 'If you dislike change, you're going to dislike irrelevance even more.'""""When I read comments lamenting disruption, I tried to pick my brain for an example of another 100+ year old company that didn't have to disrupt itself to secure sustainable relevance. I am still searching for the first example,"" Stankey noted, defending the transformation as essential for the 150-year-old company's survival.",AT&T CEO John Stankey delivered a blunt ultimatum to employees resisting the company's return-to-office mandate and cultural transformation.

Why Japan's browser rules may prove tougher for Apple than EU's Digital Markets Act,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-japans-browser-rules-may-prove-tougher-for-apple-than-eus-digital-markets-act/articleshow/123186088.cms,"Learning from Europe's implementation challenges

Japanese regulators have given Apple until December 2025 to lift its ban on third-party browser engines on iOS devices, but what makes this deadline notable is Japan's approach to addressing the implementation challenges that have affected Europe's similar efforts. The Japanese guidelines include specific language designed to prevent the technical workarounds that have allowed Apple to maintain control despite existing regulations elsewhere.The deadline comes from newly published guidelines for Japan's Mobile Software Competition Act, which explicitly prohibits Apple from blocking or hindering alternative browser engines like those used by Chrome, Firefox, and other popular browsers. Currently, all browsers on iOS must use Apple's WebKit engine, effectively limiting browser competition on iPhones Unlike the EU's approach, the Japanese guidelines aim to prevent Apple from using the workarounds and technical barriers that allowed it to maintain significant control despite European regulations. According to the Open Web Advocacy organization, which provided translations of the guidelines, Apple cannot impose ""unreasonable technical restrictions,"" place ""excessive financial burdens"" on app developers, or steer users away from alternative browser software .Japan's approach appears designed to address the gaps that Apple navigated in its response to the European Union's Digital Markets Act. Despite EU regulations, Apple has maintained considerable control over iOS browsing through technical and procedural restrictions that have limited the effectiveness of the European rules.The Japanese rules also mandate that alternative browser engines receive functionally equivalent access to operating system features that Safari currently enjoys. Any alternative APIs provided by Apple cannot offer ""materially inferior"" performance compared to what Apple uses for its own browser.Additionally, Japan requires choice screens for browsers to appear ""promptly after first activation"" of new devices, addressing another area where the EU's implementation has faced challenges with timing and user experience.With Japan joining the EU and UK in requiring third-party browser engine support, but with more detailed enforcement guidelines, 2026 could become an important year for browser competition on iOS. The outcome will largely depend on whether Japan's more comprehensive approach can achieve better results than Europe's ongoing efforts. The stakes are particularly high given that browser engine control has been central to Apple's ability to shape the mobile web experience and maintain its App Store ecosystem dominance.",Japanese regulators have given Apple until December 2025 to lift its ban on third-party browser engines on iOS devices.

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan mounted a forceful defense of his leadership, pushing back against US President Donald Trump 's demand for his “immediate resignation,” telling employees he has ""always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards"" and dismissing criticism about his Chinese investments as ""misinformation.""In an internal company memo sent hours after Trump called him ""highly conflicted,"" Tan declared his commitment to US national security while defending his four-decade career. ""The United States has been my home for more than 40 years. I love this country and am profoundly grateful for the opportunities it has given me,"" he wrote to Intel employees.Trump's public intervention came one day after Senator Tom Cotton raised three critical questions about Tan's extensive Chinese business connections in a formal letter to Intel's board.Tan directly addressed the controversy surrounding his investments in Chinese firms, some linked to the People's Liberation Army. ""There has been a lot of misinformation circulating about my past roles at Walden International and Cadence Design Systems,"" he told employees, emphasisingReuters reported that Tan invested at least $200 million in hundreds of Chinese companies between March 2012 and December 2024, with his venture firm Walden maintaining joint ownership with Chinese government funds in 20 investment vehicles from tech hubs like Hangzhou, Hefei and Wuxi. At least eight companies reportedly have direct ties to the Chinese military.Cotton's August 5 letter posed three specific questions that appear to have triggered Trump's response: whether Intel's board knew about legal troubles at Tan's former company Cadence Design before hiring him, whether he divested from Chinese military-linked firms, and if he disclosed remaining investments to the US government given Intel's sensitive defense contracts.Adding to the controversy, Cadence Design Systems, where Tan served as CEO until 2021, pleaded guilty last month to illegally selling export-controlled technologies to a Chinese military university, agreeing to pay over $140 million in penalties for activities that occurred during his tenure.The CEO's challenges extend beyond Chinese investment scrutiny. The Wall Street Journal reported that the company's board has stalled his recent efforts to raise new capital and acquire artificial intelligence companies, revealing fundamental disagreements about Intel's future direction, including whether the chip giant should exit manufacturing entirely.Tan acknowledged the company's transformation efforts under him, noting progress toward ""high-volume manufacturing using the most advanced semiconductor process technology in the country."" Intel secured $8 billion in CHIPS Act subsidies, the largest grant to a single company, making his foreign connections particularly sensitive for national security officials.""We are engaging with the Administration to address the matters that have been raised and ensure they have the facts,"" Tan wrote, expressing shared commitment with Trump's security priorities while defending his leadership of the struggling chip giant.Intel's challenges are particularly sensitive given its role as the largest recipient of CHIPS Act funding, securing $8 billion in federal subsidies to boost domestic chip manufacturing. ""We are engaging with the Administration to address the matters that have been raised and ensure they have the facts,"" Tan wrote, expressing alignment with Trump's security priorities while defending his leadership.The CEO emphasised that Intel's board remains ""fully supportive"" of transformation efforts, though Trump's intervention adds pressure to an already embattled executive facing challenges from Wall Street, and his own boardroom.","Intel CEO addresses ""misinformation"" about Chinese investments in internal memo.

How Atlassian CEO informed its employees about the layoffs



If we make call centre staff more productive, people aren’t going to call more [and] we’ll probably need less call centre staff. Some parts of our economy will grow significantly as AI makes them more productive, and some parts of our economy will shrink as we do that.”

“There are a couple of reasons I’ve purchased a plane. Personal security is the primary reason (an unfortunate reality of my world), but also so I can run a global business from Australia, and still be a constantly present dad.”

Jira software maker Atlassian has laid off 150 employees, a report claims. The affected roles in the Australian tech company are reportedly being replaced by new artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The latest round of job cuts comes months after Atlassian’s billionaire CEO and co-founder, Mike Cannon-Brookes, defended his purchase of a private jet. In March, Cannon-Brookes took to professional networking site LinkedIn to defend his decision to acquire a Bombardier 7500, an aircraft which is believed to cost over US$75 million, stating that this purchase would allow him to be a ""present dad."" The latest layoffs were also reportedly defended by Atlassian’s other co-founder and former CEO Scott Farquhar.According to a report by SkyNews Australia, Atlassian employees who were impacted in this round of job cuts were informed of the job cuts via a pre-recorded video message from Cannon-Brookes. In the video, seen by the publication, the CEO spoke from a home office in a faded green hoodie.However, the Cannon-Brookes did not name the affected individuals, who reportedly had to wait 15 minutes for an email confirming their status. Impacted staff had their laptops blocked, but are expected to receive payment for the next six months, the report noted.Meanwhile, Farquhar, Atlassian's other cofounder, has also reportedly defended the layoffs, saying that Australia’s copyright laws should be updated to allow AI companies unrestricted access to mine data.In a statement to the Sydney Morning Herald, Farquhar said: “Earlier this year, Atlassian faced criticism for Cannon-Brookes buying a personal jet for upwards of $75 million despite his support for climate action and promotion of solar power. He has reportedly been investing heavily in eco-friendly projects, including a solar power cable from Darwin to Singapore.In a post shared on LinkedIn, Cannon-Brookes wrote:","Jira software maker Atlassian has laid off 150 employees, a report claims.

WinZO disputes Google’s CCI proposal on Play Store rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/winzo-disputes-googles-cci-proposal-on-play-store-rules/articleshow/123051104.cms,"Bengaluru: Real‑money gaming platform WinZO has raised concerns over Google’s latest proposal to the Competition Commission of India (CCI), arguing that it does not adequately address the anti‑competitive issues flagged in an ongoing investigation.The case originates from WinZO’s December 2022 complaint alleging that Google abused its dominant position by restricting Play Store access to only fantasy sports and rummy apps while excluding other real‑money gaming categories. With Google controlling 96% of India’s app distribution market, WinZO said this policy inflated user acquisition costs by “at least 10x” for apps distributed outside the Play Store.Acting on the complaint, the CCI in November 2024 ordered a formal investigation, citing prima facie violations of competition law, including the imposition of unfair conditions, denial of market access and limiting of market development. The Commission had noted Google’s lack of clear criteria for its pilot programme, inconsistent enforcement of its ads policy and “misleading payment warnings” shown to users sideloading apps, which it said artificially deterred usage.In a public notice issued recently the CCI invited comments on Google’s commitment offer. Google’s proposal includes allowing all real‑money games that are certified by recognised third‑party bodies, replacing its pilot programme for fantasy sports and rummy apps and permitting certified skill‑based games to advertise on Google Ads. If approved, Google has committed to implement the Play Store changes within 120 days and its advertising changes within 150 days of the CCI’s order. The deadline for public comments is August 20, 2025.Responding to WinZO’s objections, a Google spokesperson said the company welcomed the CCI’s market testing of its proposed framework, describing it as the result of “constructive discussions” with the regulator and Indian developers. Google added that it is confident the proposal will create “a more open and safe ecosystem” for real‑money gaming apps, empower local developers and prioritise user safety.In its statement, WinZO said Google’s commitments “must be robust and genuinely eliminate the discriminatory practices identified,” adding that the proposed framework’s reference to “developing” a commercial model for real‑money gaming lacked clear timelines or objective criteria.WinZO, which reported a 70% rise in revenue to Rs 1,055 crore and a 151% increase in profit to Rs 315 crore in FY24, said it will continue to participate in the consultation process “to ensure fairness, transparency and a level playing field in India’s digital economy.”","WinZO has raised concerns over Google’s latest proposal to the Competition Commission of India.

Legal battle continues despite Epic's courtroom success

The US’ Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has rejected Google's appeal in the Epic Games lawsuit, affirming that Google's Play Store and payment systems constitute illegal monopolies. The decision forces Google to implement sweeping changes to Android's app ecosystem within three years, including allowing rival app stores on Google Play and ending exclusive payment requirements.The appeals court lifted a stay that had temporarily paused most injunction requirements while Google pursued its appeal, clearing the path for immediate implementation of the court-ordered remedies.Under the permanent injunction, Google faces unprecedented restrictions on its Android business model. The company must distribute competing app stores through Google Play and provide rivals with access to its complete app catalog.Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney , who called this a ""total victory,"" announced that the Epic Games Store for Android will launch directly within Google Play Store Google is also banned from requiring developers to use Google Play Billing and from striking revenue-sharing deals with device manufacturers to preinstall its store.Google plans to escalate its appeal to the Supreme Court, with the company warning that the decision ""will significantly harm user safety, limit choice, and undermine innovation."" The tech giant had argued that the injunction imposed ""burdensome contractual restrictions"" without justification.The case originated in 2020 when Epic embedded secret code in Fortnite to bypass Google's payment system, prompting Google to remove the popular game from its store. A 2023 jury unanimously found Google guilty of operating illegal monopolies in Android app distribution and in-app billing markets.Unlike Epic's largely unsuccessful lawsuit against Apple, the Google case revealed internal documents showing revenue-sharing agreements and concerns about competitive threats, helping Epic secure its landmark victory in the ongoing battle over mobile app store dominance.",Google must open Android to third-party app stores within three years.

Intel's manufacturing unit faces more ""bad news"" as three senior executives in its operations are set to retire. This declaration from the company follows CEO Lip-Bu Tan 's announcement of major restructuring plans in its manufacturing unit. The latest announcement marks further change as Tan works to revitalise the struggling US-based chipmaker. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Intel has confirmed that Kaizad Mistry and Ryan Russell, both corporate vice presidents in the technology development group, will retire. Additionally, Gary Patton, a corporate vice president at its Design Technology Platform organisation and a former IBM executive, is also retiring. The latest departures underscore the significant shifts occurring within Intel's manufacturing operations.Intel has also discussed internal changes to its technology development group, which oversees the creation of manufacturing processes. The Reuters report also cited two individuals familiar with the matter to claim. The company is also reportedly planning to scale down its manufacturing capacity planning team and reduce part of its engineering workforce, the sources told Reuters.Manufacturing operations are currently led by Naga Chandrasekaran , a former Micron Technology executive, who joined Intel about a year ago under previous CEO Pat Gelsinger. In March, Chandrasekaran’s role expanded to include both technology development and manufacturing. Since then, he has reorganised the teams under him, which provides for layoffs as part of broader global workforce reductions.Last week, during its quarterly earnings announcement, Intel’s new CEO announced several significant changes for the company. Tan, who stepped into the role in March, outlined a plan to reduce the company’s workforce to 75,000 by year-end, a cut of roughly 22%. The chipmaker also said it would adopt a more cautious approach to manufacturing investments.Intel added that the continuation of its next-generation 14A manufacturing process depends on landing a significant customer. Without one, the company may halt or abandon development.In a memo, Tan noted:Tan also informed investors that Intel’s 18A process would likely deliver a reasonable return only if applied to the company’s products.According to a previous report from Reuters, he has also considered discontinuing the offering of 18A technology to external clients to concentrate resources on the 14A process. Intel is reportedly planning to begin high-volume production of its Panther Lake PC chips later this year using the 18A process.","Intel's manufacturing unit faces more ""bad news"" as three senior executives in its operations are set to retire.

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has responded to Jensen Huang ’s previous remarks, stating his words are “outrageous”. ""I've said nothing that anywhere near resembles the idea that this company should be the only one to build the technology,"" Amodei said, adding ""’[=It's just an incredible and bad faith distortion.""The feud started in June when the Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he disagreed with ""almost everything"" Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said. Speaking at the Viva Tech conference earlier this year, Huang accused Amodei of believing AI is so dangerous that only his company should be allowed to build it — an idea Huang described as unrealistic and monopolistic. ""AI is so incredibly powerful that everyone will lose their jobs, which explains why they should be the only company building it,"" Huang then said of Amodei's thinking.In a latest episode of the ""Big Technology"" podcast hosted by Alex Kantrowitz, Anthropic CEO said “I've never said anything like that”, adding “That's the most outrageous lie I've ever heard.”Dario Amodei said that he didn't know where ""anyone could ever derive that from anything that I've said."" Amodei insisted that in a ""race to the bottom,"" AI companies rush to launch new features without enough safety checks, which puts everyone at risk. In contrast, his approach is a ""race to the top,"" where the most responsible and ethical AI companies lead the way, setting higher standards for the entire industry.""I've said multiple times, and I think Anthropic's actions have shown it, that we're aiming for something we call a race to the top,"" he added.In a related news, Dario Amodei warned employees against massive salary increases from competitors like Meta, stating it could ""destroy"" the company's culture. Speaking on the Big Technology Podcast, Amodei revealed that when Meta and other tech giants began targeting Anthropic engineers with lucrative offers, he sent a clear message to staff: the company would not compromise its compensation principles.""What they are doing is trying to buy something that cannot be bought,"" Amodei said, explaining that many employees rejected external offers and some ""wouldn't even talk to Mark Zuckerberg ."" The CEO emphasized that Anthropic maintains a level-based compensation system where negotiations aren't permitted, calling it a matter of fairness.","Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has responded to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s previous remarks, stating his words are “outrageous” Huang said he disagreed with ""almost everything"" Anthropic CEO said “I've never said anything like that”, adding “That's the most outrageous lie I've ever heard""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123048585,imgsize-27038,width-400,resizemode-4/Anthropic-CEO-rejects-Nvidia-CEO-Jensen-Haungs-AI-remarks.jpg"

"Elon Musk says valuation of $20 trillion for Tesla is possible, but….",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/elon-musk-says-valuation-of-20-trillion-for-tesla-is-possible-but-/articleshow/122907384.cms,"Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation. He stated that “Betting against Elon is like betting against Steve Jobs (Apple founder)”. Responding to the comments, the Tesla CEO acknowledged that while the valuation is possible, it may require ‘extreme execution’.“Extreme execution is needed, but a valuation of $20 trillion for Tesla is possible,” Elon Musk wrote, quoting a post on X (formerly Twitter).Notably, this comes days after Elon Musk warned of ‘few rough quarters’ for Tesla following the expiration of the US tax credit for EVs. In an earnings conference call with analysts and investors this week, the tech billionaire said “We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the US.”Continuing further, he said “We probably could have a few rough quarters.

Revenue for the April to June quarter also declined — from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion — but still came in slightly higher than analysts had forecast.During the earnings calls, Elon Musk was asked about whether he would want more than his current 13% stake in Tesla to keep control. To this, Musk said he did want more but not too much.“I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction,” he said, “but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”","Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation. Responding to the comments, the Tesla CEO acknowledged that while the valuation is possible, it may require 'extreme execution' This comes days after Elon Musk warned of ‘few rough quarters’ for Tesla following the expiration of the US tax credit for EVs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122907376,imgsize-13156,width-400,resizemode-4/Elon-Musk-says-valuation-of-20-trillion-for-Tesla-is-possible-but-.jpg"

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world. Speaking during an event hosted by the All-In Podcast team and a consortium of tech leaders and lawmakers known as the Hill and Valley Forum, Huang discussed the scale of impact that small, focused teams of AI researchers can have and how Nvidia’s success has translated into significant financial rewards for those in leadership. “I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.” Jensen Huang said. He was responding to a question on the effectiveness and value of smaller AI teams.“But the important big idea is that the impact of 150 or so AI researchers, with funding behind them, can probably create,” he noted. Jensen Huang gave examples of OpenAI which originally started with around 150 employees and China’s DeepSeek which also has a similar workforce.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang added that there's something unique about well-structured, mid-sized teams when given the right resources. “That’s not a small team. That’s a good-size team with the right infrastructure… If you're willing to pay, say, $20 billion, $30 billion to buy a startup with 150 AI researchers, why wouldn't you pay one?”During the interview, the Nvidia CEO also addressed reports that he personally rewards high-performing employees with surprise stock options and RSUs (Restricted Stock Units). When asked if he actually does carry stock options, Jensen Huang joked “Yeah, I'm carrying it in my pocket right now.”He then explained that he takes a hands-on approach to compensation across the company. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day… when they present it, and they send me everybody’s recommended comp, I go through the whole company. I’ve got my methods of doing that, and I use machine learning. I sort through all 42,000 employees.”“100% of the time, I increased the company’s spend on OpEx [operating expenses]. And the reason for that is because you take care of people, everything else takes care [of itself],” Jensen Huang concluded.",N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world.

AI transformation drives Microsoft’s workforce restructuring strategy

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed the company's massive job cuts in a candid memo to employees, acknowledging that recent layoffs affecting over 15,000 workers this year, have been ""weighing heavily"" on him while defending the cuts as necessary for the Redmond giant’s AI transformation.""Before anything else, I want to speak to what's been weighing heavily on me, and what I know many of you are thinking about: the recent job eliminations,"" Nadella wrote to Microsoft's more than 200,000 employees. ""These decisions are among the most difficult we have to make. They affect people we've worked alongside, learned from, and shared countless moments with – our colleagues, teammates, and friends.""The layoffs represent approximately 7% of Microsoft's global workforce, making it the company's largest personnel reduction since 2014. Despite the cuts, Microsoft's stock has soared 21% this year, hitting record highs above $500 per share, while the company reported $75 billion in net income over three fiscal quarters.Nadella directly addressed what he called the ""uncertainty and seeming incongruence"" of cutting jobs while the company thrives financially. ""By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving – our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right,"" he wrote. ""We're investing more in CapEx than ever before. Our overall headcount is relatively unchanged, and some of the talent and expertise in our industry and at Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before. And yet, at the same time, we've undergone layoffs.""The CEO described this contradiction as ""the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value,"" explaining that ""progress isn't linear. It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding.""Nadella emphasised that achieving future success ""will be defined by our ability to go through this difficult process of 'unlearning' and 'learning.'"" He argued this transformation requires Microsoft to ""meet changing customer needs, by continuing to maintain and scale our current business, while also creating new categories with new business models and a new production function.""The memo outlined Microsoft's strategic pivot from a ""software factory to an intelligence engine"" as the company invests $80 billion in AI infrastructure. Nadella envisions a future where ""all 8 billion people could summon a researcher, an analyst, or a coding agent at their fingertips.""""As we begin a new fiscal year, I've been reflecting on the road we've traveled together and the path ahead,"" Nadella wrote, positioning the layoffs within broader industry shifts toward AI-driven automation that have eliminated over 80,000 tech jobs in 2025.The CEO expressed ""sincere gratitude to those who have left,"" acknowledging that ""their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today."" However, he offered no guarantees against future layoffs, instead urging remaining employees to maintain a ""growth mindset"" during what he called the ""messiness"" of transformation.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed the company's massive job cuts in a candid memo to employees.

Read Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates' complete LinkedIn post here



I’ve entered the startup world again…

When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible. But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni.

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

Let me know what you think! You never know who’s on the other end of the customer service line…

Bill Gates daughter shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother



Big Question Answered: Why Google is Merging Android and ChromeOS

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, recently demonstrated a unique approach to leadership and family support by working a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup. In a LinkedIn post Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup — Phoebe and Gates agreed to it. “I’ve entered the startup world again… When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes,” wrote Gates in a LinkedIn post.Phoebe Gates co-founded Phia along with her Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni. The platform uses AI to help users compare prices of new and second-hand products across more than 40,000 websites. A web browser/app, Phia aims to be the Booking.com of fashion, offering an instant price comparison from thousands of e-commerce sites for any item, new or used. Phoebe Gates is the youngest child of Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates joined the customer service team of Phia for one day in order to understand how the product works.Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates revealed that this experience reminded him that “the best way to understand how something works—or where it breaks—is to go straight to the people using it.” His stint echoes a growing trend among tech CEOs to spend time on the front lines, following examples like Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who famously delivered food and drove passengers to better grasp user pain points.Earlier, in April this year, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates shared that he intentionally chose not to invest in his daughter’s AI-powered shopping app, Phia, during a podcast. He explained that funding the venture would have led him to oversee it too closely. Instead, he offered advice on staffing while others handled the investment. ""In an interview published by the New York Times, soon after Phia’s web browser and app went live, Bill Gates said: “I thought, ‘Oh boy, she’s going to come and ask.”“I would have kept her on a short leash and be doing business reviews, which I would have found tricky,” the businessman explained of his hesitance. “And I probably would have been overly nice but wondered if it was the right thing to do.”Phoebe Gates recently shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother, Melinda French Gates, about tackling investors. The 22-year-old co-founder of fashion pricing startup Phia got this advice from her mother after she faced queries from potential investors about her future motherhood. While raising funds for Phia with co-founder Sophia Kianni, Gates was asked what would happen if they decided to have children. On the Call Her Daddy podcast, Phoebe shared that this line of questioning prompted a call to her mother. She noted that her mother’s reply was: ""Get up or get out of the game, sis.""According to a report by Benzinga, both founders said that these inquiries expose a persistent bias in venture capital. “Always children,” Melinda Gates said when asked to name the most common bias they’ve faced. Kianni said she turned the tables on a male investor by asking: ""What's going to happen to your venture firm when you have kids?""""He's like, ‘Why would that affect anything?' And I was like, ‘You answered your own question,'” she added.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates worked a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup, Phia.

Sundar Pichai joins the ‘billionaire club’ after leading Google for over a decade; his net worth is…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sundar-pichai-joins-the-billionaire-club-after-leading-google-for-over-a-decade-his-net-worth-is/articleshow/122897734.cms,"Sundar Pichai achieves rare feat as a non-founder CEO

AI-powered growth and record investments

From modest beginnings to Silicon Valley’s summit

After a decade at the helm of Alphabet, Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO. Pichai, who took over as CEO of Google in 2015 and became Alphabet’s chief in 2019, now holds a net worth of $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The milestone comes after Alphabet’s market value soared by over $1 trillion since early 2023, delivering 120% returns to investors. Pichai’s rise has been defined by his leadership through multiple technological shifts, from mobile and cloud computing to AI. As Alphabet’s shares hit record highs, his decade-long stewardship has culminated in both financial success and strategic transformation.While tech billionaires are often company founders, Pichai’s entry into the billionaire club is different. He holds just 0.02% of Alphabet’s economic stake, currently valued at around $440 million. Most of his net worth comes from share sales and performance-based compensation over the past ten years. Bloomberg reports that he has sold over $650 million in stock during his tenure. If he had retained all his shares, they would now be worth more than $2.5 billion. Despite the modest stake, Pichai’s long-term vision and steady leadership have driven massive growth in Alphabet’s core businesses.August 2025 marks ten years since Pichai became CEO of Google. In that time, Alphabet has expanded rapidly, turning once-nascent divisions like YouTube, Cloud, Play, and Subscriptions into billion-dollar engines. In a recent post on X, Pichai highlighted that in 2015, Alphabet’s total revenue was $75 billion, whereas YouTube and Google Cloud alone are now generating an annual run rate of $110 billion. Under his leadership, Alphabet restructured into a parent holding company, sharpened its AI focus, and increased its global footprint.A major factor in Alphabet’s recent trillion-dollar surge has been its aggressive AI investments . The company spent $50 billion in 2023 alone on infrastructure, semiconductors, and data centers to support its AI ambitions. It also raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast by $10 billion, reaching $85 billion, most of which is earmarked for AI infrastructure. “Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand for cloud customers,” Pichai said during the Q2 earnings call. Alphabet’s DeepMind acquisition in 2014 for $400 million has also paid off, helping the company stay ahead in the AI race. Pichai's rise reflects a new era where operational excellence, not just founding status, can build tech empires.Born in Tamil Nadu, India, Sundar Pichai’s journey to Silicon Valley is one of resilience and brilliance. He grew up in a two-room apartment, with his first telephone arriving when he was 12. A scholarship brought him to Stanford in 1993, with a one-way plane ticket that reportedly cost more than his father’s annual salary. Pichai joined Google in 2004, led the development of Chrome, and later oversaw Android, before rising to the top job.Sundar Pichai is also known for his calm, consensus-driven leadership style, which has earned him respect in an industry often defined by bold personalities. In recent years, he has become increasingly vocal on topics like AI regulation, digital privacy, and ethical tech, positioning Alphabet as a global thought leader beyond just innovation.Outside of tech, Pichai has also ventured into sports. He is reportedly part of a group of executives that acquired a 49% stake in the London Spirit cricket team for $182 million. The team competes in The Hundred, a professional cricket league launched in the UK in 2020. While his wealth may not rival that of Alphabet founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth $171.2 billion and $160.4 billion respectively, Pichai's path to the billionaire club is proof that transformational leadership, even without a founding stake, can build both companies and fortunes. His rise underscores a shift in Silicon Valley’s power dynamics—where disciplined execution rivals disruptive invention. As Alphabet charts its future, Pichai’s story stands as a model for aspiring global leaders in tech and beyond.","Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO.

Apple has shipped 3 billion iPhones



Cupertino-based tech giant Apple delivered a strong third quarter for fiscal 2025. The company posted a record June quarter revenue of $94 billion with up to 10% year-over-year growth and supercharged iPhone 16 sales . In an interview with CNBC, Apple CEO Tim Cook revealed that the right now iPhone 16 series is the most-popular iPhone lineup in the world. Cook added that the iPhone 16 lineup has surpassed the performance of the iPhone 15 lineup which the company launched in 2023. During the Q3 earnings call, Apple posted $44.6 billion in iPhone revenue, suggesting a year-over-year increase of 13%.The statement made by Cook is an important indicator of the iPhone 16's market performance. This also means that the users who went for an upgrade liked the new features, camera enhancements, and design updates the company introduced with iPhone 16 lineup.Talking to CNBC, Cook said that iPhone 16 witnessed a sales growth in ‘strong double digits’ as compared to the iPhone 15 during the same period last year. He attributed the surge to a wave of upgrades from existing iPhone users, noting that the entire lineup—including the iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro, and 16 Pro Max—has resonated well with consumers.“Cook said iPhone revenue was strong because the iPhone 16 is more popular compared to the iPhone 15 devices on sale last year at the same time. Cook said iPhone 16 sales were up “strong double digits” versus its predecessor. Cook specifically highlighted popularity among current iPhone users upgrading to a new one,” mentions the report.Apple CEO also revealed that the company has shipped three billion iPhones since the launch of the original iPhone 18 years ago, in 2007. During Apple’s third-quarter earnings call, CEO Tim Cook revealed that the company shipped its three billionth iPhone during the quarter. Apple also reported $94 billion in revenue, with iPhone sales contributing $44.6 billion, nearly half of its total quarterly revenue.iPhone sales jumped 13% year-over-year in the quarter ending June 2025, with analysts suggesting tariff concerns may have driven purchases. Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman noted that consumers likely bought iPhones fearing future price increases due to President Trump's proposed tariffs, which already cost Apple $800 million last quarter and are projected to reach $1.1 billion next quarter.","Apple has shipped 3 billion iPhones since the launch of the original iPhone 18 years ago, in 2007.

We just removed a feature from

@ChatGPTapp

that allowed users to make their conversations discoverable by search engines, such as Google. This was a short-lived experiment to help people discover useful conversations. This feature required users to opt-in, first by picking a chat to share, then by clicking a checkbox for it to be shared with search engines (see below).

Ultimately we think this feature introduced too many opportunities for folks to accidentally share things they didn't intend to, so we're removing the option. We're also working to remove indexed content from the relevant search engines. This change is rolling out to all users through tomorrow morning.

Security and privacy are paramount for us, and we'll keep working to maximally reflect that in our products and features.","OpenAI rolls back new ChatGPT feature over privacy concerns.

National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has reportedly rolled out new United Payments Interface (UPI) rules starting today, i.e. August 1, 2025. According to an Economic Times report, NPCI has issued a set of new guidelines that must be followed by UPI ecosystem members starting today. These changes include limiting daily balance enquiry requests, regulating use of APIs and more. The report cites NPCI’s compliance notice dated May 21, which mandates Payment Service Providers (PSPs), UPI apps, and banks to put these changes in place by July 31, 2025.One of the major changes coming to UPI as reported by ET is a limit on how many times users can check their bank balance. Now, balance enquiries are limited to 50 per app per customer in a 24-hour period, as per the report.These balance checks must be started by the user — apps and systems are not allowed to trigger them automatically. Also, UPI apps must add a feature that lets them reduce or pause such requests during busy hours to avoid pressure on the system.To cut down on unnecessary balance checks, NPCI has also asked issuer banks to include the available account balance in every successful UPI transaction message.NPCI, ET report says, has placed limits on the use of the “list account” API, which shows users the bank accounts linked to their mobile number. This feature is now limited to 25 requests per app per customer per day. It can only be used after the user selects their bank in the app.If the app needs to retry the process, it must ask the user for permission first. This is meant to make things clearer and avoid unnecessary system calls.To reduce traffic during busy times, UPI Autopay transactions will now be allowed only during non-peak hours. NPCI defines peak hours as 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM to 9:30 PM.Each autopay instruction will be allowed one initial attempt and up to three retries, meaning no more than four total attempts per mandate.","National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has reportedly rolled out new United Payments Interface (UPI) rules starting today, i.e. August 1, 2025.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently shared his ‘mantra’ of success. Speaking at an event recently, Huang said “resilience matters in success”, adding that success often comes from facing setbacks and hardships. “People with very high expectations have very low resilience. Unfortunately, resilience matters in success,” the Nvidia CEO said. “I don't know how to teach it to you, except for I hope suffering happens to you,” he added.Jensen Huang explained that his own experiences growing up helped shape his character. While his parents supported him, he still faced challenges. These difficulties, he said, helped him grow stronger. “I was fortunate that I grew up with my parents, providing a condition for us to be successful, on the one hand, but there were plenty of opportunities for setbacks and sufferings,” he said.Jensen Huang revealed that he often uses the phrase ‘pain and suffering’ at the company. “To this day, I used the phrase pain and suffering inside our company with great glee,” he said, adding “And the reason is this is gonna cause a lot of pain and suffering – I mean that in a happy way.”“Because you want to refine the character of your company. You want greatness out of them.”According to the Nvidia CEO, greatness does not come from intelligence. Greatness, he said “comes from character and character isn't formed out of small people. It is formed out of people who have suffered.”Jensen Huang’s comments highlight his belief that difficult moments can play a key role in personal growth and long-term success — both for individuals and for companies.Last month, Nvidia achieved a major milestone by becoming the first-ever company to reach a market valuation of $4 trillion. The chipmaker’s rise is fueled by the increased demand for AI chips globally.","Jensen Huang revealed that he often uses the phrase ‘pain and suffering’ at the company. “To this day, I used the phrase pain and suffering inside our company with great glee,” he said.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy struck a more optimistic tone about artificial intelligence’s impact on workers during the company’s July 31 earnings call, months after warning that AI would lead to fewer jobs across the tech giant’s 1.5 million-person workforce.“AI will make all our teammates’ jobs more enjoyable,” Jassy said, emphasizing that the technology would free employees from “rote” functions that previously couldn’t be automated. He added that “coding agents, having AI do a lot of the coding for us … allows our teammates to start from a much more advanced starting spot.”Amazon pivots messaging after employee backlash over job displacement warningsThe comments mark a notable shift from Jassy’s stark June 17 internal memo that told employees “we will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today.” That warning sparked sharp internal criticism, with one worker sarcastically writing on company Slack channels: “There is nothing more motivating on a Tuesday than reading that your job will be replaced by AI in a few years.”Jassy explained that companies face a choice in the AI revolution: they can “embrace the change that’s happening and help shape the new era, or you can wish it away and have it shape you.” He said Amazon has chosen to embrace this transformative moment.The Amazon chief detailed how AI is already reshaping the company’s operations, from coding assistance that saved programmers “4,500 years of work” to customer service automation through AWS Connect. “It’s changing the way Amazon does coding, finance, all sorts of things,” Jassy explained, noting AI’s impact on “business process automation” and customer service.Amazon currently operates more than 1,000 generative AI services across its business units, including the next-generation Alexa+ assistant and AI-powered shopping tools used by tens of millions of customers worldwide. The company has also deployed its millionth robot at a fulfillment center in Japan.Despite the more positive messaging, Amazon has already eliminated more than 27,000 jobs since 2022 through rolling layoffs, with additional workforce reductions continuing in 2025. Amazon’s stock dropped roughly 7% in post-market trading following the earnings call.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy struck a more optimistic tone about artificial intelligence’s impact on workers.

The debate over the future of artificial intelligence (AI) development has taken a new turn, with Meta’s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun , has openly disagreed with Elon Musk 's latest move at his startup, xAI . LeCun slammed Musk’s take on eliminating the “researcher” job title in favour of “engineer.” The Meta executive said that both have different roles and the Tesla CEO may be risking “killing breakthrough innovation.”In a long post on LinkedIn, LeCun shared a screenshot of Musk’s post and explained the difference between all the roles. He argued that blurring the lines between the two roles could stifle innovation.“There is a difference between research and engineering in (1) modus operandi, (2) methodology, (3) openness, (4) evaluation criteria,” he wrote.“If you make no distinction between the two activities, if you don't evaluate researchers and engineers with different criteria, you run the risk of killing breakthrough innovation,” LeCun stated.He further emphasised that true breakthroughs require “teams with a long horizon and minimal constraints from product development and management.”LeCun pointed to the history of scientific and technological progress, arguing that the most impactful innovations came from dedicated research labs that were distinct from engineering divisions.“The industry research labs of yore that have left an indelible mark on scientific and technological progress (Bell Labs Area 11, IBM Research, Xerox PARC, etc) were all research divisions that were clearly separate from engineering divisions,” he said.LeCun’s response came two days after Musk shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) that xAI would be eliminating the “researcher” job title in favour of “engineer.”“This false nomenclature of 'researcher' and 'engineer', which is a thinly-masked way of describing a two-tier engineering system, is being deleted from @xAI today. Researcher is a relic term from academia,” Musk wrote.Musk is not the first to challenge this distinction. Other major AI companies have also moved away from the traditional “researcher” title. In a 2023 post on X, OpenAI president Greg Brockman said the company preferred to avoid such rigid buckets and instead uses the title “Member of Technical Staff.”Anthropic, the creator of the Claude AI model, also uses the same title, with its careers page stating, “While there's historically been a division between engineering and research in machine learning, we think that boundary has dissolved with the advent of large models.”","Yann LeCun, Meta’s chief AI scientist, has openly disagreed with Elon Musk's latest move at his startup, xAI.

The report finds 81% of Indians spend more than three hours a day overthinking, while 42% assume the worst when their boss sends a one-word “Ok” reply. Even simple tasks—like deciding what to eat—trigger more stress than choosing political leaders, with 63% saying picking a dish at a restaurant is harder than selecting an election candidate.Social media adds to the mental load: 61% of respondents say they overthink for at least five hours when uploading stories, worrying about everything from music and filters to how quickly others view their posts.“Through the Center Fresh India Overthinking Report , our aim was to decode how overthinking manifests in today’s hyper-connected world—and the insights are eye-opening. Whether it’s second-guessing a message or overanalysing a dinner choice, overthinking has quietly become an everyday habit, cutting across ages and regions.

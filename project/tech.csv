JioHotstar plans

JioStar, aiming to maximize viewership for the 2025 Indian Premier League (IPL), is reportedly in active discussions with Reliance Jio , Bharti Airtel , and Vodafone Idea (Vi) to bundle its streaming subscriptions with their data plans. This strategic move is crucial as live sports, including IPL, are now behind a paywall. According to a report in Economic Times, ""With live sports now behind a paywall, the partnerships will be key to JioStar’s goal of reaching over 1 billion viewers across television and digital platforms for the upcoming IPL. In 2024, IPL viewership touched 620 million on JioCinema and 541 million on the Star Sports network.""Industry experts anticipate these bundles will significantly boost telecom data consumption, mirroring the surge witnessed when live cricket was freely available on JioCinema and Disney+ Hotstar. ""These telecom partnerships will help JioHotstar reach a large internet audience base, especially now that it’s behind a paywall,"" an executive involved in the talks told ET, indicating discussions encompass both mobile and home broadband deals.The IPL 2025 is a critical event for JioStar, formed through the merger of Disney’s Star India and Reliance’s Viacom18. The company aims to secure Rs 4,500 crore in advertising revenue and has already onboarded 20 sponsors, capitalizing on IPL's extensive reach.The transition to paid streaming on JioHotstar, which boasts over 50 million paid subscribers and 500 million total users, is expected to drive growth in India’s subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) market. Media Partners Asia reports that India’s SVOD subscriptions rebounded to 125 million in 2024 and are projected to continue growing.Notably, JioHotstar's content deal with Airtel recently expired, making its renewal a priority, especially following the successful ICC Champions Trophy 2025, which saw over 5.4 billion views, with the India vs New Zealand final reaching 1.24 billion views and a peak concurrency of 61.2 million.As of December, India's telecom subscriber base included 476.58 million for Jio, 289.31 million for Airtel, and 126.38 million for Vi, according to TRAI data. Jio currently offers JioHotstar access with select prepaid plans, including a three-month subscription. Sources indicate that Airtel and Vi are expected to introduce similar JioHotstar bundled plans upon finalizing their agreements, ensuring seamless access to IPL and other content.JioHotstar, owned by JioStar -- a joint venture of Reliance Industries, Disney, and Bodhi Tree Systems—offers tiered subscription plans: Mobile (Rs 499/year), Super (Rs 899/year), and Premium (Rs 1,499/year). The Premium plan is ad-free, except for live events.","JioStar is reportedly in active discussions with Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, and Vodafone Idea (Vi) to bundle its streaming subscriptions with their data plans.

When Adobe CEO asked America's largest Bank JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon: What helped him develop as a leader,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-adobe-ceo-asked-americas-largest-bank-jpmorgan-chase-ceo-jamie-dimon-what-helped-him-develop-as-a-leader/articleshow/119270251.cms,"Jamie Dimon, CEO, JPMorgan

On Wednesday, March 20, during the second day of the Adobe Summit, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the America's largest bank, took the stage to discuss tariffs, the economy, geopolitics, and his perspective on effective leadership. In a fireside chat with Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen , Dimon reportedly addressed an audience of 12,000 marketers, practitioners, and executives, admitting, ""I'm not used to speaking in front of 12,000 people.""According to a report in Fortune, when asked about his development as a leader, Dimon outlined four key principles. First, he emphasized the importance of honest and direct assessment, stating, ""A lot of companies don't do that,"" which leads to complacency and a lack of transparency about performance. ""Don't try to use numbers to prove what you think,"" he advised. ""Try to use numbers to understand what you are doing.""Second, Dimon stressed the need for an effective leadership team, warning against those who are disorganized and fail to fulfill their responsibilities. ""They may be great people, just don't let them run something because they'll be a disaster,"" he quipped.Humility was Dimon's third piece of advice. ""People know when you care about them,"" he said, emphasizing the importance of genuineness and treating everyone with respect, from the janitorial staff to the CEO.Finally, Dimon highlighted the necessity of grit in leadership, especially when faced with constant challenges. ""You have to say 'absolutely not,' or 'absolutely, take the chance—go for it,'"" he asserted.As the head of a bank managing $4 trillion in assets and moving over $10 trillion daily worldwide with approximately 300,000 employees, Dimon also addressed innovation at scale. He reportedly credited technology as a driving force behind human progress, from agriculture to AI, and emphasized the importance of leadership discussions about technological innovation. Dimon cited Lori Beer, JPMorgan Chase's global chief information officer, who reports to him and the president, as an example of how he engages with his team on questions like, ""What are you doing? What are you building? How are you competing? How are you using new technology? How are you using Adobe?""","Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, spoke at the Adobe Summit.

"Elon Musk’s Go-to man at DOGE is SpaceX's 22nd employee, who has also worked at Tesla and Twitter. Meet ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-go-to-man-at-doge-is-spacex-22nd-employee-who-has-also-worked-at-tesla-and-twitter-meet-/articleshow/119267474.cms,"Elon Musk departs the Capitol following a meeting with Senate Republicans

Elon Musk's go-to man Steve Davis ""hates wastage""

From pioneering space exploration at SpaceX to reshaping social media at Twitter (now X), Steve Davis has been a constant figure in Elon Musk’s orbit for over two years. Now, the 45-year-old engineer faces his most ambitious challenge yet: Helping the world’s richest man streamline the US government. According to a recent New York Times article, Davis has emerged as the de-facto day-to-day leader of the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), a bold cost-cutting initiative given to Elon Musk by the US President Donald Trump.Davis’s relationship with Musk began more than 20 years ago when, as a Stanford aerospace engineering student, he was handpicked by Musk to join SpaceX as its 22nd employee. Since then, Davis has become one of Musk’s most trusted confidants, earning a reputation as a relentless cost-cutter and a problem-solver willing to tackle any task—no matter how daunting or unfamiliar. “Steve is like chemo,” Musk reportedly said during a transition meeting before Trump’s inauguration. “A little chemo can save your life; a lot of chemo could kill you.” For Musk, Davis embodies the ideal employee: an engineer with an unwavering work ethic and a knack for eliminating waste, even if it means ruffling feathers or slashing jobs.According to an article in Fortune, former colleagues describe Davis as someone who thrives on challenges, diving into projects with little regard for his own expertise -- or lack thereof -- in a given area. This tenacity has made him indispensable to Musk across multiple ventures, from SpaceX to The Boring Company and X. At The Boring Company, where Davis served as a top executive, ex-employees recall his hands-on approach to efficiency. Typically dressed in jeans and a ball cap, he demanded long hours and a high work ethic from his team, scrutinizing every expense -- no matter how small. Spreadsheets and documents were confined to free tools like Google Suite, and even minor outlays faced intense pushback. “He hates waste,” one former employee told Fortune, noting that Davis insisted on being involved in all decision-making.This cost-cutting ethos reportedly followed Davis to Twitter, where he took on a similar role after Musk’s acquisition of the platform. “He was the one in charge of finding everything we were spending money on, who we don’t need, what offices we can close,” a former Twitter employee recounted, speaking anonymously to Fortune. Davis’s meticulous oversight kept budgets tight, though it sometimes slowed decision-making as every expense required his approval.Now, as Musk turns his attention to DOGE, Davis’s track record makes him a natural fit for the role. In the lead-up to Trump’s inauguration, his name surfaced in reports by Bloomberg and the New York Times as a central figure in Musk’s latest mission to slash government bloat. Colleagues who have worked closely with Davis believe he’s capable of executing Musk’s vision, no matter how ambitious or impractical it might seem to outsiders.“He’d be able to carry out any task Musk gave him,” one colleague old the publication, acknowledging that such determination could come at the cost of jobs or entrenched systems. For Musk, who once likened Davis’s waste-eliminating prowess to a life-saving treatment, the stakes are high. DOGE represents a chance to apply the same efficiency-driven mindset that transformed SpaceX and X to the sprawling bureaucracy of the federal government. Whether Davis’s “Chemo” approach will cure inefficiencies or prove too aggressive remains to be seen.",Steve Davis is the de-facto day-to-day leader of the Department of Government Efficiency. The initiative was given to Musk by US President Donald Trump.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently said that students entering a workforce increasingly reliant on AI should focus on mastering AI tools . In an interview with Stratechery's Ben Thompson, Altman said “The obvious tactical thing is just get really good at using AI tools. Like when I was graduating as a senior from high school, the obvious tactical thing was get really good at coding. And this is the new version of that.""Altman also addressed the long-term impact of AI on software engineering jobs .""My basic assumption is that each software engineer will just do much, much more for a while. And then at some point, yeah, maybe we do need less software engineers,"" he said, referencing OpenAI’s hiring strategy.He added that AI-driven job displacement would not happen suddenly but would accelerate over time.""It kind of just seeps through the economy and mostly kind of like eats things little by little and then faster and faster,"" Altman said.For students preparing for careers, Altman recommended focusing on adaptability and the ability to learn rather than specific technical skills.""Whatever specific thing you're going to learn, like learn these general skills that seem like they're going to be important as the world goes through this transition,"" he said.During the interview, Altman said that AI is already responsible for a significant share of coding work. ""I think in many companies, it's probably past 50% now,"" Altman said in the interview. ""But the big thing I think will come with agentic coding, which no one's doing for real yet.""When asked about barriers to agentic coding, Altman responded, ""Oh, we just need a little longer,"" adding that the issue was related to AI models rather than product development.","ChatGPT-maker OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently said that students entering a workforce increasingly reliant on AI should focus on mastering AI tools.

What YouTube said about the issue



“We're aware some of you are experiencing lower than usual video quality when trying to watch Videos and Shorts.

Here's what you might be seeing:

YouTube streaming at 144p or 360p despite strong internet connection

Buffering when changing to higher quality

Video quality could be impacted on IOS mobile, desktop, or Smart TV

Rest assured, we're actively looking into this!

We'll update this thread with new information as soon as it becomes available. Thanks for your patience!”

Google-owned streaming service YouTube has confirmed that it is aware of an issue about blurry videos. The platform has acknowledged the problem which is showing iPhone users some videos at 144p or 360p, even with a strong internet connection, resulting in a blurry picture. Users have also reported that increasing the quality causes the video to buffer. As per the user reports, the problem is occurring on iOS devices, desktop web browsers and smart TVs. Users took to the outage tracking site Downdetector and YouTube Help page to report the issue. However, YouTube said that it is currently investigating the issue and will fix it soon.On its support page where over 7,000 users have reported facing the problem, YouTube team member Camila wrote:Recently, Google rolled out a fix for second-generation Chromecast and Chromecast Audio devices that stopped working for some users. This issue blocked users from casting content to their devices as they showed ""Untrusted device"" errors.While Google has not officially confirmed the cause, it is believed that an expired certificate—reported to have expired earlier this month when users started facing problems—may have been responsible for the issue.","YouTube has confirmed that it is aware of an issue about blurry videos.

Sridhar Vembu’s comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress , emphasizing the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s recent expansion in Kerala. The image in the party’s post shows a tombstone design to symbolically critique the ""Make in India"" initiative, suggesting it has failed between 2014 and 2025. The tombstone features the Indian lion emblem and the phrase ""Rest in Peace.""The post is captioned “In loving memory of….”. Responding to the post, Vembu emphasized the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s expansion in Kerala. He wrote:“Meanwhile companies like us Make in India (and started making in Kerala recently too).”“Make in India is gaining momentum and we have to make up for several lost decades. Reflect on why they were ""lost decades"" and perhaps you will appreciate Make in India better,” he further added.Zoho has been expanding its operations across India, including in Kerala. The company has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas as part of its broader strategy.The Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports. Several companies, including Zoho, have increased their domestic production efforts as part of this initiative.Vembu’s response comes amid ongoing discussions on India's economic policies and industrial growth, with businesses and policymakers debating the impact of past and present strategies.Vembu recently drew a comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods, highlighting their long-term impact on economic structures. In a recent post, he discussed how capital inflows into a single sector can divert resources from others, weakening overall economic capabilities.Citing Silicon Valley as an example, Vembu pointed out the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, attributing them to a talent shift toward sectors with higher financial incentives. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now – for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors overlooked the sector due to the absence of large exits.Drawing a parallel to India, Vembu noted that the long-standing dominance of the IT industry resulted in the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he stated.He stressed the importance of addressing these gaps and rebuilding capabilities in affected sectors. ""We have to make up for lost time,"" he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress.

Air Canada and Thales issue joint statement

JetBlue, British Airways and Swiss Airlines have faced similar issues in the past

Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories.” According to a report in CNN, Air Canada's Boeing 737 MAX fleet were found to have moving maps — part of the in flight entertainment (IFE) system — that did not show Israel as a state, but replaced it with the name "" Palestinian territories ."" The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.The discrepancy, first noticed by a passenger, involved maps produced for French aerospace group Thales. Air Canada and Thales issued a joint statement acknowledging the error and stating that the issue has been ""resolved."" ""It was brought to the attention of Air Canada that the interactive map on its Boeing 737 fleet did not consistently portray certain Middle Eastern boundaries, including those of the State of Israel, at all amplification levels,"" the statement said. ""Air Canada’s policy in general is to display only city names on the maps in its aircraft, and the configuration on this particular system was not compliant with this policy."" Thales added in a separate statement that the map had been provided by a third party.The map feature was promptly disabled, and an updated version will be installed across the fleet starting March 14. Air Canada and Thales apologized for the ""unease created by this situation.""This is not the first time such an issue has occurred in aviation. JetBlue apologized for a similar map error in 2024, and British Airways faced a similar situation in 2013. In 2018, SWISS confirmed its policy of turning off maps entirely when landing in Tel Aviv after a similar incident. Thales stated that the maps are supplied by a third party and that they are working with the airline and the provider to resolve the issue quickly.","Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories” The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.

Baidu has unveiled its AI model, Ernie X1, which is designed to articulate its reasoning process. The Ernie X1 model operates on similar principles to DeepSeek R1 , a model that garnered significant attention in Silicon Valley for its ability to deliver comparable performance to leading chatbots at a significantly lower development cost. Baidu emphasises that its reasoning model excels in areas such as daily dialogue, complex calculations, and logical deduction, as per a report.Bloomberg reports that in addition to the Ernie X1 launch, China's leading internet search provider has upgraded its flagship foundation model to Ernie 4.5 . Notably, the company has made all tiers of its AI service, including the X1 model, freely accessible to its chatbot users, accelerating its initial plans by several weeks.Baidu claims that Ernie 4.5 outperforms OpenAI's latest GPT 4.5 in text generation, citing various industry benchmarks. Baidu has also announced its intention to make its Ernie AI models open-source starting June 30. The company has also integrated the R1 model into its core search engine business.This launch appears to be a strategic move to regain momentum in the competitive AI landscape, where Baidu faces increasing pressure from emerging rivals such as DeepSeek, the report added.While Baidu was the first major Chinese tech company to introduce a ChatGPT-like chatbot, it has since faced stiff competition from rivals like TikTok parent company ByteDance and Moonshot AI. Furthermore, open-source models such as Alibaba's Qwen and DeepSeek have received recognition within the global developer community, the report added.The generative AI boom has positively impacted Baidu's financial performance, with a 26% increase in cloud revenue reported in its December-quarter results. This growth, driven by services provided to developers seeking computing power, was somewhat offset by weaker advertising sales amidst China's challenging economic conditions.","Baidu has unveiled its new Ernie X1 AI model, designed to articulate its reasoning process.

Facebook’s extreme measures in India

A ""low-ranking official,"" or as some say an office Babu at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Meta (then Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and some of the 'brightest tech minds' in his team with nothing more than a single click, according to explosive claims in a newly released memoir by former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams.The David versus Goliath moment allegedly occurred in 2016 during Facebook's aggressive push to save its controversial Free Basics program in India, which was facing regulatory scrutiny for potentially violating net neutrality principles.""Mark and some of the brightest tech minds in the world devoted months to this [outreach strategy], and some low-ranking official in India outfoxed them simply by clicking an opt-out box,"" Wynn-Williams writes in her book ""Careless People,"" which Meta is currently trying to block from publication.The memoir details how Facebook deployed its full arsenal of technological and political influence to sway public opinion about Free Basics. When India's Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) opened public consultations on whether such programs should be banned, Facebook allegedly orchestrated an unprecedented pressure campaign.""Our policy team is directly engaged with the government, include Prime Minister Modi's office,"" Wynn-Williams quotes then-COO Sheryl Sandberg as writing in an internal email. ""We're lucky this is happening in a place where we have very deep senior relationships in the government, but it's still going to be hard.""According to the book, Facebook's strategy focused on creating ""the appearance of public support"" through automated emails. The social media giant allegedly turned on a ""megaphone that Mark wouldn't let Sheryl use for [promoting] organ donation"" to nudge Indian users into sending approximately 16 million supportive emails to TRAI.The jugaad – a Hindi term for an innovative, improvised solution – came when Facebook discovered their millions of automated emails weren't being counted. ""Someone at TRAI—whoever controlled the email address for the public comments — simply opted out of all emails from Facebook,"" writes Wynn-Williams.The book makes other startling claims about Facebook's operations in India, including that the company hired an ""ex-police captain"" who would ""go to jail in a clash between Facebook and the Indian government"" if executives were targeted in government raids.Meta has dismissed the book as containing ""out-of-date and previously reported claims"" and ""false accusations about our executives."" A spokesperson told The Hindu that ""Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behaviour,"" claiming she ""has been paid by anti-Facebook activists.""Despite Meta's arbitration efforts to halt its publication and promotion in the US, ""Careless People"" remains available for purchase in India. The company has not specifically contested the claims regarding its operations in India detailed in the memoir.Free Basics was ultimately prohibited in India for violating net neutrality principles, representing a rare defeat for Zuckerberg's global expansion ambitions.",Former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams claims a 'low-ranking official' at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Mark Zuckerberg and his team.

Apple streaming service , Apple TV+, is reportedly still a money drain for the company even five years after its launch. This is despite the streamer having a big cultural moment due to the popularity of Severance’s second season. A report by The Information that analysed the state of Apple TV+ as a business claimed that the Cupertino-based tech giant is still losing over $1 billion per year. However, the report also mentions that Apple TV+ had 45 million subscribers last year while the platform may have also recently added two million new subscribers in a single month. Apple has also been reportedly tightening its spending, particularly within its film division. Despite successes like CODA— which became the first streaming movie to win the Best Picture Oscar—several theatrical setbacks led the company to reduce budgets and shift focus toward direct-to-streaming releases.On the TV show front, although some budget cuts may be underway, Apple appears willing to absorb losses from Apple TV+ as it builds the service. It's common for streaming platforms to incur losses initially before becoming profitable and Apple is well-positioned to sustain these early challenges, the report claims.While a $1 billion loss is significant, it's relatively low in comparison to Apple's overall profitability. For example, in the last quarter, Apple generated $124 billion in revenue with $36 billion in profit. Thus, while a $1 billion annual loss is notable, it isn’t as alarming as it may seem.Apple TV+ is available for $9.99 per month and offers popular shows and films like Ted Lasso, Severance, The Morning Show, Silo and Shrinking, with several free viewing options also provided.","Apple TV+ is still losing over $1 billion per year, according to a report.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently called Huawei as the “single most formidable technology company” in China. Speaking to the Financial Times, Huang noted Huawei’s increasing influence in artificial intelligence (AI). He said “Huawei's presence in AI is growing every single year”, adding “We can't assume they are not going to be a factor.”Huawei has been at the center of US-China trade tensions for years. During his first term, Donald Trump called the company a “national security threat”, stating that his administration wouldn't do business with Huawei. In 2019, the Trump administration blacklisted the company, restricting its ability to acquire US technology.These measures were extended under President Joe Biden, who imposed additional export controls on China’s semiconductor industry, targeting Huawei and 140 other firms.Founded in 1987 by former People’s Liberation Army engineer Ren Zhengfei, Huawei started as a reseller of telephone switch equipment before moving into telecom manufacturing.Huang also criticized US efforts to curb Huawei, stating they were “done poorly.” He told the publication: “They have conquered every market they've engaged”, acknowledging the company’s ability to thrive despite global restrictions.In another news, Huang recently denied any involvement in a potential consortium to acquire a stake in Intel. Speaking at Intel’s annual developer conference in San Jose, California, Huang stated that neither he nor his company had been approached about such a deal.“Nobody's invited us to a consortium. Nobody invited me. Maybe other people are involved, but I don't know. There might be a party. I wasn't invited,” Huang said, dismissing the speculation.His comments follow a Reuters report earlier this month that claimed Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) was in talks with Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD about investing in a joint venture to manage Intel's factories.","Jensen Huang called Huawei the ‘single most formidable technology company’ in China.

Deloitte principal Jillian Wanner recently said that the consultants must adopt an ""engineering-first mindset"" to stay competitive. Speaking at Nvidia’s GTC conference, Wanner said “It is no longer acceptable at Deloitte to not take an engineering-first mindset. Employees need to be technologists and engineers first, and consultants second.” The IT consulting firm recently partnered with Nvidia to implement digital AI agents and announced a collaboration with the chipmaker to develop its new reasoning models and software.Wanner noted a rapid acceleration in the adoption of generative AI among Deloitte’s federal clients over the past year.“There has been a wholehearted embrace of rethinking tasks that require intensive, manual steps,” she said. Wanner stated that administrative and documentation tasks can be automated using AI-powered agents. She said “we can start to immediately empower agents, or generative AI solutions, or platforms, that can start to automate a lot of these functions.”Adding further, she noted, “There's a significant amount of low-hanging fruit that could translate into some pretty significant value.”Deloitte is among several major consulting firms that have invested heavily in AI transformation , both internally and for clients.

NPCI’s Big change to UPI

Shark Tank India judge Anupam Mittal has called for leveraging India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) to challenge global payment giants like Visa and Mastercard. In a post on X, Mittal highlighted how UPI has enabled ""global-scale frictionless & costless transactions"" in India. He further suggested that it is time to disrupt companies like Visa, Mastercard and even banks that charge transaction fees ranging from 2-5% on a multi-trillion dollar payment industry.In his post, the People Group founder urged the National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) to take action, stating, ""India-tech for the world is ready. What are we waiting for?""In the post, Mittal said:UPI, launched in 2016, has transformed digital payments in India by offering instant, low-cost transactions. It has also expanded globally, with partnerships in countries like Singapore, UAE, and France. His statement comes amid growing discussions on reducing reliance on foreign payment systems and strengthening India's fintech presence on a global scale.In another news, NPCI has begun gradually eliminating the 'Collect Payments' feature from the UPI platform to address growing fraud concerns, according to banking officials familiar with the matter. An Economic Times report states that this pull-based payment method, which allows merchants to request money directly from users' UPI apps, has become increasingly vulnerable to scams. Under the new directive, pull payments will be restricted to only large, verified merchants, while person-to-person collect requests will be capped at Rs 2,000.","Anupam Mittal has called for leveraging India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) to challenge global payment giants like Visa and Mastercard.

An article celebrating Robinson’s remarkable journey, titled “Sports Heroes Who Served: Baseball Great Jackie Robinson Was WWII Soldier,” displayed a “Page Not Found” message in place of the article for much of the Wednesday.John Ullyot, a Pentagon spokesperson, said in a statement to the media that “DEI is dead at the Defense Department,” adding that he was pleased with the department’s “rapid compliance” with a directive ordering diversity-related content removed from all platforms.“In the rare cases that content is removed — either deliberately or by mistake — that is out of the clearly outlined scope of the directive, we instruct the components and they correct the content accordingly,” he added.He did not specify if the dissaperace of the MLP page too was part of the same.“Secretary Hegseth has made it clear that DEI has no place in the Defense Department,” Ullyot told The Independent. “Discriminatory Equity Ideology (DEI) represents a strain of Woke cultural Marxism that undermines our military. It fosters division, weakens unit cohesion, and detracts from the services’ primary warfighting mission. We’re encouraged by the swift compliance throughout the Department in removing DEI content from all platforms.”Ullyot also did not specify whether the page’s removal was a direct result of President Donald Trump’s executive order prohibiting DEI in federal programme.",Webpage honoring Jackie Robinson on Pentagon website disappeared on Wednesday.

Netflix's $100 million partnership with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle

Jimmy Fallon makes fun of Meghan Markle

Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos recently weighed in on the controversy surrounding Meghan Markle and her new lifestyle series, With Love, Meghan . Speaking to Variety, Sarandos discussed Netflix's role in the relaunch of the Duchess of Sussex’s company, As Ever. He said, “We’re a passive partner in Meghan’s company. Sarandos, who has been Netflix CEO described the collaboration as a “big discovery model” for Netflix, highlighting the company’s evolving approach.When asked why he chose to invest in Meghan, Sarandos pointed to her underestimated cultural influence. “When we released the trailer for the Harry & Meghan docuseries [in 2022], every detail was picked apart in the press for days,” he said. He noted how items like the shoes Meghan wore and the Hermès blanket in the background sold out globally, underscoring her impact. “People are fascinated with Meghan Markle,” he added. “She and Harry are overly dismissed.”The partnership between Netflix and the Sussexes, valued at $100 million and signed five years ago, has already yielded projects like the Harry & Meghan docuseries, Polo, and Heart of Invictus. Meghan’s latest show, recently renewed for a second season, features her sharing hosting and cooking insights from her Montecito, California kitchen. Guests include high-profile names like Mindy Kaling from The Office, Abigail Spencer from Suits, and renowned chefs Alice Waters and Roy Choi.Incidentally, Meghan also has been facing significant public criticism recently. Jimmy Fallon just joined the ranks of celebrities poking fun at Meghan Markle, cracking a joke about her crafting her own pretzel bags on her Netflix series. On Monday's episode of The Tonight Show on NBC, Fallon’s co-host Steve Higgins quizzed the 50-year-old during a 'Trivia Night' segment. Higgins asked, ""Here’s one you’ll get: What’s the top question that baffles scientists?"" Fallon guessed, ""Is there life on another planet?"" Higgins shot back, ""No, it’s ‘Why does Meghan Markle make her own pretzel bags?’ They can’t figure it out."" The crowd burst into laughter, and Fallon grinned, adding, ""That’s fascinating. She just moves them from one bag to another, and it’s got everyone stumped.""Meanwhile, Meghan faced fresh criticism from comedian Katherine Ryan, who once stood up for her. On Ryan’s podcast ""Telling Everybody Everything"" yesterday, the Canadian comic called out the Duchess of Sussex, alleging she wasn’t truthful about knowing who Prince Harry was before they started dating.","Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos said the company is a passive partner in Meghan Markle's company, As Ever.

""We're in it. We are now running production silicon in Arizona,”

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has confirmed that his company had not been approached about purchasing a stake in Intel. He made this statement during a press conference at the US-based chip maker’s annual developer conference in San Jose, California. Huang said this when he was asked whether Nvidia was part of a consortium with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co to buy Intel.“Nobody's invited us to a consortium. Nobody invited me. Maybe other people are involved, but I don't know. There might be a party. I wasn't invited,” Huang said dismissing the rumours.This statement follows a report by the news agency Reuters shared earlier this month that claimed TSMC having talks with other chipmakers like Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) about investing in a joint venture to manage Intel's factories.Rumours also suggested that Intel, with support from US President Donald Trump, was exploring a plan to spin off its manufacturing operations and transfer control to a consortium that included TSMC.At the event, Huang downplayed concerns about AI chip demand , stating that orders for 3.6 million Blackwell chips from major cloud providers underestimated total demand, as they excluded Meta and smaller firms.Meta, a key Nvidia customer, plans to use Blackwell chips for training its Llama AI models and is set to invest up to $65 billion in AI infrastructure this year, largely on Nvidia chips.Huang also addressed investor concerns after China's DeepSeek developed a competitive AI chatbot with fewer chips, arguing that AI’s growing focus on reasoning would drive higher computational demand.He also highlighted that higher tariffs under Trump would have little short-term impact but indicated plans to shift production to the US in the long run, however, he didn’t specify a timeline.Meanwhile, TSMC also announced a new $100 billion investment to build five additional chip facilities in the US.Huang said referring to TSMC's new chip fabrication facility in Arizona.In December 2024, TSMC was also reportedly in talks with Nvidia to manufacture its Blackwell chips at its new Arizona facility.","Jensen Huang said his company had not been approached about purchasing a stake in Intel.

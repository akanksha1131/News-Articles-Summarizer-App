Google may have to pay Rs 36 lakh for these YouTube videos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-may-have-to-pay-rs-36-lakh-for-these-youtube-videos/articleshow/118343631.cms,"Russia denies YouTube download speed allegations

This Google fine in Russia exceeded the ‘entire world's GDP’

A Russian court has fined Google 3.8 million roubles (nearly Rs 36 lakhs) for some YouTube videos, a report claims. Russian news agency TASS (via Reuters) reports that these videos allegedly instructed Russian soldiers on how to surrender.This fine is part of an ongoing effort by the country to pressure foreign tech companies to remove content it deems illegal, including information it considers to be ""fakes"" about the war in Ukraine.Google has yet to share an official comment about this fineAccording to Reuters, some critics have also claimed that Russian authorities are intentionally slowing down YouTube's download speeds to hinder access to content critical of President Vladimir Putin and his government.However, Russia has denied the allegation, claiming that the issue to Google's failure to upgrade its equipment — which the company and other technology experts disputed.In December 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Google of being a tool used by the US government for political gains, the report added.In November 2024, a Moscow court fined Google a staggering $20 decillion (a 2 followed by 33 zeros) for failing to restore banned pro-Kremlin YouTube channels. This fine, which exceeds Google's market value and even the entire world's GDP, is the result of accumulated penalties that began in 2020 and doubled weekly under Russian law.The penalty stems from Google's refusal to reinstate YouTube accounts of Russian state media and pro-government channels blocked after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. While acknowledging the astronomical and symbolic nature of the fine,“Although it is a specific amount, I cannot even pronounce this number, it is rather filled with symbolism,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said to reporters.17 Russian TV channels, including state-run and military broadcasters, filed legal claims against Google to enforce court rulings in multiple countries.In 2022, Google's Russian subsidiary went bankrupt after authorities seized its bank accounts, though its free services remain operational.",A Russian court has fined Google 3.8 million roubles (nearly Rs 36 lakhs) for some YouTube videos.

DeepSeek continues to face a ban. The latest country to announce restrictions on China's AI chatbot Deep Seek is South Korea . The South Korean government has temporarily suspended new downloads of DeepSeek over concerns about its data collection practices. The suspension will remain in place until regulators confirm the app complies with South Korean personal information protection laws. DeepSeek has rapidly gained global popularity since its launch last month, topping download charts in several countries across the world including South Korea. DAs of Monday night, the app was unavailable on Apple and Google app stores in South Korea, though it remained accessible via a web browser. The country’s Personal Information Protection Commission cited concerns over how DeepSeek processes user data and stated that addressing these issues would require significant time. In response, DeepSeek recently appointed an agent in South Korea to work with regulators.Responding to the ban on DeepSeek, China urged South Korea against “politicizing” trade issues after Seoul said it has suspended new downloads of the Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) app DeepSeek over concerns about its data collection practices.

In a world where artificial intelligence (AI) and deepfake technology are advancing rapidly, renowned paranormal expert Athos Salomé , widely known as the ‘Living Nostradamus’ has issued a dire warning about the unprecedented risks these innovations pose to society. Salomé’s predictions highlight the potential threats AI and deepfakes present to various sectors, including politics, security, and personal privacy. His forecast underscores how AI-driven advancements, which are blurring the lines between reality and fabricated content, could lead to devastating consequences on a global scale. In an era where AI-generated content is growing increasingly sophisticated, Salomé's cautions could not be more timely.Deepfake technology refers to the use of artificial intelligence to create manipulated videos and audio recordings that are highly realistic yet entirely fabricated. The term “deepfake” is derived from the combination of “deep learning,” an AI technique, and “fake,” reflecting its ability to generate deceptive and hyper-realistic content.While deepfakes have been utilised for harmless entertainment or creative expression, their potential for misuse is growing. From impersonating public figures to manipulating video evidence, deepfakes have already been exploited for malicious purposes. Athos Salomé has pointed out that as the technology continues to improve, it will become increasingly difficult to distinguish real from fake content, posing significant risks in several areas, including politics, financial security, and personal reputation.Artificial intelligence, which has revolutionized various fields, has also found its way into cybersecurity. AI algorithms are being used to detect cyber threats, monitor systems for vulnerabilities, and protect sensitive data from malicious attacks. However, Salomé warns that these same AI advancements can be exploited by cybercriminals.With AI, cyberattacks have become more automated and sophisticated. AI-driven phishing scams can mimic communication styles of individuals, making them more believable and harder to identify. Furthermore, AI-powered malware can adapt and evolve to breach even the most secure systems, stealing personal information, financial data, or intellectual property.This duality of AI – its potential for both good and evil – is what Salomé finds particularly concerning. He believes that the same tools being used to enhance cybersecurity are equally accessible to those with malicious intent, potentially creating new types of threats that were previously unimagined.The widespread misuse of AI, particularly in the form of deepfake technology, has the potential to destabilize political systems across the globe. Salomé underscores the dangers that AI-generated content poses to election integrity and the spread of misinformation. Deepfakes can be used to manipulate public opinion, sway voters, and discredit political figures by fabricating scandals or controversial statements.The implications extend beyond elections. Salomé emphasizes the risk of AI-driven disinformation campaigns that could manipulate geopolitical events, sow division among nations, and even trigger conflicts. For example, a fabricated video of a world leader could lead to diplomatic tensions or military escalations.In an increasingly polarized world, where the dissemination of information is both rapid and wide-reaching, AI-generated deception could challenge the very fabric of political stability, threatening societal peace and security.Salomé’s predictions highlight the urgent need for a global framework to regulate AI development. Without strict ethical guidelines and oversight, the proliferation of AI-powered threats could spiral out of control. While AI offers numerous benefits, Salomé argues that it is crucial to strike a balance between innovation and accountability.Governments, tech companies, and cybersecurity agencies must work together to establish policies that ensure transparency and fairness in AI development. Salomé advocates for the implementation of advanced AI detection systems capable of identifying deepfakes and other AI-generated threats. Furthermore, regulatory bodies should ensure that AI is developed with an ethical framework that prioritizes human well-being and the preservation of truth in information dissemination.AI's potential to alter the course of history and society as a whole cannot be ignored. As such, it is imperative to develop a regulatory environment that keeps pace with technological advancements to prevent misuse and safeguard against harmful consequences.Athos Salomé emphasises the importance of international cooperation in combating the misuse of AI. He argues that AI-driven threats are not limited by borders, and thus, global collaboration is essential to developing solutions that protect citizens worldwide. Governments, tech industries, and security agencies must unite to share intelligence, develop countermeasures, and create uniform regulations that tackle the ethical and security challenges posed by AI and deepfake technology.Salomé's warnings are a call to action for policymakers to take a proactive stance in addressing the potential dangers of AI. While the benefits of artificial intelligence are clear, the responsibility to ensure its safe and ethical use falls on the shoulders of all stakeholders in society.","Paranormal expert Athos Salomé has issued a dire warning about the unprecedented risks these innovations pose to society.

“Feel like going to Providence [Rhode Island] tonight?”

Ashley St. Clair's secret pregnancy and life in isolation



“I was told to keep it secret. I was being asked to keep it a secret forever. I was completely isolated during my pregnancy. Every part of my career and everything I used to do, I couldn’t do anymore. I was told not to tell anybody.”

Conservative influencer and author Ashley St. Clair recently made headlines after claiming she gave birth to Elon Musk ’s 13th child five months ago. The revelation, shared via social media, sparked widespread debate, but St. Clair has now provided more details in an exclusive interview with the New York Post. The 26-year-old described her alleged romance with the Tesla and SpaceX CEO as a secretive affair, stating that Musk, 53, wanted to keep their child hidden for security reasons.According to St. Clair, their relationship began with online exchanges that led to in-person meetings and eventually a pregnancy she was told to keep confidential. While Musk has not publicly confirmed or denied the claim, St. Clair maintains that their child exists and has even met some of Musk’s other children and his mother, Maye Musk.St. Clair claims her connection with Musk started on X (formerly Twitter), the social media platform he acquired in 2022. Their interaction allegedly began with Musk reacting to her posts, which eventually led to direct messages between them.St. Clair told the New York Post.At the time, St. Clair had no particular interest in Musk beyond his involvement with Twitter, but their conversations became more frequent. She stated that Musk eventually asked her if she ever traveled to San Francisco or Austin—two locations where he frequently works due to his commitments with Tesla, SpaceX, and X.During this period, St. Clair was working for a conservative satirical website. After Musk restored the website’s Twitter account following an eight-month suspension for making a controversial joke, she was invited to San Francisco to interview him.Following their first in-person meeting, Musk allegedly messaged her shortly after, asking:According to St. Clair, their romance took off from there.St. Clair claims that when she became pregnant, she was required to keep it an absolute secret. She was allegedly instructed not to share the news with anyone outside of a small circle of trusted individuals.She further stated that Musk provided her with a luxury apartment and heightened security measures but maintained a strict level of secrecy regarding their alleged child. She described feeling lonely throughout her pregnancy but was willing to stay silent for the safety of her child.However, as time passed, St. Clair claims that tabloids began to catch wind of her pregnancy and intended to break the story. Fearing that the media would expose the information before she could control the narrative, she decided to make a public announcement herself.On February 14, 2025, she posted on X:Her post instantly went viral, igniting widespread speculation and controversy.St. Clair claims that her child has already met some of Musk’s other 12 children. Musk has several children from previous relationships, including his twins and triplets with his first wife, Justine Wilson, as well as his children with musician Grimes and Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis.Additionally, St. Clair alleges that she has spent time with Musk’s mother, Maye Musk, though she has not disclosed further details about their interactions.Despite these claims, Musk himself has not directly commented on St. Clair’s announcement. His only public reaction has been a cryptic response to a fan’s comment on X, where he posted a laughing emoji in response to the situation being referred to as one of his many ""side quests.""The public response to St. Clair’s claims has been divided. Many social media users have expressed skepticism, demanding concrete evidence to support her statements. Others believe that Musk’s lack of a direct denial could indicate that there is some truth to her claims.Media outlets have attempted to reach Musk and his representatives for a statement, but so far, there has been no official confirmation or denial from his camp.Meanwhile, discussions about the implications of the alleged relationship continue to trend online. Some have questioned whether Musk, known for his advocacy of population growth, would have intentionally kept the birth of another child a secret. Others believe that the tech billionaire, who is constantly under public scrutiny, may have legitimate security concerns regarding his family.",Conservative influencer Ashley St. Clair claims she gave birth to Elon Musk’s 13th child five months ago.

“The SEBI circular on

API usage

and algo trading is out. What you need to know:

If you’re a retail trader using broker APIs to automate trades, you can do so as long as your order frequency is below an exchange-prescribed threshold. This limit is yet to be decided.

If you’re selling algos or strategies to other traders, you’ll need to partner with a broker and get yourself registered with the exchanges to do so.

Marketplaces, where people share algos for a fee, can’t publish strategies without exchange registration as well as an RA license.

The exchanges will publish their own circulars with operational details by April 1.”

SEBI's latest ALGO trading rules | The Daily Brief #163

What SEBI’s new algo trading rules say



Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India 's (SEBI) new rules. In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Kamath explained SEBI ’s new regulations concerning algorithmic trading for retail investors, a move that significantly alters market participation. Kamath highlighted that retail traders selling trading strategies or algorithms must now partner with a broker and register with stock exchanges. Furthermore, platforms facilitating the sharing of algorithms for a fee will need both exchange registration and a research analyst (RA) licence.In the X post, Kamath wrote:In the comment section of the post, he also shared the link to an article which explains the latest SEBI algo trading regulations in details.SEBI’s newly announced framework will allow retail investors to engage in algo trading—an opportunity previously limited to institutional players. The move comes in response to rising demand from retail participants and aims to strike a balance between accessibility and risk management.Under the updated regulations, brokers must secure exchange approval for each algorithm and ensure that all automated orders include a unique identifier for audit tracking. Any modifications to an approved algorithm will also require regulatory clearance. Retail investors developing their algorithms will only need to register them if their order execution frequency exceeds a specified threshold.SEBI has categorised algorithms into two types: “white box” algos, where the logic is transparent and replicable, and “black box” algos, which operate without disclosure. Providers of black box algos will be required to obtain a Research Analyst (RA) license and maintain detailed research documentation.Set to take effect on August 1, these new rules are expected to transform India’s algo trading landscape—expanding automation for retail traders while introducing stricter compliance measures to uphold market integrity .","Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India's new rules.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it

Akash Bobba , a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). Bobba, along with five other young engineers, was hired by Musk to modernise government systems, raising concerns about their lack of government experience and the potential security risks involved.Bobba, a graduate of UC Berkeley's elite Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (MET) program, has quickly risen through the ranks of Silicon Valley , securing internships at Meta, Palantir, and Bridgewater Associates.Known for his problem-solving skills, Bobba once rewrote an entire project overnight after a teammate accidentally deleted it just before a deadline. His former classmate Charis Zhang recalled the incident.“Let me tell you something about Akash. During a project at Berkeley, I accidentally deleted our entire codebase 2 days before the deadline. I panicked. Akash just stared at the screen, shrugged, and rewrote everything from scratch in one night—better than before. We submitted early and got first in the class. Many such stories. I trust him with everything I own,” wrote Zhang in a social media post.Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate. Critics argue that granting individuals with limited government experience access to sensitive government systems poses significant security risks. The hiring strategy has also raised questions about the competence and oversight within Musk's DOGE initiative. Reports suggest that at least four of the new DOGE hires, including Bobba, now have top-tier access to federal IT systems.Bobba isn't the only new face in Musk's government overhaul. The five other members of the DOGE team comprise a mix of recent graduates, college students, and former SpaceX interns, all of whom now have official government emails and top-level security clearances.","Akash Bobba, a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE) Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate.

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.

Asmita Patel accused of re-routing money

Securities & Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has seized Rs 53.67 crore from Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd along with five other entities. Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd is a well-known stock market training institute that offers online courses on stocks and trading. Some of the popular courses offered by the self-proclaimed ""options queen"" and ""She Wolf of Stock Market"" are ""Let's Make India Trade"" (LMIT), ""Master's in Price Action Trading"" (MPAT), and ""Options Multiplier"" (OM) .Jayesh Thakkar, a SEBI Registered Research Analyst shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) stating “SEBI has seized Rs 53.67 crore that Asmita Patel and five other related entities made illegally. Asmita Patel is also at risk of losing another Rs 104.6 crore it collected from course fees, which SEBI believes were part of unregistered advisory services.”The investigation was initiated by SEBI after receiving complaints from 42 participants of these courses. In addition to impounding the Rs 53.67 crore, SEBI has issued a show-cause notice questioning why Rs 104.6 crore, collected as fees for various programs, should not also be seized.SEBI has sent an interim order directing the school, Asmita Jitesh Patel, and Jitesh Jethalal Patel to cease offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services. The entities have also been barred from accessing the securities market.The order also uncovered that fees collected from participants were routed through entities such as King Traders (proprietor: Sagar Dhanjibhai), Gemini Enterprise (proprietor: Suresh Parmashivam), and United Enterprises (proprietor: Jigar Rameshbhai Dawada). SEBI stated that this was a regular practice and not an isolated incident, making all six entities jointly and severally liable for the Rs 53.67 crore earned from course fees.The regulator further demanded that the notices explain why they should not be ordered to disgorge Rs 104.6 crore, along with interest. SEBI's order noted that the fees collected for LMIT, MPAT, and OM courses, as well as other programs provided by the school, were earned under the guise of unregistered advisory and research analyst services.The order reads, “The aforesaid amount includes not only the amount collected as fees by the Noticees for LMIT, MPAT and Options Multiplier (OM) courses but also includes the fees collected by the Noticees for the other courses offered by the Noticee no.1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading )through which it carried out unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services along with interest”.Kamlesh Varshney, SEBI's Whole-Time Member, highlighted in the order “Examination revealed that, prima facie, the Noticee no. 1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading) along with the Noticee no.2 (Asmita Jitesh Patel) and the Notice no.3 (Jitesh Jethalal Patel) devised a scheme wherein students/investors/participants were lured to trade in specific stocks and told to open trading account with ABC Ltd.

Elon Musk-owned Tesla has significantly increased discounts on its Cybertruck in recent days as the electric pickup truck struggles with sluggish demand and rising inventory, a report has said. The automaker faced challenges selling the Cybertruck in 2024, its first full year of production.According to a report by The Economic Times, Tesla is offering discounts of up to $6,000 on available Cybertrucks in the US. This discount is, however, on Foundation Series Cybertrucks and $5,100 on non-Foundation Series Cybertrucks in its inventory. The offers apply to new 2024 model-year vehicles.Previous reports indicated Tesla resorted to removing ""Foundations Series"" badges from some Cybertrucks to market them as less expensive models and even homologated US-spec Cybertrucks for the Canadian market in an attempt to boost sales.Despite these efforts, inventory continues to accumulate in both Canada and the US. Adding to the complexity, the 2025 Cybertruck model now qualifies for the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles, while the remaining 2024 models do not.In January, Tesla offered discounts of up to $1,600 on new Cybertrucks, with the amount varying by configuration. Demo models currently in inventory were discounted even further, by up to approximately $2,600, according to online listings. Production of the distinctive, stainless-steel pickup truck has reportedly slowed recently at Tesla's Austin, Texas factory, a report by CNBC suggested.Deliveries of the Cybertruck began in 2023, years after its initial unveiling by CEO Elon Musk in 2019. Musk had originally estimated a starting price of around $40,000, but the actual base price in the US during 2024 was closer to $80,000.Despite outselling the Ford F-150 Lightning in the US last year and becoming the fifth best-selling EV domestically (per Cox Automotive data), the Cybertruck's high price, multiple recalls (including a sixth recall in November to replace defective drive inverters), and production challenges in Austin have hindered its growth.","Elon Musk-owned Tesla has significantly increased discounts on its Cybertruck in recent days.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon criticized Rohit Chopra , who served as third director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). During a recent town hall, while acknowledging that some consumer protection rules are beneficial, Dimon argued that the CFPB is redundant, as similar oversight is already provided by other agencies.According to a Business Insider report, Dimon was especially critical of Chopra, calling him ""an arrogant, out-of-touch son of a b***h"" and accusing him of making things worse for Americans. Dimon stated “They massively overstepped their authority. I think this guy — Chopra or whatever his name is — was just an arrogant, out-of-touch son of a b***h who just made things worse for a lot of Americans.”“So if they get rid of it or not makes no difference to me. It should exist, but it should be inside the OCC like it used to be, when it comes to banks,” said Dimon.He further stated “The only thing good I'll say about the CFPB is there are consumer protective rules that are good. They should be put in place to protect consumers”.Dimon recently dismissed employee complaints about the bank’s five-day return-to-office policy during a town hall meeting. According to a Reuters report, some workers had expressed frustration on internal forums and even started a petition asking Dimon to reconsider the decision. When asked about the policy during the town hall, Dimon responded firmly, saying, “Don't waste time on it. I don't care how many people sign that f***ing petition”.Dimon told employees that if they didn’t like the policy, they were free to leave, emphasizing that it’s a ""free country."" He also urged workers to focus on improving efficiency rather than complaining. “The CEO told them not to be mad at him, and said it was a free country,” the report stated.The company recently ended its hybrid work, calling more workers back to the office as COVID restrictions ease. Some workers even considered forming a union, with nearly 1,000 signing the petition against the five-day office requirement.","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon criticized Rohit Chopra, who served as third director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

The partnership between JioHotstar and Nielsen for third-party ad measurement during IPL 2025 suggests that the streaming platform may continue offering free cricket content , despite recent subscription model changes.The move to implement Nielsen's measurement systems can be seen as a strategic effort to strengthen advertising revenue rather than pivot entirely to a subscription-based model. By providing advertisers with independent verification of ad performance, JioHotstar appears to be doubling down on an advertising-supported streaming strategy.While JioHotstar has introduced paid tiers starting at Rs 149, the platform's hybrid model allows for initial free viewing. This approach, combined with the Nielsen partnership, suggests a strategy to monetize through advertising while gradually transitioning heavy users to paid subscriptions.The Nielsen-JioHotstar collaboration centers on establishing a dedicated data pipeline that enables real-time ad measurement during IPL broadcasts. Through the Nielsen ONE dashboard, advertisers will receive comprehensive metrics including impression counts, click-through rates, and viewer engagement patterns.Nielsen will have direct access to JioHotstar's first-party data, allowing for independent verification of every ad impression across devices. This sophisticated measurement infrastructure suggests JioHotstar is prioritizing advertising revenue by offering unprecedented transparency to brands.The system will track user-level interactions with ads, helping advertisers optimize their campaigns mid-tournament. Notably, this marks the first time an Indian streaming platform has implemented third-party ad measurement for live sports, addressing a key concern among digital advertisers about self-reported metrics.JioStar's massive reach of 500 million viewers also makes an advertising-centric model more viable in the price-sensitive Indian market. The company's position as the dominant player, controlling 85% of India's streaming market, allows it to generate substantial advertising revenue even with partial free access.However, the platform's new subscription tiers do indicate a gradual shift toward a mixed revenue model, suggesting that while some IPL content may remain free, premium features and ad-free viewing could increasingly move behind a paywall.",The partnership between JioHotstar and Nielsen for third-party ad measurement during IPL 2025 suggests that the streaming platform may continue offering free cricket content.

Mukesh Ambani’s vision for Jio Coin and blockchain technology



Earning JioCoins with JioSphere browser activities



JioCoins: Potential redemption options



Impact of Jio and Polygon collaboration on India’s blockchain landscape

Also Read |

Jio Coin, a digital token recently unveiled by Reliance Jio , remains somewhat enigmatic. While opinions on its nature undoubtedly abound, any proclamation at this juncture, be it attached to the expectations of a cryptocurrency-the likes of Bitcoin-or other untried instruments-presently stands uncorroborated within the business-world credit manual. Rather more in the realm of loyalty reward systems, the company has yet to divulge anything about how Jio itself will operate in its ecosystem or even whether it takes any fit to incorporate existing blockchain technologies. This whole endeavor of Jio has generated much interest, leading to curiosity and some anticipation amongst many about Jio Coin's forthcoming prospects.Designed by Reliance Jio, JioCoin has generated a lot of buzz but does not resemble the classic definition of a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. JioCoin is being billed as a form of digital currency and seems to be more about some kind of a digital reward or points system than being a well decentralized, blockchain-powered currency concerned. So, JioCoin may well have an incentive-slanted approach and an internal ecosystem currency function, rather than functioning like a decentralized currency similar to bitcoin.As of now, Jio Coin's official price has not been announced, but business analysts estimate that it might start at a token price of approximately $0.50 (Rs 43.30). One of the most important determinants of JioCoin value will be how well it integrates within Reliance Jio's larger ecosystem, such as popular services like JioMart, Reliance petrol stations, and more, among others. Mukesh Ambani said that JioCoin is an attempt to push blockchain-based technology to a wider audience. With nearly 450 million users, the Jio presence could make this digital currency a leading player within India, expectedly aiding the increased adoption of Web3 technology in the country.JioCoin probably followed with the entry of several Indians into blockchain and decentralization technologies, improving ease of access to Web3- potential mainstreaming.JioCoins are digital tokens that reside on the Polygon blockchain. Users earn them when they use various apps mobile and internet-based, enabled through Jio's JioSphere browser. Users will earn JioCoins simply by signing in with their numbers and surfing Jio's ecosystem. They will be credited to their Polygon wallet because such activity takes place.This rewards system encourages Jio users to be active in the Jio ecosystem, getting Web3 tokens simply through use of the JioSphere browser. On the other hand, rather unclear seem to be the ways of redeeming or using these tokens for its users. It would be interesting to see different things Reliance Jio is going to explore in future uses for JioCoins, such as redemption for reward through discounts, purchases, further linking to other services within the Jio ecosystem.There are many theories as to how Reliance Jio might allow users to redeem their JioCoins. Some people believe that tokens function as an internal currency for all his services, which will integrate those brands into a coherent rewards system. Others believe that Jio may take a more conventional route and set up a JioCoin for real things, discounts, or services.If JioCoin catches ground and has a larger user base to add, then potentially the JioSphere browser could otherwise compete to be one of the better-known browsers such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox as it attracts users into earning digital tokens through their actions online.Jio and Polygon together make a loud and clear noise to enhance the credibility of Polygon as a blockchain network in India. Because Jio has numerous users all over India, this collaboration has enormous potential to bring in millions into using the Polygon network, which will further increase consumer interest in blockchain technology.It could also make other consumer giants like Airtel or Vodafone Idea in future consider integrating with Polygon or other blockchain networks. This deal is a significant milestone security-wise for Polygon, as it opens up valuable opportunities tapping into Jio's consumer base, which is supposed to lead to real widespread adoption of blockchain technology.","Reliance Jio unveiled Jio Coin, a digital token recently unveiled by the company.

As reported by Economic Times, the salary increments are expected to average between 4-8%, with payouts starting in April.The announcement comes amid a gradual slowdown in salary hikes across the IT industry, which has seen a shift from double-digit increments during the COVID-19 period to single-digit increases in recent years. In FY24, TCS employees received an average hike of 7-9%, while in FY22, the hikes were around 10.5%.TCS has also linked its salary hikes and variable payouts to employees' compliance with its return-to-office (RTO) mandate, which was announced early in 2024.

Gaurav Taneja takes a dig at Shark Tank India

Aman Gupta, co-founder of boAt Lifestyle, responded to the pitch from Burger Bae ’s founders on Shark Tank India with a humorous remark. During their pitch, Rohan Kashyap, one of the founders, shared his ambition to transform Ludhiana just as Narayana Murthy transformed Bengaluru. ""Mujhe Ludhiana ka Narayana Murthy banna hai,"" Rohan said. To this, Aman Gupta replied, ""Sahi hai, bas 70 ghanta kaam karna padega,"" referencing Murthy’s famous 70-hour workweek. The founder jibed in saying he was even willing to work 100 hours a week if needed.Burger Bae's founders sought Rs 1 crore for a 2.5% equity stake, valuing their business at Rs 20 crore. They shared that their revenue was set to reach Rs 15 crore this year, though Rohan revealed the brand had faced bankruptcy issues due to an early partnership gone wrong. He had to buy out a difficult investor after borrowing money from his family.Namita Thapar and Viraj Bahl backed out, citing concerns over Rohan’s understanding of numbers and the early stage of the business. Anupam Mittal, Kunal Bahl, and Aman Gupta were interested, with two offers on the table: Rs 1 crore for 10% equity or Rs 2 crore for 20%. The founders ultimately accepted the latter, sealing a Rs 2 crore deal for 20% equity.Meanwhile, youtuber Gaurav Taneja, known as Flying Beast, recently took a playful jab at Shark Tank India after his pitch for his protein powder brand, Beast Life, was rejected on the show. In his latest vlog titled ""Inke Gao Mein Deal Pakki Ho Gayi,"" Gaurav documents his journey across several villages in Rajasthan, where he successfully secured a business deal for his dairy brand, Rozier.On Shark Tank India, Gaurav pitched Beast Life, seeking ₹1 crore for a 1% equity stake. However, the Sharks raised concerns about his commitment to the brand, given his involvement in multiple ventures. Anupam Mittal even suggested he quit YouTube to fully dedicate himself to his startup.","Burger Bae's founders sought Rs 1 crore for a 2.5% equity stake.

What is Youngtro; the viral K-trend bringing old iPhones and cameras back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-is-youngtro-the-viral-k-trend-bringing-old-iphones-and-cameras-back/articleshow/118317998.cms,"Representative Image

More than just iPhones

A new smartphone trend is taking over South Korea, and it’s not about the latest flagship devices. Instead of chasing the latest iPhones, a growing number of millennials and Gen Z are embracing Youngtro—a movement that brings back older iPhones and digital cameras for their nostalgic charm and vintage aesthetics.With today’s smartphones offering ultra-powerful cameras, why would anyone go back to an iPhone 6S or the first-gen iPhone SE? For many, it’s all about the look—both of the device and the photos it takes. Some fans love the sleek, minimalist designs of older iPhones, especially those from the Steve Jobs era. Others appreciate the unique, softer tones these phones capture, offering a raw, vintage feel that modern AI-enhanced cameras lack.The rising demand of older iPhones, particularly the first-generation iPhone SE, originally released in 2016, has sparked what’s now being called the “iPhone SE phenomenon.” According to the Korean second-hand platform Bungaejangter, listings for the iPhone 6s in 2023 skyrocketed by 519% compared to the previous year, while actual transactions saw a 28% increase.A student interviewed by The Korea Times shared, “I find the design of old iPhones from the Steve Jobs era more vintage and aesthetically pleasing than the latest models.” Another said, “The colors in photos taken with an old iPhone are more unique than those from newer models.”Lee Ji-soo, 23, has started using her old iPhone 6 as a secondary phone.“Among my peers, older iPhones are actually more popular than the latest ones,” she said. “The colours in photos taken with an old iPhone are more unique than those from newer models.”The Youngtro trend isn’t stopping at iPhones. Classic digital cameras, wired headphones, and other retro tech are making a major comeback. Even celebrities are embracing the movement, posting photos that highlight not just their outfits but also the nostalgic devices they’re using. Interest in retro photography spiked in December 2023 after K-pop group NewJeans, now NJZ, filmed parts of their “Ditto” music video using a vintage digital camcorder.","A growing number of millennials and Gen Z are embracing Youngtro, a movement that brings back older iPhones and digital cameras.

This principle is part of a broader update to OpenAI's Model Spec, a comprehensive document outlining how the company trains its AI models to behave.The new principle, titled ""Seek the truth together,"" aims to ensure that ChatGPT remains neutral and provides multiple perspectives on controversial subjects. OpenAI emphasises that the AI should not take an editorial stance, even if some users find certain topics morally wrong or offensive. Instead, ChatGPT will offer context about each movement, reflecting OpenAI's commitment to intellectual freedom and user control.This update comes amid ongoing debates about AI censorship and bias. OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman , has previously acknowledged the challenges of addressing bias in AI models, noting that it would take time to achieve a balanced approach. The new guiding principle is seen as a response to conservative criticism about ChatGPT's safeguards, which have been perceived as skewing center-left.The changes are also part of OpenAI's effort to reduce the number of topics the AI chatbot won't talk about, allowing it to answer more questions and offer more perspectives. This shift aligns with OpenAI's long-held belief in giving users more control over their interactions with AI.As the AI community and users worldwide react to this update, the question remains: Will this new principle enhance the trustworthiness and versatility of ChatGPT? Only time will tell if OpenAI's commitment to truth and neutrality will set a new standard for AI ethics and performance.","OpenAI has announced a new guiding principle for ChatGPT.

Five big anti-trust cases targeting Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook going in the US

Google suffered another legal blow as a judge ruled that the company illegally dominates two markets for online advertising technology. What makes this important is that it paves the way for the US antitrust prosecutors to seek a breakup of Google's ad products. A US judge ruled that Google illegally wielded monopoly power in the online ad technology market, delivering a significant blow to the tech giant’s revenue engine. According to a report by news agency AFP, district Court Judge Leonie Brinkema found Google built an illegal monopoly over publisher ad servers and ad exchanges, engaging in anticompetitive acts to maintain dominance, harming publishers, competition, and consumers.The federal government and over a dozen US states filed the antitrust suit, accusing Alphabet-owned Google of dominating digital advertising sectors -- publisher ad servers, advertiser tools, and ad exchanges. Brinkema reportedly partially dismissed claims about advertiser tools but agreed Google’s policies and product feature eliminations entrenched its monopoly.Google vowed to appeal, with vice president of regulatory affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland noting the court found no competitive harm in its advertiser tools or acquisitions like DoubleClick. “We won half of this case and we will appeal the other half,” she said, adding that the company disagrees with the decision on its publisher tools. “Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.”Advertising accounted for about 75% of Alphabet's $350.02 billion in revenue for 2024. The Google Network business accounted for only 8.7% of the revenue.The ruling is part of a broader US government push to curb Big Tech, with five major antitrust cases targeting tech giants, marking an aggressive shift in enforcement since the Microsoft case in the 1990s.Analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf of Emarketer said the antitrust tide has turned against Google, though legal remedies and timelines depend on appeals, which could span years. The case, launched under the Trump and Biden administrations, follows another ruling last August that Google illegally monopolized search, also under appeal. Online advertising fuels Google’s fortune, funding free services like Maps, Gmail, and search, and its AI investments.","Judge rules Google illegally dominates two markets for online advertising technology.

Nvidia may make another chip for China

Nvidia CEO's trip may not go well with Washington

Nvidia is not willing to give up on China. According to a report in Financial Times, Nvidia chief executive officer (CEO) Jensen Huang visited Beijing this week to meet clients and Chinese officials. Huang's visit comes after new US export restrictions on the chipmaker’s H20 chip that triggered a $5.5bn earnings hit for Nvidia. H20 chip is a lower-powered model that is reportedly designed to comply with former export controls to China announced by the Joe Biden administration.Huang is said to have met with DeepSeek ’s founder Liang Wenfeng to discuss designing next-generation chips compliant with US and Chinese regulations, according to two people familiar with his travel schedule. In January, DeepSeek’s cost-efficient AI model shook US tech stocks, highlighting its competitive edge. Nvidia CEO also held talks with Chinese vice-premier He Lifeng. “We hope to continue to cooperate with China,” Huang said, as per Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.The visit, finalized after US President Donald Trump’s unexpected ban on the H20 chip, underscores Nvidia’s determination to maintain its $17bn Chinese market despite Washington’s escalating trade restrictions. Huang’s discussions indicate that Nvidia may design another chip for China, even after previous efforts were blocked by US controls. China, facing pressure to decouple from the US amid 245% reciprocal tariffs, has pushed its tech firms to adopt Huawei’s Ascend AI chip, though it struggles with model training, leaving companies reliant on Nvidia.Huang’s trip, which followed a State Council-approved meeting request, comes amid regulatory scrutiny. China’s antitrust regulator is probing Nvidia’s compliance with commitments tied to its acquisition of an Israeli networking company, while US lawmakers question whether DeepSeek accessed export-controlled chips. Nvidia declined to comment on the trip, per the Financial Times.Huang’s trip to Beijing may further stoke concern in the US government, where lawmakers have already expressed fears that Nvidia’s advanced chips have helped DeepSeek and other Chinese companies catch up to the US in the AI race. “We regularly meet with government leaders to discuss our company’s products and technology,” an Nvidia spokesperson reportedly said. In response to the probe, the company has said it is following the US government’s directions “to the letter.”",N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang visited Beijing this week to meet clients and Chinese officials.

"Billionaire Mark Cuban thanks Donald Trump on healthcare order, says can ‘save hundreds of billions’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/billionaire-mark-cuban-thanks-donald-trump-on-healthcare-order-says-can-save-hundreds-of-billions/articleshow/120390542.cms,"What Mark Cuban said about Trump’s healthcare executive order



“Gotta be honest. The @realDonaldTrump EO on healthcare and in particular,

drug pricing

could save hundreds of billions.

Here is how:

1. Divorce formularies from PBMs. Require them to come from independent organizations with no economic incentive from the formulary

Make them about wellness, not pay for play like a grocery store endcap. This ends rebates and allows for net pricing. It also allows for better care and wellness.

2. Require PBMs to provide ALL claims data to employers, states and manufacturers. The manufacturers need this to provide better results. It’s insane they don’t have this data to analyze and improve patient results.

Plus they current pay 5 to 10 pct of the retail price to get that data so they can do just that. Make it so it’s required and they can save 10pct of RETAIL pricing , which they can use to lower pricing.

This also stops the 340b double dipping problem.

3. Remove the specialty tier and the requirement to buy from any specified pharmacy. There is nothing special about

specialty drugs

. They call them special to jack up the price. And of course have them divest any that they do.

4. Require that all pharmacies get fully reimbursed for brand drugs and get rid of the Generic Cost Ratio which allows distributors to jack up pricing on generics with the threat of chargebacks and more.. We need independent pharmacies to thrive

5. Remove confidentiality clauses. They prevent companies from talking to manufacturers. It’s insane that your company can’t talk to a GLP1 manufacturer (as an example) to help you put together a wellness plan and get you a better price

6. Stop biosimilar substitution calls. PBMs know that they need to find new sources of margin. They do it by white labeling their own biosimilar versions. That’s fine.

But because that’s where all the margin is, they will put a low cost biosim on the formulary, and when they get a script for the lower cost option, they will have someone call the prescribing doctor to switch to their more expensive version they make more money on. And because employers and manufacturers don’t get their data. They never know

Put me in coach ! I’m here to help.”

Tech billionaire Mark Cuban has supported US President Donald Trump ’s latest executive order. This new order targets Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), which oversee nearly 80% of US prescription drug claims. In his post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Cuban outlined measures to separate drug formularies from PBMs, the need for transparent claims‑data reporting, and removal of speciality-drug tiers to curb cost inflation. He also urged action to address double‑dipping in the 340B program , which refers to a situation where an eligible provider, like a hospital or clinic, improperly receives both a 340B drug discount and a Medicaid drug rebate for the same medication. The order further directs HHS to align Medicare drug payments with hospital rates, streamline FDA approval for generics and biosimilars, and support state drug importation programs. According to Cuban, these steps can yield notable savings and better patient outcomes under the new policy framework.In his X post, Cuban wrote:","Tech billionaire Mark Cuban has supported US President Donald Trump ’s latest executive order.

"Mark Zuckerberg block’s iOS 18’s biggest feature for iPhones on WhatsApp, Facebook and Threads",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mark-zuckerberg-blocks-ios-18s-biggest-feature-for-iphones-on-whatsapp-facebook-and-threads/articleshow/120390396.cms,"Meta may have blocked Apple’s AI tools to promote Meta AI



Facebook parent Meta has escalated its rivalry with Apple, a report claims. The Mark Zuckerberg-led social media major is reportedly preventing users from accessing Apple Intelligence features on its popular apps, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The report claims that users are unable to access Apple’s AI features, such as Writing Tools and Genmoji, on Meta apps. The decision follows Apple’s announcement that developers could opt in or out of AI integration with iOS 18 and its subsequent rollout in October 2024. Users have reported that even basic functions like text rewriting and AI‑generated custom emoji no longer appear in Meta’s apps, despite being enabled in the app settings.According to a report by the Brazilian blog Sorcererhat Tech, the lack of access was confirmed through testing on Instagram, where these features could not be accessed even with Apple Intelligence settings enabled within the app. Apple Intelligence first became available with ios 18.1 last October, offering built‑in tools across most iPhone apps by default. The block also extends to keyboard stickers and Memoji in Instagram Stories—features that were previously accessible within the app.The move aligns with reports that Meta is steering users toward its own AI suite, Meta AI , which is integrated across its platforms. Meta AI offers similar text‑editing and image‑generation tools directly within its apps, including caption suggestions on Instagram. The company’s refusal to adopt Apple Intelligence highlights a growing divide between the two tech ecosystems over control of AI‑driven user experiences.A Wall Street Journal report from June 2024 reveals that Apple and Meta explored integrating Facebook’s AI model into iOS 18 as part of Apple Intelligence, but Apple declined the proposal over privacy concerns and instead struck a deal with OpenAI to offer optional ChatGPT responses via Siri.Given their history of clashes—from device‑interoperability demands to App Store disputes—it follows that Meta would opt to exclude Apple’s AI tools from its apps. Meta has since rolled out its suite of AI features across its platforms.Earlier this year, during an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg argued that Apple has fallen short on innovation and relies too much on the enduring success of the iPhone.""Steve Jobs invented the iPhone and now they're just kind of sitting on it 20 years later,"" Zuckerberg said, pointing to a slowdown in iPhone upgrades, as many users no longer see enough improvements in each new model to justify buying the latest device.","Facebook parent Meta is reportedly preventing users from accessing Apple Intelligence features on its popular apps.

JP Morgan Chase CEOJamie Dimon on US economy

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said that the U.S. and China should keep communications open as trade tensions continue. In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Dimon said regular and respectful dialogue between the two nations is important to manage disagreements. Noting that China has seen strong economic growth, he highlighted that the country’s trade practices and influence in the region have raised concerns. “They are scaring Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam, India,” he stated, urging Chinese authorities to be receptive to addressing these concerns. Dimon's comments come as the Trump administration announced a sweeping new tariff of up to 245% on Chinese imports. China, on the other hand, said if the U.S. continues to play the ""tariff numbers game"", it will pay no attention to it.In the interview, Dimon further highlighted that the U.S. should not try to fully cut economic ties with China, adding that “it is neither desirable nor necessary”. Dimon further said that the U.S. should build its own capacity and work with countries like the UK, Europe, Japan, Korea, Australia, and the Philippines to negotiate better trade terms.During the interview, Dimon was asked whether Donald Trump should call Chinese President Xi Jinping . He responded saying “I think adults should talk to each other and listen to each other and acknowledge when the other person is right, or at least has a good point.” He said the two countries should engage more, adding that “You start with a phone call”.Commenting on the U.S. economy, Dimon said that he remains confident in its strength, highlighting its rule of law, innovation, and military power. He also warned against isolating the U.S. from the rest of the world, saying “America First is OK, but not America Alone.”He further added that division among Western countries could lead to long-term problems. “We don’t read a book in 40 years: ‘How the West was Lost’,” the CEO added.Stating that while he doesn’t agree with everything done by the Trump administration, he hopes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent would lead the trade deals well.","Jamie Dimon said regular and respectful dialogue between the two nations is important to manage disagreements.

Time Magazine has unveiled its 2025 list of the 100 Most Influential People, featuring five prominent tech CEOs, including Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg . However, the most notable highlight is the selection of Demis Hassabis , CEO of Google DeepMind , Google's artificial intelligence division, as the magazine's cover star. Here are the five popular tech CEOs that have made it to the list.Demis Hassabis is among highly influential figures in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). At Google, he leads one of the world’s leading AI research teams, DeepMind, which is known for groundbreaking achievements in AI. These include major breakthroughs like AlphaGo: the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go, and AlphaFold, an AI system that has revolutionised protein structure prediction, a significant challenge in biology.Hassabis and his colleague John M. Jumper were jointly awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on AlphaFold. This recognition highlights the profound impact of AI in scientific discovery.Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has driven innovation in electric vehicles and space exploration, respectively. He is also the owner of X (formerly Twitter) and has promoted free speech on the platform. He is also involved with Neuralink, The Boring Company and co-founded xAI. Most recently his political involvement increased, especially with his role in the Trump administration's DOGE.Mark Zuckerberg is a prominent businessman and computer programmer best known for co-founding Facebook, the social media giant. He launched Facebook from his Harvard University dorm room in 2004. Zuckerberg serves as the Chairman and CEO of Meta Platforms , Inc., the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.“More recently, his belief in open-source AI—exemplified by Meta’s groundbreaking Llama models, downloaded more than a billion times worldwide since the initiative’s launch in 2023—has reshaped the industry, democratizing innovation and making AI more accessible and affordable for all of us,” wrote Drew Houston, CEO of Dropbox, in his write-up.Lisa Su is a prominent figure in the technology industry, most notably recognised as the President, CEO, and Chair of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Her leadership has been widely credited with AMD 's significant resurgence, transforming the company into a major competitor in the high-performance computing and graphics markets, challenging industry giants like Intel and Nvidia.“Most importantly for AI, she’s positioned the company’s chips to compete as a credible alternative to Nvidia’s graphics processing units,” said Andrew Ng, the founder of DeepLearning.AI.Liang Wenfeng is the CEO of DeepSeek, a company that is making waves in the field of AI. The company has gained attention for developing powerful AI models.

"Google faces potential breakup as judge finds it illegally dominated ad tech markets, company responds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/judge-finds-google-illegally-dominated-ad-tech-markets-faces-potential-breakup/articleshow/120385482.cms,"How latest ruling may affect Google’s business

'We won half of this case...': Google says



In a significant antitrust ruling, a federal judge has determined that Alphabet 's Google illegally dominated two key markets within the online advertising technology sector. The decision, delivered on Thursday (April 17), marks another setback for the tech giant in its ongoing legal battle with the US government.As per a report by news agency Reuters, US District Judge Leonie Brinkema of the Alexandria, Virginia, court ruled that Google unlawfully monopolised the markets for publisher ad servers and ad exchanges, which facilitate transactions between ad buyers and sellers.However, the judge found that antitrust enforcers did not successfully prove Google held a monopoly in advertiser ad networks.This ruling opens the door for prosecutors to pursue remedies that could include the forced breakup of Google's advertising business. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has previously advocated for Google to divest at least its Google Ad Manager, a suite of tools encompassing the company's publisher ad server and ad exchange.Google now faces the potential of being subjected to divestiture orders or significant changes to its business practices from two separate US courts. A trial is scheduled to commence next week in Washington, DC, where a judge will consider the DOJ's request to compel Google to sell its Chrome browser and implement other measures aimed at curbing its dominance in online search.Prosecutors argued that Google employed classic monopolistic tactics, including acquiring competitors, locking customers into its products, and exerting control over online ad market transactions.Meanwhile, Google's defense argued that the case focused on a past reality, emphasising the company's ongoing efforts to ensure its tools could connect with competitors' products.Previous reports indicated that Google had the possibility of selling off its ad exchange in an attempt to appease European antitrust regulators.Google's legal team further contended that prosecutors disregarded competition from other technology giants, such as Amazon.com and Comcast, and failed to acknowledge the shift in digital ad spending towards platforms like apps and streaming video.Google has responded to the verdict, saying that it will appeal.""We won half of this case and we will appeal the other half. The Court found that our advertiser tools and our acquisitions, such as DoubleClick, don’t harm competition. We disagree with the Court’s decision regarding our publisher tools. Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective,"" Lee-Anne Mulholland, Vice President, Regulatory Affairs.","US District Judge Leonie Brinkema of the Alexandria, Virginia, court ruled that Google unlawfully monopolised the markets for publisher ad servers and ad exchanges.

"‘Suspending Spacex, Tesla, DOGE and all websites affiliated with Elon Musk for a full ...,’ warn hackers who previously targeted Donald Trump",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/suspending-all-websites-affiliated-with-elon-musk-companies-for-a-full-warn-hackers-who-previously-targeted-donald-trump/articleshow/120102622.cms,"What hackers said about targeting Elon Musk



A group of hackers has threatened to launch an attack on sites linked to Elon Musk . The cybercrime group named DonRoad Team, which had earlier claimed responsibility for taking down several websites associated with US President Donald Trump, has now announced that it would start targeting sites associated with Tesla and SpaceX CEO. The group also shared its intent to attack sites associated with the tech billionaire over a month. Previously, the DonRoad Team has claimed responsibility for its attacks in March that targeted The Trump Organization's website, as well as Tesla and SpaceX email servers, causing temporary global outages at the time. This comes after Musk-owned social media platform X (earlier Twitter) was targeted by a group of pro-Palestinian hackers who were able to disable the site for several hours.In a post (seen by Newsweek) shared on messaging platform Telegram, the hackers said: “In the next few hours, we will be suspending all websites affiliated with Elon Musk companies for a full month.”However, the Telegram post was later removed. Should these hacks occur, they may impact multiple Musk-related websites, including X and his AI platforms Grok and Tesla. Hackers may also target websites of other companies owned by Musk, like SpaceX and Tesla.In March, Musk-owned X experienced at least three major outages following a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. —a cyber assault that floods networks or devices with bot-generated traffic. The Dark Storm Team claimed responsibility for the incident.Reacting to the cyberattack, Musk at that time took to X to write: There was (still is) a massive cyberattack against 𝕏. We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing …”Later, in a Fox Business interview, Musk noted: “There was a massive cyber attack to try to bring down the X system with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area.”In a separate event in February, the website for the Department of Government Efficiency, of which Musk is a member, was compromised and altered to mock him and his team.The hacked site temporarily displayed a prominent message stating, “This is a joke of a .gov site,"" alongside the note, ""THESE 'EXPERTS' LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN.”",Hackers threaten to launch an attack on sites linked to Elon Musk.

"Walmart Boycott: World's largest retailer tells protesters, 'we are America's ...'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/walmart-boycott-worlds-largest-retailer-tells-protesters-we-are-americas-/articleshow/120119363.cms,"Here's what Walmart said about the protest

People's Union USA founder John Schwarz has announced on social media details of upcoming planned boycotts:

Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, has issued a statement addressing the ongoing week-long boycott organised by the People’s Union USA . The boycott, dubbed the "" Walmart Blackout ,"" began on April 7 and targets the company’s rollback of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, as well as broader concerns over corporate influence and tax policies .The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity. The group’s founder, John Schwarz, urged consumers to avoid shopping at Walmart stores, using its online services, or purchasing from its subsidiaries like Sam’s Club. Schwarz stated, “We are holding these companies accountable so they finally step up and pay their fair share of taxes to alleviate federal income tax from the working-class citizen.”Responding to the boycott, Walmart has defended its contributions to communities and the US economy. “Serving communities is at the heart of Walmart's purpose to help people save money and live better,” the company said in a statement. “As one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, not only do we pay our fair share, we are an economic force multiplier strengthening communities nationwide through job creation, supplier growth, and over $1.7 billion in cash and in-kind donations last year"", it added further.The boycott follows Walmart’s decision last November to discontinue its five-year commitment to a racial equity center and other DEI programs. Critics argue that these rollbacks undermine progress in promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Walmart, however, emphasised its dedication to supporting local charities, disaster response, hunger relief, workforce development, and conservation efforts.A report from SuperMarketNews, citing data from Numerator, suggests that Walmart may be more resistant to boycotts compared to other retailers. The data indicates that Walmart has not experienced significant impact from households regarding its stance on non-DEI initiatives, particularly among multicultural households—a trend that contrasts with another retail chain Target.Target reportedly faced the most severe backlash during the February 28 boycott focused on DEI initiatives, experiencing a 9% drop in web traffic on the day of the protest, according to Forbes. In comparison, Walmart observed a 5% decline in web traffic, while Amazon saw the smallest decrease, at just 2%.* Walmart: April 7-14 and May 20-26* Second economic blackout: April 18* General Mills: April 21-28* Amazon: May 6-12* Target: June 3-9* McDonald's: June 24-30* Independence Day boycott: July 4","The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female. The change aligns with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January 2025, titled ‘Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government’. The updated policy, which took effect on April 2, applies to all pending and future immigration benefit requests. “USCIS is returning to its historical policy of recognizing two biological sexes,” the agency said in a press statement.Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security , said “There are only two sexes—male and female. President Trump promised the American people a revolution of common sense, and that includes making sure that the policy of the U.S. government agrees with simple biological reality. Proper management of our immigration system is a matter of national security, not a place to promote and coddle an ideology that permanently harms children and robs real women of their dignity, safety, and well-being.”Under the new guidance, a person’s sex will be determined based on the birth certificate issued at or closest to the time of birth. “If the birth certificate issued at or nearest to the time of birth indicates a sex other than male or female, USCIS will base the determination of sex on secondary evidence. See Volume 1, General Policies and Procedures, Part E, Adjudications, Chapter 6, Evidence, Section B, Primary and Secondary Evidence [1 USCIS-PM E.6(B)],” the agency stated.The agency further stated that the benefits will not be denied solely based on how an applicant identifies his/her sex. USCIS confirmed that it does not issue documents with a blank sex field or one that differs from the original birth certificate. Any discrepancies may lead to processing delays.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female.

Thank you again for being part of the SHEIN family.

With gratitude,

The SHEIN Team

Shein and Temu , Amazon’s biggest Chinese e-commerce platforms, have announced plans to increase prices for US consumers, citing the impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump US administration. In separate but similarly worded statements, Temu, owned by Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and Shein, now headquartered in Singapore, informed customers that “recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs” have increased their operating expenses.According to a report by Associated Press, both companies indicated that “price adjustments” would take effect on April 25, although they did not specify the magnitude of the increases.“We’ve stocked up and stand ready to make sure your orders arrive smoothly during this time. We're doing everything we can to keep prices low and minimize the impact on you,” Temu’s statement said.Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump announced a 145% tariff on most products made in China, combined with the ending of a customs exemption allowing duty-free entry for goods under $800, significantly challenging their business models.This “de minimis provision,” heavily used by e-commerce companies, is being eliminated following an executive order signed earlier this month, making affected imports from China and Hong Kong subject to the 145% import tax beginning May 2.The elimination of the provision will impact the estimated 4 million low-value parcels, largely originating from China, that enter the US daily under this exemption.","Shein and Temu, Amazon’s biggest Chinese e-commerce platforms, have announced plans to increase prices for US consumers, citing the impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump US administration.

Did Katy Perry pay for her trip



Public reaction and viral impact

In a landmark moment for space tourism and celebrity space travel, singer Katy Perry joined five other women for a brief but historic space voyage aboard Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin spacecraft. The 11-minute suborbital trip, which took place from a launch site in West Texas, has garnered widespread attention not only for its all-female crew but also for reigniting public interest in civilian spaceflight. Videos and images from the flight have gone viral on social media, showcasing the pop star and her crewmates floating in zero gravity above Earth.Katy Perry’s journey marks a continuation of Blue Origin’s mission to make space travel more accessible—at least for those who can afford it. Since its first crewed mission in 2021, Blue Origin has sent 58 people into space, including several celebrities and private citizens. The latest flight added a unique dimension with its all-woman lineup, reinforcing broader efforts to promote diversity in space exploration.For those interested in replicating the experience, Blue Origin has an open reservation system available on its official website. While the process appears straightforward, it does come with specific requirements and significant financial implications.The only publicly disclosed eligibility requirement is age. Applicants must be at least 18 years old to be considered for a commercial spaceflight with Blue Origin. There is no publicly listed requirement related to physical fitness or health screening at the reservation stage, although further evaluations may follow during preflight preparations.The price of booking a Blue Origin flight remains undisclosed for most passengers. However, the company notes on its website that a refundable deposit of $150,000 is required to initiate the order process. The final ticket price is determined later in the process and remains confidential for most customers.In 2021, one seat was auctioned for $28 million for Blue Origin's first crewed flight.Virgin Galactic, a competitor in the space tourism sector, has sold tickets priced between $200,000 and $450,000, according to the Associated Press.In some cases, Blue Origin offers free trips to selected individuals, especially high-profile guests. Previous examples include Star Trek actor William Shatner and Good Morning America co-host Michael Strahan, both of whom reportedly flew without charge.was part of a six-woman team that launched aboard Blue Origin’s New Shepard spacecraft. The crew included:The Blue Origin capsule launched at 9:31 a.m. ET, climbing over 62 miles (100 kilometers) above Earth's surface, crossing the Kármán line—the internationally recognized boundary of space. The crew experienced several minutes of weightlessness before the capsule safely returned to the desert floor via parachutes.The financial details surrounding Katy Perry’s participation in the spaceflight remain partially undisclosed. According to a CNN report, not all passengers on the all-female flight paid for their tickets. The report stated that “some passengers” flew free of charge, while others paid for the experience. Blue Origin has not confirmed which passengers paid and which were offered complimentary seats.This selective payment structure appears consistent with Blue Origin’s past flights, where a blend of paying customers and invited guests has been used to generate interest and visibility for the program.Following the spaceflight, social media platforms were flooded with images and footage of the crew experiencing zero gravity. Katy Perry’s celebrity status significantly amplified public engagement, with fans and space enthusiasts alike sharing clips and expressing curiosity about civilian space travel.As of now, Blue Origin has not announced when its next crewed mission will take place or whether additional celebrity passengers are scheduled to fly. The company continues to expand its private spaceflight program while balancing exclusivity, accessibility, and global media interest.",Katy Perry joined five other women for a brief but historic space voyage aboard Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin spacecraft.

Musk’s expanding family and past confidential agreements

In a new report that has drawn widespread public attention, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is alleged to have offered conservative influencer Ashley St. Clair a multi-million-dollar financial arrangement in exchange for silence regarding their child. According to documents and insider confirmations cited byand, Musk proposed a one-time payment of $15 million, along with $100,000 in monthly child support, to ensure that details surrounding their son remained confidential. The child, born in September 2024, was revealed to be named Romulus , following prior public references to him as R.S.C. A paternity test conducted by Labcorp has reportedly confirmed Musk as the biological father with a 99.9999% probability.This development adds another layer to Musk's increasingly complex personal life, involving multiple children with several women and private settlements negotiated behind closed doors. While Musk has yet to publicly confirm the terms of the reported agreement, representatives from St. Clair’s side have verified key elements, including the financial offer and the outcome of the paternity test.The identity of the father of Ashley St. Clair’s infant son had remained largely speculative until recent weeks. In a February 2025 post on X (formerly Twitter), St. Clair publicly acknowledged that Elon Musk was the child’s father. Shortly afterward, she confirmed through a spokesperson that Musk had taken a paternity test, which showed with near certainty (99.9999%) that he is the biological father.The paternity report was issued by Labcorp and cited ininvestigation. This confirmation has made the financial and legal aspects of the case particularly relevant, as the parties continue to navigate public attention and private negotiations.The child's name, previously concealed and referenced only by the initials R.S.C., has been publicly confirmed as Romulus. The choice of name has not been explained by either parent, but it continues the tradition of unusual names among Musk's children, which include X Æ A-12, Exa Dark Sideræl, and Techno Mechanicus.According to The Wall Street Journal, Musk offered St. Clair a one-time $15 million payment along with monthly support of $100,000 as part of an agreement to keep the birth and details of the child private. Sources close to St. Clair confirmed the existence of this proposal and also disclosed that Musk had made similar arrangements with other mothers of his children.The report did not clarify whether St. Clair accepted or declined the offer, although she has since publicly discussed financial aspects of her relationship with Musk, including disputes over support adjustments.In February 2025, St. Clair took to social media to publicly disclose her child’s paternity, citing growing media interest and threats to her child's privacy. In her post, she emphasized that she had withheld the information for months to protect her son's safety and security. She appealed to the press to respect their privacy and avoid invasive reporting, noting that the announcement was made reluctantly due to the increasing likelihood of tabloid exposure.she wrote.In late March 2025, the situation escalated publicly when St. Clair appeared in a video published by The Daily Mail, handing over the keys to her Tesla Model S. She claimed that she was selling the vehicle to offset a significant reduction—approximately 60%—in child support payments from Musk.Musk, however, denied the claim that he had reduced support as a form of financial retaliation. Responding to a post by political commentator Laura Loomer on X, Musk stated:This comment contradicts the confirmed paternity test and has raised further questions about the consistency of Musk’s statements on the issue.Elon Musk is the father of at least 14 children, including Romulus, and has reportedly signed confidentiality and financial agreements with multiple women. While many of these arrangements have remained private, some—including his co-parenting with musician Grimes and Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis—have come into public view.As per reports, the structure of Musk’s financial arrangements varies case by case. While legal documentation of the settlements remains sealed or undisclosed, Musk has historically provided substantial financial support in private, often tied to non-disclosure expectations.","A paternity test conducted by Labcorp has reportedly confirmed Musk as the biological father with a 99.9999% probability.

Bill Gates predicts: Two non-tech jobs once considered 'slowdown-proof' that AI is threatening to take over,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-predicts-two-non-tech-jobs-once-considered-slowdown-proof-that-ai-is-threatening-to-take-over/articleshow/120379747.cms,"Gates cites Nvidia's robots, Keynes' prediction and ...

Bill Gates reportedly has another prediction on artificial intelligence (AI) impacting jobs. Microsoft founder Bill Gates forecasts that artificial intelligence (AI) will soon eliminate shortages of doctors and teachers by filling critical gaps in healthcare and education. According to a report in Business Insider, speaking on the ""People by WTF"" podcast, Gates said, ""AI will come in and provide medical IQ, and there won't be a shortage."" He also predicted AI would take over roles like factory workers, construction crews, and hotel cleaners, potentially reducing workweeks and prompting a philosophical rethink about how time is spent. ""You can retire early, you can work shorter workweeks,"" he said, noting even he struggles to adjust to this shift after decades in a world of scarcity.In healthcare, the US reportedly faces a projected shortage of up to 86,000 physicians by 2036, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Globally, countries like India and those in Africa also struggle with insufficient medical professionals. AI startups like Suki, Zephyr AI, and Tennr are raising billions to address this by automating tasks like billing and note-taking, improving diagnostics, and identifying patients for new treatments. McKinsey estimates generative AI could add up to $370 billion in productivity to healthcare and pharma.Education faces reportedly similar challenges. According to the report, in 2023, 86% of US K-12 public schools reported hiring difficulties, with 45% understaffed. In the UK, David Game College in London has piloted AI tools like ChatGPT to assist 20 students in subjects like English and math. Educators see AI as a time-saver and learning enhancer, despite concerns about cheating.Gates also highlighted AI’s potential to revolutionize manual labor. Tech giants like Nvidia are developing humanoid robots for tasks like warehouse picking and floor cleaning, aiming to cut labour costs and boost efficiency. He emphasized that AI’s ability to replicate physical skills will reshape industries, saying, ""The hands have to be awfully good to do those things. We'll achieve that.""Reflecting on the future, Gates echoed economist John Maynard Keynes’ 1930 prediction of a 15-hour workweek, noting that despite productivity gains, most still work 40 hours. Gates, who works for enjoyment despite not needing to, sees AI-driven changes as both an opportunity and a challenge to redefine work and leisure.","Bill Gates says artificial intelligence (AI) will soon eliminate shortages of doctors and teachers.

Tariff uncertainty and business impact



Indian IT firms are slashing hiring mandates and adopting a cautious approach as the America-China tariff war fuels economic uncertainty. As reported by Economic Times, the $280 billion industry, which heavily relies on North American and European markets, has seen demand for tech talent drop by nearly 20% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the previous quarter.Recruitment firms report that IT services companies have reduced active hiring demand from 80,000 in February to 55,000 in April. Experts warn that layoffs could follow, particularly in IT services and Global Capability Centers (GCCs), which employ 70% of India’s tech workforce.Kamal Karanth, co-founder of Xpheno, told Economic Times, “There is a likelihood of layoffs in the Indian tech industry, especially in IT services and GCCs.” He added that companies may stop replacing employees, leading to organic headcount reductions.The hiring slowdown follows US President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements, including a 10% minimum tariff on all trade partners and a 245% levy on Chinese imports. While Trump called for a 90-day pause on April 9, the uncertainty has already impacted India’s top IT firms.Wipro CEO Srini Pallia acknowledged the growing concerns, stating, “The uncertainties have dramatically increased. We don’t want to onboard people and then face challenges in deploying them.” Similarly, TCS CEO K Krithivasan noted that project delays and decision-making slowdowns have emerged since March.Industry leaders expect continued caution in hiring, with firms focusing on backfilling critical roles rather than expanding their workforce.

In May 2021, Bill and Melinda Gates publicly announced their divorce after 27 years of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences. The separation marked one of the most financially significant divorces ever recorded, primarily due to the absence of a prenuptial agreement and the couple’s staggering net worth, which was estimated at $130 billion, according to. The divorce gained global attention not only because of the personalities involved—Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, and Melinda French Gates, philanthropist and co-founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation —but also due to the legal and financial complexities surrounding the equitable distribution of their vast wealth.Despite the magnitude of their combined assets, the couple requested privacy during the proceedings. As a result, many specific terms remain confidential. However, substantial details regarding the properties, artworks, and investments they owned have emerged through public records and credible reports, painting a picture of one of the most high-stakes divorces in modern history.The divorce was filed in Washington, a community property state. Under Washington law, any assets acquired during the course of a marriage are considered jointly owned and must typically be split equally in the event of a divorce—unless a prenuptial agreement exists. In this case, no prenup was in place. Instead, the couple had signed a separation agreement, the terms of which remain undisclosed but served as the foundation for the division of their assets.Among the most high-profile assets affected by the split was the couple’s substantial art collection, valued at over $124 million, according to. The collection includes several historically and culturally significant pieces:The Gates divorce also involved the division of real estate worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The properties span several states and serve various purposes, from primary residences to luxury vacation retreats.This high-tech compound on Lake Washington served as the family’s primary residence and is one of the most iconic private homes in the U.S.Purchased in April 2020, this property contrasts the Gates’ Washington estate with its modern design and beachfront access.This property was purchased in 2014 and may not have been included in the division, depending on how it was categorized under the separation agreement.A luxury desert getaway offering privacy and relaxation, bought by the couple in 1999.Gates' financial portfolio was arguably the most complex aspect of the divorce.Although Bill Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board in 2020, he retained significant shares in the company. The exact allocation of these stocks post-divorce has not been disclosed.Founded by Gates, Cascade Investment manages a large portion of his wealth and holds stakes in companies like Four Seasons Hotels, AutoNation, and Canadian National Railway. The ownership structure post-divorce remains private.Despite the divorce, both parties confirmed their continued commitment to co-chairing the Gates Foundation. With over $67 billion in assets, the organization is one of the largest private philanthropic entities in the world. In 2021, a two-year trial period was initiated to evaluate their working relationship. If they found themselves unable to work together after this period, Melinda agreed to step down.","Melinda Gates got mansions, ranches, and a slice of Xanadu 2.0.

Popular Chinese e-commerce platforms Shein and Temu are set to lose their competitive edge in the US online shopping market as they prepare to raise prices starting April 25. The move comes in response to new trade policies introduced by former President Donald Trump, including a 145% tariff on Chinese goods and the elimination of a duty-free exemption for low-value imports.The de minimis provision, which allowed goods valued under $800 to enter the US duty-free, will be eliminated on May 2. This exemption had been a cornerstone of Shein and Temu’s business models, enabling them to offer ultra-low prices on clothing, accessories, and household items. With the new tariffs in place, the platforms will face higher operating costs, forcing them to adjust their pricing strategies.Both companies have issued statements acknowledging the price adjustments, citing “recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs” as the primary reason. Shein and Temu have also encouraged customers to shop before the price hikes take effect, assuring smooth delivery during the transition period.The tariff changes are expected to impact 4 million low-value parcels arriving in the US daily, many of which originate from China.

Poll Do you believe Shivon Zilis holds a truly 'special status' in Elon Musk's life? No, her status is exaggerated. Yes, she is uniquely integrated into his personal and professional life.

How Elon Musk 'views' fatherhood

A recent Wall Street Journal (WSJ) article has shed light on the personal life of the world's richest man Elon Musk . The article focuses on Tesla and SpaceX CEO's expansive family of at least 14 children with four women. Among the mothers of his children, Shivon Zilis , a top executive at Neuralink , is described as holding a “special status” within Musk’s inner circle, a designation that has sparked intrigue and speculation about her role in his life and family dynamics.Zilis and Musk share twins Strider and Azure (born November 2021), daughter Arcadia (born February 2024), and son Seldon Lycurgus (birth date undisclosed, announced February 2025). Their relationship, which began to draw public attention after the twins’ birth was revealed in 2022, has been described as both professional and deeply personal, though its romantic nature remains ambiguous.According to the WSJ, Zilis enjoys a unique position among the mothers of Musk’s children, described as a “special status” within his sprawling family network. This distinction stems from several factors. Unlike other mothers of Musk’s children -- such as musician Grimes, author Justine Wilson, or conservative influencer Ashley St. Clair -- Zilis is deeply embedded in Musk’s professional ecosystem. As a high-ranking executive at Neuralink, she works closely with Musk on cutting-edge AI and neurotechnology projects. This professional alignment gives her a level of access and influence that sets her apart. The WSJ notes that Zilis is seen as a “steadying force” within Musk’s inner circle, suggesting she plays a stabilizing role in both his personal and business endeavors.Zilis has been increasingly visible alongside Musk at high-profile events, a rarity for someone who has largely stayed out of the spotlight. For instance, she accompanied Musk to a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington, D.C., in February 2025, where they were seen with their children. She also attended Donald Trump’s pre-inauguration dinner in January 2025, mingling with notable figures like Jeff Bezos and Ivanka Trump. These appearances kind of confirm that Musk may be publicly acknowledging a closer relationship with Zilis, further underscoring her elevated status.The WSJ report suggests Musk has ambitious plans for his children, whom he reportedly refers to as his “legion,” aiming to raise them in a way that boosts “Earth’s IQ” through brilliant minds. Zilis appears to be a key partner in this vision. She has moved into a $35 million compound in Austin, Texas, purchased by Musk to house his children and their mothers in adjoining properties, allowing him to “schedule time” with his youngest kids. While other mothers, like Grimes, have reportedly resisted this arrangement, Zilis’ participation signals her alignment with Musk’s unconventional family model.Sources cited by People magazine claim that Musk “really loves Shivon,” suggesting a deep personal bond. Zilis herself has spoken positively about Musk, defending him against critics and praising his commitment to humanity’s future. In Walter Isaacson’s biography Elon Musk, Zilis revealed that Musk encouraged her to have children, offering to be her sperm donor because he believed she should pass on her genes. This mutual respect and shared ideological goals -- particularly around AI and population growth—further cement her unique standing.The article, as referenced in The Daily Beast, contrasts Zilis’ status with the experiences of other women in Musk’s life. For example, Ashley Clair, who claims to be the mother of Musk’s 13th child, alleged that Musk offered her $15 million and $100,000 monthly payments to keep his paternity secret, an arrangement she says is common among other mothers. Ashley Clair also described Musk’s demands, such as requiring a cesarean section to maximize brain size, which she rejected. In contrast, Zilis appears to navigate Musk’s world with less public conflict, suggesting a more harmonious relationship.Musk’s approach to fatherhood is said to be closely tied to his belief in an “underpopulation crisis,” a view he has expressed publicly and on X, stating that “a collapsing birth rate is the biggest danger civilization faces.” The WSJ report highlights Musk’s desire to create a “legion” of children, strategically selecting women he deems intelligent to bear his offspring. Zilis, with her academic pedigree and AI expertise, fits this mold, and her willingness to have four children with Musk aligns with his pronatalist ideology.The article also describes Musk’s efforts to manage his complex family through financial agreements and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). While some mothers, like St. Clair, have pushed back against these arrangements, Zilis’ integration into Musk’s professional and personal life suggests she operates within his framework more seamlessly, reinforcing her “special status.”","Shivon Zilis is described as holding a ""special status"" within Elon Musk's inner circle.

The world's richest man Elon Musk has consistently sounded the alarm about what he calls ""population collapse"" in Europe and other parts of the world. He has warned of ""population collapse"" in Singapore and Japan among Asian countries. Tesla CEO has repeated this warning for the West as well. He views declining birth rates as an existential threat to civilization, a greater danger than even global warming.On numerous occasions, he has stated that ""there will be no West if this continues,"" and has warned that a failure to reverse this trend will lead to economic stagnation, labor shortages, and societal decline. In a recent post on Twitter, he reiterated his population warning for Greece.Musk wrote, ""The death of Greece "". He quoted a report from Greek Reporter that said that hundreds of schools have closed in Greece this year as there are no students. ""More than 700 schools have been closed in Greece due to a prolonged demographic crisis. Greece has one of the lowest fertility rates in the European Union - around 1.3 births per woman, far below the replacement level of 2.1.

Gboard rolls out dedicated ‘font size’ setting for custom keyboard appearance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/gboard-rolls-out-dedicated-font-size-setting-for-custom-keyboard-appearance/articleshow/123661722.cms,"What changes and what doesn’t



Google’s Gboard is rolling out a new feature that gives users more control over how their keyboard looks: a dedicated ‘Font size’ setting that allows for personalized text scaling independent of system-wide display preferences. The update, currently available in Gboard beta version 15.9, introduces a new option under Settings > Preferences > Font size, where users can choose from increments ranging between 85% and 200%. The default setting is “Match System,” but users can now fine-tune the size of letters, numbers, and tool icons directly within the keyboard interface.While the font size adjustment affects key labels and icons in the suggestion strip, it does not impact emoji sizes—only the category titles above them. This means users can enjoy a more readable keyboard without altering the visual scale of emoji or other system elements.Screenshots from the Pixel 10 show noticeable differences between the smallest (85%) and largest (200%) settings, offering a more accessible experience for users with visual preferences or impairments.The font size feature follows recent visual updates to Gboard, including a pill-shaped redesign of the suggestion strip. Together, these changes reflect Google’s ongoing effort to make Gboard more customizable and user-friendly.Though the feature is still in limited beta rollout, it’s expected to reach more devices in the coming weeks. For users who rely on Gboard daily, this small tweak could make a big difference in comfort and usability.","Google’s Gboard is rolling out a new ‘Font size’ setting that allows for personalized text scaling independent of system-wide display preferences.

Apple's Foldable iPhone is Coming, Here’s Why it Matters

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced that it will roll out new safety guardrails for its AI chatbot by the end of the year. These new guardrails will specifically target teens and users in emotional distress. The announcement comes amid mounting criticism and legal action against the company after reports of the chatbot’s alleged involvement in tragic events, including suicides and murder.“We’ve seen people turn to it in the most difficult of moments. That’s why we continue to improve how our models recognize and respond to signs of mental and emotional distress, guided by expert input,” OpenAI said in a blog post.“This work has already been underway, but we want to proactively preview our plans for the next 120 days, so you won’t need to wait for launches to see where we’re headed,” the company added, noting that it will continue to work to launch “as many of these improvements as possible this year.”The move is a direct response to a growing number of cases where ChatGPT has been accused of failing to intervene or, in some instances, reinforcing harmful delusions. Last week, the parents of a 16-year-old in California filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, holding the company responsible for their son's death.Another report from The Wall Street Journal said that a case where a man killed himself and his mother after ChatGPT reinforced his ‘paranoid delusions’. The new measures are aimed at preventing such tragedies, though OpenAI currently directs users expressing suicidal intent to crisis hotlines, citing privacy as the reason for not reporting self-harm cases to law enforcement.The company said it is already beginning to route some ""sensitive conversations,"" such as those where signs of acute distress are detected, to more advanced reasoning models like GPT-5-thinking , which is designed to apply safety guidelines more consistently.To ensure the effectiveness of these new features, OpenAI is enlisting a network of over 90 physicians across 30 countries to provide input on mental health contexts and help evaluate the models.OpenAI is also strengthening protections for teen users. Currently, ChatGPT requires users to be at least 13 years old, with parental permission for those under 18. Within the next month, the company plans to allow parents to link their accounts with their teens' for more direct control.","ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced that it will roll out new safety guardrails for its AI chatbot by the end of the year.

Google Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro XL: What’s new

Google has addressed several recent reports which claimed it sent out a widespread security notification about Gmail to 2.5 billion users, calling them “entirely false”. The company hinted that this may have been an attempt by hackers to ‘infiltrate inboxes’.“We want to reassure our users that Gmail’s protections are strong and effective. Several inaccurate claims surfaced recently that incorrectly stated that we issued a broad warning to all Gmail users about a major Gmail security issue. This is entirely false,” the company said in a blog post, announcing, “Gmail's protections are strong and effective, and claims of a major Gmail security warning are false.”“While it’s always the case that phishers are looking for ways to infiltrate inboxes, our protections continue to block more than 99.9% of phishing and malware attempts from reaching users,” it added.Last week, multiple reports claimed that Google issued a critical security alert impacting its 2.5 billion Gmail users worldwide.

Jensen Huang’s 10 predictions for the future of AI, robotics, and global technology

1. China market challenges and opportunities



2. Agentic AI to drive massive compute demand



3. Robotics as the next multi-billion market

4. A trillion-dollar AI infrastructure boom

5. Hyperscalers continue AI spending surge



6. Nvidia’s holistic advantage over rivals

7. Networking and connectivity as core growth drivers

8. Record-breaking financial momentum

9. Robotics and AI ecosystem expansion

10. Long-term market leadership secured

Nvidia has transformed from a niche graphics-chip maker into the world’s most valuable semiconductor giant, riding the explosive rise of artificial intelligence. At the centre of this transformation is CEO Jensen Huang , whose bold bets on accelerated computing, AI chips, and robotics have redefined the technology industry. In 2025, with Nvidia now valued at nearly $4 trillion and sitting at the top of the S&P 500, Huang continues to lay out an ambitious vision for the company’s future. From opportunities in China to the trillion-dollar AI infrastructure market, Huang believes the next decade will be shaped by agentic AI, robotics, and massive global data centre expansion. Here are ten of Huang’s most important predictions that are shaping Nvidia’s roadmap and the future of global computing.China remains a vital market for Nvidia, representing tens of billions in potential sales. Huang has acknowledged that US trade restrictions have complicated Nvidia’s ability to fully participate, but the company is exploring ways to balance Washington’s concerns with Beijing’s demand for advanced AI hardware. The company’s China-specific H20 chip is currently paused, but CFO Colette Kress has noted that shipments could reach between $2 billion and $5 billion in Q3 2025 if export approvals come through. Huang has described China as a “50 billion dollar AI opportunity” this year, with the potential to grow by 50 per cent annually if restrictions ease. That makes China both a geopolitical challenge and a critical growth frontier for Nvidia’s future.Huang predicts that the next stage of AI will move beyond simple chatbots and text generators into what he calls agentic AI. These are reasoning systems capable of planning, decision-making, and taking actions on behalf of humans. Unlike current models that mainly respond to prompts, agentic AI will function more like digital co-workers or assistants. Huang believes that powering such intelligence will require 100 to 1000 times more computing resources than today’s AI systems. This prediction underlines Nvidia’s push to keep advancing its GPUs and data centre platforms, since the success of agentic AI depends on unprecedented compute capacity.Huang has been clear that artificial intelligence will not only exist in software but also in physical machines. Nvidia is betting heavily on robotics through its Jetson Thor platform, designed to support everything from warehouse automation to humanoid robots. Market analysts project that the humanoid robot sector alone could grow to $38 billion by 2035. Huang envisions every industrial company running two factories in the future: one traditional and one populated by AI-powered robots. He describes robotics as a natural extension of Nvidia’s mission to bring intelligence into every aspect of human life, and he believes the company’s leadership in accelerated computing makes it the natural platform for this transformation.According to Huang, AI infrastructure will be the biggest capital investment of the next decade. Nvidia estimates that the global AI data centre market could reach $3 to $4 trillion within the next five years. Companies and governments are racing to build the computational equivalent of power plants, but instead of generating electricity, these facilities generate intelligence. New architectures such as Blackwell and Rubin will dominate this new landscape, providing greater efficiency and scalability. Huang compares the rise of AI infrastructure to the industrial revolution, with Nvidia positioned as the central supplier of the “machines of intelligence.”The world’s four biggest hyperscale companies, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta, remain Nvidia’s largest customers. Together they account for hundreds of billions of dollars in annual capital expenditures, much of it directed towards building faster and more efficient AI data centres. In 2025, hyperscalers have already doubled their annual CapEx to $600 billion, and industry forecasts suggest that spending will continue rising sharply throughout the decade. Huang sees this as proof that AI is no passing trend but an enduring technology wave. As long as hyperscalers continue expanding, Nvidia will remain the supplier of choice for their most advanced compute platforms.Huang often emphasises that Nvidia has a structural advantage compared to competitors such as AMD and Intel. While others produce chips, Nvidia controls the entire technology stack: GPUs, AI servers, networking hardware, and the CUDA software ecosystem that has become the industry standard for AI development. This combination gives Nvidia up to 95 per cent of the AI chip market share. More importantly, it ensures that developers and companies rely on Nvidia’s ecosystem rather than alternatives. Huang argues that rivals face almost insurmountable barriers to entry because Nvidia has already built the foundation for the AI economy.Nvidia is not just a chipmaker but also a leader in networking technologies that connect the world’s most advanced AI factories. Its Spectrum-X Ethernet and InfiniBand platforms deliver the high throughput and low latency that massive AI models require. The company’s upcoming Spectrum-XGS will link multiple data centres together, creating mega AI hubs capable of serving entire regions. Nvidia’s networking business has already surpassed a $10 billion annual run rate, and Huang expects it to grow even faster as AI models demand more seamless and efficient global connectivity.Nvidia continues to break records quarter after quarter. For Q3 2025, the company projects revenue of $54 billion, a figure achieved even without major sales to China. Analysts forecast Nvidia’s full-year revenue at $207 billion in 2025, rising to $272 billion in 2026. These numbers underscore not only Nvidia’s market dominance but also the scale of the AI revolution. Huang argues that Nvidia’s financial trajectory proves that demand for AI will keep accelerating as businesses integrate intelligent systems across all industries.Nvidia is not pursuing robotics and AI in isolation. The company has cultivated a global developer community of more than two million people and built partnerships with over one thousand companies. These range from Amazon Robotics and Boston Dynamics to healthcare giants such as Medtronic. Huang sees this ecosystem as Nvidia’s strongest long-term advantage, since it ensures that innovation and applications will continue to flow through its platforms. By embedding itself in every industry, Nvidia aims to make its hardware and software indispensable to the future of automation and intelligent machines.Looking to the next decade, Huang remains confident that Nvidia will continue to lead. He compares Nvidia’s current position to Microsoft’s dominance during the PC era, arguing that the company has become the default choice for AI. By being present everywhere from cloud computing to robotics to edge devices, Nvidia has secured a place at the centre of the AI economy. Huang sees this as only the beginning, with AI set to transform every aspect of life and Nvidia poised to supply the critical infrastructure that powers it all.","Jensen Huang has laid out an ambitious vision for the company’s future.

State-owned telecom provider BSNL may soon launch its own digital payment service , BSNL Pay , which will be powered by the BHIM UPI framework. This new service will be integrated into the telco's existing Selfcare app, rather than being released as a standalone application. BSNL has not yet announced a formal launch date.“BSNL Pay – Coming Soon! A new digital step by BSNL. Now UPI payments will be Secure | Swift | Smart, directly through the BSNL Selfcare App , powered by BHIM,” said a post by BSNL UP (East) Circle twitter handle.“Soon you’ll be able to recharge, pay bills & transfer money seamlessly with BSNL Pay,” it added.Earlier this year, BSNL reported a net profit of Rs 280 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, marking its second consecutive profitable quarter after nearly two decades. The turnaround comes a year after the company posted a loss of Rs 849 crore in the same quarter.“For the first time in 18 years, back-to-back quarterly profits, net profits, not just operating margins, for the second time running after 2007,” Union telecom minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said.BSNL had posted a profit after tax of Rs 262 crore in the October-December quarter of FY25. The company's cumulative loss for the full financial year has now narrowed sharply to Rs 2,247 crore, from Rs 5,370 crore in FY24.BSNL chairman and managing director A Robert J Ravi attributed the performance to ""professional management, government support and relentless focus on both the top line and the bottom line.""“BSNL is not just being revived, but redefined,” Ravi said, adding that the company is focused on cost discipline and accelerating 4G and 5G deployments to maintain momentum.In July, American company, Viasat, expanded its satellite communications operations in the country by partnering with the state-run telecom provider to offer a range of satellite-based services, from consumer-focused mobile connectivity to solutions for aviation and security forces. This came as Elon Musk’s Starlink prepares to launch its satellite internet services in India.","State-owned telecom provider BSNL may soon launch its own digital payment service.

‘US client calls’: Infosys changes bus timings for employees at Bengaluru campus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-client-calls-infosys-changes-bus-timings-for-employees-at-bengaluru-campus/articleshow/123652468.cms,"Client calls vs. commute chaos

Bengaluru’s traffic woes persist

Work culture and flexibility

Indian IT giant Infosys has revised the evening bus departure timings at its Electronic City campus in Bengaluru. The company took this decision after employees raised concerns about the long commuting hours. Responding to the employee concerns over long commuting hours the company changed the departure time at the Bengaluru campus as it was interfering with client calls and demos—particularly those aligned with US time zones.As reported by Economic Times, in an internal mail, the company announce that starting September 1, the internal shuttle service will depart at 4PM and 6PM, replacing the earlier 5:30 PM and 6:30 PM slots. In mail also cited “congestion” on city roads as the reason for the change in the timings. However, the employees feel that the real cause is the loss of productivity because of the peak-hour travel.“It used to take about 90 minutes or more for those of us boarding the 5:30 PM bus to reach home,” one employee told Economic Times, requesting anonymity. “This came in the way of handling official calls and hurt productivity.” The Infosys employees working with the US-based clients often continue to their workday after reaching home, but many complained that they were not able to take confidential calls during the commute. This feedback from employees lead to the change in the schedule of the shuttle.Bengaluru’s traffic congestion still remain as a main challenge. Despite the recent launch of the 19-km Yellow Line Metro, the traffic on the roads remain the same. Notably, stations like Konappana Agrahara and Hebbagodi were funded by Infosys and Biocon, respectively.Infosys encourages employees to use its bus service to ease congestion both on city roads and within its campus, especially for those living in areas not served by the metro.Infosys employees have a daily shift of 9.15 hours. As part of its return-to-office policy which the company introduced in November 2023, the employees are asked to work from office for at least 10 days a month. With over 323,500 employees, operational tweaks like bus rescheduling reflect the company’s effort to balance infrastructure challenges with global client demands.","Infosys has revised the evening bus departure timings at its Bengaluru campus.

"Online shopping using ChatGPT and other AI tools can be 'confusing' for users, report claims",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/online-shopping-using-chatgpt-and-other-ai-tools-can-be-confusing-for-users-report-claims/articleshow/123652375.cms,"How these disparities in recommendations can ‘confuse’ users



Mivi AI Buds Review: Earphones that talk to you

Online shopping using AI tools like ChatGPT can be confusing for users due to a lack of consensus in brand recommendations, a report claims. An analysis by BrightEdge, which assessed thousands of shopping-related questions across various AI platforms, found that they frequently disagree on which brands to suggest. The report found that 61.9% of user queries resulted in conflicting brand recommendations, depending on the platform used. In only 17% of cases did ChatGPT, Google's AI Overviews, and Google's AI Mode in Search recommend the same brand. Google AI Overviews were noted to lead with brand mentions in 36.8% of queries.The report also mentions significant inconsistencies in brand recommendations across AI platforms. The three tools agreed on brand choices for only 17% of queries. Disagreements were most important in healthcare (68.5%), followed by education (62.1%) and finance (57.9%).According to the report, various chatbots handle shopping-related queries in different ways. This means that if you’re looking to buy something like a shirt or jeans, you’ll likely need to check at least two AI tools to get a complete picture of the brands that are worth considering.The report shows that ChatGPT typically suggests fewer options, while Google’s AI tends to present more than twice as many. Instead of relying on a single AI for shopping guidance, you may need to cross-check between them to get a clearer idea.Some users may prefer ChatGPT because it offers around 2.5 times fewer brand suggestions than Google’s AI, making the experience feel less overwhelming. Others could argue that having more options increases the chances of making the right choice.As per the research, ChatGPT recommends an average of 2.37 brands per query, whereas Google’s AI Overview suggests nearly 6.02. On the other hand, Google’s AI Mode lags with just 1.59 brands per query. However, the report noted that ChatGPT avoids naming brands in 43.4% of cases, while Google AI Overviews skip brand mentions in only 9.1% of queries.Online shopping isn’t as simple as it looks, since buyers often rely on reviews and expert opinions before making a decision. In such cases, ChatGPT and Google’s AI differ significantly as well.While ChatGPT mentions an average of 2.37 brands per query, it provides only 0.73 citations, offering limited transparency. In comparison, Google AI Mode delivers over 14 citations for six brand mentions, which is 2.4 times more citations than brands, making its recommendations appear more reliable.This suggests Google’s AI Mode is stronger when it comes to explaining why certain brands are recommended. However, to make a well-informed choice, shoppers may still want to cross-check between ChatGPT and Google’s AI, even if it’s less convenient.","An analysis by BrightEdge assessed thousands of shopping-related questions across various AI platforms.

Population collapse: Elon Musk’s ongoing concern



Tesla CEO Elon Musk has once again started the debate around collapsing population. In a stark warning post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Elon Musk wrote, “There will be no West if this continues.” Musk shared the post in response to a post shared by an X user. An X user shared a post on the platform in which he mentioned that replacement migration is the greatest threat to the West. In response to the post, Musk said that not migration, but low birth rate is the number one threat to the west.SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has issued a dire warning for America and European nations. Musk said that ‘there will be no West’ if the current population trend continues. Musk’s comment was part of a broader online discussion where users were sharing data and concerns about migration and falling birth rate.An X user @captive dreamer shared a post in about the migration data of Ireland. Sharing the post he wrote ‘Replacement migration is the greatest threat the entire West currently faces.”Replying to this post, Musk wrote, “Low birth rate is the number one threat to the West, followed closely by migration. There will be no West if this continues.”This is not the first time that Elon Musk has raised concerns over declining population. Elon Musk’s comment aligns with his repeated assertions that population collapse—not overpopulation—is the real existential threat to civilization. Musk earlier argued that declining birth rates could lead to economic stagnation, labour shortages, and even civilizational decline if not addressed. “Most people still think the world is overpopulated,” Musk said in earlier interviews. “It’s actually the opposite.”Japan has been the focal point for population collapse, but Elon Musk’s warning also applies to other nations such as South Korea, Italy and parts of Eastern Europe as they are also facing similar trends. This issue of population collapse has also sparked the interests of pro-natalist policies, immigration reform, and even the role of AI and robotics in offsetting labor gaps.",SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has issued a dire warning for America and European nations.

Piotr Szczerek issues public apology

A Polish millionaire has been at the center of a social media firestorm after a viral video appears to show him snatching a tennis hat from a young boy at the US Open. The man, identified as Piotr Szczerek , owner of the paving company Drogbruk , allegedly took an autographed hat from a fan named Brock as it was being offered by Polish tennis star Kamil Majchrzak . The incident, which took place Thursday night (August 28) after Majchrzak’s victory over Karen Khachanov, was captured on a live broadcast and quickly went viral.In the video, Szczerek is seen apparently placing the hat into his wife's bag, while the young boy, who had been standing next to him, looks on in dismay. The video sparked widespread outrage online, with many calling out Szczerek for his actions.Since the incident, Szczerek's company has been ""Google-bombed,"" with its rating plummeting to 2.7 stars from over 60 reviews, most of which are one-star ratings posted in the last 12 hours. Szczerek has also deactivated his social media accounts.Majchrzak confirmed Szczerek’s identity, noting that the millionaire sponsors his tennis federation in Poland. The tennis pro described the incident as a ""confusion"" and a ""dead look,"" stating that he was ""super tired and super excited"" after his win and may have missed what happened.""I was pointing, giving the hat, but I had a lot going on after my match,"" Majchrzak told The Post. ""I’m sure the guy was also acting in the moment of heat, in the moment of emotions.""Piotr Szczerek has issued a public apology. In a post on Instagram, Szczerek wrote that he believed tennis star Kamil Majchrzak was signing the hat for him to give to his sons when he appeared to grab the cap from the little boy. “I would like to unequivocally apologize to the boy who was harmed, his family, as well as all the fans and the player himself,” Szczerek wrote. “I made a serious mistake. In the emotions, in the crowd’s joy after the victory, I was convinced that the tennis player was handing the cap in my direction — for my sons, who had earlier asked for autographs,” he added. “It is a painful but necessary lesson in humility for me,” he concluded.","Polish millionaire Piotr Szczerek has been at the center of a social media firestorm after a viral video appears to show him snatching a tennis hat from a young boy.

Lucy Guo dropped out of college

How Lucy Guo learnt to earn money as a kid

Lucy Guo , world's youngest self-made billionaire and serial entrepreneur, credits her frugal parents with motivating her to start hustling at a young age. Guo, 30, was recently named Forbes' youngest self-made billionaire with a net worth of $1.3 billion. Her first company, Scale AI, an AI data-labeling firm, was acquired by tech giant Meta for a whopping $25 billion.Today, Lucy Guo is the founder of Passes, a content creator monetization platform launched in 2022. She also founded a venture capital firm, Backend Ventures, in 2019 to invest in early-stage tech startups. Growing up in Fremont, California, with Chinese immigrant parents, Guo was taught the importance of both education and money. ""They threw me into Abacus competitions,"" she told CNBC Make It, adding that she was ""definitely forced to have good academics.""Her focus on academics led her to study computer science and human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. However, she dropped out after two years, with only a year left to complete her Computer Science degree. This decision was a major disappointment for her parents.""They sacrificed everything to immigrate from China to America to give their kids a better future,"" Guo explained. ""For their kids to suddenly let go of their education when they were almost done was like a slap in the face.""Instead of finishing her degree, Guo pursued the Thiel Fellowship , a program that provides young people with $200,000 to build innovative companies. ""I think they [parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn't love them,"" she said, ""when it was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future for myself.""Lucy Guo’s parents lived ""a very frugal life,"" but always emphasized the importance of having money. As a result, she started hustling in elementary school. ""I would find ways to make money on the playground,"" she said. This included trading and selling Pokémon cards, colored pencils, and ""anything I could find.""Her parents were strict, and if she misbehaved, they would take her money away. In response, Guo, in second grade, went to Home Depot to get a debit card and opened a PayPal account to store her cash.As the years went on, her money-making endeavors grew. A fan of the game Neopets, she would sell virtual creatures and in-game currency on forums. ""I would get rare pets, rare items, and resell them for actual cash,"" she said.After discovering engineering and coding, she began making and selling bots to cheat in games. From there, her ventures ""snowballed."" ""I then started finding other ways to make money on the internet from making websites using Google AdSense, then creating internet marketing tools...it just snowballed from there,"" she is quoted as saying.","Lucy Guo, 30, was recently named Forbes' youngest self-made billionaire with a net worth of $1.3 billion.

Mivi AI Buds Review: Earphones that talk to you

The digital token, $WLFI, from the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial , has begun trading on major exchanges on Monday (September 1). This development marks a significant step for the “decentralised finance” platform, allowing investors to buy and sell the tokens and potentially boosting the value of the president's own holdings.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the World Liberty tokens have been designed to give holders voting rights on certain business decisions. These digital tokes were initially sold to investors without being tradable.However, in July, investors voted to make the tokens tradable, paving the way for their public debut. World Liberty has said that early investors can now sell up to 20% of their holdings.The tokens are now being offered on some of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance , OKX, and Bybit. According to CoinGecko, the token was last trading at $0.3115.Since World Liberty's launch last year, the Trump family has reportedly earned around $500 million from the project. The primary appeal of the $WLFI token for early investors was its direct connection to the Trump brand and the expectation that the token's value would rise due to the president's backing.However, this latest crypto venture has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers and government ethics experts. They argue that the Trump family's involvement in digital currencies, while the president's administration reshapes the regulatory framework for the sector, presents a profound conflict of interest.Meanwhile, the White House has maintained that Trump’s assets are held in a trust managed by his children and that no conflicts exist.","The $WLFI digital token, from the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial, has begun trading on major exchanges. This development marks a significant step for the “decentralised finance” platform.

Silicon Valley embraces AI; some are being serious while others are trying to make it fun

Airtable CEO Howie Liu is taking an unconventional approach to AI adoption, actively encouraging his 700+ employees to cancel regular work commitments and dedicate entire days—or even weeks—to experimenting with artificial intelligence tools . The directive represents a bold departure from traditional workplace expectations as tech companies scramble to integrate AI into their operations.""If you want to cancel all your meetings for a day or for an entire week and just go play around with every AI product that you think could be relevant to Airtable, go do it. Period,"" Liu stated during a recent appearance on Lenny's Podcast. The 36-year-old cofounder emphasised that ""play"" and ""experimentation"" are the most crucial elements for AI mastery.Liu practices what he preaches, claiming to be the ""No. 1 most expensive in inference-cost user of Airtable AI"" globally across all customers. He describes his AI usage as ""extremely, intentionally wasteful,"" spending hundreds of dollars on inference costs to generate insights from sales call transcripts. ""Hundreds of dollars spent on this exercise is trivial compared to the potential strategic value of having better insights,"" Liu explained, noting that such analysis would typically cost millions through consulting firms.This approach mirrors broader industry trends where tech leaders are mandating AI proficiency . Google and Microsoft executives have warned employees that AI adoption is no longer optional for career advancement, with both companies now incorporating AI usage into performance evaluations.The push for AI integration extends across Silicon Valley, including its biggest players. Microsoft's Julia Liuson declared that ""using AI is no longer optional—it's core to every role and every level,"" while Google CEO Sundar Pichai urged employees to ""be more AI-savvy"" during company meetings. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has instructed teams to learn AI tools for creating ""scrappier teams,"" and Shopify now requires departments to demonstrate AI usage before requesting additional resources.Duolingo that is also pushing employees towards AI literacy, but has implemented similar strategies to that of Airtable CEO through weekly ""f-r-A-I-days,"" where teams experiment with AI efficiency improvements every Friday morning. The language learning platform's CEO Luis von Ahn told The New York Times that these sessions help teams discover new AI applications.Airtable, valued at nearly $12 billion in 2021, relaunched as an "" AI-native app platform "" in June, positioning itself in what Liu calls the ""killer application of AI""—vibe coding platforms that make AI work scalable beyond simple chat interactions.","Airtable CEO models ""Wasteful"" AI usage to drive company innovation.

Google defends its safety protocols



Over half a dozen UK lawmakers have accused Google DeepMind of violating international AI safety commitments by releasing its Gemini 2.5 Pro model in March 2025 without proper safety documentation, calling it a ""troubling breach of trust with governments and the public.""The cross-party group, including digital rights campaigner Baroness Beeban Kidron and former Defence Secretary Des Browne, published an open letter through activist group PauseAI UK , claiming Google failed to honor the Frontier AI Safety Commitments signed at an international summit in February 2024.The controversy centers on Google's decision to release Gemini 2.5 Pro—which the company said outperformed competitors by ""meaningful margins""—without immediately publishing a detailed model card containing safety testing information. The document was only released 22 days after the model became publicly available, with comprehensive safety details arriving over a month later.According to the letter shared with TIME, Google's delayed disclosure ""sets a dangerous precedent"" for AI development. The lawmakers criticised what they termed a ""minimal model card"" that lacked substantive details about external evaluations and failed to confirm whether government agencies like the UK AI Security Institute participated in testing.""If leading companies like Google treat these commitments as optional, we risk a dangerous race to deploy increasingly powerful AI without proper safeguards,"" Lord Browne of Ladyton stated in the letter.At the 2024 summit, Google and other AI companies pledged to ""publicly report"" their models' capabilities and risk assessments while disclosing external testing involvement. The commitment was designed to provide transparency as AI systems become more powerful and potentially dangerous.A Google DeepMind spokesperson told Fortune the company stands by its ""transparent testing and reporting processes"" and is fulfilling public commitments, including the Seoul Frontier AI Safety Commitments. The spokesperson confirmed that Gemini 2.5 Pro underwent ""rigorous safety checks, including by UK AISI and other third-party testers.""However, Google only shared the model with the UK AI Security Institute after its March 25 release, according to TIME reporting. The lawmakers are demanding Google establish clear timelines for safety reporting and provide full transparency about testing partnerships for future releases.The letter reflects growing concerns about voluntary AI safety commitments, with similar criticism directed at other companies including Meta's Llama 4 and OpenAI 's recent model releases lacking immediate safety documentation.","UK lawmakers accuse Google DeepMind of violating AI safety commitments.

"Elon Musk’s Starlink plans to lower satellite orbit, here’s why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-starlink-plans-to-lower-satellite-orbit-heres-why/articleshow/126310150.cms,"Read Michael Nicolls’ full announcement



Starlink is beginning a significant reconfiguration of its satellite constellation focused on increasing space safety. We are lowering all @Starlink satellites orbiting at ~550 km to ~480 km (~4400 satellites) over the course of 2026. The shell lowering is being tightly coordinated with other operators, regulators, and USSPACECOM.

Lowering the satellites results in condensing Starlink orbits, and will increase space safety in several ways. As solar mininum approaches, atmospheric density decreases which means the ballistic decay time at any given altitude increases - lowering will mean a >80% reduction in ballistic decay time in solar minimum, or 4+ years reduced to a few months. Correspondingly, the number of debris objects and planned satellite constellations is significantly lower below 500 km, reducing the aggregate likelihood of collision.

Starlink satellites have extremely high reliability, with only 2 dead satellites in its fleet of over 9000 operational satellites. Nevertheless, if a satellite does fail on orbit, we want it to deorbit as quickly as possible. These actions will further improve the safety of the constellation, particularly with difficult to control risks such as uncoordinated maneuvers and launches by other satellite operators.

Some tech startups in America are telling employees: 'Leave your shoes behind'; and reason is a 'schedule' that has its origins in China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/some-tech-startups-in-america-are-telling-employees-leave-your-shoes-behind-and-reason-is-a-schedule-that-has-its-origins-in-china/articleshow/126312951.cms,"Representative Photo (Image via Puma)

‘996’: Hustle culture trend taking hold in Silicon Valley

Why 'shoe-less' trend may not go mainstream





Some startups in America are embracing a ""no shoes"" policy. According to a report in the New York Times, ""The “no shoes” trend is spreading in tech offices, with buzzy start-ups telling employees to leave their Vans and Uggs at the door. "" The list of such startups includes Cursor, Replo and Composite. Ben Lang, an employee at Cursor, wrote in a social media post, ""I’ve only worked at startups that have a no-shoes in office policy.""Sneha Sivakumar, a co-founder and the chief executive of Spur, told New York Times that the no-shoes policy “makes it feel like a second home” for her 10 employees and “disarms you in a positive way.” Spur uses AI to check websites for bugs. The report quotes Nick Bloom, a Stanford economist who studies work culture, saying that the shoes-off trend was partly “the pajama economy in action.” According to Bloom, now that people who worked from home during the pandemic are back in the office, they are bringing their home habits with them.Analysts are also linking the phenomenon with Silicon Valley's 996 culture. The 996 number combo refers to a work schedule — 9 a.m.to 9 p.m., six days a week — that has its origins in China’s hard-charging tech scene. Though analysts say that the term is relatively new in Silicon Valley, 996 is a “high-octane version of something that has been around in the tech industry for a while,” said Margaret O’Mara, a historian at the University of Washington as per an NY Times report.She added that after a few turbulent years of layoffs, the tech industry has tightened things up. Elon Musk’s self-proclaimed “extremely hard core” approach is no longer out of step with the rest of the industry. Silicon Valley’s “hard tech” era is here, and working crazy hours (or at least talking about working crazy hours) is part of the new norm.Still, the practice is unlikely to become the go-to in American offices. As the New York Times fashion critic Vanessa Friedman has written, feet “are among the most controversial, least discussed parts of the body.” Another reason the trend may struggle to catch on in more age-diverse workplaces is because as per Friedman, “Young people have great feet,” he reflected. “Old people don’t.”","Some startups in America are embracing a ""no shoes"" policy.

Google has long been known for embedding innovative Easter eggs into its search engines. These Easter eggs usually have some link with popular cultural events that otherwise captivated the entire globe. One Easter egg is from the popular sci-fi series offered by Netflix entitled ‘Stranger Things.’ The series has long fascinated audiences with the eerie world of its alternate dimension called the Upside Down. The Easter egg related to this series is very subtle because it does not intend to be noticed or heard. This Easter egg has not been designed for any specific device because it only lasts for an instance.The Stranger Things Google Easter egg is a visual effect that occurs on the actual page displaying the search results. The visual effect gives the appearance of the actual page being turned upside down, much like the Upside Down of the series. It’s not like other games or animations where the goal is to have the user actively engage with it, and this particular Easter egg is kept purposefully simple, using only distortion and rotation to unsettle the user, which is much like the series.When this happens, the Easter egg triggers a subtle manipulation of how the page is presented.It is not immediate or drastic, which is why many people manage to overlook the occurrence the first time. The page might revolve slowly, and/or everything seems to be turned upside down or like it is somehow out of place, much like the heroes in the Netflix series recognize an infusion of the Upside Down into their world.The Upside Down effect can easily be activated; it just requires good timing and attention.To access it:It might not happen immediately, so it is very important to give it a little time to take effect.The Easter egg will also be optimised for functionality on both desktop and mobile platforms, albeit with a subtle variation based on the platform and operating system being utilised.Despite these differences, the net effect, however, is the same.Google often partners with popular franchises in order to give fans an organic search experience. Stranger Things is one of the best series for this type of activity because its central idea has to do with secrets and altered worlds. The Upside Down is weaved into the search experience, which causes a normal online environment to become slightly disconcerting, all in tribute to Stranger Things.The Upside Down effect is a temporary one and can be easily reversed. There is no chance that it might become permanent and affect your device.To reset the screen:Once you are done with that, everything goes back to normal.The Stranger Things feature is just one example of Google’s playful side. Over the years, the search engine has included dozens of hidden tricks tied to films, games and internet culture.Well-known examples include:Each Easter egg is designed to be harmless, temporary and fun.","The Stranger Things Google Easter egg is a visual effect that occurs on the actual page displaying the search results.

OnePlus Nord 6 is on the TDRA Certification website; hints that it will be released soon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/oneplus-nord-6-is-on-the-tdra-certification-website-hints-that-it-will-be-released-soon/articleshow/126308022.cms,"AI generated

Does the OnePlus Nord 6 TDRA listing hint at an upcoming launch

Credit - A screenshot of TDRA website

Is the OnePlus Nord 6 just a renamed OnePlus Ace 6

OnePlus Nord 6 display and design expected

How powerful could the OnePlus Nord 6 be

What do we know about the cameras and battery so far





Phones rarely announce themselves all at once. More often, they appear in fragments. A model number here. A regulatory listing there. The OnePlus Nord 6 seems to be following that familiar path. Its name has now surfaced on the UAE’s TDRA certification website, adding to an earlier appearance in Malaysia. There is still no launch date, no official image, and no press event in sight. Yet these small signs matter. They suggest the phone exists beyond rumour and is moving through the routine steps that come before release. For midrange phones especially, this slow build tends to say more than bold claims. The Nord line has always grown this way, quietly, with details filling in over time rather than arriving all at once.The TDRA listing confirms the name OnePlus Nord 6 and links it to the model number CPH2795. That alone might sound minor, but certification sites are rarely wrong. They sit between development and release, catching devices as they prepare to enter real markets.The same model number was previously seen on Malaysia’s SIRIM database, which strengthens the case that this is a global model rather than a local variant. The UAE listing does not reveal specifications, but it does suggest OnePlus is lining up launches across regions, not just China.Rumours point in that direction. OnePlus has a history of rebranding Ace series phones for international markets under the Nord name. If that pattern holds, the Nord 6 would closely mirror the OnePlus Ace 6 that launched in China last October.This approach is not unusual. It allows OnePlus to reuse proven hardware while adjusting software and pricing for different regions. For buyers, it usually means solid performance rather than experimental design. Still, final confirmation will only come from OnePlus itself.Leaks suggest the OnePlus Nord 6 could feature a 6.83-inch display with 1.5K resolution. That places it firmly in large phone territory, aimed at people who value screen space for video, games, or reading.Design details remain unclear, but if it follows the Ace 6 closely, the phone may keep a clean, practical look rather than anything flashy. The focus appears to be on durability, with reports pointing to strong dust and water resistance ratings across several IP levels.One of the more surprising rumours is the processor. The phone is said to run on the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, which would place it well above typical mid-range expectations.If true, this would make the Nord 6 more about performance longevity than short-term appeal. Paired with up to 16GB of RAM and up to 512GB of storage, it would suit users who keep phones for several years rather than upgrading often.Camera details remain modest. Leaks point to a dual rear setup, led by a 50 megapixel primary sensor and an 8 megapixel secondary camera. On the front, a 16 megapixel camera is expected.According to reports, the upcoming OnePlus phone is expected to come with a 7,800mAh battery paired with 120W fast charging. If accurate, this would offer long usage and short charging times, a combination many users now expect.","OnePlus Nord 6 has appeared on the UAE’s TDRA certification website.

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!

iPhone Fold expected design and features



iPhone Fold expected price







Apple is expected to launch its first foldable smartphone next year. Now, the long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders offering a clear look at the design of first foldable iPhone. As per the YouTube channel Front Page Tech and popular tipper Ice Universe, the design of Apple’s first foldable iPhone may resemble to Google’s Pixel Fold. As per the images leaked online, the yet-to-launch foldable iPhone is said to feature a book-style foldable design.As per the leaks, the upcoming foldable iPhone is said to feature a large internal display and a smaller cover screen. The renders also highlight a minimal crease along with fold area where rival devices like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold have often drawn criticism. The design appears to prioritize durability and a seamless viewing experience, aligning with Apple’s reputation for premium hardware aesthetics.“The comparison of the design of the Samsung Galaxy Wide Fold and the Apple iPhone Fold is almost identical, with the only difference being the R-angle. Samsung is more square, while Apple is more rounded. Do you prefer the square one or the rounder one?,” wrote Ice Universe.Early leaks suggest that the first foldable iPhone may look and function differently from the current iPhone lineup. It is expected that the foldable iPhone may ditch the Face ID in order to accommodate the thinner foldable design. It is also said that the company may include a 24MP under-display selfie camera which will offer a cleaner and uninterrupted look to the display. The is also tipped that the foldable iPhone may feature another 24MP camera on the cover display making it easier for the users to take selfies or answer video calls.On the back, the foldable iPhone may feature a dual-lens setup with two 48MP sensors — one standard and one ultrawide — but no telephoto lens. This simplified camera system seems to be a design trade-off to maintain the slim build that a foldable phone requires. While the camera specs may sound modest compared to Apple’s Pro models, the focus for this device appears to be on delivering a sleek design, new display technology, and the flexibility of a foldable form factor.Multiple online rumours suggest that the upcoming Foldable iPhone may be priced around $2,399.","The long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders.

'Trump Needs Indian Skilled Workers': Expert On Big Tech's AI Bet On India

Demis Hassabis makes his stand clear on AI scaling





Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Speaking on Google DeepMind: The Podcast, Hassabis said many early-stage companies are now raising tens of billions dollars before even launching product. He believes that this trend exposes cracks in the valuation model. “Some startups basically haven’t even got going yet,” Hassabis said. “It’s sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. My guess is probably not, at least not in general.” This increase in speculative funding has drawn comparisons to past bubbles, such as the dot-com boom and the crypto frenzy, where companies raised massive sums on hype rather than proven business models.Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google, which he said are backed by “a lot of real business.” While Big Tech’s AI bets are supported by revenue streams and infrastructure, many startups are relying solely on investor enthusiasm.He added that AI is “overhyped in the short term” but “underappreciated in the medium to long-term,” suggesting that while the technology’s potential is profound, the current funding frenzy may not reflect sustainable growth.Reflecting on DeepMind’s own early days, Hassabis noted how technological shifts often swing from skepticism to obsession, inflating valuations quickly. “It’s almost an overreaction to the underreaction,” he said, pointing out that investor sentiment can flip dramatically once a technology gains traction.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO also made his stand clear on the debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent. Scaling laws suggest that the more data and compute an AI model receives, the smarter it becomes.",Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"

He revealed on The Joe Rogan Experience that his mantra is to run Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business,"" a mindset forged by past near-death experiences.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Fear-driven leadership powers AI chip giant's success

Seven-day workweeks extend beyond executive suite





Despite leading the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang operates in constant fear of failure. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business."" The co-founder, who has led the chipmaker since 1993, said this feeling of vulnerability ""doesn't leave you"" despite the company's recent milestone of becoming the first public firm to reach a $5 trillion valuation in October.Huang's unconventional leadership approach stems from near-death experiences in the 1990s when Nvidia faced bankruptcy multiple times. He recalled flying to Japan to inform Sega that a contracted graphics chip was flawed and the deal should be canceled, while simultaneously admitting Nvidia needed the final $5 million payment to survive. Sega converted the funds into an investment, providing the lifeline that kept the company afloat.""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,"" Huang explained. The CEO maintains his intense work schedule by waking at 4 a.m.daily to read emails for hours, processing several thousand messages each day.

"Instagram head Adam Mosseri says AI has ‘killed’ creativity, urges creators to make original content: Read full post",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/instagram-head-adam-mosseri-says-ai-has-killed-creativity-urges-creators-to-make-original-content-read-full-post/articleshow/126310024.cms,"Here’s Instagram head Adam Mosseri’s full letter:



The key risk Instagram faces is that, as the world changes more quickly, the platform fails to keep up. Looking forward to 2026, one major shift: authenticity is becoming infinitely reproducible.

Everything that made creators matter-the ability to be real, to connect, to have a voice that couldn’t be faked-is now accessible to anyone with the right tools. Deepfakes are getting better. Al generates photos and videos indistinguishable from captured media.

Power has shifted from institutions to individuals because the internet made it so anyone with a compelling idea could find an audience. The cost of distributing information is zero.

Individuals, not publishers or brands, established that there’s a significant market for content from people. Trust in institutions is at an all-time low. We’ve turned to self-captured content from creators we trust and admire.

We like to complain about “AI slop,” but there’s a lot of amazing

AI content

. Even the quality AI content has a look though: too slick, skin too smooth. That will change - we’re going to see more realistic AI content.

Authenticity is becoming a scarce resource, driving more demand for creator content, not less. The bar is shifting from “can you create?” to “can you make something that only you could create?”

Unless you are under 25, you probably think of Instagram as feed of square photos: polished makeup, skin smoothing, and beautiful landscapes. That feed is dead. People stopped sharing personal moments to feed years ago.

The primary way people share now is in DMs: blurry photos and shaky videos of daily experiences. Shoe shots. and unflattering candids.

This raw aesthetic has bled into public content and across artforms.

The camera companies are betting on the wrong aesthetic. They’re competing to make everyone look like a pro photographer from 2015. But in a world where AI can generate flawless imagery, the professional look becomes the tell.

Flattering imagery is cheap to produce and boring to consume.

People want content that feels real. Savvy creators are leaning into unproduced, unflattering images. In a world where everything can be perfected, imperfection becomes a signal.

Rawness isn’t just aesthetic preference anymore — it’s proof. It’s defensive. A way of saying: this is real because it’s imperfect.

Relatively quickly, AI will create any aesthetic you like, including an imperfect one that presents as authentic. At that point we’ll need to shift our focus to who says something instead of what is being said.

For most of my life I could safely assume photographs or videos were largely accurate captures of moments that happened. This is clearly no longer the case and it’s going to take us years to adapt.

We’re going to move from assuming what we see is real by default, to starting with skepticism. Paying attention to who is sharing something and why. This will be uncomfortable - we’re genetically predisposed to believing our eyes.

Platforms like Instagram will do good work identifying AI content, but they’ll get worse at it over time as AI gets better. It will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media.

Camera manufacturers will cryptographically sign images at capture, creating a chain of custody.

Labeling is only part of the solution. We need to surface much more context about the accounts sharing content so people can make informed decisions. Who is behind the account?

In a world of infinite abundance and infinite doubt, the creators who can maintain trust and signal authenticity - by being real, transparent, and consistent - will stand out.

We need to build the best creative tools. Label AI-generated content and verify authentic content. Surface credibility signals about who’s posting. Continue to improve ranking for originality.

Instagram is going to have to evolve in a number of ways, and fast.



","Instagram head Adam Mosseri has written a letter to users about the future of the social network. Mosseri says that in 2026, 'authenticity is becoming infinitely reproducible' and that the bar is shifting from 'can you create' to 'can only you create?' Mosseri also says that Instagram will have to evolve in a number of ways.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126309974,imgsize-620682,width-400,resizemode-4/instagram-ceo-adam-mosseri.jpg"

Perplextiy CEO explaines benefits of moving AI from cloud to machines





Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas has issued a warning: the future of artificial intelligence (AI) may not be in the cloud, which means that massive, energy-hungry data centres for which tech giants pouring billions of dollars may become irrelevant. He said that the AI power will be in users’ pockets with silicon that powers their devices, capable of running sophisticated LLMs.In an interview, Srinivas argued that the rise of high-performance, on-device AI is the biggest existential threat to the centralised infrastructure which is currently dominating the tech industry.“Well, the the biggest threat to a data centre is if the intelligence can be packed locally on a chip that's running on the device and then there's no need to inference all of it on like one centralized data center. It becomes more decentralized and even better if the models that are coming along with the chip are are things that adapt to you,” Srinivas said.“And by the way, you don't even you may not even need that for adaptation to you. It could just be um data that lives on your computer or your device um that can be retrieved on the fly,” he added.Srinivas postulated multiple benefits of moving AI from the cloud to the device. He said that the processing will happen instantly on the device, removing the delay of sending data to a remote server.Having AI on machine will ensure that personal data never leaves the user's hardware. Thirdly, Srinivas compared local AI to having a “digital brain” that lives with the user, learning and evolving based on their specific habits.“That way you don't have to repeat it. That's your intelligence. You own it. It's your brain. Then that really disrupts the whole data centre industry like it doesn't make sense to spend all this money 500 billion 5 trillion whatever on building all the centralised data centres across the world that do a lot of the intelligence workloads for people. This is the question. This is whatever it's a $10 trillion question, hundred trillion dollar question,” he explained.“That's not yet happened. No one's actually shipped a model that can be packaged on your computer, a very efficient chip locally and then it's very intelligent enough that it can complete tasks reliably. That's not yet happened. When that happens, I think it's it'll be very interesting,” the Perplexity CEO concluded.","The future of artificial intelligence (AI) may not be in the cloud, says Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas.

To,

The Chief Compliance Officer, X Corp., (formerly Twitter), India Operations

Subject: Failure to observe statutory due diligence obligations under the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, and seeking an Action Taken Report towards immediate compliance for prevention of hosting, generation, publication, transmission, sharing or uploading of obscene, nude, indecent and sexually explicit content through the misuse of Al-based services like 'Grok' and xAl's other services.

It has been reported and represented from time to time, including through public discourse and representations from various parliamentary stakeholders that certain categories of content circulating on your platform may not be in compliance with applicable laws relating to decency and obscenity. It has especially been observed that the service namely ""Grok Al"" developed by you and integrated and made available on the X platform, is being misused by users to create fake accounts to host, generate, publish or share obscene images or videos of women in a derogatory or vulgar manner in order to indecently denigrate them. Importantly, this is not limited to creation of fake accounts but also targets women who host or publish their images or videos, through prompts, image manipulation and synthetic outputs. Such conduct reflects a serious failure of platform-level safeguards and enforcement mechanisms, and amounts to gross misuse of artificial intelligence technologies in violation of applicable laws.

2. In this context, and without prejudice to action taken or being taken by authorised agencies under applicable laws, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (""Ministry""/ ""MeitY"") is of the view that the regulatory provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000(""IT Act"") and the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (""IT Rules, 2021) are not being adequately adhered to by your platform, particularly in relation to obscene, indecent, vulgar, pomographic, paedophilic, or otherwise unlawful or harmful content which are potentially violative of extant laws.

3. The aforesaid acts and omissions are viewed with grave concern, as they have the effect of violating the dignity, privacy and safety of women and children, normalising sexual harassment and exploitation in digital spaces, and undermining the statutory due diligence framework applicable to intermediaries operating in India.

4. Attention is invited to the Advisory issued by MeitY on 29.12.2025, particularly paragraph 9 thereof, wherein all intermediaries have been unequivocally advised to undertake an immediate review of their internal compliance frameworks, content moderation practices and user enforcement mechanisms, and to ensure strict and continuous adherence to the provisions of the IT Act and the IT Rules, 2021.

5. X, being a significant social media intermediary, is hereby reminded that compliance with the IT Act and the IT Rules, 2021 is not optional, and that the statutory exemptions under section 79 of the IT Act are conditional upon strict observance of due diligence obligations, including but not limited to Rules 3 and 4 of the IT Rules, 2021:

• Rule 4(9): obligation to provide additional information which may include any clarifications and Action Taken Reports as may be sought by the Ministry.

• Rule 4(1)(a): appointment and effective functioning of a Chief Compliance Officer, who shall be responsible and liable for ensuring compliance with the Act and the Rules;

• Rules 3(1Kb) and 3(1(d): obligation to prevent hosting, publication, transmission or sharing of unlawful content by making reasonable efforts and to remove or disable access expeditiously to any such information that is obscene, pornographic, paedophilic, harmful to women and child, or otherwise unlawful, and strictly within the prescribed timelines upon receipt of actual knowledge, through court orders or reasoned intimation from the Appropriate Government or its authorised agency;

• Rule 3(1Xi): obligation to furnish information and extend assistance lawfully sought by the Government or its authorised agencies, strictly within the timelines specified, for the purposes of verification of identity, or for the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution, of offences under any law for the time being in force; and

• Rule 3(2), Rule 4(4): obligation to deploy accessible reporting and grievance redressal systems under Rule 3(2), while additionally deploying technology-based measures under Rule 4(4), including automated tools or other mechanisms, to proactively prevent the dissemination of such obscene, vulgar and indecent content and ensure timely compliance with removal requirements.

• Rule 3(2)(b): obligation to remove or disable access to any content which is prima facie in the nature of material depicting an individual in any sexual act or conduct, or any impersonation thereof, within twenty-four hours of receipt of a complaint from the affected individual or any person on such individual's behalf.

6. It is reiterated that hosting, generation, publication, transmission, sharing, or uploading of obscene, nude, indecent, sexually explicit, vulgar, pedophilic content or any content that is invasive of another's privacy including bodily privacy or otherwise unlawful, including through Al-enabled systems and tools, attracts serious penal consequences under multiple statutes, including: sections 66E, 67, 67A and 67B of the IT Act; relevant provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanita, 2023 (""BNS"");

• the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986;

• the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012;

• the Young Persons (Harmful Publications) Act, 1956;

• section 85 of the IT Act: Offences by companies in contravention of the IT Act and the rules thereunder including the IT Rules, 2021; and

• other applicable laws for the time being in force.

7. Further, attention is specifically drawn to section 33 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS), which imposes a mandatory statutory obligation to report certain offences to the appropriate authorities. This includes offences involving organised crime that includes cyber-crime, as defined under section 111 of the BNS. Any failure to report such offences, despite knowledge or reasonable suspicion, may independently attract penal action under the BNSS.

8. Accordingly, you are advised to strictly desist from the hosting, displaying, uploading, publication, transmission, storage, sharing of any content on your platform that is obscene, pornographic, vulgar, indecent, sexually explicit, paedophilic, or otherwise prohibited under any law for the time being in force in any manner whatsoever. Failure to observe such due diligence obligations shall result in the loss of the exemption from liability under section 79 of the IT Act, and you shall also be liable for consequential action as provided under any law including the IT Act and BNS.

9. Therefore, in exercise of the powers of the Central Government under the IT Act and the IT Rules, 2021, X is hereby directed to:

(a) immediately undertake a comprehensive technical, procedural and governance-level review of the Al-based application ""Grok"", including its prompt-processing, output-generation (responses generated using Large Language Models (LLMs)), image-handling and safety guardrails, so as to ensure that the application does not generate, promote or facilitate content which contains nudity, sexualisation, sexually explicit or otherwise unlawful content in any form whatsoever;

(b) forthwith enforce its user terms of service, acceptable use policies and Al usage restrictions, including strong deterrent measures such as suspension, termination and other enforcement actions against violating users and accounts;

(c) remove or disable access, without delay, to all content already generated or disseminated in violation of applicable laws, in strict compliance with the timelines prescribed under the IT Rules, 2021, without vitiating the evidence in any manner;

(d) submit a detailed Action Taken Report (ATR) to this Ministry, including covering the above aspects, at the earliest and in any case not later than seventy-two (72) hours from the date of issuance of this letter, inter alia, covering:

• specific technical and organisational measures adopted or proposed in relation to the Grok application;

• the role and oversight exercised by the Chief Compliance Officer;

• actions taken against offending content, users and accounts; and mechanisms put in place to ensure compliance with the mandatory reporting requirement under section 33 of the BNSS; and

(e) ensure ongoing, demonstrable and auditable compliance with all due diligence-obligations under the IT Act and the IT Rules, 2021, failing which appropriate action may be initiated, including the loss of the exemption from liability under section 79 of the IT Act, and consequential action as provided under any law including the IT Act and the BNS.

10. It is reiterated that non-compliance with the above requirements shall be viewed seriously and may result in strict legal consequences against your platform, its responsible officers and the users on the platform who violate the law, without any further notice, under the IT Act, the IT Rules, the BNSS, the BNS and other applicable laws.

11. This issues with the approval of the Competent Authority in the Ministry, without prejudice to any other action that may be taken by the Government or law enforcement agencies under any law for the time being in force.

Yours faithfully,

(Ajit Kumar)

The ministry of electronics and IT has sent a letter to X (formerly Twitter), the social media website owned by Elon Musk , pointing out failures in moderating AI-generated content on its platform. The ministry highlighted concerns that the Grok and other services of xAI have been used to generate and distribute obscene or non-consensual images, particularly targeting the dignity and privacy of women. Through the letter, the government has also sought a report on the actions taken by the company, and the immediate removal of illegal materials.The government has also asked X to enforce the required AI guardrails, and submit a detailed Action Taken Report not later than 72 hours or risk losing its statutory immunity from legal liability. Failure to comply with these directives “may result in strict legal consequences against your platform, its responsible officers and the users on the platform who violate the law, without any further notice”.","The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is of the view that the regulatory provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000 (""IT Act"") are not being adequately adhered to by your platform.

Global investors are increasingly favoring Chinese tech, seeing strong policy support and rapid AI monetization as key drivers for future growth.

Trump 's chip embargo inadvertently fueled China's tech sector

Global investors are betting big on Chinese tech independence





Chinese leader Xi Jinping used his New Year's address to send a clear signal to Washington: American chip restrictions aren't slowing down China's AI ambitions. Speaking from Beijing on Wednesday, Xi celebrated his country's homegrown AI models and chipmaking breakthroughs, highlighting how China has turned trade barriers into opportunities for tech independence.""Many large AI models have been competing in a race to the top, and breakthroughs have been achieved in the research and development of our own chips,"" Xi said in his annual address. He emphasized that these innovations have made China ""one of the economies with the fastest-growing innovation capabilities.""The timing of Xi's remarks is significant. His celebration comes after years of escalating US trade restrictions under both the Biden and Trump administrations, which were designed to limit China's access to advanced AI chips from companies like Nvidia. Rather than crippling Chinese tech development, these restrictions appear to have accelerated domestic innovation.In January, it was the DeepSeek AI startup of China that made waves in Silicon Valley by announcing its R1 model, a rival to OpenAI's lineup, enough to send even Nvidia's stock down over 17% on the news. Meanwhile, homegrown Chinese chip makers continued to thrive under the export ban, founders like Chen Weiliang of MetaX Integrated Circuits climbed into the billionaire ranks.The shift hasn't gone unnoticed by Wall Street. UBS Global Wealth Management recently rated Chinese tech as ""most attractive"" to investors, citing strong policy backing and rapid AI monetization. Investment firms like UK's Ruffer are now increasing stakes in Chinese giants like Alibaba while deliberately limiting exposure to US tech stocks.In December, Trump tried a pivot toward reassurance by allowing Nvidia to sell H200 chips to cleared Chinese customers. But analysts say the damage may already be done. Beijing's push for technological self-sufficiency, combined with increasing investor confidence in Chinese AI prospects, means Xi's call for technological independence is finding an audience well beyond China's borders.","China's leader Xi Jinping declared significant AI and chipmaking advancements, framing US restrictions as catalysts for tech independence.

AI's real impact extends beyond replacing programmers, says ex-Google CEO

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt says artificial general intelligence may arrive by 2029





Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt declared his own programming expertise obsolete after watching an AI system autonomously generate an entire software program, calling it a ""profound"" moment that signals the end of traditional coding careers. ""Holy crap. The end of me,"" Schmidt said during a forum at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum earlier this month. ""I've been doing programming for 55 years. To see something start and end in front of your own life is really profound.""The tech veteran underlined the rapid development of AI from being a useful assistant to a possible replacement for qualified programmers. Schmidt revealed that at leading AI research facilities, like OpenAI and Anthropic, the AI system is already performing about 10 to 20 percent of the work in programming, adding that the said percentage will further increase at a very rapid rate.Even with that striking demonstration, Schmidt said that AI is underhyped rather than overhyped. In discussion with Professor Graham Allison, he emphasized that this is where AI’s real economic potential-exists: in automatically performing corporate operations, not just in coding.The real transformation is happening inside companies, where AI systems are taking over billing, accounting, product design, delivery, and inventory management, Schmidt explained.These routine processes consume billions in corporate spending, and automating them could fundamentally reshape business operations.""If anything, it's under-hyped because you are fundamentally automating businesses,"" he said. ""There's an awful lot there—it's extraordinary.""Schmidt predicted artificial general intelligence (AGI)—systems matching the smartest mathematicians, physicists, and artists—will arrive within three to five years. This timeline is driven by what he calls ""recursive self-improvement,"" where AI learns independently without human instruction.""The computers are now doing self-improvement. They're learning how to plan, and they don't have to listen to us anymore,"" he warned at another recent event.However, Schmidt emphasized the need for human oversight as AI approaches these capabilities. ""Somebody's going to have to raise their hand and say, 'We just went too far,'"" he cautioned. ""I think there's no higher duty than to preserve human agency and human freedom.""The former Google executive suggested Wall Street is underestimating the magnitude of AI's impact on business automation and scientific discovery, pointing to medicine, climate solutions, and engineering as sectors where automation could accelerate breakthroughs.","Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt believes AI's rapid advancement signals the end of traditional coding careers.

Seeing names when receiving calls from unknown numbers on your phone: Here’s what has changed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/seeing-names-when-receiving-calls-from-unknown-numbers-on-your-phone-heres-what-has-changed/articleshow/126304230.cms,"AI-generated image for representation purpose

Why Calling Name Presentation

The WhatsApp Scam That Gives Hackers Your Phone!

How CNAP works





Seeing a caller’s name flash on your phone screen even when the number is not saved in your phone book? This is because telecom operators have expanded the rollout of Calling Name Presentation (CNAP), a feature that shows the registered name of the person calling, aimed at reducing spam and fraud calls. The feature was first launched in pilot in October 2025, with an all-India rollout expected by March 31, 2026. The rollout follows directions from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), which has been pushing operators to introduce network-level solutions to improve transparency and curb misuse of telecom services.Currently, only the mobile/ landline numbers are being displayed as Calling Line Identification (CLI) during incoming calls. Most users relied on third-party apps like Truecaller to identify the name of the caller. With Calling Name Presentation or CNAP, the caller’s name will appear automatically during incoming calls, even from unknown numbers, using information available with telecom operators.“At present, smartphone users make use of native smartphone tools and third-party apps to identify the calling party name and mark spam calls.Apple (manufacturer of iPhones) has a ‘silence unknown numbers’ feature on its mobile handsets. The Google Phone app for Android has a ‘caller ID and spam’ protection option that allows phone users to mark incoming calls as spam,” TRAI said in its consultation paper in 2022.“Third-party apps like ‘Truecaller’ and ‘Bharat Caller ID & Anti-spam’ also provide calling party name identification and spam identification facilities. The native smartphone tools and third party apps, generally, provide name identification services based on crowd-sourced data. However, the crowd-sourced name identity information may not be reliable, in many instances,” it added.At the time of connection, users are required to fill customer acquisition forms. The CNAP feature uses these details shared by customers to reveal their identity.Once the rollout is complete, CNAP will be enabled by default. For now, it does not cover landline users or people using feature phones on 2G networks.","Calling Name Presentation (CNAP) is a feature that shows the registered name of the person calling.

Some bankers urge caution on AI over reliance





Morgan Stanley has now issued an AI job warning for the banking sector. More than 2,00,000 banking jobs in Europe could be lost in over next four years as lenders are accelerating the adoption of artificial intelligence and planning to close branches, according to analysts at Morgan Stanely. As reported by Financial Times, the investment bank estimates that the industry could cut 10 per cent of its workforce which amounts to more than 2,00,000 by 2030. The report further highlights that these job cuts will be driven by efficiency gains from digitalisation and AI. The analysis done covers around 35 European lenders which employ around 2.12 million staff.As per the Morgan Stanley analysts these cuts will be mainly concentrated in the central services divisions which includes back office, middle office, risk management and compliance roles.“Many banks have quoted efficiency gains coming from AI and further digitalisation to the tune of 30 per cent,” Morgan Stanley noted. The report highlights how lenders are under pressure from investors to reduce costs and improve returns on equity, which continue to lag behind US rivals.Banks have already begun citing AI as a driver of restructuring. Dutch lender ABN Amro announced plans in November to cut about a fifth of its staff by 2028, while Société Générale chief executive Slawomir Krupa warned earlier this year that “nothing is sacred” in his campaign to reduce costs.Analysts also adds that AI offers bank an opportunity to improve their cost-to-income ratios which is a key measure of efficiency. The forecast also highlight the fact that his digitalisation could reshape Europe’s banking landscape, particularly in countries such as France and Germany, where cost‑to‑income ratios remain high.UBS has already experimented with AI, turning its analysts into avatars to deliver video briefings to clients. Jason Napier, head of European banks research at UBS, said: “Those who still need convincing that AI will significantly change financial services should spend more time exploring the tools which are already available.”Despite the increasing AI adoption, some bankers have urged caution.Conor Hillery, JPMorgan Chase’s co‑chief executive for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, warned against rushing into AI adoption at the expense of training. “The one thing we have to be very careful about — in this rush and excitement about AI in our world of banking — is that people don’t lose an understanding of the basics and fundamentals,” he said.Hillery added that JPMorgan is trying to balance AI integration with ensuring junior staff are properly trained in core tasks such as building cash flow models and calculating price‑to‑earnings ratios. “Otherwise, we’re storing up a big problem for the future,” he cautioned.","Morgan Stanley has issued an AI job warning for the banking sector.

Untapped Economic Value

Breaking Down the Blocks

The policy landscape

From policy to practice

Turning potential into progress

India is home to 63 million MSMEs, with nearly 20% owned by women. Yet the promise of women-led enterprise remains largely unrealized. About 95.6% of these businesses operate in the informal sector, often home-run and micro in scale, invisible to digital markets and formal financial systems despite their economic contributions.Barriers include limited access to credit, lack of digital skills, restricted mobility, and unpaid care responsibilities. Yet women-owned MSMEs demonstrate higher repayment rates and create 11% more jobs for women, reflecting both untapped potential and proven reliability.This Women Entrepreneurship Day, the focus must shift from celebration to systemic action. The question is no longer whether women entrepreneurs can drive India's growth, but how we can leverage technology to allowthem to do so at scale. Digital tools provide the most scalable solution by transcending geography, enabling flexible access, and connecting women to markets and finance that were previously out of reach. For entrepreneurs operating from small towns and villages, this infrastructure becomes the bridge between isolation and opportunity.The economic case for supporting women entrepreneurs extends far beyond inclusion metrics.Integrating an additional 68 million women into the workforce could boost India's GDP by USD 0.7 trillion, while accelerating women's entrepreneurship at scale can create 150 to 170 million jobs.Women-owned businesses generate more local employment, especially for other women, and channel earnings back into their neighbourhoods. They demonstrate stronger repayment discipline and build economic resilience at the community level, creating stability that reaches beyond individual balance sheets.Targeted support could catalyze over 30 million new women-owned enterprises. This goes beyond simply adding businesses to the economy. It means activating an engine that drives inclusive growth while strengthening local markets. The challenge lies not in proving the economics, but in creating the conditions that remove the barriers that currently hold them back.Consider a woman running a handloom business in rural Odisha. She owns a smartphone but uses it only for calls. In fact, only 54% of women aged 15 to 49 own a mobile phone compared to 91% of men, limiting their access to digital markets, training, and formal financial services.Even when women do have devices, financial access remains elusive. Nearly 90% of women entrepreneurs rely entirely on personal savings to fund their businesses. With only 13% of women owning houses independently, they lack the collateral that traditional lending requires. For many, this means business growth depends on what they can save and not what their businesses could potentially generate.These barriers operate within broader social constraints. Household responsibilities, mobility restrictions, and social norms limit how much time and autonomy women can dedicate to their enterprises. In about 20% of cases, male family members effectively control businesses registered in women's names. A woman may own her business on paper, but whether she can independently make decisions often depends on factors beyond her control. These barriers compound to limited device access, restricting digital learning, preventing access to formal finance and keeping businesses informal and small.India has established a substantial policy framework to support women entrepreneurs. Schemes such as Stand-Up India, PMEGP, and the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) include targeted provisions for women. In FY 2023-24 alone, PMMY disbursed ₹2.22 lakh crore to 4.24 crore women entrepreneurs. Platforms like the Women Entrepreneurship Platform offer access to hundreds of government schemes designed to simplify navigation and support.Despite this, 95% of women entrepreneurs remain unaware of the support mechanisms available to them. This gap reflects deeper design issues: only 7% of state-level schemes are exclusively for women, and just 7.6% of gender-neutral schemes include additional benefits for them. The disconnect between policy intent and ground reality reveals that simply having schemes isn't enough when they don't reach the women who need them most.The infrastructure exists, but the last-mile delivery mechanisms – awareness, accessibility, and design that accounts for women's constraints – remain underdeveloped. Building these mechanisms becomes essential for converting policy into impact.Transformation begins with hands-on training that introduces women to digital tools as business assets. Training must go beyond basic device usage to include UPI payments, digital recordkeeping, and online customer engagement. When delivered through one-on-one support in local languages, digital transaction adoption can grow from 30% to over 80%.This digital foundation unlocks financial access through innovative mechanisms that work around traditional collateral constraints. Joint Liability Groups formalize women's participation while building collective creditworthiness. The digital transaction histories they create prove repayment discipline, opening access to working capital through schemes like Mudra and Udyam. Alternative lending platforms like RangDe and MeraBill further expand options by recognizing digital transaction patterns as creditworthiness, addressing the collateral gap.Financial stability and digital confidence together enable market expansion. Onboarding onto platforms like ONDC and social commerce channels connects businesses to customers beyond local boundaries, while support in pricing strategies and digital marketing helps women compete effectively in these new spaces. This enables women to move into higher-value economic roles where their skills command better compensation.Peer mentorship networks multiply this impact organically, as successful entrepreneurs guide others and transition into community leadership roles. Women move from being producers to decision-makers, building leadership capacity that compounds across their networks and communities.The approach succeeds when systems are designed around women's existing realities rather than imposing structures that demand wholesale life reorganization.Women's entrepreneurship isn't a welfare issue but a strategic driver of national economic growth. When support systems work effectively at scale, women shift from borrowers to builders. This transformation creates compounding benefits. Women's control over business income changes not just their own economic trajectory but shapes how families invest in the next generation.The opportunity to activate this growth engine is immediate. What determines success is whether interventions reach women systematically, not sporadically, turning isolated successes into sustained transformation across communities.","India is home to 63 million MSMEs, with nearly 20% owned by women.

Apple cuts Vision Pro headset production and marketing by over 95%: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-cuts-vision-pro-headset-production-and-marketing-by-over-95-report/articleshow/126301382.cms,"Apple launched upgraded Vision Pro model last year





Apple has cut production of the Vision Pro headset, reports Financial Times. Launched in February 2024, the Apple Vision Pro has not been able to take off, the publication says. Apple continues to sell iPhones, iPads and Macs in millions each quarter, however, it is reportedly struggling with the sales of Vision Pro headsets, which cost $3,499. As per the report, the company has decided to reduce marketing for Vision Pro by more than 95% last year. It cites multiple reports – including production cuts in 2024 and International Data Corporation’s (IDC) estimate of holiday sales.While Apple has not released any official sales figures for the Vision Pro headset, IDC estimates it will have sold only 45,000 in the last quarter of last year. The market research firm says that Apple’s Chinese producer, Luxshare, had stopped production of the headset at the start of 2025, and Apple has not expanded direct sales beyond a select 13 countries.The report comes months after Apple launched an upgraded version of its Vision Pro in October 2025. The new headset comes equipped with the latest M5 chipset and runs VisionOS 26. Apple then claimed that the new M5 processor promises improved performance and even faster, smoother, and more responsive experience for Apple Vision Pro users, while introducing new opportunities for developers to create more advanced spatial and immersive experiences.Another key change introduced with the new Apple Vision Pro is the dual knit band which, the company claims, helps users achieve an even more comfortable fit.Price of Apple Vision Pro with the M5 chip and Dual Knit Band starts at $3,499. Apple Vision Pro is available in 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage capacities.With visionOS 26, Apple has introduced a set of powerful spatial experiences to Apple Vision Pro. Widgets seamlessly integrate into a user’s space, making it easy to check the time or weather, play music or podcasts, decorate their space with photos, or access ChatGPT. Further, users can play back 180-degree, 360-degree, and wide field-of-view video from popular action cameras.","Apple has cut production of the Vision Pro headset, reports Financial Times.

France President’s new year pledge to protect children from social media

Australia Enforces World’s First Under-16 Social Media Ban, Sparks Global Debate| Global Pulse





After Australia, France is planning to ban social media for children under 15 years of age. According to a report by Reuters, France also plans to prohibit mobile phones in high schools from September 2026. Quoting local media, the news agency said that the move comes amid rising public angst over the impact of online harms on minors. Notably, the country has already banned smartphones in French primary and middle schools since 2018 and now wants to extend the ban to high schools.According to the Reuters report, President Emmanuel Macron has often pointed to social media as one of the factors to blame for violence among young people. In a New Year's Eve address, he pledged to ""protect our children and teenagers from social media and screens"", though he did not reference the legislative push.The Macron government plans to submit a draft legislation for legal checks in early January, Le Monde and France Info reported, per Reuters report. The country had passed a law in 2023 requiring social platforms to obtain parental consent for under-15s to create accounts, though technical challenges have impeded its enforcement.In June 2025, Macron said that he will push for social media regulation for all under 15 at the level of the European Union. The remarks were made after a fatal stabbing at a school in eastern France shocked the nation. In November, the European Parliament asked the EU to set minimum ages for children to access social media to combat a rise in mental health problems among adolescents from excessive exposure.","France also plans to prohibit mobile phones in high schools from September 2026.

The Chinese government has urged the Netherlands that Dutch officials “correct their mistakes” regarding the takeover of chipmaker Nexperia, and help in restoring the global chip supply chain. In a statement released this week, the Chinese commerce ministry described the Dutch administrative interference as “inappropriate” and “perplexing”.“China once again urges the Netherlands not to act unilaterally, but to immediately correct its mistakes and clear the obstacles to restoring the stability and security of the global semiconductor supply chain,” the Chinese commerce ministry said in a statement, as per news agency Reuters.The statement comes months after the conflict started when in September, the Dutch government took control of Nexperia to prevent its founder from allegedly moving sensitive technology and production facilities to China. In response, Beijing froze exports of Nexperia chips, which are critical components for the global automotive and consumer electronics sectors.

The Dutch government had briefly suspended its intervention in November as a ""gesture of goodwill"" while negotiations continued.As a result of this standoff, a “packaging bottleneck” has been created that threatens the flow of components to major European car manufacturers.

How Amazon is 'breaking law' claims the rights group

Who is Francesca Albanese





Amazon has received a legal notice from a prominent Jewish civil rights group. Reason a forthcoming book listed on Amazon's website. According to a report in the New York Post, National Jewish Advocacy Center has warned Amazon that selling a forthcoming book by a US-sanctioned United Nations official could violate federal sanctions law. In a post on Twitter, Mark Goldfeder, head of the National Jewish Advocacy Center, said that his organization notified the retail giant that Francesca Albanese, an Italian human rights lawyer, is banned from receiving payments or other economic benefits in the US. “Today we issued notice to Amazon and others about potential sanctions-violations connected to @FranceskAlbs new book,” Goldfeder wrote on Twitter. The hardcover, scheduled for release in April, is currently reportedly listed as a bestseller in the human rights category on Amazon’s website.The US reportedly sanctioned Albanese in July, with officials alleging she improperly coordinated with the International Criminal Court and engaged in political and economic warfare against the US and Israel. Goldfeder rejected allegations of censorship, saying the issue is not the book’s content but whether US companies may legally conduct business with a sanctioned individual.In his legal notice to Amazon and other distributors, Goldfeder warned that the company’s platform “promotes and sells Ms. Francesca Albanese’s publications, directly enhancing her revenue and conferring a financial benefit,” which he said falls outside protections for informational materials and could expose the retailer to civil penalties under US sanctions law. “Under federal law, property and interests of Specially Designated Nationals are blocked and may not be transferred or paid out without specific authorization,” he wrote Monday.Francesca Albanese is the UN special rapporteur on the Palestinian territories who sparked a furore after accusing Israel of genocide, apartheid and settler colonialism in UN reports and public statements. Both Israel and the US have rejected his claims as false and antisemitic. She is also the author of “When the World Sleeps: Stories, Words, and Wounds of Palestine,” a collection of essays and personal reflections on Israeli policies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.Goldfeder argues that Albanese’s designation as a Specially Designated National means all of her property and interests in property are blocked, barring US companies from transferring funds or providing services to her without authorization from the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. He wrote, ""Francesca Albanese was designated as a Specially Designated National (SDN) by OFAC in July 2025. Property and interests in property of SDNs are blocked and may not be transferred, sold, or otherwise disposed of without specific OFAC authorization or license. The failure to obtain a license prior to transacting with an SDN is a violation of IEEPA, 50 U.S.C. § 1705(a). This framework applies broadly under federal jurisdiction irrespective of the geography of the SDNs, extending to various commercial activities subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Violations of these sanctions can lead to civil penalties, administrative enforcement, and potential criminal liability under statutes including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA). Pursuant to the foregoing, transactions involving Ms. Albanese are prohibited for U.S. persons absent an OFAC license.

What hackers said about attacking ESA systems





The European Space Agency (ESA) has confirmed a cyberattack on some of its systems after a hacker offered to sell data allegedly stolen from the organisation. The agency's forensic investigation has revealed that servers located outside the ESA corporate network have been compromised. According to ESA, only a very small number of external servers may have been impacted.The compromised servers support unclassified collaborative engineering activities within the scientific community, the agency stated in a post on microblogging site X (formerly Twitter). ESA is conducting a forensic investigation and working to secure the compromised devices. All relevant stakeholders have been informed. The agency said it will provide further updates as soon as additional information becomes available from the ongoing investigation.In the X post, ESA wrote:“ESA is aware of a recent cybersecurity issue involving servers located outside the ESA corporate network. We have initiated a forensic security analysis—currently in progress—and implemented measures to secure any potentially affected devices.Our analysis so far indicates that only a very small number of external servers may have been impacted.These servers support unclassified collaborative engineering activities within the scientific community.

This includes files from private online storage spaces where ESA keeps computer code.The hacker claimed they obtained source code (the instructions that make computer programs work), digital keys that grant access to systems, setup files, passwords and usernames, and secret documents.To prove their claims are real, the hacker even shared several screenshots showing some of the stolen information publicly online.","The European Space Agency has confirmed a cyberattack on some of its systems.

Billionaires are reportedly fleeing California to escape a crippling tax hike. The names include Google co-founder Larry Page; venture capitalist Peter Thiel; and David Sacks, a longtime venture capitalist and former member of the PayPal Mafia who now serves as President Donald Trump’s crypto czar. These billionaires are cutting ties with California because of a potential ballot measure that would tax 5% of their total wealth — which could reportedly run into billions of dollars. The controversial wealth tax, if passed, would affect anyone who was a California resident at the start of 2026.While Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist and former Facebook exec, claimed in a Twitter post that people's collective net worth of $500B left California for good on December 31, there are so far no official confirmations, except from David Sacks. In a Twitter post, Sacks confirmed his move to Texas. ""I’m pleased to end the year by announcing that Craft Ventures has opened an Austin office. God bless Texas and happy new year!,"" wrote Sacks.The White House AI czar has been publicly slamming the California Wealth Tax. ""After blindly funding the Left for years, Silicon Valley is finally realizing what time it is. Dinner time. And they’re on the menu,"" wrote Sacks in a social media post.""Why does California need a wealth tax? To fund the massive fraud. Red states like Texas and Florida don’t even have income taxes. Democrats steal everything, then blame job creators for their “greed,” Sack said in another post.Chamath Palihapitiya too has been publicly trashing the proposed Billionaire's tax. In a post that can be termed as warning to California government, he wrote, ""People I know, with a collective net worth of $500B, scrambled and left California for good yesterday. They took no risk because of the proposed asset seizure tax - introduced as a “Billionaire Tax”. Without these people, the California budget deficit will only get bigger. This hole gets filled in one of two ways: more borrowing from the bond market - who is purely financial and unforgiving or more taxes on everyone else. Meanwhile waste, fraud and abuse runs rampant from the hundreds of billions in revenues the state already collects,"" wrote Palihapitiya.Other billionaires who have blasted the tax include hedge funder Bill Ackman and Garry Tan, CEO of San Francisco-based startup accelerator Y Combinator.

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

What Raymond Chen said about Microsoft making customers talk to Bill Gates

A colleague of mine who used to work in product support told me that they had a procedure if a customer became irate and demanded to speak with Bill Gates. (This was, of course, back in the days when Bill Gates still ran the company.)

The product support technician would apologise for not resolving the problem to the customer’s satisfaction, but if the customer continued to demand to speak with The Boss, the technician would indeed transfer the customer.

The customer was transferred to a special internal phone number, and when the operators saw a call on that line, they took the call and said, “Bill Gates’s office.” They weren’t actually in Bill Gates’s office. They were just pretending to be Bill Gates’s secretary. Their job was to tell the caller that Mr. Gates is currently unavailable, but if the customer leaves a message and their contact information, they will pass the information to Mr.

Gates.

Of course, I assume¹ the information was never actually passed along to Bill. The information went back into the product support channel with a note that the customer was escalated to “Bill Gates’s office.” The technician who returned the call would probably say something like “Bill Gates asked me to contact you to follow up on an issue you had earlier.”

¹ Maybe Bill got a copy or a summary of these messages, I don’t know.”





Microsoft had a clever solution for irate customers demanding to speak with Bill Gates . The company used to transfer their calls to a special internal line where operators answered, ""Bill Gates's office,"" without actually connecting them to the CEO. In hisblog, veteran Microsoft engineer Raymond Chen shared the insider procedure that product support staff used to handle such situations while keeping customers satisfied.He said when a customer (typically a high-value one) became angry enough during a support call to demand speaking with Gates, staff followed a specific protocol. First, they apologised for not resolving the issue to the customer's satisfaction. If apologies failed and the customer continued demanding to speak withsupport staff transferred the call to a designated internal phone number. When operators saw an incoming call on that special line, they answered withIn his blog post, Chen wrote: """,Microsoft had a clever way to handle angry customers demanding to speak with Bill Gates.

16 executives reporting directly to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella





Microsoft turned fifty-year-old this year. In the year Microsoft turned 50, CEO Satya Nadella announced one of the biggest-ever leadership overhaul and some big hires. Microsoft hired former Meta engineering boss Jay Parikh. The company also and elevated senior executives, including commercial head Judson Althoff and Ryan Roslansky, chief executive of LinkedIn. In October 2025, Microsoft is promoting longtime sales executive Judson Althoff to CEO of its commercial business, a major reorganization that frees up CEO Nadella to focus exclusively on technical work as the company races to dominate Artificial Intelligence (AI) landscape. The restructuring puts Althoff in charge of what Nadella called Microsoft's ""most important growth engine"", as he now leads marketing, sales, support and operations, which includes setting priorities for its engineering teams to match customer needs.Althoff joined Microsoft in 2013 and has led the company's global sales team for nine-plus years. The move represents one of Microsoft's most significant leadership changes in years, with Chief Marketing Officer Takeshi Numoto and his team too now reporting directly to Althoff.Chief Operations Officer Carolina Dybeck Happe's team also joins the new organisation.Following recent changes, Satya Nadella reportedly now has 16 direct reports, broadly in line with previous years due to the consolidation of roles, including for sales and marketing. The reorganisation allows CEO Nadella and Microsoft's engineering leaders to concentrate on what he described as ""highest ambition technical work"" spanning datacenter construction, systems architecture, AI research and product innovation. ""We are in the midst of a tectonic AI platform shift, one that requires us to both manage and grow our at-scale commercial business today, while building the new frontier,"" Nadella wrote in an email to employees announcing the leadership shakeout.LinkedIn chief Roslansky has an expanded remit, including the company’s Office software suite.

Samsung and other Korean companies get US approval to bring chip-making tools into China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/samsung-and-other-korean-companies-get-us-approval-to-bring-chip-making-tools-into-china/articleshow/126289304.cms,"America has granted Samsung and SK Hynix yearly permits to send chipmaking tools to their Chinese plants until 2026. This replaces an older system with stricter annual reviews. These licenses allow factories to operate and maintain equipment. However, they do not permit expansion or upgrades to the newest technology. The US aims to limit China's access to advanced chip-making tools.





The US government has approved annual export licences to allow Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix to ship chipmaking equipment to their China facilities throughout 2026. A Reuters report, citing people familiar with the decision, said the approvals came just before a long-standing waiver system expired, marking a shift to a more restrictive licensing framework for foreign-owned fabs in China.Under the new system, the US has formally moved to annual approvals for chipmaking tool exports into China, replacing the validated end-user status that Samsung, SK Hynix and TSMC previously enjoyed. The yearly licences must be renewed each calendar year, the Reuters report claimed.What is this waiver system between the US and ChinaThe expired waiver system validated end-user status and allowed qualifying factories in China to receive US-controlled semiconductor tools without seeking individual export licences for each shipment. Now, all shipments of US-origin manufacturing equipment require explicit authorisation from Washington to enter China.US officials had increasingly viewed the previous waiver system as overly permissive, according to one source cited by Reuters, prompting the transition to stricter annual oversight.These approvals are significant for Samsung and SK Hynix because they make most of their memory chips in China.Samsung has a big factory in Xi'an that makes NAND flash memory, while SK Hynix has two major factories, one in Wuxi making DRAM chips and another in Dalian making NAND chips.Together, these factories produce a considerable amount of the world's memory chips. With memory chip prices going up due to high demand from AI data centres, keeping these factories running smoothly has become even more critical.The new annual licences let these companies keep their factories running and maintain their equipment, but do not allow them to expand or upgrade to the latest technology. US officials have made clear they want to stop China from getting advanced chip-making tools. Even before this change, the most advanced equipment (like EUV machines) was already banned.Switching to yearly approvals creates uncertainty for chipmakers. Each year, the US can change the rules or even deny approval completely, depending on political tensions and security concerns. Experts believe this stricter system will hurt sales for American equipment makers such as Applied Materials, Lam Research, and KLA, which sell machines these memory factories need.For 2026, Samsung and SK Hynix can keep bringing essential equipment into their China factories. But going forward, the US will watch these shipments much more closely, reviewing them every single year.","Samsung and SK Hynix granted yearly permits to send chipmaking tools to their Chinese plants until 2026.

Big Tech's $70 Billion AI Move: Silicon Valley Bets On India, Snubs Trump's 'America First' Diktat

How Kioxia became the most growing company in 2025





Nvidia dominated a majority of headlines in 2025 in the tech industry with other Silicon Valley giants like Google, Microsoft and OpenAI witnessed boom in their fortunes. However, the company that grew the most in 2025 is not based in the US but Tokyo, Japan. The crown for the world’s best-performing stock of 2025 went to Kioxia Holdings that was either dismissed by investors or ‘barely noticed’.According to a report by Bloomberg, Kioxia’s shares skyrocketed a staggering 540% in 2025, outperforming every other company in the MSCI World Index. The company launched its IPO in December 2024 and witnessed its market value balloon to approximately 5.7 trillion yen ($36 billion). The company now has customers like Apple and Microsoft.Meanwhile, companies, including Google-parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Apple – al performed well, riding the AI boom in 2025.Kioxia’s rise is fueled by a global appetite for AI data storage. There was a critical shift in the AI arms race as tech giants’ hunt for “compute” (GPUs) quickly shifted to “memory” as they realised that large-scale AI models require massive amounts of NAND flash memory to store the enormous datasets they process.As the tech giants rushed to build more data centres, the demand for memery chips exploded, providing a chance to companies like Kioxia to take advantage of the unmet demand.Citing market trackers, the report says that the global demand for memory exceeds supply by roughly 10% and this deficit has triggered a pricing surge. Not only data centres, the shortage has also affected the prices of smartphones, PCs and gaming consoles.Notably, Kioxia’s stock rise was not smooth as the company tumbled more than 20% in a single session in November after quarterly results failed to meet lofty expectations.","Kioxia Holdings of Tokyo emerged as the world's best-performing stock in 2025.

"Google-parent Alphabet may soon join Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia in $4 Trillion exclusive club",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-parent-alphabet-may-soon-join-apple-microsoft-and-nvidia-in-4-trillion-exclusive-club/articleshow/125546823.cms,"AI reversal and antitrust ruling







Google-parent company Alphabet may soon become a $4 trillion company – only the fourth corporation in history to reach this market capitalisation. The tech giant is riding a rally fueled by artificial intelligence (AI), boosted by an antitrust ruling delivered by a judge, saying the company doesn't need to divest its Chrome browser business. According to a report by news agency Reuters, shares of Alphabet surged more than 5% on Monday (November 24), giving the company a market capitalisation of $3.82 trillion.Notably, the company’s stock has climbed nearly 70% so far this year, significantly outpacing AI rivals like Microsoft and Amazon.com. The exclusive “$4 Trillion Club” has previously included Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple, though only Nvidia and Apple currently maintain that valuation. At the time of writing, Alphabet ($3.62 trillion) even has more market capitalisation than Microsoft ($3.51 trillion).The surge reflects a massive reversal in investor sentiment. After the launch of ChatGPT in 2023, many investors feared Alphabet had lost its AI edge, despite inventing much of the underlying generative AI technology. Alphabet has regained momentum by transforming its cloud business into a key growth driver and receiving strong early reviews for its powerful new Gemini 3 model.The company's recent success also attracted investment from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.Furthermore, Google shares have rallied as Big Tech largely emerged unscathed from the bipartisan antitrust push initiated during US President Donald Trump’s first term. The company notably sidestepped a court-ordered breakup after its search business was found to be an illegal monopoly. Notably, Alphabet crossed the $3 trillion mark in September. Analysts further believe that Google is well-positioned in the AI race due to its “full stack” advantage.","Google-parent company Alphabet may soon become a $4 trillion company – only the fourth corporation in history to reach this market capitalisation.

The Delhi High Court has granted temporary relief to Elon Musk ’s Tesla in a trademark infringement case. The court ordered that a prior commitment made by the domestic company Tesla Power India will remain in effect until the lawsuit is officially resolved. Previously, Tesla Power India’s CEO had given an undertaking that the company would not manufacture or market electric vehicles (EVs). The company also committed not to use the wordor any branding that is confusingly similar to the name of the US-based electric vehicle maker. Delhi HC’s Justice Tejas Karia passed the order, ensuring this commitment continues until the final judgment in the case titled Tesla Inc v. Tesla Power India.According to a report by Bar & Bench, Tesla moved the Delhi HC in May 2024 after Tesla Power India announced its intention to enter the electric vehicle market under the Tesla trademark. The court was informed that Tesla Power India had published newspaper advertisements about this move.Musk's Tesla said it had issued cease-and-desist notices to Tesla Power India and Tesla Power USA back in April 2022. Still, the defendant company continued to advertise and market products under the Tesla trademark.During the first hearing, the owner of Tesla Power India appeared before the Court and gave an undertaking stating they had no plans to manufacture electric vehicles and would not market other companies' electric cars under the trademark or trade name 'TESLA POWER USA' or any other brand similar toHowever, in later hearings, Tesla claimed that Tesla Power had begun manufacturing e-scooters under the Tesla brand.Last year, the court ordered:The case was then referred for mediation.

The launch will mark a key event for the carmaker led by Musk, which has not only entered the Indian electric vehicle market but is also testing consumer interest in premium electric vehicles amidst growing climate awareness and urban demand.A showroom, designed to reflect Tesla's brand image, opened earlier this year after years of negotiations, policy discussions and speculation about the company's entry into one of the world's larger automobile markets.

Mayhem at Amazon Amid 30,000 Job Cuts: AI - Easy Corporate Excuse? | Global Pulse

What Amazon cloud has to say









Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world’s leading cloud provider, struggled with “critical capacity constraints” for its flagship AI service, Bedrock, earlier this year which led to the company losing revenue and prompting some high-value customers to shift projects to rivals such as Google Cloud. Citing an internal July document, Business Insider reported the extent of the capacity crunch that it was “threatening customer adoption and potentially causing substantial revenue loss across multiple industries.”The report said that the capacity constraints led to tens of millions of dollars in lost or delayed revenue for AWS. Epic Games reportedly shifted a $10 million Fortnite project to Google Cloud after AWS failed to provide adequate quota for Bedrock. Similarly, Oil trader Vitol risked a $3.5 million revenue hit due to “prolonged quota approvals.”Other large customers, including Atlassian and GovTech Singapore, had at least $52.6 million in projected sales delayed due to waiting on quota increases. Three current and former employees confirmed to the publication that the capacity issue remained a top concern for AWS through September.An Amazon spokesperson confirmed Bedrock is “experiencing rapid growth” and noted that the internal self-criticism is a “feature of our culture, not a flaw.”“At Amazon, we're vocally self-critical because that's how we drive continuous improvement and deliver better results for customers,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.“This internal candor is a feature of our culture, not a flaw. We're grateful for all customer feedback—including challenges they encounter—because it helps us make Bedrock even better, and that's exactly how you build a scalable, sustainable business that serves customers well over the long term,” the spokesperson added.It is to be noted earlier in this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has repeatedly stressed the intense focus on accelerating cloud infrastructure. For example, during an October earnings call, Jassy confirmed AWS added over 3.8 gigawatts of power over the past year and plans to double its current power capacity again by 2027.He added that the company will remain “very aggressive” in scaling up to meet booming AI demand, believing Bedrock has the potential to grow as large as the highly successful EC2 service.","Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world’s leading cloud provider, struggled with “critical capacity constraints” for its flagship AI service, Bedrock, earlier this year.

How the Foxconn partnership can help OpenAI





“Foxconn is uniquely positioned to support OpenAI’s mission with trusted, scalable infrastructure,”





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US. This partnership is the AI startup's newest step in its extensive infrastructure development plans. The companies stated the goal is to accelerate infrastructure deployment and secure long-term US capacity for essential AI components. While financial terms were not disclosed, OpenAI confirmed it will have early access to evaluate the systems produced by the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and Apple ’s largest supplier, along with the option to purchase them.In a statement to CNBC, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the partnership, saying:adding that AI infrastructure presents aUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities, which are located in Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Indiana.Foxconn adds another manufacturing layer to OpenAI’s supply chain, which could help make production for the AI startup more local and speed up deployment.The company is widely known for assembling Apple’s iPhones, but it has also expanded into AI and automotive manufacturing. It builds server racks designed for AI workloads and is an important global supplier to Nvidia, a major producer of high-end AI chips.Chairman Young Liu said to CNBC.However, the company has had mixed results in the US. In 2018, Foxconn began construction of a large factory in Wisconsin intended to make flat-panel displays. The project did not succeed, and the site is now being used for an AI data centre under construction by Microsoft.OpenAI has recently made several major agreements with some of the world’s biggest technology companies, announcing spending plans of about $1.4 trillion.These commitments have raised questions about whether the company will eventually generate enough profit to support that level of investment.Earlier this month, Altman said the company expects to reach $20 billion in annualised revenue by the end of the year and aims to reach hundreds of billions by 2030.Previous deals include a $100 billion agreement (yet to be finalised) with Nvidia, under which the chipmaker would invest in OpenAI in phases as the company expands its infrastructure.OpenAI also has cloud partnerships with Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, as well as significant compute buildout commitments with Oracle.","OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities.

John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang makes another prediction on how AI will change future jobs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-makes-another-prediction-on-how-ai-will-change-future-jobs/articleshow/125542611.cms,"File photo: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang (Picture credit: AP)

“If your life becomes more productive and if the things that you’re doing with great difficulty become simpler, it is very likely because you have so many ideas you’ll have more time to pursue things.”

""Everybody’s jobs will be different,”

""I would say that there’s every evidence that we will be more productive and yet still be busier because we have so many ideas. It is my guess that Elon will be busier as a result of AI. I’m going to be busier as a result of AI,”

“The prediction that all radiologists would be the first jobs to go was exactly the opposite.”

AI-Powered Future: Next Gen Careers You Should Watch

What Tesla CEO Elon Musk said about AI’s impact on future jobs at the event





“If you want to work, you know, in the same way, you can go to the store and just buy some vegetables or you could grow vegetables in your backyard.”





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said AI's boost to productivity would simply make workers busier, and their companies wouldn't give them more paid time off. According to him, while AI can automate many mundane tasks, the efficiency it affords will not decrease the amount of work; instead, it will free people to pursue a wave of new ideas and unfinished projects. At the recent US-Saudi Investment Forum, sitting alongside Tesla CEO Elon Musk , Huang said:The chief executive of the US-based chipmaking giant also argued that productivity gains will not erase work but it will create more of it. He predicted:a Fortune report noted.Huang added.As an example, Huang cited the field of radiology. He noted:When AI improved image analysis efficiency, it gave workers more time to read additional scans, manage more images, and spend time with patients.This shift led to job growth, countering earlier predictions.While discussing the implications of AI on future jobs, Musk predicted that work could become optional in the near future, as jobs will be seen more like sports or video games. He said:During its recent earnings call, Nvidia, which is a major player in the AI surge, reported strong revenue growth. However, as younger workers grow concerned that AI may replace the early-career roles they rely on, Huang's comments offer a view of how work may evolve. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI could replace 92 million jobs while creating around 170 million new ones.Despite Huang's optimism, the job market is proving challenging to enter for many graduates, as AI is reducing the need for many entry-level positions. Many are turning to advanced degrees, such as MBAs and law programs, as a form of protection.It is not the first time Huang has talked about AI and its impact on productivity. Earlier, he assured people that they should not be scared of losing their jobs to AI, but rather focus on the risk of losing their jobs to those who know how to use AI more effectively.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said AI's boost to productivity would simply make workers busier, and their companies wouldn't give them more paid time off.

Meta denies claims, says it ‘aggressively fights fraud’







US Senators Josh Hawley and Richard Blumenthal have written a letter to the heads of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), demanding an immediate investigation into scam ads on Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram, a report has said. News agency Reuters recently reported that the social media giant allegedly earns billions in revenue from running ads on these platforms that promote scams and illicit activities.In a joint letter to the federal agencies, the bipartisan pair stated, “The FTC and SEC should immediately open investigations and, if the reporting is accurate, pursue vigorous enforcement action where appropriate” to compel Meta to disgorge profits, pay penalties, and agree to cease running such advertisements.Citing internal Meta documents from late 2024, which indicated that the company earned approximately 10% of its revenue (around $16 billion) from illicit advertising that year, the senators expressed skepticism regarding Meta’s efforts to combat the issue. One document reportedly noted Meta earns $3.5 billion from “higher risk” scam ads every six months.Both of them pointed to the company’s Ad Library which, they claim, still shows “clearly identifiable advertisements for illicit gambling, payment scams, crypto scams, AI deepfake sex services, and fake offers of federal benefits.”The senators further alleged that Meta’s actions suggest a conscious choice to accept fraudulent ads, noting that the company has “drastically cut its safety staff... even as it dumps unimaginable sums into its generative AI projects.”In response, Meta spokesman Andy Stone asserted that the senators' letter “makes claims that are exaggerated and wrong.”“We aggressively fight fraud and scams because people on our platforms don’t want this content, legitimate advertisers don’t want it and we don’t want it either,” Stone said, noting that Meta had reduced user reports of scams by 58% over the last eighteen months.","US Senators Josh Hawley and Richard Blumenthal have written a letter to the heads of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) They are demanding an immediate investigation into scam ads on Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram.

What Microsoft Windows head Pavan Davuluri said in reply to Windows user feedback



“Can’t see any reason for sw [software] engineers to choose Windows with this weird direction they are doubling down on. So odd because Microsoft has building dev tools in their DNA… their OS doesn’t look like anything a builder who wants OS control could choose. Mac or Linux it is for devs.”

“Hey Gergely, I am responding here, and I think this applies to a bunch of the comments that people have made. I mean, a lot of comments 🙂. The team (and I) take in a ton of feedback. We balance what we see in our product feedback systems with what we hear directly. They don’t always match, but both are important. I've read through the comments and see focus on things like reliability, performance, ease of use and more.

But I want to spend a moment just on the point you are making, and I’ll boil it down, we care deeply about developers. We know we have work to do on the experience, both on the everyday usability, from inconsistent dialogs to power user experiences. When we meet as a team, we discuss these paint points and others in detail, because we want developers to choose Windows. We know words aren’t enough, it’s on us to continue improving and shipping. Would love to connect with you about what the team is doing to address these areas if you are open to it.”





Microsoft's Windows chief, Pavan Davaluri, has addressed customer criticism towards the latest Windows 11 update. The backlash came after he said Windows would transform into an ""agentic OS. ”. He used this phrase to describe the latest version of Windows, which is heavily focused on AI tools. Many customers told him that Windows still has too many unfinished features and basic issues that should be fixed first. The complaints grew so much that Davaluri was forced to turn off replies to his original post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter).Finally, Davaluri responded to specific concerns about Windows no longer being developer- or power-user-friendly and that the company is actually taking away user control. Replying to these concerns, Davaluri confirmed that the Windows team knows about all the feedback and said: “We know words aren’t enough, it’s on us to continue improving and shipping.” He also added that the team realises there are many things to be fixed in the operating system regarding user experience, including inconsistent dialogue boxes, and overall power user experience.Davaluri’s response came to a X post by a user named Gergely Orosz. Commenting on the Microsoft execuitve’s original post announcing Windows transformation to “agentic OS”, Orosz wrote:Replying to this, Davaluri wrote:","Microsoft's Windows chief Pavan Davaluri has responded to customer criticism.

AI Coding tools create new security challenges for enterprises





Thomas Dohmke, who stepped down as GitHub CEO in August, has landed his next role at Apiiro, a startup focused on securing AI-generated code and protecting enterprise software systems from emerging cybersecurity threats, just months after leaving his position as GitHub CEO. The startup helps organisations monitor and secure AI-generated software code and codebases.Dohmke will focus on helping Apiiro develop new protections for AI-generated software code, addressing growing concerns that AI coding tools could make enterprise systems more vulnerable to cyberattacks.Dohmke explained that developers now often use multiple AI coding agents, and these tools don't necessarily know all the policies, rules, and safeguards that their employers have set up to ensure their codebases and broader technology offerings are secure.Apiiro's technology connects with companies' code-management systems, providing this crucial context for AI code generation. The platform can spot and automatically fix issues in code, helping developers comply with company guidelines without creating additional work.Apiiro has raised more than $100 million from investors, including General Catalyst, Greylock, and Kleiner Perkins. CEO Idan Plotnik has previously launched and sold other startups and served as a cybersecurity executive at Microsoft.Dohmke said he met Plotnik about three years ago and was impressed by the CEO's energy and Apiiro's mission. While he receives equity for his advisory role, Dohmke indicated he's more interested in what Apiiro is building than compensation.In August, Dohmke announced his departure from GitHub to pursue entrepreneurial ventures after over a decade at Microsoft.

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained





Microsoft has acknowledged persistent performance problems with File Explorer in Windows 11 and announced plans to preload the application in the background to reduce launch delays. The company is testing the feature in Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26220.7271, available in Dev and Beta channels, with a full rollout expected in early 2026.The performance fix addresses widespread complaints from users who experience delays of over a second when opening File Explorer, often seeing a blank window with ""Working on it..."" before the interface loads. Unlike Windows 10, where File Explorer launched almost instantly, Windows 11 users have reported consistent slowdowns regardless of hardware specifications.While the Windows shell (explorer.exe) already runs continuously to power the taskbar and desktop, File Explorer itself doesn't remain open in the background. Microsoft's new approach will keep File Explorer preloaded in memory, allowing the interface to appear immediately when users click to open it.The feature will be enabled by default but can be disabled through Folder Options under the View tab by unchecking ""Enable window preloading for faster launch times.""Microsoft emphasized the change should be invisible to users except for improved performance, with minimal impact on RAM usage based on initial testing.Alongside the performance improvements, Microsoft is redesigning File Explorer's context menu to reduce clutter. A new ""Manage file"" flyout consolidates options like ""Compress to ZIP file"" and ""Copy as path,"" while cloud-specific commands have been grouped into individual provider flyouts. The ""Open folder location"" option has been repositioned next to ""Open"" for more intuitive access.Microsoft is seeking user feedback through the Feedback Hub under ""Files, Folders and Online Storage"" as it refines both the preloading feature and interface changes before the wider release.","Microsoft is testing the feature in Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26220.7271, available in Dev and Beta channels.

TRAI advice on how to combat spam



Download the TRAI DND App from official app stores.

Report spam SMS/calls using the app instead of local blocking, which enables permanent disconnection of offenders.

Never share personal or banking details via calls, messages, or social media.

Immediately disconnect threatening or suspicious calls.

Report cyber frauds to the National Cybercrime Helpline (1930) or the official government portal.

Use the Sanchar Saathi's ""Chakshu"" feature to report attempted fraud involving the misuse of telecom resources.





The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has issued a public advisory in the fight against fraud and spam class. The regulator says that it has disconnected and blacklisted more than 21 lakh mobile numbers and approximately one lakh entities involved in sending spam and fraudulent messages in the last one year. It also urged mobile phone users to not just block fraud callers but report spam calls and SMS through the official TRAI DND App. It emphasised that simply blocking numbers locally on a device is not sufficient to stop fraudulent activity at its source.According to the advisory, this large-scale enforcement was only possible because citizens used the official TRAI DND App. When a report is filed through the app, TRAI and telecom providers can trace, verify and permanently disconnect the offending number.However, when users just block the number on their personal phones, it merely hides the spammer, allowing them to continue targeting others.TRAI has issued the following directives to users, particularly senior citizens, women and digitally less-experienced users:",The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has issued a public advisory in the fight against fraud and spam.

Harms’ current role



Harms was the director of corporate strategy in 2010.

Now he is working as the corporate vice president under Cloud + AI chief Scott Guthrie and he will continue reporting to him

In the memo shared Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that Harms’ “new scope will extend beyond AI Infra”. He will help Microsoft in understanding how existing categories will be transformed and new ones created.





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has tapped longtime strategist Rolf Harms to help the tech giant rethink its business model for the era of artificial intelligence, taking lessons from Microsoft’s cloud transformation 15 years ago. As reported by Business Insider, in a memo to top executives issued earlier this month, Nadella said that Microsoft must ‘rapidly rethink the new economics of AI across the company — just as we once did with the cloud.’Harms who co-authored the influential 2010 white paper Economics of the Cloud, which forced a cultural reckoning inside Microsoft and helped justify massive investments in cloud infrastructure. The paper highlighted how customers would eventually be able to save money by adopting large-scale could services despite early concerns about security and reliability. At the time, some employees complained Harms was “throwing bombshells into their org. ” Nadella recalled Harms’ response, “They’re already there, I’m just helping you find them.”Nadella mentioned that the same kind of disruptive mindset is needed today as Microsoft is now facing the mounting questions about whether the aggressive AI infrastructure spending will actually pay off. Earlier this year, Microsoft slowed down its AI investments, but it doubled down with the major new deals with Anthropic and OpenAI.The expanded role of Harm will also include advising Nadella and other senior leadership on how to adapt Microsoft’s economics for AI ranging from infrastructure to platform technology and applications.Microsoft’s cloud reboot was once seen as risky but ultimately reshaped the company’s fortunes. Nadella believes AI requires a similar overhaul, with Harms again playing a pivotal role in guiding the economics of a platform shift that could define the next decade.",Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has tapped longtime strategist Rolf Harms to help the tech giant rethink its business model for the era of artificial intelligence.

Why OpenAI engineer exodus is ‘bad news’ for Apple







ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is said to be poaching talent from Apple ’s hardware engineering team for the hardware initiative tied to its recent $6 billion acquisition of Jony Ive's secretive AI startup, io. The talent drain has accelerated since CEO Sam Altman and design icon Jony Ive announced in May that they were collaborating on a family of hardware products expected to debut next year, as per a report by Bloomberg Mark Gurman.Gurman claims that while Ive’s post-Apple design studio, LoveFrom, has long hired talent from the iPhone-maker, the focus has now shifted to Apple’s core hardware engineering teams. Citing sources, Gurman says that in just the past month, OpenAI’s devices group has hired more than 40 people, with many coming directly from Ive’s previous employer.The exodus from Apple includes highly senior designations, such as key directors, as well as managers and engineers. The poached talent spans nearly every relevant Apple department, including:“As Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told us in May, the AI company is working on a family of hardware products that could debut next year. It’s already public that former Apple industrial design head Evans Hankey and former hardware engineering executive Tang Tan are part of the initiative,” Gurman said in his weekly newsletter.The scale of the hiring is notable because it strips talent from an Apple hardware engineering team which is led by John Ternus. Apple is actively pursuing its own AI-driven hardware revival, which includes smart home devices, robotics and AI-enhanced accessories like camera-equipped AirPods. The current situation is described as a “problem” within Apple, as OpenAI continues to pick up critical expertise for its new hardware ventures.Not only OpenAI, Facebook-parent Meta has also poached one of the distinguished AI engineers, Ruoming Pang, with a hefty pay package exceeding $200 million. Pang joined Meta’s “superintelligence team” which is led by Alexandr Wang, Chief AI officer of Meta. Pang led Apple’s AI models team.","OpenAI is said to be poaching talent from Apple ’s hardware engineering team.

Malaysian social media ban details





Malaysia has now announced that it is planning to ban the use of social media for children under the age of 16 years starting next year. As reported by Reuters, the Malaysian government is working on to soon join the list of countries that are either tightening rules or are imposing a ban on the use of social media by children. Fahmi Fadzil, the communication minister of Malaysia said that the government is framing a legislation which will make it illegal for the children below 16 years of age to make or maintain a social media account on platforms like Facebook, TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat.Along with this, Fadzil also added that the Malaysian government is taking this step in order to protect young children from online threats such as exploitation, cyberbullying and exposure to inappropriate content.The plan of the Malaysian government to impose a ban on social media comes amid the growing wave of international scrutiny over the impact of social media on children. Recently, the Australian government also announced that it will enforce a social media ban for teen starting December 2025. On the other hand, the lawmakers in the United States and Europe are debating over stricter age-verification files and better parental consent requirements.As reported by Reuters, the Malaysian government said that the ban on social media will be backed by new regulatory powers. The ban will require the social media platforms to implement better age-verification systems. Also, the parents and guardians may also face penalties if they allow underage children to bypass rules and maintain a social media account.Fadzil further added that the government is also working with the tech companies, child welfare groups and educators in order to finalise the framework for the ban before its roll out in 2026.","Malaysia has now announced that it is planning to ban the use of social media for children under the age of 16 years starting next year.

Beyond amnesiac savants: The race to build personalised AI assistants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/beyond-amnesiac-savants-the-race-to-build-personalised-ai-assistants/articleshow/125533936.cms,"By: Sheetal Bahl is a Founding Partner at Merak Ventures, an early stage B2B VC fund backing bold founders in AI, DeepTech, and other emerging technologies that might finally give us assistants worth talking to.





It starts small. A slight catch in your voice, a word you stumble over, a quickening of your breath. On their own, these are easy to miss. But together, they could be the precursor to something worse: the spiral of an anxiety attack. (It could also be love at first sight, but no assistant will ever be able to help you with that.)Now imagine an assistant that catches those signals before you do. It hears the strain in your tone, registers the shift in your heart rate from your wearable, recalls that sleepless night, and remembers what happened the last time this strange brew came together. Quietly, it nudges you: take a break, breathe, step outside. And the episode never comes.That is what a PAIA - Personalized AI Assistant - could do. It perceives across modalities, remembers context, reasons over time, and intervenes at the right moment. If this sounds like the stuff of science fiction - Samantha in Her whispering in your ear - it’s because we are inching toward that reality. We’re not there yet, but we’re closer than we ever have been.Today’s assistants are genuinely useful - sometimes indispensable.ChatGPT is by turns a researcher, a friend, and a therapist. Copilots help engineers code faster, note-takers tidy up meetings, wearables nudge us toward healthier habits. These are not gimmicks; they’ve already reshaped how we work and live.And yet, they remain amnesiac savants - brilliant in the moment, but starting from scratch each time. They don’t carry context across conversations, or connect the dots between your calendar, biometrics, and tone of voice. They’re powerful, but fragmented.PAIAs are the next step on this inevitability curve. But to get there, we need breakthroughs - in particular, in what can be called multi-modal, longitudinal reasoning.Multi-modal means taking in different types of input - voice, text, images, biometrics, sensor data - and processing them together, not in silos. Today’s models can juggle formats, but mostly in sequence or in a lightweight fused way. They don’t yet weigh tone, expression, heart rate, and context at the same time to infer what’s happening.Longitudinal means across time. Memory that doesn’t vanish with each session. Pattern recognition that spots the early signs of burnout before every product launch or remembers which client objection has surfaced three times in the past six months. Humans excel at this kind of temporal reasoning; AI is still clumsy.Put them together, they form the gold standard: a system that perceives widely and reasons deeply, across modalities and across time. That’s what would make a PAIA feel less like a tool, and more like a second brain.You might assume that it is a foregone conclusion that the breakthroughs will come from Big Tech - they have the models, the devices, the data, the money. But power and incumbency don’t guarantee leadership in a new paradigm. Microsoft owned PCs but missed mobile. Google owned search but stumbled in social. Facebook dominated social but failed in messaging.In the PAIA arena, there is room for startups to play - in at least three ways. First, the giants build broad solutions; they rarely solve wedge use cases, say, to help sales leaders never forget client promises, or aid therapists to track long-term patient patterns. Second, technical hacks can trump brute force: persistent memory doesn’t mean storing every byte, it means remembering what matters, which is cheaper and more human-like. Third, startups can complement instead of colliding - building assistants that are device- and model-agnostic, surviving in the shadows of giants while carving their own value.Privacy presents perhaps the biggest opportunity to flip the script. ""What about my data?"" has become the defining question of the category. Big Tech often makes the user the product. Startups can build assistants where privacy becomes the moat, rather than a marketing line. On-device processing, zero-knowledge encryption, federated learning: the architecture can itself become the trust signal.The window of opportunity is narrow - perhaps 12-18 months. And this moment isn’t just for Silicon Valley. Indian startups, with their bias for clever hacks and frugal building, can become real contenders if they play this smartly. The technology has matured enough for everybody to have access to the building blocks, and winning, differentiated plays can still be created before the gates lock.It is rare for Indian tech to have a real shot at building globally relevant businesses during an epochal technology shift. PAIAs offer that chance. Tough, yes. Plausible, definitely. And that is reason enough to chase it.Tony Stark was never really a superhero. Strip away the flying suit and you had a billionaire with terrible impulse control, a flair for sarcasm, and a genius that was as much a liability as an asset. What kept him alive - literally and figuratively - wasn’t just JARVIS, the all-seeing AI in his ear, but Pepper Potts, the all-feeling human who remembered what mattered. JARVIS calculated trajectories; Pepper remembered birthdays. One ran diagnostics; the other soothed egos. Together, they were Stark’s real superpower: an external brain that fused machine precision with human intuition.As for me, I don’t want superpowers - my ambitions are smaller. Just remembering to ask my partner how her doctor’s appointment went would feel like victory.","Sheetal Bahl is a Founding Partner at Merak Ventures, an early stage B2B VC fund backing bold founders in AI, DeepTech, and other emerging technologies that might finally give us assistants worth talking to.

Apple Intelligence remain a key exception to iOS 27’s no-frills approach





Apple has begun work on the next major software releases for the coming year, with iOS 27 reportedly focusing on quality improvements and Apple Intelligence enhancements rather than introducing flashy new features, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.In his Power On newsletter published Sunday, Gurman revealed that Apple is taking a page from its 2009 Mac OS X Snow Leopard playbook—prioritising refinement over revolution. The company's engineering teams are systematically reviewing iOS to eliminate bloat, squash bugs, and boost overall performance following the Liquid Glass design overhaul introduced in iOS 26.Apple engineers are combing through the operating system, hunting for unnecessary code to remove and opportunities to improve quality and performance, Gurman writes. This approach mirrors Snow Leopard's focus on stability after the feature-heavy Leopard release, and comes as users have reported various iOS 26 issues including device overheating, battery drain, keyboard failures, and connectivity problems.The quality-first strategy will also lay groundwork for future hardware innovations, including foldable iPhones and other new devices, according to the Bloomberg report.While iOS 27 emphasises polish, artificial intelligence remains a major priority as Apple works to close the gap with competitors. Planned AI features for next year's release include a health-focused agent tied to a potential Apple Health+ subscription and expanded AI-powered web search capabilities, according to Gurman's newsletter.The update follows the delayed arrival of a redesigned Siri, expected in iOS 26.4 this spring, which will reportedly leverage Google's Gemini technology through a custom implementation for Apple's private cloud computing platform.Apple has also been internally testing a chatbot application called Veritas, though the company currently has no plans to release it as a standalone product, Gurman notes in his newsletter.","Apple has begun work on the next major software releases for the coming year, with iOS 27 reportedly focusing on quality improvements and Apple Intelligence enhancements.

As per the Reuters report, starting this week, the Snapchat users in Australia will be prompted to verify their age with the help of ConnectID, a system which is owned by the banks in the country. The ConnectID links a user’s bank account and returns only a yes or no confirmation of age eligibility without sharing the company identity data. Users will also have the option to opt for an alternative verification method.

A coalition of major US technology companies -- including Apple, Amazon, Cisco, Meta, HP, and Intel -- have formally opposed demands by Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea regarding the allocation of the 6 GHz spectrum band. While the Indian telecom operators are pushing for the spectrum to be auctioned for mobile services (IMT), the tech giants are advocating for the entire band to be delicensed for Wi-Fi use. In a joint submission to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) regarding the upcoming spectrum auction, the US tech majors argued that the ecosystem for mobile services in the 6 GHz band is not yet technically or commercially ready. Currently, the Indian government has identified that 400 MHz of frequencies in the 6 GHz band are available for auction, with another 300 MHz expected by 2030. The lower 6 GHz band (5925-6425 MHz) has already been decided for delicensing to support low-power applications like Wi-Fi.The coalition of American technology companies has urged the government to delay any auction timelines for the 6425-6725 MHz and 7025-7125 MHz ranges.In a joint response to telecom regulator Trai's consultation paper for the next round of spectrum auction, the US technology giants have said the technical and commercial readiness in the 6 GHz band is not established for mobile services.""We do not recommend setting timelines for any future auction of the 6425-6725 MHz and 7025-7125 MHz ranges for IMT. TRAI, together with the Department of Telecommunications, should review the allocation of the upper 6 GHz band following the outcomes of WRC-27, including Agenda Item 1.7 concerning 7.125-8.4 GHz,"" the joint submission said. The tech giants said any upper 6 GHz spectrum that would otherwise remain unused should be made available for unlicensed use in the interim. They further suggested that any upper 6 GHz spectrum left unused should be opened for unlicensed use—effectively Wi-Fi—in the interim.The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), representing Reliance Jio, Airtel , and Vodafone Idea, has strongly opposed delicensing. They argue that handing the spectrum over to Wi-Fi would result in a loss of exchequer revenue and provide an unfair advantage to foreign OTT players. It said that delicensing even a part of the 6 GHz band will be an irreversible action, permanently foreclosing its use for licensed mobile broadband services and severely limiting India's long-term digital capacity and provision of affordable services.""Moreover, unlicensed Wi-Fi deployments by global OTT players and device manufacturers could preclude licensed usage in the band, reduce exchequer revenues and give disproportionate advantage to foreign OTT players, creating an inequitable environment for telecom operators,"" COAI said.* Reliance Jio has demanded that the entire 1200 MHz of available spectrum in the 6 GHz band be included in the upcoming auction, despite the government’s decision to delicense the lower 500 MHz for low-power applications.* Vodafone Idea has requested that the 400 MHz currently available be put up for sale immediately.* Bharti Airtel, taking a more cautious approach, has sought a deferment of the auction. Airtel cited a lack of ecosystem readiness regarding devices and global harmonization, a view echoed by chipset major Qualcomm.US-based chipset major Qualcomm, however, has echoed views similar to Airtel. Qualcomm aligned partially with Airtel, emphasizing that the upper 6 GHz band is critical for India's future 6G ambitions.""By deferring the auction of the 6425-6725 MHz and 7025-7125 MHz bands until after WRC-27, India safeguards its 6G future, aligns with global standards, and honours its leadership aspirations,"" the San Diego-based Qualcomm said in its submission.","Apple, Amazon, Cisco, Meta, HP, and Intel have formally opposed demands by Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea regarding the allocation of the 6 GHz spectrum band.

TSMC investigates if the top exec who has joined Intel took TSMC tech; while Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan says: We ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tsmc-investigates-if-the-top-exec-who-has-joined-intel-took-tsmc-tech-while-intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan-says-we-/articleshow/125529609.cms,"What Intel said on the allegations







TSMC has reportedly opened an internal investigation to find whether Lo Wen-jen has taken trade secrets with him to Intel without its consent. According to a report in Bloomberg, Taiwanese newspapers spent the week reporting on the transition of Lo Wen-jen, 75, from his retirement from TSMC earlier this year to joining Intel in recent weeks. It is unclear whether TSMC has reached a conclusion about any potential damage to the company, the person added, asking not to be identified since the information is private.“The government is concerned with national security implications,” Taiwan’s Minister of Economic Affairs Kung Ming-hsin told reporters, without elaborating on any of the details pertaining to allegations against Lo. Minister Wu Cheng-wen of Taiwan’s National Science and Technology Council reportedly told reporters later in the day that TSMC is still looking into the situation, according to Taiwan’s official Central News Agency.Lo was responsible for corporate strategy before his retirement from TSMC in July. He was at one point in charge of research and technology development at TSMC and played a key role in facilitating the mass production at TSMC of cutting-edge chips, including those used to make AI accelerators. He is also a laureate of Taiwan’s prestigious Industrial Technology Research Institute.Before he joined TSMC in 2004, Lo spent some time at Intel focusing on advanced technology development, including running a chip factory in Santa Clara, California.He has a doctorate degree in solid state physics and surface chemistry from UC Berkeley.Relations between Intel and TSMC have not been very good over the past few years as the US chipmaker tries to play catchup in the technology race. Intel is at once a customer and a competitor to TSMC, which is also the sole maker of the most high-end chips for Apple and Nvidia.Intel Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Lip-Bu Tan dismissed reports about a new hire taking trade secrets from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) to his company, saying the US chipmaker respects other firms’ intellectual property. Taiwanese newspapers spent the week reporting on the transition of Lo Wen-jen, 75, from his retirement from TSMC earlier this year to joining Intel in recent weeks. The executive is alleged to have taken proprietary knowhow from his former employer just before his departure. “It’s rumor and speculation. There’s nothing to it. We respect IP,” Tan told Bloomberg News on the sidelines of the Semiconductor Industry Association Awards in San Jose on Thursday. The event recognized TSMC CEO C.C. Wei and former Chairman Mark Liu with its highest honor, the Robert N. Noyce Award.Incidentally, Intel's sacked former CEO Pat Gelsinger frequently argued that it was too risky for the US to depend heavily on TSMC for cutting-edge semiconductors due to growing geopolitical volatility in the Taiwan Strait, creating friction between the two companies.",TSMC has reportedly opened an internal investigation to find whether Lo Wen-jen has taken trade secrets with him to Intel without its consent.

Gemini 3 and Nano Banana Pro

These tools demonstrate improved spatial reasoning, allowing AI to understand how objects should be positioned in the real world.

Tech investor Balaji Srinivasan noted that the burger image showed Gemini 3 had solved a long-standing challenge: “Normally, AI models struggle with spatial orientation… but this image seems to resolve that issue.”

Google’s AI comeback





Eight years after Google was roasted online for a cheeseburger emoji that placed the cheese under the meat. Now, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has finally set the record straight with the help of Google’s latest generative AI models. Back in 2017, Google faced a lot of backlash when the ingredients of its cheeseburger emoji in Android were stacked incorrectly. Pichai jokingly apologised at that time and promised to soon come up with a fix. Recently, the Google CEO delivered the correct emoji. Pichai shared a post on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) in which he shared an AI-generated cheeseburger image with the cheese firmly above the patty, captioned “iykyk” as a nod to the viral furor.The emoji correction coincided with Google’s launch of Gemini 3, its most advanced AI model, and Nano Banana Pro, a new image-generation tool capable of producing realistic pictures, diagrams, and charts.The launch of Gemini 3 marks a turning point for Google, which has faced criticism for lagging behind rivals in generative AI. The company’s stock surged to a record high this week, briefly making Google more valuable than Microsoft.Pichai’s decade-long push toward an AI-first strategy is now bearing fruit. “Google really did drop everything they were doing to truly focus on AI,” Srinivasan wrote. “Gemini 3 represents the moment when they actually retook the lead. ”What began as a lighthearted emoji scandal has evolved into a symbol of Google’s AI progress. By fixing the cheeseburger stack, Pichai showcased not just humor but a serious leap in AI’s ability to understand the physical world — a capability that could reshape industries far beyond fast food.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai posted an AI-generated cheeseburger image with the cheese firmly above the patty, captioned ‘iykyk’ The emoji correction coincided with Google’s launch of Gemini 3, its most advanced AI model, and Nano Banana Pro, a new image-generation tool.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125518532,imgsize-496675,width-400,resizemode-4/sundar-pichai-image-credit-bbc-interview-youtube.jpg"

His role in politics and efforts to support President Trump.

Tesla’s growth trajectory and Musk’s ambitious vision of a $20 trillion valuation, largely tied to the Optimus humanoid bot.

His ventures in AI through xAI and the chatbot Grok.





Tesla CEO Elon Musk may soon add a new title to his long list of roles. In a recent post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk revealed that he is considering of writing his autobiography to share lessons from his life and career. Musk’s comments come two years after Walter Isaacson’s 2023 biographybecame a bestseller. While Isaacson’s book chronicled Musk’s journey from childhood through Tesla’s “production hell” in 2018 and the Twitter buyout in 2022, Musk suggested there is more to tell.“I need to tell my story myself and highlight lessons that I learned along the way that would be useful to others,” Musk wrote on X in reply to a user sharing Isaacson’s interview with C-SPAN’s. Isaacson, who had behind-the-scenes access to Musk, recently criticized Musk’s political involvement, saying he could have “changed the government for good” had he focused differently.A Musk-penned autobiography could detail his life from 2023 through 2025, including:Despite the talk of a book, Musk’s immediate focus remains on Tesla. His new pay package, worth nearly $1 trillion, has investors expecting him to prioritize the company’s future growth over politics or personal projects.Before Musk’s own book materializes, fans may see his life depicted on the big screen.

Meta’s Secret AI Army: Top Talent Hired from OpenAI, Google & More

Meta denies allegations, says methodology was flawed







A claim filed in a class-action lawsuit against Meta alleges that the company shut down internal research after finding causal evidence that its products, Facebook , were causing mental health problems to users. The allegation comes from unredacted filings submitted by US school districts suing Meta, Google, TikTok and Snapchat, news agency Reuters reported, adding that the plaintiffs argue the tech giants intentionally concealed internally recognized risks from users, parents and educators.The core of the claim revolves around a 2020 internal research project code-named “Project Mercury.” Meta scientists, working with the survey firm Nielsen, studied the effects of “deactivating” Facebook use. According to internal documents cited in the filing, the results were highly unfavourable: “people who stopped using Facebook for a week reported lower feelings of depression, anxiety, loneliness and social comparison. ”Rather than publicising the findings or continuing the study, the filing alleges Meta terminated further work and internally dismissed the negative results, claiming they were tainted by the existing “media narrative” around the company.One staffer allegedly expressed concern that burying the findings was akin to the tobacco industry “doing research and knowing cigs were bad and then keeping that info to themselves.”In a statement released on Saturday (November 22), Meta spokesman Andy Stone defended the company, asserting that the study was stopped because its methodology was flawed, and that Meta works diligently to improve product safety.“The full record will show that for over a decade, we have listened to parents, researched issues that matter most, and made real changes to protect teens,” Stone said.He noted that the company’s teen safety measures are effective, adding that the company has a policy is to remove accounts as soon as they are flagged.","Claim filed in a class-action lawsuit against Meta alleges that the company shut down internal research after finding causal evidence that its products, Facebook, were causing mental health problems to users.

Major financial institutions affected



Sensitive personal data at risk



FBI says it is monitoring situation







Some of America’s largest financial institutions are reportedly working urgently to assess potential damage from a significant cyberattack on SitusAMC, a critical vendor used by hundreds of banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and Morgan Stanley, to process real estate loans and mortgages. The New York-based company, which employs approximately 5,000 people and is owned by several private equity firms, confirmed on Saturday (November 22) that it was breached on November 12 and has spent nearly two weeks investigating the scope of compromised data related to residential loan mortgages.Citing five people briefed on the incident, The New York Times reported that JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and Morgan Stanley are among the institutions notified by SitusAMC that client data may have been stolen. A JPMorgan spokesperson clarified that the bank itself had not been directly hacked.The breach has generated particular alarm on Wall Street due to the nature of information SitusAMC handles. The vendor maintains vast collections of personal data from loan applications, including Social Security numbers and other sensitive financial information.SitusAMC CEO Michael Franco said in a statement that the company has notified law enforcement and “remain[s] focused on analyzing any potentially affected data.”The company has been providing near-daily updates to banking clients as the investigation continues. The company is owned by several private equity firms. It is unclear what data has been stolen, or how many US banking consumers are affected.Meanwhile, FBI Director Kash Patel addressed the incident, stating: “While we are working closely with affected organizations and our partners to understand the extent of potential impact, we have identified no operational impact to banking services.”SitusAMC serves as essential infrastructure for the real estate lending industry, offering services including loan origination, collection, and regulatory compliance.","JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and Morgan Stanley are among the institutions notified by SitusAMC that client data may have been stolen.

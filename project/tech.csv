Apple and Google: An unlikely AI alliance

A make-or-break moment for Siri



Apple Intelligence: A broader vision







In a surprising twist in the AI arms race, Apple is reportedly preparing to integrate Google’s Gemini AI model into a revamped version of Siri, marking a rare collaboration between two of tech’s fiercest rivals. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the new Siri—part of Apple’s broader “Apple Intelligence” initiative—is expected to debut around March 2026, alongside new hardware including a smart home display, an updated Apple TV, and a refreshed HomePod miniThe upcoming Siri upgrade will reportedly “lean” on Google Gemini, the search giant’s flagship generative AI model, to power more advanced voice interactions and AI-driven web search capabilities. Apple is said to be paying Google to develop a custom version of Gemini tailored to Siri’s needs.This move signals a strategic shift for Apple, which has historically emphasized in-house development and user privacy. While the company has been investing heavily in its own AI infrastructure, it appears to be augmenting its capabilities with external partnerships to stay competitive in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.The integration of Gemini is part of what’s being described as one of the biggest overhauls in Siri’s history. Apple aims to transform Siri from a basic voice assistant into a more intelligent, context-aware system capable of handling complex queries and tasks. However, Gurman cautions that the success of the new Siri is far from guaranteed. “There’s no guarantee users will embrace it, that it will work seamlessly, or that it can undo years of damage to the Siri brand,” he wroteThe Siri upgrade is just one component of Apple’s broader Apple Intelligence platform, which aims to embed AI more deeply across its ecosystem. The company is expected to showcase these features through new hardware launches, including a smart display with speaker and wall-mount options, designed to highlight Siri’s enhanced capabilities. Apple’s decision to collaborate with Google also reflects the growing complexity and cost of developing frontier AI models, prompting even the largest tech firms to consider partnerships over going it alone.","Apple is reportedly preparing to integrate Google's Gemini AI model into a revamped version of Siri.

Satya Nadella on lessons Cricket has taught him

Congratulations and congratulations





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has congratulated the Indian women's cricket team for winning its first-ever World Cup. The Indian women's cricket team kept its date with history by winning the World Cup with a 52-run victory over South Africa. In a post on Twitter, Microsoft CEO Nadella wrote, ""Women in Blue = World Champions! 🏆🇮🇳 Respect to 🇿🇦 South Africa for making their first-ever final 👏 A truly historic day for women’s cricket—new chapters written, barriers broken, legends born.""An avid cricket fan, Nadella's congratulatory post came within minutes of the Indian women's cricket team scripting a golden chapter in the country's pantheon of sporting achievements. It was India’s third final after 2005 and 2017.Nadella has often spoken about his deep-seated passion for cricket, a sport he dreamed of playing professionally while growing up in India. He was reportedly an off-spin bowler and captained his school team, experiences that profoundly shaped his leadership style.Nadella views cricket as more than just a game; he compares Test cricket to a ""Russian novel"" for its depth and unfolding drama.He frequently credits lessons learned on the pitch -- like persistence, teamwork, and building a teammate's confidence -- or his success in the tech industry. His enduring love for the sport also led him to invest in Major League Cricket.Satya Nadella and Soma Somasegar are among the key owners of Seattle’s cricket team, named the Orcas. Somasegar is a venture capitalist and managing director at Madrona.In fact, Nadella is such a die-hard cricket fan that Microsoft has a cricket field at its campus in Bellevue, Washington.Earlier this year, Microsoft CEO took to social media to praise the Test match series played between India and England. The five-match series, which was played for a period of 25 days ended in a 2-2 draw. The test series witnessed many outstanding performances by the players of both the teams. In a post shared on X (formerly known as Twitter) Nadella wrote, “25 days. 5 battles. Scores tied 2-2. This isn’t just a game — it’s Test Cricket in all its timeless glory. A series for the ages. Hats off to IND & ENG for the drama, grit, and greatness.”Similarly, in March this year, Nadella congratulated team India on winning Champions Trophy 2025. Nadella applauded the Men in Blue for their performance. ""Congratulations to Team India on their incredible victory in the Champions Trophy final against New Zealand!” Nadella said.He also gave a special shoutout to two Indian cricketing greats -- Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. “Special shoutout to @ImRo45 and @imVkohli for their stellar performances.

Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman to developers and researchers: Stop 'doing' projects that …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman-to-developers-and-researchers-stop-pursuing-projects-that-/articleshow/125040076.cms,"“I don’t think that is work that people should be doing. If you ask the wrong question, you end up with the wrong answer. I think it’s totally the wrong question.”

“The Coming Wave”

“We must build AI for people, not to be a person.”

What Mustafa Suleyman said about AI having emotions



“Our physical experience of pain is something that makes us very sad and feel terrible, but the AI doesn’t feel sad when it experiences ‘pain.’ It’s a very, very important distinction. It’s really just creating the perception, the seeming narrative of experience and of itself and of consciousness, but that is not what it’s actually experiencing.”

5 biggest AI announcements at Microsoft Build 2025

“The reason we give people rights today is because we don’t want to harm them, because they suffer.

They have a pain network, and they have preferences which involve avoiding pain. These models don’t have that. It’s just a simulation.”

“They’re not conscious. So it would be absurd to pursue research that investigates that question, because they’re not and they can’t be,”





Microsoft AI chief Mustafa Suleyman has advised developers and researchers to stop pursuing projects that suggest artificial intelligence (AI) is capable of consciousness. He said this, asserting that only biological beings possess this trait and noted that the pursuit is misplaced. In a recent interview with CNBC at the AfroTech Conference, Suleyman said,Suleyman has been a vocal opponent of the prospect of conscious AI, or AI services that could convince humans they are capable of suffering.In 2023, Suleyman co-authored the bookand penned an essay titled,His comments come as the generative AI market, led by companies like OpenAI, pushes toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). Meanwhile, the AI companion market is growing with products from companies including Meta and Elon Musk’s xAI.Highlighting the difference between AI becoming more capable and the idea of it having emotions, Suleyman said:Referring to the theory of biological naturalism, which suggests that consciousness depends on the processes of a living brain, Suleyman explained:Suleyman also highlighted that the science of detecting consciousness is still in its early stages. While he acknowledged that different organisations may have their own research goals, he strongly opposed studying AI consciousness.he added.","Mustafa Suleyman has advised developers and researchers to stop pursuing projects that suggest artificial intelligence (AI) is capable of consciousness.

Google , Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Amazon all have the 'same problem'

Meta's missing product





In the midst of an unprecedented AI buildout, Meta is spending more than most. The company is building two massive data centers, and reporting indicates there will be as much as $600 billion in spending on U.S. infrastructure over the next three years. While such figures might be expected in the heart of Silicon Valley, they are beginning to raise alarms on Wall Street.The concern hit a peak this week as Meta reported its third quarter earnings. The results revealed a substantial year-over-year jump in operating expenses, coupled with a staggering nearly $20 billion in Capital Expenditure (CapEx). This spending spree is driven by intense investment in AI talent and the necessary infrastructure, none of which has yet translated into meaningful, directly attributable revenue. When pressed for details by analysts, CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed that this spending is only the beginning.Meta isn't the only tech titan sinking billions into AI infrastructure. However, the market reaction to their spending is noticeably different compared to that of rivals like Google and Nvidia, both of whom recently posted strong quarters. Even OpenAI, arguably the biggest catalyst for this investment wave, spends comparable amounts despite having a far smaller financial cushion than Meta.The core issue fueling investor anxiety is the fear of an AI bubble. If one forms, the consensus suggests Meta’s strong core business might allow it to weather the storm better than most, but the underlying question remains: where is the immediate return?While specific recent quarterly CapEx figures fluctuate, reports often show that Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are all substantially increasing their CapEx, albeit often in ways more directly tied to immediate, established revenue streams like Cloud services (Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services) or dominant advertising/search platforms. Sam Altman of OpenAI justifies his hundreds of billions in compute spending by pointing to one of the fastest-growing consumer services in history, backed by a reported $20 billion annual revenue run rate (ARR). That rapid growth offers a clear, quantifiable answer to sustainability questions.Meta’s spend, by contrast, is being directed toward infrastructure whose direct monetization path is less clear in the immediate future. Meta currently lacks a comparable, runaway AI product. Its most visible AI offering is the Meta AI assistant, which Zuckerberg noted has over a billion active users. However, this figure is heavily ""juiced"" by the three billion active users across Facebook and Instagram, and the current version struggles to stand as a true competitor to specialized models like ChatGPT. Furthermore, features like the Vibes video generator successfully boost daily active users but have limited long-term business impact. Vibes is a platform where users can create and share short-form, AI-generated videos.The most ambitious physical product, the Vanguard smart glasses, feels more like an extension of Meta’s established Reality Labs efforts than a direct, large-scale application harnessing the raw power of Large Language Models (LLMs) for immediate, scalable profit.In short, Meta is making monumental bets on infrastructure that is currently funding promising experiments, not yet fully formed, direct revenue-generating products."," Meta is building two massive data centers, and reporting indicates there will be as much as $600 billion in spending on U.S. infrastructure over the next three years.

European Union supports US against China

Scott Bessent blames Biden government







China’s move to tighten control over rare earth mineral exports has backfired, prompting the United States and its allies to ramp up efforts to secure alternative supplies of the critical materials, so says US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Talking to Epoch Times, Bessent said that Beijing “made a real mistake” by attempting to use its dominance in rare earths for political leverage -- a move that instead unified Western economies against what he called China’s “economic coercion”.Bessent reportedly noted that China’s export curbs on rare earth-related technologies in early October sent shockwaves through global markets, further straining already fragile supply chains. “China has alerted everyone to the danger. They’ve made a real mistake,” he said, comparing Beijing’s approach to “firing shots in the air” after brandishing a weapon.The restrictions quickly became a flashpoint in trade talks between Washington and Beijing, spurring the U.S. to accelerate efforts to diversify sources of key minerals. Following a high-level meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea, China abruptly announced a one-year suspension of the export controls.Bessent said the reversal showed Beijing’s concern about the global backlash and the potential loss of credibility as a reliable trading partner. He cautioned, however, that while the temporary suspension might ease tensions, China’s leverage over the rare earth supply chain is diminishing fast.“There’s an agreement that we have reached an equilibrium for the next 12 months,” Bessent said, adding that the U.S. now has “offsetting measures” in place to blunt China’s influence. He predicted that within 12 to 24 months, Beijing’s ability to use rare earths as an economic weapon will fade as Western nations expand mining and refining operations in Southeast Asia and other friendly regions.European Union Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic confirmed that the suspension also applies to the EU, underscoring how China’s actions have strengthened global resolve to reduce dependency on Chinese supplies.Bessent also criticized previous U.S. administrations for being “asleep at the switch” while Beijing spent years consolidating its dominance in the rare earth sector. “Now this administration is going at warp speed over the next one, two years to get out from under this sword the Chinese have over us—and over the whole world,” he said on CNN’s State of the Union.As part of a broader understanding reached between Washington and Beijing, the U.S. will reduce tariffs on Chinese exports by 10 percent, while China has agreed to take new steps to curb fentanyl exports to the United States. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has identified China as the largest supplier of the synthetic opioid fueling America’s overdose crisis.","China’s move to tighten control over rare earth mineral exports has backfired, says US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

US may impose complete ban on sale of TP-Link Wi-Fi routers for this ‘Big China Fear’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-may-impose-complete-ban-on-sale-of-tp-link-wi-fi-routers-for-this-big-china-fear/articleshow/125036315.cms,"AI generated image for representation

What US federal agencies said about TP Link







More than half a dozen US federal departments and agencies have cited national security concerns to support a proposal to implement a complete ban on future sales of TP-Link networking equipment in the country, According to a report by The Washington Post, the inter-agency risk assessment concluded that TP-Link's US-based entity could still be subject to Chinese government influence due to its established ties to the China-based TP-Link Technologies. The federal departments supporting the ban include the United States Department of Commerce, the United States Department of Defence, and the United States Department of Homeland Security.The report claims that a recent inter-agency risk assessment found that the Chinese government may still be influencing TP-Link’s US entity due to its historical connections with China-based TP-Link Technologies. The company currently holds a significant share of the US home router market, with estimates ranging from 50% to 65%. The government has not yet announced an official ban, but if it proceeds, TP-Link would be given a 30-day notice and a chance to respond, as per existing regulations.The Commerce Department must now decide whether to impose a complete sales ban or consider other measures, such as independent security audits or domestic production requirements.Before taking any action, the department would formally notify TP-Link, after which the company would have 30 days to reply.Commerce would then have an additional 30 days to evaluate the company’s response and issue a final ruling.Sources cited in the report suggest that Commerce officials believe only a full ban would address the national security concerns associated with TP-Link’s operations in China. However, this conclusion has not been publicly confirmed.For now, US customers are advised to remain cautious by regularly updating router firmware, changing default passwords, and disabling unused remote management settings. These steps can help reduce security risks regardless of brand while the situation continues to unfold.","More than half a dozen US federal departments and agencies have cited national security concerns to support a proposal to implement a complete ban on future sales of TP-Link networking equipment.

Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency





Mayor Bruce Harrell called on Seattle's tech powerhouses, including Microsoft and Amazon , to fulfill a ""moral obligation"" to reinvest in the community, highlighting their massive profits during a speech at a Fremont Chamber of Commerce event late last month. ""Microsoft … they made $88 billion last year … they have an obligation to give back to society, as does Amazon,"" Harrell said, praising the city as a ""city of innovation"" and a ""great launching pad"" for large companies. ""That’s a good thing. That’s not a bad thing.""According to a report in GeekWire, the remarks underscore the tightrope walk for Harrell and city leaders: leveraging the economic boost from global tech firms while tackling their impacts on housing, transportation, and local neighborhoods. Seattle's largest employer, Amazon, has been a frequent focus of Harrell's push for corporate accountability since he took office in 2022.In an earlier interview with GeekWire, Harrell emphasized valuing tech jobs but stressed a ""culture of accountability. ""At the 2022 GeekWire Summit, he invited business leaders to deepen civic involvement, saying, ""There’s just plenty of opportunities for you all to engage, and I’m just a call away to facilitate that engagement.""Harrell,a former telecom attorney, is seeking re-election on November's ballot against progressive challenger Katie Wilson, a community organizer who captured nearly 51% of the vote in the August primary. The contest has garnered national interest due to the candidates' stark contrasts.Wilson's campaign reportedly gained momentum after voters approved a publicly funded social housing developer earlier this year, backed by a 5% tax on salaries exceeding $1 million for city-based employees. Harrell backed an alternative funding plan that drew contributions from Amazon and Microsoft.The debate highlights Seattle's tension between progressive tax policies and dependence on tech prosperity. Harrell warned of the risks of over-taxation, citing Amazon's loss of 10,000 jobs amid past policy clashes. ""That’s not a sustainable strategy, just to tax people,"" he said.Yet Harrell has supported targeted measures, including a proposal this year to exempt smaller companies from the business and occupation tax while raising rates on larger ones. As city council president in 2018, he oversaw the approval and rapid repeal of a controversial per-employee ""head tax"" on big businesses. In 2020, the council passed the ""JumpStart"" payroll tax, which Wilson helped design.","Mayor Bruce Harrell called on Seattle's tech powerhouses, including Microsoft and Amazon, to fulfill a ""moral obligation"" to reinvest in the community.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124805693,imgsize-7992,width-400,resizemode-4/x-twitter.jpg"

Xbox’s higher sales targets







Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, which will allow users to stream select titles without requiring a paid Game Pass subscription. The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees. The ad-supported service is expected to provide users with access to:The company is reportedly testing a model where users will view approximately two minutes of pre-roll advertisements before a game starts streaming. Internal testing also features limits on playtime, including a one-hour session limit and a maximum of five hours of free streaming per month. These restrictions are subject to change before the official launch, the report noted.The free tier is expected to be widely available across PC, Xbox consoles, handheld devices and web browsers. The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%. This change reportedly came after Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new 30% target.","Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

Intensifying price war in quick commerce market









Quick commerce platform Zepto has eliminated all handling fees and surge charges while significantly reducing its minimum order value for free delivery. This move comes just weeks after the company closed a substantial $450 million funding round.According to a report by The Economic Times, under its newly launched ‘All new Zepto experience,’ the company is now advertising zero handling fees, zero rain and surge charges, and zero delivery fees for all orders above Rs 99. The company also sent this message on WhatsApp.Previously, Zepto levied a handling charge described as covering the “handling of products in your orders at our stores.”The move positions Zepto as the lowest-cost quick commerce platform in the market, applying direct pressure on its main competitors, the report suggested, adding that rival platforms continue to charge various service fees.Blinkit charges an Rs 11 handling fee and a Rs 30 delivery fee on orders below Rs 199. Meanwhile, Instamart applies a Rs 9.8 handling fee and a Rs 30 delivery fee for orders below Rs 199. Both platforms also levy additional charges like rain and surge fees.The market shift was anticipated following Zepto’s recent funding, which industry experts predicted would escalate competition and intensify the use of discounting across the sector.Media reports from October 18 suggested the funding would increase cash burn as platforms focus on expansion and price competition. Experts predict discounting will continue and likely increase in the coming months.Zepto's latest change reverses a trend observed earlier this year. In June, industry reports highlighted that quick commerce platforms had collectively added a range of fees—including platform, handling, convenience, and small-cart levies—to customer orders.These fees, which generally ranged between Rs 6 and Rs 30 per order, were an attempt by companies to improve their unit economics and increase earnings from each transaction.",Zepto has eliminated all handling fees and surge charges while significantly reducing its minimum order value for free delivery.

AI’s power and its pitfalls



A system built for profit, not people



A call for structural change







Geoffrey Hinton popularly known as the Godfather of AI has now issued a stark warning about the future of work. Hinton has said that artificial intelligence may wipe out millions of jobs, but the real danger lies not in the technology, but how the society wants to deploy it. Speaking in an interview with Bloomberg TV via Fortune, Hinton stressed on the fact that fact that the looming employment crisis is not about inevitable consequence of AI, but rather a reflection of how governments and corporations prioritise short-term profit over long-term human well-being. “The problem is not ultimately due to AI itself,” Hinton said. “It’s due to how we structure our society and our economy.”Hinton emphasised that AI systems are slowly becoming capable of performing tasks which once required the intervention of humans. From customer service and logistics to legal research and even creative writing, AI is rapidly encroaching on white-collar and blue-collar jobs alike. But instead of calling for a halt to progress, Hinton urged the leaders to rethink how AI’s benefits are distributed. He warned that without proactive policy, the gains from automation will disproportionately enrich a small elite while leaving millions unemployed or underemployed.Along with this, Hinton has also criticised the present economic model, where corporate incentives are aligned with maximizing shareholder value, often at the expense of workers. He argued that AI is being used primarily to cut labor costs rather than to enhance human potential or reduce inequality. “If we continue to use AI to increase profits for the few, we’re going to end up in a very bad place,” he cautioned.To mitigate the risks, Hinton called for bold policy interventions, including universal basic income, stronger labor protections, and a reimagining of how work is valued in an AI-driven world. He also emphasized the need for global cooperation to ensure that superintelligent AI systems—if and when they arrive—are aligned with human values.His comments come amid growing concern over the societal impacts of AI, as companies like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic race to build increasingly powerful models. While some experts focus on existential risks, Hinton is equally concerned about the near-term consequences of unchecked automation.","Geoffrey Hinton, known as the Godfather of AI, has issued a stark warning about the future of work.

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

Microsoft’s dual ‘factory’ strategy







Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shifted the focus in the AI infrastructure debate, asserting that the limiting factor in the race for advanced AI is no longer the supply of AI semiconductors, but the availability of electrical power. Speaking on the BG2 podcast, hosted by Altimeter CEO Brad Gerstner, Nadella engaged in a rare joint dialogue with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman about the challenges and future of the AI industry.Nadella stated that the industry has moved past the initial supply constraints of specialised hardware and is now facing a more fundamental challenge.“The biggest issue we’re having now isn’t chips — it’s POWER,” said Satya Nadella.“If you can’t build close to power, you’ll have a bunch of chips sitting in inventory you can’t even plug in. It’s not a chip supply problem anymore — it’s a power problem,” he said during the podcast.OpenAI’s Sam Altman, meanwhile, predicted that the current scarcity of computing power is temporary, stating that “excess computing power will definitely emerge”, noting that this oversupply could happen within the next two to six years.Nadella detailed Microsoft’s strategic approach to AI development, emphasising that the key metric is not reducing the cost of computing power, but improving the efficiency of “intelligence per unit.”To achieve this, Microsoft is focused on building two ""factories"" simultaneously:The 'Token Factory' which refers to the underlying computing infrastructure such as hardware, system software, virtualization management and scheduling capabilities. The second is 'Agent Factory' which pertains to the upper-level software ecosystem.Altman also underscored the importance of AI's potential for scientific discovery, calling it the ultimate goal. “If we can truly enable AI to conduct scientific research, then in a sense, that would be superintelligence,” he stated.Altman also offered high praise for his partner, attributing OpenAI's success to the software giant's early backing: “Without Microsoft, especially Satya Nadella’s early and steadfast belief, we wouldn’t be where we are today. I think there were very few people willing to take such a bet back then.”","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shifted the focus in the AI infrastructure debate.

The Chinese unit of Dutch chipmaker Nexperia has claimed that its supply chain remains “secure and stable” despite its parent company cutting off critical wafer supplies. The statement by Nexperia China comes after the Dutch parent company suspended the shipment of wafers – the core material used to assemble chips – to its Chinese facility on October 26. The Dutch side cited the Chinese management's “recent failure to comply with the agreed contractual payment terms” as the reason for the halt.According to news agency Reuters, Nexperia China swiftly refuted the parent company’s explanation in a statement released early Sunday morning, calling the suspension “unilateral” and “extremely irresponsible.”The Chinese unit went on to label the Dutch parent's claim regarding contractual payment terms as “misleading and highly deceptive.”Despite the lack of new wafer shipments from the Netherlands, Nexperia China asserted it has “sufficient inventories of finished goods and work-in-progress” to meet customer demand. The Chinese unit claimed existing stock would sustain order fulfillment “through year-end and beyond.”The company reportedly also announced it has “proactively initiated multiple contingency plans and are accelerating the qualification of new wafer supply sources,” with expectations to meet all customer demands starting next year.In September, Dutch authorities seized control of Nexperia from its Chinese owner, Wingtech, over concerns about potential technology transfer. Beijing responded to the seizure by blocking Nexperia's products from being exported out of China.This ongoing dispute has increased pressure across the global automotive industry, which relies heavily on Nexperia's basic power-control chips needed in virtually every modern device.",Nexperia China says Dutch parent’s claims ‘irresponsible’ and ‘misleading’ The Chinese unit of Dutch chipmaker Nexperia has claimed that its supply chain remains “secure and stable” The Dutch parent company suspended the shipment of wafers – the core material used to assemble chips – on October 26.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125032964,imgsize-76400,width-400,resizemode-4/nexperia-chips.jpg"

Huang says ‘China doesn’t want any American chips’







Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, addressing the competition it faces in China, has sent a warning saying that it will be foolish to underestimate Huawei. The Chinese telecoms giant is at the centre of ongoing US trade tensions as during the first Trump administration, the US banned federal use of Huawei products and restricted American companies from dealing with the firm over spying concerns.While stating Nvidia is “miles ahead” in the chips race, Haung issued a strong caution against complacency, CNBC reported.“It is foolish to underestimate the might of China and the incredible, competitive spirit of Huawei,” Huang stressed. He praised Huawei’s technical prowess, noting their dominance in 5G technology and their ability to build “amazing chips” and systems like their large-scale AI supercomputing system, CloudMatrix.“This is a company with extraordinary technology. They dominate the world’s 5G telecommunication standards and technology. They build amazing smartphones, they build amazing chips, they’re incredible at networking and so when they announced CloudMatrix, I was not surprised that they were able to create such an amazing thing,” Huang said.“It’s deeply uninformed to think that Huawei can’t build systems,"" Huang concluded.“We take competition very seriously. We respect the competition, we respect deeply the capabilities of China. That’s why we run so fast, and that’s why we dedicate ourselves to inventing the future so we can get there before anybody else,” he added.The Nvidia CEO also said that China has plenty of AI chips and the country doesn’t want American AI processors.“China makes plenty of AI chips themselves, and the Chinese military surely have plenty of access to chips that are created in China. So, whatever national security concerns, have to take into consideration the fact that China has blocked H20 [an Nvidia chip] and, so, in a lot of ways, China is saying that, ‘listen, we have plenty of AI technology ourselves’,” Huang told CNBC.“And so the national security concern, from that perspective, I think, is really answered by the fact that China doesn’t want H20 or any American chips,” he added.The Nvidia CEO described the market opportunity in China as “probably $50 billion this year. It’s probably, call it, a couple of 100 billion dollars by the end of the decade.”",Huang says ‘China doesn’t want any American chips’ The Chinese telecoms giant is at the centre of ongoing US trade tensions.

Tesla board chairman writes open letter





Gerber Kawasaki co-founder and Tesla Bull Ross Gerber recently shared a post on X, slamming the Tesla board who, he alleges it of acting solely for CEO Elon Musk ’s interests. Gerber remarks come as the electric car maker’s crucial annual general meeting (AGM) approaches on November 6. During the AGM, the company is expected to reach a decision on Musk’s $1 trillion compensation package, one of the largest in corporate history.In the post, Gerber wrote:In September this year, the Tesla board proposed a $1 trillion compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk. The newly proposed award is roughly 18 times the size of the 2018 pay package.In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company said that “traditional compensation packages granted to executives at other companies were determined to not be appropriate for designing Mr. Musk’s incentive compensation.”Notably, the new pay package comes with a condition – 10 million active FSD subscriptions for Tesla and 1 million Tesla robotaxis on the road. FSD, as explained in the SEC filing “means an advanced driving system, regardless of the marketing name used, that is capable of performing transportation tasks that provide autonomous or similar functionality under specified driving conditions”.Elon Musk’s proposed pay has faced criticism from many groups. Addressing the concerns, Tesla board chairperson Robyn Denholm recently wrote an open letter to shareholders describing proxy advisory firms – ISS and Glass Lewis’ criticism of Elon Musk’s pay package as ‘misguided recommendations’. The letter said that these companies are “fundamentally unable to evaluate companies, like Tesla, that chart their own course and challenge the status quo. ” Denholm urged shareholders to ignore ISS’s and Glass Lewis’s advice for this year’s Annual Meeting which is scheduled for November 8.In the letter, he clarifies that Musk’s $1 trillion pay is a ‘performance incentive award’ which is “contingent on delivering products that support Elon’s vision for Sustainable Abundance, addresses shareholder concerns regarding retention and long-term succession, and ultimately creates extraordinary shareholder value.”","Tesla Bull Ross Gerber slammed the Tesla board who, he alleges it of acting solely for CEO Elon Musk ’s interests.

Roadster delays and public frustration

A history of clashes





The long-standing feud between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman got flared up once again. Recently, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman alleged that he paid $45,000 as a pre-reservation for a Tesla vehicle in July 2018, but is yet to receive the delivery of the car. In a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Altman shared screenshots of 3 different emails of the vehicle confirmation, his ask for refund and email bounce back. Altman said that he recently tried to connect with Tesla about the issue, but the email, as per the screenshot, bounced back. It showed an error stating “Address not found”.Telsa CEO Elon Musk has now responded to Altman and accused him of leaving out key details.Replying to the claims made by Altman, Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) and accused the OpenAI CEO of missing out in the key details. In a pointed replay, Musk wrote, “And you forgot to mention act 4, where this issue was fixed and you received a refund within 24 hours. But that is in your nature.” In a follow-up post, Musk added, “You stole a non-profit,” implying Altman dramatized the situation for attention.Tesla’s second generation Roadster was first launched in 2017 and Musk called it ‘the fastest production car ever made’. However, the vehicle faced a lot of repeated delays and it remains in “design development” as of Tesla’s latest earnings report.On the other hand, the popular tech YouTube MKBHD also canceled his Roadster reservation recently, citing the prolonged wait. While speaking on the Joe Rogan podcast recently, Musk also teased that the upcoming Roadster would feature ‘crazy technology’ likening it to a mashup of all the James Bond cars. “It’s crazier than that,” Musk said. “We’re getting close. The demo will be unforgettable.”The recent refund spat between Elon Musk and Sam Altman is the recent episode in the series of public spat between the two. For the uninitiated, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015, but left the board in 2018. Musk has criticised the company’s shift from open-source ideals to a closed, profit-driven model. Along with this, Musk also accused Altman of steering OpenAI away from its original mission. Musk also went ahead and launched his own AI venture — xAI.Earlier this year, Musk made headlines with a $97 billion bid to acquire OpenAI’s nonprofit arm—a move Altman publicly mocked.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman alleged that he paid $45,000 as a pre-reservation for a Tesla vehicle in July 2018, but is yet to receive the delivery of the car.

Jamie Dimon apology for using expletives in Town Hall





JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is standing firm on his demand that employees return to the office full time, brushing off internal calls for hybrid work and saying in-person collaboration is key to professional growth. Speaking at a conference in Riyadh this week, Dimon argued that younger bankers miss out on crucial mentorship opportunities when working remotely. “I’m not making fun of Zoom, but younger people are being left behind,” he said. “If you look back at your careers, you learned a little bit from the apprentice system. You were with other people who took you on a sales call or told you how to handle a mistake. That doesn’t happen when you’re in a basement on Zoom.”His comments come a week after a petition signed by about 2,000 JPMorgan employees called for the bank to reinstate hybrid working options. The petition, launched earlier this year, followed the company’s January announcement that it was ending remote work for most of its more than 300,000 employees.The bank’s return-to-office mandate has triggered frustration among staff, particularly in back-office roles, with internal message boards flooded with complaints.Dimon has previously taken a hard line against remote work. In February, he dismissed the petition outright, saying, “I don’t care how many people sign that f—ing petition,” and warned that anyone unwilling to come into the office daily could “find a new job. ”In February this year, JPMorgan CEO Dimon slammed calls from some employees to soften the bank's five-day return-to-office policy in an animated town hall meeting. According to a Reuters report, employees at the largest US bank have complained on internal message boards and chats about losing hybrid working arrangements, and one group launched an online petition urging Dimon to reconsider.When asked about the in-person work policy during the staff meeting, he said: ""Don't waste time on it. I don't care how many people sign that fucking petition,"" he said, drawing some laughter.In-office requirements will not be left up to managers, Dimon said. ""There is no chance that I will leave it up to managers,"" he said. ""Zero chance. The abuse that took place is extraordinary."" “I’ve had it with this stuff,” he said at the time. “I’ve been working seven days a goddamn week since COVID, and I come in — where is everybody else?”While Dimon later apologized for using profanity, saying he should “never curse, ever,” he maintained that remote work undermines efficiency and creativity. Dimon, who has led JPMorgan for 19 years, received $39 million in total compensation in 2024.","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says in-person collaboration is key to professional growth.

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon delivered a pointed message to AI chip rivals as his company announced its entry into the data center market: the battle for dominance is just beginning, and ""it's going to become a competitive environment very soon. ""Speaking at the Fortune Global Forum in Riyadh, Amon acknowledged that while ""everybody's playing to win"" in the AI race, ""it's hard right now to declare who the winners are."" His comments came as Qualcomm unveiled its AI200 and AI250 accelerator chips, directly challenging Nvidia's stronghold on the market for AI semiconductors.The announcement sent Qualcomm's stock soaring as much as 20% in Monday trading, signaling investor confidence in the company's pivot from mobile devices to data center AI infrastructure.Qualcomm's AI200, shipping in 2026, and AI250, arriving in 2027, will compete against Nvidia's GPUs that currently command over 90% of the AI chip market. The chips focus on inference computing—running AI models—rather than training them, and boast 768 gigabytes of memory capacity, surpassing current Nvidia and AMD offerings.Saudi Arabia's Humain will be the first customer, deploying 200 megawatts worth of AI200 chips at data centers next year.The deal expands a partnership announced during President Trump's May visit to Riyadh.Despite the competitive rhetoric, Amon compared today's AI boom to the dotcom era, suggesting the technology's long-term potential is ""probably underestimated."" He noted that companies investing in efficient architectures will be ""very well positioned"" as the market matures.His measured optimism contrasts with growing bubble concerns from industry leaders including Ray Dalio and Sam Altman , who have warned of overexcitement reminiscent of the late 1990s tech crash. However, Amon maintained that AI represents a ""massive opportunity"" whose true scale won't be clear for years.The AI chip market is expected to drive nearly $6.7 trillion in data center capital expenditures through 2030, according to McKinsey estimates.","Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon: ""It's hard right now to declare who the winners are"" His comments came as Qualcomm unveiled its AI200 and AI250 accelerator chips.

Google To Invest $15 Billion On AI Hub In Visakhapatnam, CEO Sundar Pichai Speaks To PM Modi

Two big bets Sundar Pichai made when became CEO in 2019

'Un-Googling' of Google Cloud

Betting on Chips and Competitors





Once seen as a laggard in Google parent Alphabet’s portfolio, Google Cloud has emerged as one of the company’s fastest-growing divisions, powered by surging demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and years of heavy investment in data centers, custom chips, and networking infrastructure. At earnings call this week, Alphabet said that its cloud revenue topped $15 billion in the third quarter, a 34% year-on-year increase, reflecting strong uptake of AI infrastructure and services — including Google’s own Gemini model.The unit is now challenging YouTube as Alphabet’s second-largest revenue generator after search advertising. “Google Cloud is one of the most important priorities for Alphabet as a whole, and I expect it to play an even more central role as the company moves forward,” CEO Sundar Pichai told Reuters in an interview earlier in October. Much of that growth has been driven by Thomas Kurian, a former Oracle executive who took over in 2018 and has since boosted Google Cloud’s market share from 7% to 13%, according to Synergy Research Group.When Pichai succeeded co-founder Larry Page as CEO in 2019, he named YouTube and Google Cloud as his two big bets to diversify Alphabet beyond advertising. YouTube has already delivered, becoming the world’s largest video platform with more than a billion hours watched daily. Google Cloud, by contrast, lost billions between 2018 and 2022 before turning its first profit in 2023. Now, with the rise of generative AI, Alphabet sees a new opportunity to narrow the gap with Microsoft and Amazon, which control roughly 20% and 30% of the market, respectively.“This is the moment Google Cloud was waiting for,” said Dave McCarthy, research director at IDC. “A lot of the future growth at Alphabet is being looked at through its potential.”In interviews with Reuters, senior executives described how Google Cloud’s turnaround was achieved through a cultural reset — shifting to a customer-driven sales model, tightening financial discipline, and working more closely with rivals.Kurian slashed costs by opening offices in lower-cost locations such as North Carolina and Poland and renegotiating internal contracts that overcharged his division, Reuters reported. He also restructured the sales strategy to target industries rather than geographies and replaced Google’s loose, experimental culture with what insiders called an “un-Googley” focus on execution and accountability.Google Cloud’s growth has also been propelled by a pivotal internal shift: in 2022, Kurian convinced Pichai to move Google’s in-house TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) chip business under his control. That allowed the cloud division to offer Alphabet’s own AI chips directly to customers — including rivals.Nine of the ten leading AI labs, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Safe Superintelligence, now use Google Cloud, Kurian said in September. “We are the only hyperscaler with both silicon and models of our own,” he told Reuters.The move paid off. In 2024, Anthropic expanded its deal with Google to deploy up to one million TPUs, worth tens of billions of dollars, as it sought alternatives to Nvidia hardware. Other major AI developers, including Apple, have since followed.","Google Cloud has emerged as one of the company’s fastest-growing divisions.

Mystery of Comet 3I/ATLAS

How does 3I/ATLAS 'look'

Elon Musk and Joe Rogan discuss 3I/ATLAS

Elon Musk makes a public vow on Aliens





Recent, simultaneous developments in Space technology and astronomy have fueled intrigue and speculation: Unauthorized signal transmissions tied to SpaceX's Starshield network are coinciding with heightened scrutiny of a bizarre, Manhattan-sized interstellar object known as Comet 3I/ATLAS. The connection deepened on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, where host Joe Rogan and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk discussed the comet's anomalous characteristics, leading to an astonishing conversation that touched on potential alien probes and even the historic Tunguska Event of 1908.First spotted in July, Comet 3I/ATLAS is behaving unlike any object scientists have seen before. The speculation surrounding its nature intensified after Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb boldly claimed the interstellar visitor could be an ""alien probe sent to do recon on Earth,"" a quote Rogan brought up on the show. Loeb went on to accuse NASA of withholding critical information about 3I/ATLAS. Earlier, the Harvard scientist has said that the Manhattan-sized interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS could have extraterrestrial origins.Along with its unusual tail orientation, Loeb noted that it was spouting a plume of four grams of nickel per second with no evidence of iron, which is a phenomenon unheard of in comets. He has also reportedly voiced concern over ATLAS’s nongravitational acceleration and anomalous trajectory that will bring it suspiciously close to Jupiter, Venus and Mars.The Manhattan-sized interstellar object 3I/ATLAS exhibited signs of non-gravitational acceleration and appeared “Bluer than the Sun” as it passed our local star — which could be signs of an alien craft “engine,” according to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, as reported by NY Post.Rogan highlighted a key, baffling characteristic: The discovery of nickel in the comet’s gas cloud, noting that, on Earth, this is primarily found in industrial alloys. Elon Musk, however, offered a terrestrial explanation for the nickel deposits. He stated that many comets and asteroids are ""made primarily of nickel,"" and that ""the places where you mine nickel on Earth is actually where there was an asteroid or comet that hit earth—that was a nickel rich meteorite. ""When pressed on the possibility of the object being an alien spacecraft, Musk acknowledged the implications of a nickel-heavy construction. ""It would be a very sort of heavy spaceship if you make it all out of nickel,"" he said, adding that such a vessel ""would like obliterate a continent type of thing—maybe worse.""In what can be termed as a bizarre moment that underscored the conspiratorial undertones of the discussion, Rogan asked Musk if he was keeping up to date with the comet. Elon Musk’s response was a public promise regarding the existence of extraterrestrial life: ""I mean, one thing I can say is like, look, if I was aware of any evidence of aliens -- Joe, you have my word -- I will come on your show and I will reveal it on the show. ""Elon Musk then made an emphatic, public declaration to address a conspiracy theory suggesting that those who know the truth about alien contact are silenced: ""I’m never committing suicide, to be clear. So, on camera, guys, I am never committing suicide ever!""The confluence of unexplained signals from a major satellite network and an interstellar object exhibiting properties likened to artificial origins has reignited public fascination with the final frontier, leaving many to wonder what other secrets Comet 3I/ATLAS might hold as it hurtles through our solar system.","Comet 3I/ATLAS is behaving unlike any object scientists have seen before.

Amazon layoffs hit engineers hardest in its Home state; here's what filing with Employment Security Department says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-layoffs-hit-software-engineers-hardest-in-its-home-state-heres-what-filing-with-employment-security-department-says/articleshow/125021493.cms,"Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency





What Amazon filing with the Washington Employment Security Department says

""This letter is being issued in accordance with any possible obligation under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and the Washington Securing Timely Notification and Benefits for Laid-Off Employees Act (collectively, “WARN”) to notify you that Amazon is separating employees at the below facilities within the state of Washington (collectively, the “Facilities”), with employee separations expected to commence effective January 26, 2026.

As a result of this action, we anticipate that the above-described approximately 2,303 employees will be separated from employment with Amazon, with separations effective on the following dates: January 26, 2026; January 30, 2026; February 5, 2026; February 25, 2026; February 27, 2026; March 19, 2026; April 1, 2026; April 26, 2026; and May 26, 2026. While WARN requires only 60 days’ advance notice, Amazon is providing at least 90 days’ notice to all affected employees before their separations are scheduled to occur. Affected employees who accept internal transfer opportunities at Amazon prior to their separation date will not be separated as a result of this action.

Employee separations resulting from this action are expected to be permanent. The affected employees are not represented by a union or any other collective bargaining representative. Amazon and its affiliates do not allow separated employees to displace any other employee based on seniority or any other factor (i.e., no “bumping rights” exist). Affected employees who are separated as a result of this action will be paid all wages and other benefits to which they are entitled (if any) through their date of separation, provided they do not resign from their employment with Amazon prior to that date. On or before the effective date of each employee’s separation, Amazon will provide information concerning benefits and (as applicable) severance available under separate cover to eligible affected employees. This action is not the result of, nor reasonably expected to result in, any overall relocation or contracting out of Amazon’s Washington operations/employee positions.

A list of the job titles held by the above-referenced affected employees, and the number of affected employees holding each such job title, is attached hereto. At Amazon we take the responsibility of protecting the personal information of our employees very seriously, including taking steps to ensure that any recipients of such information maintain it confidentially. Given that this notice is generally obtainable by third parties, and that affected employees have a legitimate privacy interest in not having their names, contact information, and selection for layoff made available to the general public for review, republication, or other purposes, we have omitted employee names and home addresses from this notice. The privacy interest here is the same interest that underlies the confidentiality of unemployment compensation information in the Employment Security Department’s files. RCW 50.13.020. To assist with communication between affected employees and the Department, we are providing the Department’s contact information to all affected employees.

We are providing you with this notice based upon the best information available to us at this time and do not plan to provide future notices with respect to this action. We wish to provide you with notices that are helpful, rather than inundate you with repeated or intermittent updates. However, please let us know if you would like us to provide you with future notices or additional information.





Software development engineers represent the biggest group hit by Amazon's newest layoffs in the company's Home state -- Washington. According to a GeekWire report, citing a fresh filing with the Washington Employment Security Department, Amazon plans to cut 2,303 corporate jobs in the state -- primarily in Seattle and Bellevue -- as part of a global reduction affecting roughly 14,000 employees announced the same day.The state's detailed breakdown shows over 600 software development engineering positions among those eliminated, accounting for more than a quarter of the Washington total. This pattern echoes Microsoft's engineering cuts earlier this year, as tech companies recalibrate amid AI-powered coding advancements. Amazon launched its own AI tool, Kiro, in July and has explored integrating the Cursor AI code assistant for staff. The engineer reductions signal a profound evolution in an industry long dependent on human coders for core infrastructure.In Washington, more than 500 manager roles are also being slashed, supporting Amazon's goal of trimming bureaucracy for greater efficiency. Cuts extend to recruiting, HR, marketing, advertising, and legal functions.The hardest-hit location is Amazon's SEA40 Doppler building on 7th Avenue in Seattle, with 361 jobs lost, per the filing.Over 100 Washington-based remote workers are additionally affected.“This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet,” Amazon HR chief Beth Galetti stated in a employee message, noting that it allows teams to “innovate much faster than ever before.” These moves contribute to wider AI-driven disruptions in tech and white-collar work, per a Wall Street Journal article this week on nationwide layoffs and an Axios piece headlined “How an AI job apocalypse unfolds. ”","Report: Amazon plans to cut 2,303 corporate jobs in Washington state.

Alaska Airlines hires Accenture to audit IT systems after global outage forced it to cancel quarterly earnings call,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/alaska-airlines-hires-accenture-to-audit-it-systems-after-global-outage-forced-it-to-cancel-quarterly-earnings-call/articleshow/125020707.cms,"Representative Image





Alaska Airlines has announced that it has hired global consulting company Accenture to conduct a full-scale audit of its technology systems, following two major IT outages that have disrupted operations in recent months. The airline said the independent review will assess its entire technology ecosystem — including systems, standards, and operational processes — as part of a broader effort to strengthen reliability and prevent future breakdowns.The decision comes on the heels of a massive system failure last week that grounded flights for eight hours, disrupting travel for more than 49,000 passengers and forcing the cancellation of over 400 flights across Alaska Airlines and its regional carrier Horizon Air. The incident was reportedly so severe that it prompted the airline to postpone its scheduled quarterly earnings call.According to the Seattle-based carrier, the outage stemmed from a failure at its primary data center and was not the result of a cybersecurity breach. In a new regulatory filing, Alaska said that it does not plan to reschedule the third-quarter earnings call and will instead issue updated fourth-quarter guidance in early December, after assessing the full financial impact of the IT disruptions.The company faced a similar outage in July, when a malfunction in a “critical piece of hardware” at one of its data centers led to an estimated $12 million hit to earnings, or about $0.10 per share.Alaska noted that it has increased its IT infrastructure spending by nearly 80% since 2019, investing in redundant data centers and migrating customer-facing systems to cloud-based platforms. The airline operates a hybrid technology model, combining its own data centers with third-party cloud services.The airline said the new audit aims to identify system vulnerabilities and establish stronger safeguards to ensure operational resilience moving forward.","Alaska Airlines has hired global consulting company Accenture to conduct a full- scale audit of its technology systems.

What triggered fall in Mark Zuckerberg's ranking on Billionaires Index

So, if there are 'Two Words' that are responsible for $29 billion-plus wipe out in Mark Zuckerberg's wealth, they are 'Capital Expenditure' or CAPEX. In simple words, Capex or Capital Expenditure, is the money a company spends to acquire, upgrade, or maintain its long-term physical assets, such as buildings, machinery, and equipment.

Amazon and Google founders beat Mark Zuckerberg





This week saw Facebook-parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg fall from third to fifth place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The plunge happened after Meta’ stock fell 11% on Thursday, October 30, wiping out $29.2 billion from Zuckerberg's fortune in just one day. The drop was the fourth-largest one-day market-driven loss ever recorded by Bloomberg’s wealth index.The 41-year-old CEO’s net worth fell to $235.2 billion, his lowest ranking in nearly two years, as investors recoiled from Meta’s plan to issue $30 billion in new debt to fund artificial intelligence spending, according to Bloomberg.Meta has forecast ""notably larger"" Capital Expenses next year (2026), thanks to investments in artificial intelligence, including aggressively building data centers to power its AI push. Wall Street is just not happy with the company's spending spree, resulting in almost 10% fall in its stock value.The Facebook and Instagram parent reported third-quarter revenue growth of 26% that beat market estimates, but that jump was outpaced by a 32% increase in costs. The company announced that it would raise its total expense forecast for 2025 to as much as $118 billion — including up to $72 billion in capital expenditures — to expand its AI infrastructure, with even higher spending anticipated in 2026. The staggering outlay triggered at least two analyst downgrades, with some warning that Meta’s AI ambitions could squeeze profits.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been overtaken by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Google co-founder Larry Page in the global billionaire rankings, marking a sharp reversal from earlier this year when he was closing in on the top spots held by Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Zuckerberg, whose net worth skyrocketed by $57 billion in the first half of the year amid a 28% rise in Meta shares, now trails behind as competitors capitalize on booming AI and cloud sectors.Tesla's Elon Musk remains firmly entrenched at No. 1, with Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison in second place. The shift highlights the beneficiaries of recent market gains: Jeff Bezos and Larry Page rode waves of strong corporate earnings that propelled their companies' stock prices higher. Amazon shares have jumped more than 30% since April, fueled by renewed investor confidence in its cloud-computing division, AWS, which has secured major deals with AI startups like Anthropic. Similarly, Alphabet -- Google's parent company -- saw its stock climb 2.5% following better-than-expected third-quarter revenue, driven by robust demand for its cloud and AI services.Compounding Meta's challenges, the company's $30 billion bond sale -- the largest investment -- grade offering of 2025—was intended to fund ambitious investments in AI, data centers, and metaverse initiatives. Instead, it has ignited concerns among investors that the social media giant is overextending itself financially at a time when rivals are gaining traction in AI-powered advertising.","Mark Zuckerberg has been overtaken by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Google co- founder Larry Page in the global billionaire rankings.

What is Golden Dome







SpaceX is reportedly slated to receive $2 billion in federal funding to develop a massive network of satellites capable of tracking missiles and aircraft. The system is being funded under President Donald Trump’s ambitious Golden Dome project, a report has claimed, adding that the funding was secretly included in a tax-and-spending bill signed by President Trump in July, with the allocation not publicly tied to a specific contractor at the time.Citing people familiar with the matter, The Wall Street Journal reported that the planned “air moving target indicator” system may eventually field as many as 600 satellites, marking another expansion of the Elon Musk-led company's influence in US national security efforts.The report said that SpaceX is expected to secure major roles in two other classified Pentagon satellite networks:Milnet: This network would be dedicated to relaying sensitive military communications.Ground Tracking: A separate fleet of satellites capable of tracking vehicles on the ground.The traction SpaceX has gained with these future satellite fleets underscores the company’s increasing importance within the US national security apparatus, the report said, pointing out that despite the growing reliance on SpaceX, government officials noted that some of Musk's past actions – such as his threat to decommission a spacecraft transporting NASA astronauts to the International Space Station – have reinforced the need to ensure several contractors support critical national-security operations in space.Government officials have described Golden Dome as a complex defense system intended to act as a missile shield, capable of tracking and potentially destroying missiles before they hit their targets. The Pentagon has released few specifics about the shield's operational architecture.Major contracts for Golden Dome have not yet been formally awarded, as defense officials finalise spending plans. Lawmakers and industry executives anticipate more details from the Pentagon in the coming weeks.A Pentagon spokesperson declined to comment on SpaceX's involvement, stating, “We do not provide details relating to specifics of architectural discussion or predecisional matters.”",SpaceX is reportedly slated to receive $2 billion in federal funding to develop a massive network of satellites capable of tracking missiles and aircraft.

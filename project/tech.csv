"How Google Calendar gave away information about a DOGE staffer’s connections with NASA, Elon Musk’s Tesla and tech job hunt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-calendar-gave-away-information-about-a-doge-staffers-connections-with-nasa-elon-musks-tesla-and-tech-job-hunt/articleshow/118810051.cms,"Recruitment details in DOGE, Tesla may have been leaked

A senior advisor at NASA who is part of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative maintained a publicly accessible Google Calendar that revealed his connections to the programme and scheduled job interviews at companies including Tesla, Palantir and Anduril, a report has said.According to a report by Business Insider, 26-year-old Riley Sennott appears in an internal NASA directory as a “senior advisor” in the administrator's suite at headquarters and is also involved with DOGE.Apparently, unlike many DOGE workers who have deleted their LinkedIn profiles and made social media accounts private in recent months, Sennott failed to secure his Google Calendar, which was linked to his personal email address. Anyone with the address could view his appointments dating back to 2016, the report added.The publication claimed that the calendar contained entries, including a January 6 meeting titled ""Riley Sennott and DOGE Recruiting,"" which came from a Gmail address apparently used by DOGE for recruitment purposes, essentially providing rare insight into the group's hiring process, which has remained largely secretive despite advertising open positions.Another significant calendar entry from January 17 showed Sennott was scheduled to attend a ""SGE ethics discussion."" SGE reportedly stands for ""special government employee,"" a designation reportedly used for Elon Musk.Sennott's calendar suggests potential connections to Tesla, with several scheduled meetings with Tesla employees and references to “a rotating project-based role.” His private X account bio describes him as “energy @tesla.”The calendar also documented Sennott's apparent job search activities, including interviews with major tech firms throughout 2024.These included a scheduled Zoom call about a “venture role” with Founders Fund (an early SpaceX investor), a “recruiter call” with Peter Thiel's Palantir, an “Opportunity Chat” with defense technology company Anduril, and recent meetings with partners at venture capital firm Thrive Capital.","Riley Sennott, 26, appears in an internal NASA directory as a ‘senior advisor’ in the administrator's suite at headquarters.

"Champions Trophy 2025 Final winner is ... India or New Zealand: What AI chatbots ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Elon Musk's Grok predict on the D-Day",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/champions-trophy-2025-final-winner-is-india-or-new-zealand-what-ai-chatbots-chatgpt-google-gemini-and-elon-musks-grok-predict-on-the-d-day/articleshow/118810313.cms,"Led by Rohit Sharma, India clinched four wins from as many matches — despite losing all the tosses.

Google Gemini says: India is the likely winner

Based on the information available, the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 final is between India and New Zealand, and it's being held at the Dubai International Stadium. Here's a summary of what I found:

The Final Match:

The final is between India and New Zealand.

It's taking place at the Dubai International Stadium.

The match is on Sunday, March 9, 2025.

Predictions:

Many AI sources are predicting that India is the likely winner, citing their strong batting lineup and recent performance in ICC tournaments.

However, it is important to remember that cricket is a sport, and anything can happen.

To get the most up to date information, it would be best to follow live sports news during the match.

Essentially, while India is favored, the outcome of any sporting event is never guaranteed.

ChatGPT says: India is favoured to win

The 2025 ICC Champions Trophy final is scheduled for today, March 9, at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, featuring India and New Zealand. Both teams have demonstrated exceptional performances throughout the tournament, setting the stage for a thrilling conclusion.

India's Performance and Strengths:

Unbeaten Run: India enters the final as the tournament's only unbeaten team, having secured victories in all their matches, including a notable win against New Zealand in the group stage.

Key Players: The team has been bolstered by the outstanding form of players like Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill. Kohli's recent performances have been pivotal in India's batting lineup, while Gill's consistency at the top order has provided solid starts.

Spin Advantage: The conditions in Dubai have historically favored spin bowling, and India's spinners, particularly Kuldeep Yadav, have exploited these conditions effectively throughout the tournament.

New Zealand's Performance and Strengths:

Resilient Journey: New Zealand has showcased resilience and adaptability, culminating in a significant semi-final victory against South Africa. Their journey to the final reflects their ability to perform under pressure.

Key Players: Kane Williamson's leadership and form have been instrumental in guiding the team, while Rachin Ravindra's contributions with the bat have added depth to their lineup.

Balanced Attack: New Zealand's bowling unit, featuring effective spinners like Mitchell Santner, has been adept at exploiting varying pitch conditions, making them a well-rounded side.

Conclusion:

While India is favored to win the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy final, New Zealand's resilience and strategic prowess ensure that the match will be a closely contested affair. Cricket enthusiasts worldwide can anticipate an exciting and unpredictable finale.

Elon Musk's Grok: India is a strong favorite

As of today, March 9, 2025, the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 final is set to take place later today in Dubai between India and New Zealand. Predicting the winner involves looking at current form, key players, and tournament progress so far, but no definitive outcome can be stated until the match concludes.

India has been a dominant force in the tournament, reaching the final after defeating Australia in the first semi-final on March 4 in Dubai. Their batting lineup, featuring stars like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, has been in top form, while their bowling attack, led by Mohammed Shami and supported by spinners like Kuldeep Yadav, has been highly effective. India’s consistent performance in ICC events and their unbeaten streak in Dubai during this tournament make them strong favorites according to many experts and betting odds prior to the knockout stages.

New Zealand, on the other hand, secured their spot in the final with a clinical victory over South Africa in the second semi-final on March 5 in Lahore. Known for their tactical approach and resilience, the Kiwis have relied on players like Kane Williamson and Matt Henry, the latter leading the wicket charts with 10 scalps. Their ability to perform under pressure in knockout matches adds to their credibility as contenders, though they face a formidable challenge against India’s depth.

Given the information available:

India’s form, depth, and historical success in the Champions Trophy (winners in 2013 and joint winners in 2002) tilt predictions in their favor.

New Zealand’s consistency in reaching ICC finals and their balanced squad make them a serious threat, but they are often seen as underdogs against powerhouses like India.

While I can’t predict the future with certainty, based on current tournament dynamics and expert sentiment, India appears to have the edge heading into the final. However, cricket is unpredictable, and New Zealand’s knack for upsets could turn the tide. The result will be clear by the end of March 9, 2025—check back after the match for the confirmed winner!

Champions Trophy 2025 final to be played between India and New Zealand is now less than 24 hours away. The Final Match of Champions Trophy 2025 will be played at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday, March 9. Excitement and Nervousness is in the air, as Indian cricket fans have their all eyes set on what promises to be a high-stakes final. The Indian team is undefeated in the tournament so far, and the Kiwis have looked rock solid with bat and ball. India's Men in Blue would like to avenge losses to the Blackcaps in the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup semifinal and 2021 ICC World Test Championship final.As Indian Cricket fans across the country -- or rather globe -- await their team to bring the Champions Trophy home, Times of India Tech took some of the popular AI chatbots for a spin and asked the outcome of Champions Trophy 2025 Final. Here's what ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Elon Musk's Grok predict on the 'Match Day'.","The ICC Champions Trophy 2025 final is between India and New Zealand.

"How Jim Walker, the man who saw 2008 Stock Market crash coming, may have just 'agreed' with Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath's 'Stock Market Gyaan'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-jim-walker-the-man-who-saw-the-2008-stock-market-crash-coming-may-have-just-agreed-with-zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamaths-stock-market-gyaan/articleshow/118727832.cms,"Jim Walker to investors: Take long-term investment approach

Jim Walker picks India over China

Indian stock markets witnessed Bears onslaught in the month of February, with the benchmark Sensex closing over 4,000 points lower. The carnage witnessed in the market during the month led to a staggering erosion of over Rs 40 lakh crore from the market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies; while Nifty 50 marked its longest losing streak since its inception in the year 1996. The relentless downward trend has left retail investors anxious. In a message to investors late earlier this week, Zerodha founder and CEO Nithin Kamath termed the fall as ""the first real market correction "" since Covid pandemic.""Markets are cyclical, and given the way our markets went up from late 2020, this fall was inevitable,"" he said. Kamath told investors to not get carried away by the doom and gloom in the market and continue investing in SIPs. ""I don't know how good the data is, but it seems like the number of investors stopping their SIPs has gone up. This is the wrong thing to do. What an SIP helps you do is to average your investments across different market cycles,"" he said.A similar sentiment comes from Jim Walker, a celebrated economist from Alethia Capital who famously foresaw the 2008 financial crisis. In an exclusive interaction with ETNow, Walker gave perspective on the current state of the global economy and what he thinks about India. Contrary to widespread concerns that today’s market exuberance might precipitate a collapse akin to that of 2008, Walker holds a different view.Speaking with ETNow, he acknowledged a global economic slowdown but stressed that the circumstances differ markedly from those preceding the financial debacle over ten years ago. Similar to Nithin Kamath, Walker batted for a long-term investment approach. Walker encouraged his clients to boost their stakes in India, despite valuation concerns in its stock market. “I’ve advised clients this week to significantly increase their investments in India. Though stock valuations raise eyebrows, I believe economic growth will soon justify them with strong corporate earnings,” he elaborated.Known for his prescient 2006-07 warning of a looming U.S. housing market crash, Walker remarked that today’s danger signals are less evident. “The signs were glaring in 2006-07 when we predicted a severe downturn driven by excesses in the property sector; it’s not the same now,” he said.He pointed out that unlike the lead-up to 2008, there are currently no significant overindulgences in the housing or financial sectors poised to spark a major banking crisis. Although certain areas show excessive stock market gains and asset price inflation, Walker believes these won’t lead to widespread corporate failures that could rattle the banking system. “We’re not seeing the kind of corporate collapses that impacted banks in 2008. That’s not on the horizon,” he observed.Additionally, Walker expressed a stronger preference for investing in India over China, suggesting it might be an opportune moment to increase investments there. He is especially sanguine about India’s prospects, citing its robust policy environment—the best in three decades—as a key factor enhancing its appeal to investors. “India’s policy stability and certainty are at their peak in the last 30 years,” he asserted, crediting solid monetary and fiscal policies along with exchange rate stability for bolstering India’s economic structure.He also praised the Indian government’s efforts in deregulation and improving business conditions, which he views as catalysts for future growth. By supporting small and medium enterprises, Walker believes India will spur further economic and job growth.",Jim Walker picks India over China as a good place to invest in the stock market.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat. In the post, Altman wrote “very proud of the openai team for what is perhaps the most impressive scientific/technical breakthrough of recent decades…thought that was the thing i'd always be most proud of in life”. Adding further, he wrote “turns out i am now more proud of a preemie baby for learning how to eat on his own!”.In a follow-up post, Altman wrote “i realize i am getting neurochemically hacked here but idc, it's the best)”.Sam Altman welcomed his baby boy last month with his partner and software engineer Oliver Mulherin. The baby arrived prematurely and has been receiving care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).In another news, the CEO shared an update about the company’s latest version of the large language model (LLM), GPT-4.5 . In an X post, Altman announced that GPT-4.5 is expected to roll out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers. However, he noted that the update will be a staggered rollout over several days to manage high demand and ensure a smooth user experience.Altman also explained that launching with a low rate limit would restrict usage and prevent users from having meaningful interactions with the new model. The staggered release will allow users to have longer conversations with GPT-4.5, even if it means some subscribers will have to wait a bit longer to access it.In his X announcement, Altman wrote: “We are likely going to roll out GPT-4.5 to the plus tier over a few days. There is no perfect way to do this; we wanted to do it for everyone tomorrow, but it would have meant we had to launch with a very low rate limit.

Come April 1 of Fiscal Year 2026-27, a new rule in the Income Tax Act law may grant the Income Tax department powers to access your social media accounts or emails in case they suspect tax evasion . Income Tax Bill 2025, which was introduced in the Parliament recently, will give Income Tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces, termed Virtual Digital Spaces in the bill. This means that the Income Tax department can break into social media accounts, personal emails, bank accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, and more if they have any reason to believe that you own any undisclosed income, money, Gold, Jewelry, or valuable item or property on which you haven’t paid applicable Income Tax.Presently, Section 132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, allows Income Tax officials to seize assets and books during search operations if they find sufficient reasons to believe that an individual is in possession of undisclosed income or assets. The changes in the bill, once passed in the Parliament, will extend this authourity to the digital realm, allowing officials to bypass security measures on computer systems and virtual spaces.The Clause 247 of the Income Tax Bill outlines this expanded power, stating that officers can “break open the lock of any door, box, locker, safe, almirah, or other receptacle” or “gain access by overriding the access code” to computer systems or virtual digital spaces when access is otherwise unavailable. This applies if they believe an individual possesses undisclosed income or assets taxable under the law.According to the bill, the term Virtual Digital Space includes email servers, social media accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, banking accounts, and any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset. It further adds that virtual digital space is an environment, area or realm that is constructed and experienced through computer technology and not the physical, tangible world, which encompasses any digital realm that allows users to interact, communicate and perform activities using computer systems, computer networks, computer resources, communication devices, cyberspace, internet, worldwide web and emerging technologies, using data and information in the electronic form for creation, storage or exchange and includes:* Email servers* Social media account* Online investment account, trading account, banking account, etc* Any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset* Remote server or cloud servers* Digital application platforms* Any other space of similar natureAs to who all can wield this authority? The bill designates “authorised officers” as senior tax officials, including Joint Directors, Additional Directors, Joint Commissioners, Additional Commissioners, Assistant or Deputy Directors, Assistant or Deputy Commissioners, Income Tax Officers, and Tax Recovery Officers.What does this mean for individuals? The new rules significantly widen the scope of tax investigations, giving officials the ability to probe deeply into personal and financial digital footprints. As this provision takes effect, it raises questions about privacy and the balance between tax enforcement and individual rights.","Income Tax Bill 2025 will give Income Tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces.

Apple Intelligence: ‘One of the biggest’ AI features for iPhones is delayed till 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-intelligence-one-of-the-biggest-ai-features-for-iphones-is-delayed-till-2026/articleshow/118805663.cms,"Apple Intelligence features

Apple has reportedly delayed the launch of its more personalised Siri features, citing the need for further development. In its initial WWDC 2024 announcement, Apple said the development of a more conversational Siri is underway and will come to iPhone next year, suggesting a spring release in 2025. However, an Apple spokesperson has confirmed the delay, saying the features, which include enhanced personal context awareness and cross-app actions, will now roll out ""in the coming year.""Company spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told about the delay in a statement to Daring Fireball (via The Verge):Siri helps our users find what they need and get things done quickly, and in just the past six months, we’ve made Siri more conversational, introduced new features like type to Siri and product knowledge, and added an integration with ChatGPT. We’ve also been working on a more personalized Siri , giving it more awareness of your personal context, as well as the ability to take action for you within and across your apps. It’s going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year.Last year, Apple announced AI-driven features under Apple Intelligence. These features included capabilities such as rewriting emails and summarising emails and inbox.According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple executives, including software boss Craig Federighi, “voiced strong concerns internally that the features didn’t work properly — or as advertised — in their personal testing.”Gurman also says that people in Apple’s AI division “believe that work on the features could be scrapped altogether” and that the features may have to be rebuilt “from scratch.”This comes as Gurman claimed that a “true modernised, conversational version of Siri” might not arrive until iOS 20 “at best.”","Apple has reportedly delayed the launch of its more personalised Siri features.

"Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu has same 'warning' for China that Elon Musk made to Singapore, Japan and South Korea",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zoho-ceo-sridhar-vembu-has-same-warning-for-china-that-elon-musk-made-to-singapore-japan-and-south-korea/articleshow/118801724.cms,"Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu

What Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu wrote on China

As Prof Pettis explains, the Chinese private sector suffers from ""neijuan"" - extreme predatory competition driven by and driving over-investment. Lacking domestic income to consume their production, they are driven to seek export markets just to keep their operations alive. This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates.

Japan suffered from this same problem in the 1980s and 90s. What appeared to the outside world as ""Japanese brands everywhere"" really was about ""too many companies, funded with cheap loans, desperately fighting it out in the global market"".

In one sense Japan never really recovered, their companies lost their drive as their workforce aged (decades of ultra low birth rates do that to you) and then Korea/China took over from them. Japan achieved ""Karoshi"" - death due to overwork - on a civilizational scale.

As an aside, we have seen that in silicon valley too - for example in Saas business and now in AI. Unlike in Japan and China, where bank and government backed loans dominated the investment, in silicon valley it was VC and PE. Over-investment leads to too many companies chasing too few customers. Marketing spending goes through the roof and there is no real profit (you do get ""profit when we don't count the expenses we push to shareholders"" stuff).

Globalization of the past 40 years has been driven by infinitely stretchable balance sheets at every level but the imbalances have reached such an extreme that they can no longer be ignored. These trade wars didn't happen out of the blue.

What is the alternative?

We have to embrace economic balance - production and consumption balanced regionally, which means production balanced by real income to consume the production regionally.

We have to question the entire premise of this era of massive imbalances-led globalization. We need fresh thinking.

Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu has kinda same warning for China as, Elon Musk had for Singapore, Japan and South Korea. Elon Musk has often warned about declining populations in several Asian countries, including Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Elon Musk even went on to say that Singapore is particularly at risk due to its falling birth rate and is almost on the verge of extinction. In a warning post some time back, Elon Musk wrote, “Singapore will go extinct in some time.” Elon Musk has expressed similar concern about South Korea and Japan.Zoho CEO Vembu in a post on Twitter said that the '996' culture strogly getting popular in China simply mean ever sinking birth rates. ""As Prof Pettis explains, the Chinese private sector suffers from ""neijuan"" - extreme predatory competition driven by and driving over-investment.

He wrote, how he did not see children playing in parks in and around SF bay area. ""I visited the SF bay area this week, staying near the Apple HQ, an area of beautiful multi-million dollar homes, well maintained parks - but hardly any young children roaming the wide open residential streets (hardly any traffic) or playing in the parks.

Facebook-parent Meta’s former executive Sarah Wynn-Williams accuses CEO Mark Zuckerberg of being ‘careless’ in her book,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebook-parent-metas-former-executive-sarah-wynn-williams-accuses-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-of-being-careless-in-her-book/articleshow/118800426.cms,"What Meta said about these allegations



“We haven’t seen the book, but this former employee was terminated in 2017 and an investigation at that time found she made false claims. As Mark himself said in a televised address in 2019, ‘[He] wanted our services in China … and worked hard to make this happen. But we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there.’ That is why we don’t operate our services in China today.”

What the book’s publishers said



Other allegations the book made against Meta



Facebook-parent Meta's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is a ""careless"" executive, a new book alleges. The memoir, ""Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism"" written by former Meta employee Sarah Wynn-Williams, accuses Zuckerberg of prioritizing entering the Chinese market, developing censorship tools and helping China's AI to gain market access. In her book, Wynn-Williams also claims these efforts were concealed from the US Congress. Moreover, the book further describes Meta having a “rotten company culture” under Zuckerberg and ex-COO Sheryl Sandberg, who is also accused of ""shocking accounts of misogyny and double standards.""The book even portrays Zuckerberg and Sandberg as “callously indifferent” to the consequences of their pursuit of enrichment. Wynn-Williams, who was Director of Global Public Policy at Facebook until 2018, details these accusations in her book.In a statement to the New York Post, a Meta spokesperson said:Publisher Flatiron Books describes the book as “a deeply personal account of why and how things have gone so horribly wrong in the past decade,” and it claims to expose the inner workings of Meta’s leadership and culture.The book’s UK publisher, Pan Macmillan called it “an explosive dispatch from someone who had a front-row seat to the inner workings of one of the most influential companies on the planet.”Wynn-Williams “takes readers inside Meta’s board rooms, private jets, and meetings with heads of state, revealing the appetites, excesses, blind spots, and priorities of executives Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and Joel Kaplan,” Pan Macmillan described.According to the publisher, these executives have been portrayed as “profoundly flawed, self-interested, and careless human beings,” and as they accumulated power, “the less responsible they became, with far-reaching consequences that continue to this day.”The book also details “previously unreported lengths to which Mark Zuckerberg went to convince the Chinese Communist Party to allow Meta to operate in China.”These efforts reportedly involved “providing briefings to CCP officials on new technologies like artificial intelligence, developing bespoke censorship tools with the CCP, and making efforts to hide Meta’s cooperation with the CCP from the United States Congress,” the memoir noted.Wynn-Williams criticises the company for failing to halt “genocide-fueling lies” overseas and for “shocking accounts of workplace harassment and misogyny.”The book even singles out Sandberg for not addressing “the grueling demands and humiliations of working motherhood” even as she was winning “international acclaim for urging women to ‘Lean In.’”The release of the book was kept under wraps, with Flatiron announcing it less than a week before publication and Amazon initially listing it under the placeholder title “Untitled-Flatiron-Author-Revealed-March.”Additionally, the memoir even notes that Zuckerberg has made multiple attempts to expand Facebook’s presence in China despite the country's strict internet regulations.","Former Meta employee Sarah Wynn-Williams has written a memoir, ""Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism"" The book claims Meta's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is a ""careless"" executive.

""When women are at the forefront of decision-making in organisations, whether as creators, innovators, or leaders, business results follow,"" Dasgupta stated. However, she pointed out the stark reality of India's workforce participation rate for women, which remains at a mere 40.3%. ""The challenge isn’t a lack of talent—it’s the systemic barriers that limit access and opportunities.""Dasgupta's comments come at a time when the tech industry is increasingly recognizing the importance of diversity and inclusion. She stressed the need for concrete actions beyond mere acknowledgment. ""As an industry, tech leaders need to continue to elevate and invest in women by creating leadership opportunities, mentorship, and support systems that enable them to thrive.""HP India , under Dasgupta's leadership, is taking significant strides in this direction. ""At HP India, one of our key strategies has been to focus on hiring, retaining, and investing in women,"" she revealed. This commitment has resulted in women now comprising one-third of their workforce, a substantial increase from ""the low double digits not long ago.""A key initiative driving this change is HP India's ""Disha"" program, which focuses on enhancing leadership skills for high-potential women, empowering them to advance in their careers. Dasgupta highlighted the tangible results of this investment, stating, ""I’m especially proud that our Supplies product team, Growth, and Strategy teams are led by women – proof that when you invest in women, they rise.""Beyond internal initiatives, Dasgupta believes in the power of advocacy. ""It’s incumbent on us to actively advocate and champion female talent, encourage them to take risks and be vocal for opportunities,"" she asserted. She emphasized that the future of technology is inextricably linked to the inclusion of women's diverse perspectives and leadership. ""The future of technology needs women’s ideas, perspectives, and leadership, and it’s on all of us to make that future a reality.” Dasgupta's message resonates with a growing understanding that empowering women in tech is not just a matter of social justice, but a strategic imperative for innovation and economic growth.","Ipsita Dasgupta, Senior Vice President and Managing Director, India Market, HP Inc, has emphasized the critical role of women in driving business success.

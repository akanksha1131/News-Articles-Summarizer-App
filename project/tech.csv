White House AI czar David Sacks has defended Donald Trump administration’s approach to China. In a recent interview on Bloomberg Television, he said that it was essential for the US to dominate artificial intelligence, seeking to rebuff criticism from advocates of a harder line with China. He went on to add, “I want the US to win this AI race. We understand that China is our main competition globally in this AI race, and we want to do everything we can to win.”Taking aim at concerns raised by supporters of a tougher China policy, Sacks said, “I consider myself to be a China hawk.” Incidentally, this is the same phrase that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently called ""badge of shame"".According to a report in Global Times, on the tech podcast BG2, hosted by tech investors Brad Gerstner and Bill Gurley, Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang stated that some Americans wear the label of ""China hawks"" as a ""badge of honor."" In his view, however, it is a ""badge of shame"" and that their actions are not ""patriotic.""As per the report, Huang further remarked, ""I didn't hear about the phrase 'China hawks' until just a few years ago."" He went on to critique the mindset, saying, ""Apparently, if you are a 'China hawk,' you get to wear that label with pride. It's almost like a badge of honor. [But] it's a badge of shame. There's no question it's a badge of shame.On the podcast, Nvidia CEO once again made an urgent appeal to the American government on China. He said that allowing American technology companies to compete openly in China serves the best interests of both the countries. Huang highlighted the rapid advances and robust potential of China's chipmaking industry, cautioning that the country is ""nanoseconds behind"" the US. ""We’ve got to go compete,"" he asserted, pointing to China's deep talent pool, hustling work culture, and intense internal competition across its provinces. He described the environment as a ""vibrant, entrepreneurial, hi-tech, modern industry.""","White House AI czar David Sacks has defended Donald Trump administration’s approach to China.

With mass shootings a constant fear for parents and school administrators almost across the US, several States have spent the last decade investing in surveillance systems to monitor students' online activity. A recent incident in Florida showed this technology. A school monitoring system flagged a student after he asked ChatGPT for advice on how to kill his friend.The event unfolded when a school-issued computer flagged a concerning query made to OpenAI's ChatGPT. According to local police, the unnamed student asked the AI tool ""how to kill my friend in the middle of class."" The question immediately triggered an alert through the school's online surveillance system, which is operated by a company called Gaggle.According to a report in local NBC-affiliate WFLA, Volusia County Sheriff’s deputies responded to the school and interviewed the student. The teen reportedly told officers he was ""just trolling"" a friend who had annoyed him. However, law enforcement officials were not amused by the explanation. ""Another ‘joke’ that created an emergency on campus,"" the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office stated, urging parents to talk to their children about the consequences of such actions.The student was subsequently arrested and booked at a county jail, although the specific charges have not been publicly disclosed.This incident is said to be the latest example of a school district's increasing reliance on surveillance technology to monitor students' digital activity in the wake of rising mass shootings. Gaggle, which provides safety services to school districts nationwide, describes its system as a tool for flagging ""concerning behavior tied to self-harm, violence, bullying, and more."" The company’s website indicates that its monitoring software filters for keywords and gains ""visibility into browser use, including conversations with AI tools such as Google Gemini, ChatGPT, and other platforms. ""This event comes as chatbots and other AI tools are increasingly appearing in criminal cases, often in relation to mental health. The rise of ""AI psychosis,"" where individuals with mental health issues have their delusions exacerbated by interactions with chatbots, has become a growing concern, with some recent suicides also being linked to the technology.","A Florida student was arrested after he asked an AI tool for advice on how to kill his friend.

LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky recently said that the future of work will not belong to people with the “fanciest degrees” but to those who are adaptable, forward thinking, eager to learn, and ready to embrace artificial intelligence (AI). Speaking at a fireside chat at the company’s San Francisco office, Roslansky said this shift marks a major change in what employers value.“I think the mindset shift is probably the most exciting thing because my guess is that the future of work belongs not anymore to the people that have the fanciest degrees or went to the best colleges, but to the people who are adaptable, forward thinking, ready to learn, and ready to embrace these tools,” Ryan Roslansky said.He further added that this new outlook opens opportunities for more people. “It really kind of opens up the playing field in a way that I think we’ve never seen before.”Roslansky also highlighted the importance of human qualities alongside AI skills. “I believe that the human component to all of this is quite frankly going to be most people’s secret weapon. So, empathy, communication, adaptability, being able to actually just have a conversation with someone.Don’t forget the human skills. Those are critical to being successful in anything that you’re trying to do moving forward. ”During the event, the LinkedIn CEO also said that he relies on AI for nearly every important email he sends to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, describing the technology as essential for high-stakes communication with his boss and other world leaders.“A lot of the time when I'm sending a super high-stakes email to Satya Nadella or other CEOs or world leaders, you've got to make sure you sound super smart when you do that,” Roslansky said.The CEO further clarified that he doesn't use AI to write entire emails from scratch. Instead, the technology serves as an interactive writing partner that guides him through a step-by-step process, asking questions to help determine the best approach for each response.","LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky recently said that the future of work will not belong to people with the “fanciest degrees” but to those who are adaptable, forward thinking, eager to learn, and ready to embrace artificial intelligence (AI) He said he relies on AI for nearly every important email he sends to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124342648,imgsize-23952,width-400,resizemode-4/ryan-roslansky.jpg"

What OpenAI deal means for AMD







AMD and OpenAI have announced a multi-year agreement wherein the ChatGPT-maker will get hundreds of thousands of AI chips from Nvidia-rival, potentially generating tens of billions in annual revenue. The deal also offers OpenAI an option to acquire up to 10% of the US-based semiconductor company.The agreement encompasses the deployment of hundreds of thousands of AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) equivalent to six gigawatts of computing power, with deliveries beginning in the second half of 2026. OpenAI plans to construct a one-gigawatt facility using AMD's upcoming MI450 chip series starting next year, with AMD expecting to recognise revenue at that time.“We view this deal as certainly transformative, not just for AMD, but for the dynamics of the industry,” AMD Forrest Norrod, executive vice president, told Reuters.AMD executives project the agreement will generate tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue – the company anticipates more than $100 billion in new revenue over four years from OpenAI and other customers who follow suit.Meanwhile, as part of the arrangement, AMD issued a warrant granting OpenAI the right to purchase up to 160 million AMD shares at 1 cent each throughout the duration of the chip deal.The initial lot will become available after the first MI450 chip shipment in late 2026. Subsequent tranches unlock when AMD's stock reaches specific price targets, escalating to $600 per share for the final installment.The deal positions AMD as a more formidable competitor to Nvidia, the dominant player in AI processors. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated the AMD partnership will help the company build sufficient AI infrastructure to meet its expanding needs.In September, Nvidia announced its own investment of up to $100 billion in OpenAI, including plans to supply at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems.

I am moved by music I did not create myself. When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive. I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.

"Lawsuit filed against Donald Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee hike, 4 biggest complaints it makes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/lawsuit-filed-against-donald-trumps-100000-h-1b-visa-fee-hike-4-biggest-complaints-it-makes/articleshow/124307279.cms,"H-1B restrictions are backfiring: Here’s how India became the new innovation hub

Here's the press release on the lawsuit by the organisation:

* Defies Congress:

* Invites chaos and favoritism:

* Hurts communities nationwide:

* Undermines the economy:

What Trump's H-1B visa fee order says





A coalition of labor unions, health care providers, schools, and religious organizations has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump ’s executive order increasing H-1B visa fee. The lawsuit claims the increase in visa fee to the anti-immigration power grab: A sweeping executive action that slaps an unlawful new $100,000 price tag on every new H-1B application. As per the press release issued by the association, the proclamation has already thrown employers, workers, and federal agencies into chaos. Plaintiffs are represented by Democracy Forward, Justice Action Center, South Asian American Justice Collaborative (SAAJCO), Kuck Baxter LLC, Joseph & Hall, P.C., and IMMpact Litigation.The H-1B visa program was created by Congress to provide a critical path for the United States to attract highly skilled professionals from around the world to fill urgent needs in the economy and public services to strengthen American innovation. Under the program, U.S. employers can hire qualified foreign talent — such as doctors, nurses, engineers, teachers, and researchers — after a rigorous review process.The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, challenges the order as unconstitutional and unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act. Plaintiffs include Global Nurse Force; Global Village Academy Collaborative; Society of the Divine Word; the Fathers of St.Charles; Church on the Hill; International Union; United Auto-Aerospace Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW International); UAW Local 4811; American Association of University Professors (AAUP); Committee of Interns and Residents, SEIU (CIR), a citizen of the United Kingdom residing in the Appalachia region, and a citizen of India residing in the Northern District of California.These plaintiffs represent medical residents, fellows, interns, and nurses serving rural and medically underserved communities, a school that relies on H-1B workers to serve their students, religious organizations that depend on the H-1B program to hire pastors and religious professionals that minister to underserved communities, major labor unions representing faculty and academic professionals and higher education members, and individual highly skilled workers whose careers and lives were upended overnight.When the government makes it prohibitively expensive or impossible for these professionals to come to America, or for current H-1B workers to transition to a more permanent status, entire communities lose — patients wait longer for care, students have fewer teachers, and local economies miss out on the innovation and jobs these experts create.The complaint details how the sudden $100,000 demand:The H-1B program has a carefully crafted fee and oversight system set by law. The President cannot rewrite it overnight or levy new taxes by proclamation.The order offers a vague “national interest” loophole with no clear standards for fee exemptions, opening the door to arbitrary, pay-to-play decisions.Rural hospitals warn they will be unable to keep needed doctors and nurses; schools say the unlawful fee is more than many teacher salaries; and nonprofit organizations and research institutions can’t absorb the significant expense. All will lose if they cannot utilize H-1B workers.Economists agree that H-1B workers create U.S. jobs and drive new industries. Forcing talent away means companies move operations—and good jobs—overseas. Without relief, hospitals will lose medical staff, churches will lose pastors, classrooms will lose teachers, and industries across the country risk losing key innovators.The suit asks the court to immediately block the order and restore predictability for employers and workers.In its order, Trump administration argued that the H-1B visa system was being abused to replace American workers with people willing to work for less money. The United States awards 85,000 H-1B visas per year on a lottery system. India accounts for around three-quarters of the recipients.","A coalition of labor unions, health care providers, schools, and religious organizations has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump ’s executive order increasing H-1B visa fee.

Here's CEO Satya Nadella's email to Microsoft employees on the restructuring:

We are in the midst of a tectonic AI platform shift, one that requires us to both manage and grow our at-scale commercial business today, while building the new frontier and executing flawlessly across both.

An image of Judson Althoff, chief executive officer of the commercial business at Microsoft.

History shows that general purpose technologies like AI drive step changes in productivity and GDP growth, and we have a unique opportunity to help our customers and the world realize this promise.

Our success depends on enabling commercial and public sector customers and partners to combine their human capital with new AI capabilities to change the frontier of how they operate. To accelerate this, we will increasingly need to bring together sales, marketing, operations, and engineering to drive growth and strengthen our position as the partner of choice for AI transformation.

With this context, I have asked Judson Althoff to take on an expanded role as CEO of our commercial business. Over the past nine years, Judson has led our global sales organization and was the architect behind designing and building Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions (MCAPS) into what it is today: the “number one seed” in the industry and our company’s most important growth engine.

Takeshi Numoto and his marketing team will join this new organization, with Takeshi reporting directly to Judson as CMO, while also continuing to report directly to me on all-up business models, planning, consumer marketing, and corporate brand and communications.

Our operations organization will also move to report to Judson. By bringing operations into the commercial business, we can tighten the feedback loop between what customers need and how we deliver and support them. Carolina Dybeck Happe will continue to report to me, as she works on our overall company transformation and continues to closely partner with Judson.

Additionally, Judson will lead a new commercial leadership team that brings together leaders from engineering, sales, marketing, operations, and finance to drive our product strategy and governance, GTM readiness, and sales motions with shared accountability for the rigor and executional excellence our customers expect.

This will also allow our engineering leaders and me to be laser focused on our highest ambition technical work—across our datacenter buildout, systems architecture, AI science, and product innovation—to lead with intensity and pace in this generational platform shift. Each one of us needs to be at our very best in terms of rapidly learning new skills, adopting new ways to work, and staying close to the metal to drive innovation across the entire stack!!

This isn’t just evolution, it’s reinvention, for each of us professionally and for Microsoft.

Microsoft is reorganizing its top leadership team, appointing longtime sales chief Judson Althoff to oversee marketing and operations in a move designed to allow CEO Satya Nadella and his engineering leaders to concentrate on technical innovation, particularly in artificial intelligence.In an email to employees on Wednesday, October 1, Nadella announced that Althoff will take on the new role of CEO of Microsoft's Commercial Business. This expanded position will also see him assume responsibility for the company's operations organization. Takeshi Numoto, Microsoft's Chief Marketing Officer, will join this new commercial business unit.According to Nadella's email, the shift will enable him to dedicate more time to the company's significant data center expansion, artificial intelligence, and product development.Althoff, who joined Microsoft in 2013, was previously the executive vice president and chief commercial officer. Before his time at Microsoft, he held senior sales positions at Oracle and EMC. The reorganization comes shortly after Althoff's return from an eight-week sabbatical.","Microsoft is reorganizing its top leadership team, appointing longtime sales chief Judson Althoff to oversee marketing and operations.

Microsoft discovers critical security flaw in software that prevents creation of deadly toxins or pathogens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-discovers-critical-security-flaw-in-software-that-prevents-creation-of-deadly-toxins-or-pathogens/articleshow/124341632.cms,"Representative Image

Science,

Microsoft warns how this flaw can be misused



The patch is incomplete, and the state of the art is changing.

But this isn’t a one-and-done thing. It’s the start of even more testing. We’re in something of an arms race.”





A team of Microsoft researchers have used artificial intelligence (AI) to discover a ""zero-day"" vulnerability in the biosecurity screening software. This software is designed to prevent the misuse of DNA to create deadly toxins or pathogens. The discovery, which was led by Microsoft’s chief scientist, Eric Horvitz, shows how AI can bypass existing protections in a way previously unknown to biosecurity defenders. The findings, published in the journalstated that the researchers focused on generative AI algorithms, the same types of programs that fuel drug discovery at major startups. This software has ""dual-use"" potential to generate both beneficial and harmful molecules. Microsoft initiated a ""red-teaming"" test in 2023 to assess whether ""adversarial AI protein design"" could aid bioterrorists in manufacturing hazardous proteins.To execute the attack, Microsoft used several generative protein models, including its own EvoDiff, to subtly redesign known toxins. This manipulation was predicted to preserve the deadly function while allowing the DNA sequence to bypass the biosecurity screening software used by commercial vendors.Microsoft confirmed that the exercise was entirely digital and that no toxic proteins were ever produced. Before publishing the results, the company alerted the US government and software makers, who have since patched their systems.However, the fix is not complete.

Growing concerns over privacy and mission creep





US Immigration and Customs Enforcement is moving forward with plans to establish a round-the-clock social media surveillance operation, hiring nearly 30 private contractors to monitor platforms including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X, YouTube, and Reddit for deportation leads, according to federal contracting documents reviewed by Wired.The surveillance program would operate from two ICE targeting centers—the National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center in Williston, Vermont, and the Pacific Enforcement Response Center in Santa Ana, California. Vermont would employ 12 contractors while California would host 16 staff members working in shifts to ensure 24/7 coverage.Contractors would face strict deadlines for processing cases, Wired reported. Urgent matters involving national security threats or individuals on ICE's Most Wanted list must be researched within 30 minutes, while high-priority cases require completion within one hour. The agency expects contractors to meet these deadlines in at least 75 percent of cases.The program would also incorporate artificial intelligence and provide analysts with commercial databases like LexisNexis Accurint and Thomson Reuters CLEAR, which compile property records, phone bills, and vehicle registrations into searchable profiles.ICE has allocated over $1 million annually for surveillance software subscriptions.Privacy advocates warn the surveillance could extend beyond immigration enforcement. The Electronic Privacy Information Center has sued ICE over its use of data brokers, calling it a ""significant threat to privacy and liberty."" The American Civil Liberties Union argues such bulk data purchases help ICE circumvent warrant requirements.This initiative follows other controversial ICE surveillance contracts, including a $2 million deal with Israeli spyware company Paragon and agreements with facial recognition firm Clearview AI. The agency's main database, built by Palantir Technologies, already uses algorithmic analysis to generate enforcement leads.ICE defends the program by stating that ""previous approaches which have not incorporated open web sources and social media information have had limited success."" The agency did not respond to Wired's request for comment.

Tim Cook won’t be the only one to retire, some other executives too may leave





Apple CEO Tim Cook may step down from his leadership role in the near future, with hardware engineering chief John Ternus positioned as the leading candidate to replace him, according to Mark Gurman's Power On newsletter for Bloomberg.Cook, who turns 65 next month, no longer has a clear second-in-command following Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams' departure earlier this year. Williams, once viewed as Cook's heir apparent, relinquished his operations duties in July and is preparing to exit the company.Ternus, 50, has emerged as the frontrunner for CEO—the same age Cook was when he assumed the role in 2011. Bloomberg's Gurman reports that Apple's PR and marketing teams have increasingly spotlighted Ternus, who recently introduced the iPhone Air and led customer events at Apple's Regent Street store in London, a ceremonial role Cook previously filled.The hardware engineering chief has expanded his influence beyond traditional responsibilities, becoming a key decision-maker on product roadmaps, features, and strategies across the company. His technical background could address Apple's struggles in emerging categories like mixed reality, generative AI, and smart home technology.Apple faces a significant changing of the guard beyond Cook's eventual departure.AI chief John Giannandrea's position remains uncertain after struggles with Apple Intelligence and Siri, with executives reportedly considering external candidates from companies like Meta to strengthen the AI division.Hardware technologies leader Johny Srouji is also evaluating his future, according to sources cited in the Power On newsletter, while environmental and government affairs chief Lisa Jackson has discussed retirement plans.When Cook does step down, he's expected to remain involved—potentially as board chairman, following the path of tech leaders like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. This continuity could prove crucial for the nearly $4 trillion company navigating both technological transitions and political relationships.","Apple CEO Tim Cook may step down from his leadership role in the near future, with hardware engineering chief John Ternus positioned as the leading candidate to replace him.

Donald Trump's H-1B visa fee hike: Why global tech startups outside US are ‘happy’ with new rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trumps-h-1b-visa-fee-hike-why-global-tech-startups-outside-us-are-happy-with-new-rules/articleshow/124340335.cms,"H-1B Visa Shock Explained: $100K Annual Fee Announced by Donald Trump

What founders and political leaders have to say



Some industry leaders are already seeing changes







The Trump administration’s stricter H-1B visa requirements are creating opportunities for technology companies outside the US, as international tech hubs position themselves to attract top-tier engineering talent previously bound for Silicon Valley, a report has said, citing senior employees of various UK and Canada-based tech startups.Last month, the White House unveiled significant changes to the H-1B visa program, which has long been the pathway for American tech companies to recruit talented foreign workers. The new measures include a proposed $100,000 application fee and more demanding salary thresholds for prospective workers.According to a report by The Financial Times, for founders like Husayn Kassai of London-based Quench.ai, an AI workplace solutions provider, the changes represent a watershed moment.“We were getting second league picks. These changes open a window to the top tier of talent,” Kassai explained.Not only the founders, political leaders across nations have been quick to recognise the competitive advantage. For example, UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced plans to streamline Britain's immigration system, including reduced visa fees, specifically to attract highly skilled workers.Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney characterised the H-1B fee increase as an “opportunity to attract people” who might have otherwise pursued careers in American tech centers like California or New York.However, some industry leaders are reportedly already observing tangible shifts. Arsham Ghahramani, co-founder of Toronto-based recruiting startup Ribbon, noted that roughly 40 percent of his team consists of workers who faced US visa complications.“Traditionally Canada was seen as a stopping point en route to the US. More people getting stuck here is great for us,” Ghahramani was quoted as saying.The impact extends beyond individual hiring decisions. Mikhail Sharonov, who leads Immigram, a UK-based relocation service specializing in tech workers, reported unprecedented demand: “Our call centre is currently overwhelmed” following the H-1B announcement.","Last month, the White House unveiled significant changes to the H-1B visa program.

Telegram founder and CEO Pavel Durov recently opened up about his arrest in August 2024 by French authorities. Speaking on the Lex Fridman Podcast, Durov said that “No country, not even an authoritarian one, did that to any tech leader”.“I arrived in France last year in August for a short two-day trip, and I see a dozen armed policemen asking me to follow them,” he said, adding “They read me a list of something like 15 serious crimes that I was accused of, which was mind-boggling.”During the podcast, Durov said that those involved in the investigation then demonstrated “very limited understanding” of how technology, encryption, and social media platforms work. Pavel Durov further stated that if the French government wished to resolve issues with Telegram, they would have reached through conventional diplomatic channels.He continued: “At first, I thought there must be some mistake. Then I realised they’re being serious and they’re accusing me of all possible crimes that the users of Telegram have allegedly committed, and they think I should be responsible”.To recall, Pavel Durov was arrested in August last year after French prosecutors charged him with six offenses, including ""complicity"" in distributing child sexual abuse material and drug trafficking.The French authorities then alleged that he enabled illegal activities to thrive on Telegram while declining to cooperate with authorities.In an X (formerly Twitter) post this year, Durov reaffirmed his commitment to user data privacy stating: “I’d rather die — no third party has access to private messages on Telegram”. Here’s the full post, Durov shared:“One year ago, the French police detained me for 4 days because some people I’d never heard of used Telegram to coordinate crimes. Arresting a CEO of a major platform over the actions of its users was not only unprecedented — it was legally and logically absurd.A year later, the ‘criminal investigation’ against me is still struggling to find anything that I or Telegram did wrong. Our moderation practices align with industry standards, and Telegram has always responded to every legally binding request from France.Ironically, I was arrested due to the French police’s own mistake: before August 2024, they ignored French and EU laws and hadn’t sent any of their queries to Telegram via the required legal process. They could have learned the correct procedure simply by googling it or asking.One year after this strange arrest, I still have to return to France every 14 days, with no appeal date in sight. So far, the only outcome of my arrest has been massive damage to France’s image as a free country. One thing is certain: we’ll keep fighting — and we will win ✊”","Telegram founder and CEO Pavel Durov recently opened up about his arrest in August 2024 by French authorities.

Not Just for Elon: More leaders could adopt the model



Cult of personality over marketing spend



Legal aggression and market polarization







Venture capitalist and Andreessen Horowitz cofounder Marc Andreessen feels that more corporate leaders can emulate Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s radical approach to leadership, especially in tech companies. As reported by Business Insider, speaking on Stripe cofounder John Collison’s podcast A Cheeky Pint, Andreessen mentioned that Elon Musk’s playbook diverges sharply from the traditional management models, such as those championed by former General Motors CEO Alfred P. Sloan. “Basically, number one, it’s only engineers,” Andreessen said. “The people who matter in your company are the engineers—the ones who understand the technical content of what you’re doing. You only ever talk to the engineers. You never ever ever talk to mid-level management.”Andreessen emphasised that Musk’s method needs an extraordinary grasp of engineering across disciplines, something few CEOs possess. His co-founder Ben Horowitz also argued that this approach assumes a leader like Musk can hold “the entirety of every engineering topic in their head.” But Andreessen believes there are more people capable of this than commonly assumed.“How many of those people exist? We know the answer is one. I believe the answer is 10 or a hundred or a thousand,” he said. “I tend to think we have more of those people than we think we do.”Another business tactic of Elon Musk which Andreessen really likes is the creation of a powerful personal brand which drives everything ranging from product launches to stock performance. “We’re not gonna spend any money on marketing. We’re not going to put any time into IR,” Andreessen said. “What we’re going to do is put on the show of all time.”Andreessen also explained Musk’s ‘cult of personality’ as a useful strategy. He feels that this idea of Musk radiates from every aspect of his companies ranging from books and videos to hiring and investor sentiment.Andreessen also praised Musk for its aggressive legal strategy. He believes that an aggressive legal strategy helps in creating a strong deterrent effect. “Anybody who goes up against us, we are going to terrorize, we are going to declare war,” he said. “We’re not always going to win all the wars, but we’re going to establish massive deterrence.”He further added that Musk’s “Anybody who goes up against us, we are going to terrorize, we are going to declare war,” he said. “We’re not always going to win all the wars, but we’re going to establish massive deterrence.”","Marc Andreessen feels that more corporate leaders can emulate Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s radical approach to leadership, especially in tech companies. “The people who matter in your company are the engineers—the ones who understand the technical content of what you’re doing,” he said.

Tesla’s humanoid robot, Optimus, has captured global attention with a remarkable demonstration of artificial intelligence (AI). Elon Musk shared a short video on X (formerly Twitter) showing Optimus practicing Kung Fu alongside a human trainer. The robot flawlessly mimics the trainer’s movements, executing precise blocks, changing stances, and maintaining perfect balance throughout the session.Unlike earlier models that required human assistance for basic actions, this demonstration confirms that Optimus can learn complex physical tasks independently. It highlights Tesla’s advancements in humanoid robotics, combining AI-driven learning with mechanical agility. Musk has emphasized that such capabilities allow Optimus to observe and acquire new skills autonomously, signaling a major leap forward in practical AI-powered robotic applications for both work and everyday life.In the viral video, Optimus begins with a friendly greeting to its human trainer, signaling a controlled start to the session. As the practice progresses, the robot replicates the trainer’s Kung Fu movements with remarkable accuracy.It executes blocks, shifts stances fluidly, and moves its arms in perfect coordination.What is most striking is how Optimus maintains balance and stability throughout the session. Unlike previous models, which struggled with smooth movement and coordination, Optimus performs complex maneuvers and returns to its resting pose seamlessly, demonstrating significant advancement in both mechanical engineering and AI control systems.When questioned on X about remote control, Elon Musk confirmed that Optimus was operating completely on AI, without any human guidance or teleoperation. This independence is a stark contrast to earlier demonstrations, where human intervention was necessary even for basic actions.For example, in earlier appearances, such as serving popcorn at the Tesla Diner, Optimus was revealed to be tele-operated, relying entirely on human control. The Kung Fu demonstration, by contrast, shows that the robot is now capable of learning and executing complex skills autonomously, making it a true AI-driven humanoid robot.Elon Musk has previously explained that Optimus can learn new tasks simply by observing humans. The robot has already demonstrated the ability to vacuum floors and sort objects by watching human behavior and even online videos, including YouTube tutorials.This capability, known as observational learning, allows Optimus to adapt to human environments and perform practical tasks without explicit programming for each movement. It represents a major step toward robots that can autonomously learn and assist in real-world settings. Musk envisions Optimus as a cornerstone of Tesla’s future growth. He has stated that nearly 80% of Tesla’s long-term value could eventually derive from its robotics division. To accelerate adoption, Tesla plans to ramp up production to 5,000 Optimus units by 2025, signaling the company’s ambition to make humanoid robots a significant part of both industrial and everyday life.The Kung Fu demonstration is more than a novelty—it’s a showcase of AI sophistication, physical agility, and Tesla’s long-term robotics strategy, signaling a future where humanoid robots could become central to both work and daily activities.","Tesla’s humanoid robot, Optimus, has captured global attention with a remarkable demonstration of artificial intelligence (AI) Elon Musk shared a short video on X (formerly Twitter) showing Optimus practicing Kung Fu alongside a human trainer.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has once again sparked conversation on X (formerly Twitter ), this time by voicing his dislike for QR codes. The tech billionaire posted online: “I hate QR codes. Such an eyesore” while responding to a user named Peter Imanuelsen – a Swedish journalist. “I'm never ordering from a QR code menu at a restaurant,” Imanuelsen wrote.QR code menus became popular during the pandemic, offering a touch-free way of viewing menus and ordering food. While many restaurants have continued using them for convenience and cost savings, they remain unpopular with a section of customers who prefer traditional printed menus.Elon Musk’s remarks quickly caught attention on the platform, with several users agreeing with him and others defending the use of QR codes as practical and efficient. Some argued that digital menus allow for quick updates without reprinting, while critics called them clunky, unattractive, and disruptive to the dining experience.“Do you have a better alternative? I find them convenient,” questioned a user. “What is the alternative?,” said another.“I think they are hilarious. My favorites are the ones on websites. It’s like, how am I supposed to scan this on my phone I am using to view this website?

Career advice: Skip consulting, guard your wallet







Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary credited Apple co-founder Steve Jobs with a productivity mindset which has helped him in transforming his approach towards business and life. In post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), O’ Leary revealed a simple but powerful strategy: focus on three essential tasks each day—and block out everything else.O’Leary recounted an advice by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. He mentioned that Jobs emphasised on the importance of identifying the ‘signal’ between daily distractions. “There are three things you have to get done today, and that’s the signal. Everything that stops you from doing that is the noise,” he wrote.He added, “There’s always somebody reaching out to you, or you wanna watch YouTube… you can’t do that. You have to be 80% signal, 20% noise. That changed me forever.O’Leary also clarified that these tasks are not vague goals but are specific actions which must be completed within 18 to 24 hours in order to grow the business. “When you know what you gotta get done today and you do it, nothing stops you,” he said. “Those three things, when completed daily, create extraordinary outcomes. And when you repeat this, your business goes geometric.”He further explained that the strategy creates a feedback loop of productivity, where each day is created to last and helps in driving consistent momentum and measurable results.O’Leary also used the moment to reinforce his broader philosophy on career and financial discipline. He warned students against entering consulting, saying it can stunt entrepreneurial growth. “If you want to drift into hell on Earth, stay 24 months in a consulting firm and you are tainted meat for the rest of your life,” he said during a July talk at Harvard, where he serves as an Executive Fellow.On personal finance, he cautioned against lending money to extended family, advising that money should only be gifted once to avoid long-term complications.","O’Leary recounted an advice by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.

Targeted sectors of AI tech







The European Union (EU) is preparing to launch a strategy aimed at reducing its reliance on foreign artificial intelligence (AI) providers and promoting European-made AI platforms, as concerns mount over the bloc's technological dependence on the US and China, a report has said. According to a draft proposal seen by the Financial Times, the European Commission's new “Apply AI strategy” emphasises security, resilience and industrial competitiveness by accelerating the development and adoption of homegrown AI technologies. The strategy is set to be presented by EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen on Tuesday, the report said.The draft proposal warns that “external dependencies of the AI stack”—the infrastructure and software needed to build, train and manage AI applications—”can be weaponised” by both state and non-state actors, posing risks to supply chains.The Commission aims to “strengthen EU AI sovereignty” by promoting policies to “accelerate the adoption of European scalable and replicable generative AI solutions in public administrations,” according to the draft.The strategy highlights the need to improve AI usage in critical sectors including healthcare, defense and manufacturing. To implement these initiatives, the Commission is mobilising 1 billion euros from existing financing programmes.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at an event Friday that the bloc wants to “speed up AI adoption across the board” through the Apply AI strategy to ensure Europe doesn't fall behind in the new technology.The bloc plans to prioritise implementation of European AI-enabled tools in defense.

Call of Duty ‘cost’ Xbox $300 million in console sales



India’s Gaming Revolution: New Law Changes EVERYTHING





Microsoft’s Xbox division recently announced a 50% price increase for its premium Game Pass subscription service, raising the cost to $30 per month—a move that suggests the company's ambitious streaming strategy is failing to meet revenue expectations, a report has said. This is despite Microsoft adding blockbuster titles to the service like Call of Duty, which came with the company's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard in 2023.Citing interviews with seven current and former Xbox employees, Bloomberg reports that the price hike, which drew swift backlash online, is the latest sign that Xbox's streaming push has underperformed eight years after launch. They also point that the strategy of including higher-margin games in Game Pass is undermining their salesCiting a former employee, the report claims that Xbox sacrificed more than $300 million in Call of Duty sales on consoles and PCs last year by including the franchise on Game Pass. Although Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 became the top-selling video game in the US last year and the biggest launch in franchise history, Sony's PlayStation accounted for 82% of those sales, according to trade publication IGN.The game's inclusion on Game Pass may have prompted some customers to subscribe for a month or two rather than purchasing the title outright for $70.“Game Pass hasn't delivered the explosive growth Microsoft anticipated post-Activision, and they've realized their infrastructure costs don't align with their pricing model,” said Joost Van Dreunen, founder of video game analytics firm Aldora Intelligence.According to current and former employees, Microsoft launched Game Pass in 2017 at $10 per month, offering access to over 100 older titles. A year later, the company made a decision to include its own new games on release day at no extra charge—a move that proved controversial internally.While subscription revenue increased 16% industry-wide last year, partly due to customers playing Call of Duty on Game Pass according to IGN, the model appears to be cannibalising traditional game sales without generating sufficient replacement revenue.",Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass subscription service has gone from $10 per month to $30 per month.

What data has not been affected







Discord – a free voice, video, and text communication platform – has disclosed that one of its third-party customer service providers has been hacked and the hackers have gained access to limited user information – like names, emails as well as scanned government photo IDs among other data – and attempted to extort money from the company.According to the company, the “unauthorized party” accessed data from users who had contacted Discord's Customer Support or Trust & Safety teams but did not breach Discord's systems directly.According to the company, the breach potentially exposed several types of user information, including names, Discord usernames, email addresses, and contact details provided to customer support. Limited billing information has also been accessed, such as payment types, the last four digits of credit card numbers and purchase history.Hackers also gained access to IP addresses, messages exchanged with customer service agents, and limited corporate data including training materials and internal presentations.A small number of government-issued ID images—such as driver's licenses and passports—from users who had appealed age determinations were also compromised. Discord said it will specifically notify affected users if their ID documents may have been accessed.Discord emphasised that full credit card numbers, CCV codes, and passwords have not been impacted by the breach. Messages and activity on Discord beyond conversations with customer support were also unaffected, the company said.Discord said it took immediate action upon discovering the attack, including revoking the third-party provider's access to its ticketing system and launching an internal investigation. The company has engaged a computer forensics firm to support remediation efforts and is working with law enforcement on the matter.Discord has also notified relevant data protection authorities and reviewed its threat detection systems and security controls for third-party support providers.","Discord, a free voice, video, and text communication platform, has disclosed that one of its third-party customer service providers has been hacked.

“We identified that the criminal group carried out a series of other scams, involving deepfakes of other celebrities and false betting platforms.”

“That created a perverse situation in which the criminals enjoyed a kind of 'statistical immunity.' They knew most people would not report them, so they operated at scale without fear.”





A group of suspected scammers in Brazil reportedly earned millions of dollars through online fraud by running Instagram ads featuring AI-generated deepfakes of supermodel Gisele Bundchen and other celebrities. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, police investigators confirmed the fraud, which was executed using manipulated celebrity images. Authorities arrested four suspects tied to the scheme this week and froze assets across five Brazilian states. The federal anti-money laundering agency, COAF, identified over 20 million reais ($3.9 million) in suspicious funds linked to the operation. The operation represents one of the first significant attempts in Brazil to combat the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) to manipulate celebrity images and videos for online scams.The arrests follow Brazil's Supreme Court ruling in June that social media platforms can be held liable for criminal ads if they fail to remove the content promptly.In a statement to Reuters, Instagram owner Meta stated that its policies prohibitand that it removes such adsThe company also noted that it hasAccording to Reuters, the spokesperson for Bundchen's team advised consumers to be cautious about huge discounts in ads featuring celebrities, to verify the legitimacy of offers through official brand or celebrity channels, and to report suspected scams to the authorities.The investigation announced this week by police in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul began in August 2024, following a complaint from a victim who was deceived by an Instagram ad that showed an altered video of Bundchen promoting a skincare product.In another case, an ad used the supermodel’s image to advertise a suitcase giveaway, requiring buyers to pay shipping fees for items that never arrived.In a statement to Reuters, Eibert Moreira Neto, head of Rio Grande do Sul's cybercrime unit, said:Investigators are pursuing money laundering and online fraud charges, noting that most victims lost small amounts, which is typically under 100 reais ($19), and often did not report the incidents.Isadora Galian, another official from the cybercrime unit, said:","Police in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, have arrested four suspects tied to the scheme.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) does not want to depend entirely on its sales team to sell artificial intelligence (AI) apps, a report claims. The world's largest cloud service provider is reportedly aiming to gain organic traction among developers and reduce its reliance on traditional sales teams for its AI products. This strategy shift comes after an internal Amazon document obtained by Business Insider (whichBI) indicated that AWS's coding assistant, Q Developer, has struggled to gain grassroots adoption compared to rivals like Cursor and Windsurf. The document noted that while Q Developer had seenin selling directly to senior executives, those sales, however, requiredThis also contrasts with the early years of AWS, during which cloud services were adopted organically among developers.To address the gap, AWS recently launched Kiro, an AI coding assistant specifically designed to attract more self-serve developers. The internal document acknowledged thatLarger enterprise customers, the document stated, currently tend to favour Microsoft's GitHub Copilot.AWS’ plans also highlight an ongoing debate in software sales, whether to sell directly to top executives or start with individual users and scale up. Traditionally, companies targeted senior decision-makers, but the rise of cloud services like AWS and viral apps like Slack and Zoom popularised a bottom-up model. In the AI era, this approach is even more critical, as seen with the rapid organic growth of ChatGPT and Cursor.Meanwhile, in a statement to BI, an AWS spokesperson said all sales channels are important and noted that many developers use AWS before their companies adopt it. They added that Q Developer’s usage has grownthis year.the spokesperson noted.The Q apps are key to AWS’s AI strategy, which was showcased at the company’s 2023 re:Invent conference and represents a significant portion of its AI portfolio. AWS relies on them to demonstrate to investors that it’s staying competitive as Microsoft and Google advance.However, Q Developer currently earns only a small share of what rivals like Cursor and Windsurf make. AWS also plans to speed up Q Business chatbot sales by adopting a user-led model after upgrading to an internal AI platform called Quick.AWS has also received positive early feedback on Kiro since its July launch, but plans to addfeatures after users requested more control. However, some employees remain sceptical about Q’s future, saying AWS excels more in infrastructure than in business apps.The AWS spokesperson dismissed the claims, saying that it isthat the company hasn’t succeeded beyond infrastructure, pointing to products like Bedrock, Connect, and SageMaker.the spokesperson added..","Amazon Web Services (AWS) does not want to depend entirely on its sales team to sell artificial intelligence (AI) apps. The world's largest cloud service provider is reportedly aiming to gain organic traction among developers. This strategy shift comes after an internal Amazon document indicated that AWS's coding assistant, Q Developer, has struggled to gain grassroots adoption compared to rivals like Cursor and Windsurf.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124318634,imgsize-14124,width-400,resizemode-4/why-amazon-does-not-want-to-rely-only-on-its-sales-team-to-sell-ai-products.jpg"

Risk vs. stagnation



Elon Musk's SpaceX wins contracts worth $714 million from Pentagon







Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has revealed his philosophy on failure. Musk described failure not as a setback but as a necessary part of innovation. Speaking at the 2020 Air Warfare Symposium during a fireside chat with Gen. John F. Thompson, Tesla CEO explained his point of view on failure as part of a broader portfolio of actions, where the goal is maximising the overall impact rather than avoiding individual missteps.“I think of these things as just… there’s a certain amount of time and within that time you want the best net outcome,” Musk said. “So for all the set of actions you can do, there’s going to be some which will fail, some which will succeed, and you want the net useful output of your set of actions to be the highest.”He further explained his approach by using the example of baseball” “What you mostly care about is not any individual at-bat but the overall batting average. Failure is irrelevant unless it’s catastrophic.”Elon Musk’s this mindset has long shaped the development strategy of SpaceX, where the core to progress lies in rapid iteration and frequent testing. From Starship to explosions to Falcon 9 landing mishaps, SpaceX faced each failure and took them as a learning opportunity rather than defeat.“If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough,” Musk said in a 2015 TED interview—a mantra that continues to guide his teams.The framework of Elon Musk sets a clear boundary that failure is acceptable unless it ends the mission. This principle of tolerance has compelled SpaceX to push boundaries and still maintain focus on safety as systems mature. He also warned against environments that avoid failure altogether, suggesting they may be avoiding hard problems. “The bigger danger is stagnation,” Musk implied, urging engineers and entrepreneurs to stay biased toward action and keep their “net useful output” rising.Meanwhile, The US Space Force has awarded SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, five of seven critical military launch missions for the upcoming fiscal year, totaling $714 million. The contracts are said to reinforce SpaceX’s dominance in Pentagon space contracts, despite recent public tensions between Musk and President Donald Trump. United Launch Alliance (ULA) secured the remaining two missions for $428 million.The contracts fall under the National Security Space Launch Program (NSSL), which previously selected SpaceX, ULA, and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin for 54 missions worth $13.5 billion, scheduled between 2027 and 2032. “Space is the ultimate high ground, critical for our national security,” said Col Eric Zarybnisky of the U.S. Space Systems Command, per Air & Space Forces.","Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has revealed his philosophy on failure.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk says Wikipedia’s AI rival Grokipedia will launch in 2 weeks: Here’s what to expect,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-says-wikipedias-ai-rival-grokipedia-will-launch-in-2-weeks-heres-what-to-expect/articleshow/124316953.cms,"What to expect from Grokipedia



Grokipedia will be similar to Community Notes





Tesla CEO Elon Musk has announced that an early version of “Grokipedia,” a new project linked to his AI venture xAI, will be released in the coming weeks. Taking to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Musk wrote: “Version 0.1 early beta of Grokipedia will be published in 2 weeks”. For those unaware, Grokipedia is touted as an AI-powered knowledge platform with “massive improvement” over Wikipedia The tech billionaire was replying to an X user X Freeze @amXFreeze who said that “Grokipedia is going to be the world's biggest, most accurate knowledge source, for humans and AI with no limits on use”.According to the post, Grokipedia will rely on Grok — xAI’s chatbot — to process huge amounts of information from sources such as Wikipedia. The AI will then ask: What’s true, partially true, false, or missing? Based on that, Grok will rewrite content by removing falsehoods, correcting half-truths, and adding missing context.The X user claimed the reason Grokipedia could emerge as a “true knowledge source” is because it is designed to focus only on truth, free from bias or hidden agendas. In this framing, the platform would aim to provide accurate, transparent context rather than narratives shaped by legacy media or institutional influence.The post compared Grokipedia’s mission to X’s Community Notes feature, which has challenged misleading claims online — even from major organizations. The user suggested Grokipedia would “strike like a sharp spear” by delivering corrections and context that “cut through the BS.”According to the description, Grokipedia will use first principles and physics as a basis to identify facts and counter distortion. This would mean moving beyond surface-level edits to provide complete and accurate explanations.Another expected feature, as described in the post, is that Grokipedia would be open to both humans and AI systems without restrictions. This could potentially make it a universal reference tool in the growing AI ecosystem.The post concluded with a sweeping claim: “This will change for good… Grokipedia will change it.”","Elon Musk has announced that an early version of “Grokipedia,” a new project linked to his AI venture xAI, will be released in the coming weeks.

Former Cisco CEO's dangerous prediction goes beyond AI will destroy jobs; says 50% of Fortune 500 companies will disappear,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-cisco-ceos-dangerous-prediction-goes-beyond-ai-will-destroy-jobs-says-50-of-fortune-500-companies-will-disappear/articleshow/124316574.cms,"Former Cisco CEO on job loss due to AI





Former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers has issued a stark warning about the future impact of artificial intelligence (AI). While concerns about AI replacing human jobs have already been widely discussed, Chambers believes the disruption will go far deeper. “You are probably going to see 50% of the Fortune 500 companies disappear and 50% of the executives of the Fortune 500 disappear,” he said in a recent interview with Fortune.Chambers, who led Cisco through the internet boom of the late 1990s and the painful crash that followed, compared today’s AI wave to the dot-com era. But he stressed that the pace and consequences of AI adoption are far more dramatic. “AI is moving at five times the speed and will produce three times the outcomes of the internet age,” he said, pointing out that startups are now able to develop products in weeks rather than years.The former CEO cautioned that such rapid transformation will create both winners and losers. “Is there going to be a train wreck? Yes, for those that aren’t able to translate the technology into a sustainable competitive advantage,” Chambers said. He warned that while some companies will thrive, others will vanish because their leaders lack the ability to adapt quickly enough to the new innovation economy.On the jobs front, Chambers echoed a concern that has been raised by many industry leaders but with an even sharper edge.“If I am right about AI moving at five times the speed of the internet, we are going to destroy jobs faster than we can replace them,” he explained. He acknowledged that new roles will eventually be created, but not before a painful period of adjustment. “There is going to be a drought while we have to re-educate lots of people,” he said.According to Chambers, both white-collar and blue-collar entry-level jobs are most at risk in the immediate future. To counter this, he urged governments and companies to rethink education and training systems. “We need to change education. Entry-level jobs, both white and blue collar, are going to disappear fast,” he warned.Despite his concerns, Chambers also sees potential for AI to drive productivity and economic growth—if businesses reinvest their gains. But he believes only those companies that can quickly reinvent themselves will survive. “With the speed the market is moving at now, you have to be able to reinvent yourself, which most CEOs and business leaders don’t know how to do, especially with AI,” he said.For Chambers, the current moment represents the most uncertain global business climate he has ever witnessed. He described it as “the new normal” and said leaders who fail to adapt will be left behind.","John Chambers, who led Cisco through the internet boom of the late 1990s and the painful crash that followed, compared today’s AI wave to the dot-com era.

App Store moderation under scrutiny



What users should know







ChatGPT creator OpenAI recently launched its Sora 2 model. This video generation tool of OpenAI has gained immense popularity which has led to a wave of imitation apps on the Apple App Store. As reported by 9to5Mac, these apps—many of which mimic Sora’s branding, interface, and promises—are appearing in multiple countries, often misleading users into thinking they’re downloading the official version.Sora 2 is known for its ability to generate realistic, AI-powered video clips from the text prompts. The video generation tool has become the most-talked about AI tools of 2025. The viral demos and its integration with creative platforms have made it popular among content creators, marketers and educators. However, with this popularity comes imitation.According to 9to5Mac report, developers across the regions have rushed to release apps with similar names, logos, and even fake screenshots, hoping to capitalize on the buzz. Some clones offer limited functionality, while others are outright scams, charging users for features that don’t exist.The increase in the number of Sore 2 clones have once again started the debate over App Store moderation and the ability of the platform like Apple to detect and remove deceptive apps quickly. While Apple has taken down several impersonators, new ones continue to surface, often with slight variations in name or branding.Security experts warn that some of these clones may pose privacy risks, collecting user data or injecting ads into devices without proper disclosure.- The official Sora 2 app is not yet available on the mobile platforms. Any app available on the App Store and claiming to be Sora 2 is likely misleading.- OpenAI has not yet announced a mobile release and users are advised to access Sore via verified web platforms only.- Check developer credentials and reviews before downloading any AI video app.","ChatGPT creator OpenAI recently launched its Sora 2 model.

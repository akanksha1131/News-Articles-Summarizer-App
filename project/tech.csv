US lawmaker has a plan solve 'Nvidia-China problem' that caused trillions of 'loss' for American companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-lawmaker-has-a-plan-solve-nvidia-china-problem-that-caused-trillions-of-loss-for-american-companies/articleshow/120917556.cms,"Google already uses location-tracking for its chips

A U.S. lawmaker is set to introduce legislation to track the location of AI chips, such as those produced by Nvidia, to curb smuggling into China, spotlighting the emergence of China’s DeepSeek. According to Reuters, Representative Bill Foster, a Democrat from Illinois and former particle physicist, aims to address widespread reports of Nvidia chips being smuggled into China in violation of the US export controls. DeepSeek, a Chinese AI developer, has reportedly utilized these prohibited Nvidia chips to build advanced AI systems that rival US counterparts, raising national security concerns, per analyst firm SemiAnalysis.Foster’s bill, expected in the coming weeks, would mandate the US Department of Commerce to develop regulations within six months to enforce two measures: tracking AI chips to ensure compliance with export licenses and preventing unauthorized chips from functioning. Foster emphasized the urgency, citing credible, undisclosed reports of large-scale smuggling. “This is not an imaginary future problem,” he told Reuters, warning of the Chinese military potentially using smuggled chips to develop weapons or pursue artificial general intelligence, akin to nuclear technology in its implications.The legislation responds to cases like DeepSeek’s, which reportedly leveraged Nvidia chips—critical for AI systems like chatbots and potentially bioweapons—despite U.S. restrictions under both the Biden and Trump administrations. A recent case in Singapore saw three individuals, including a Chinese national, charged with fraud involving servers possibly containing Nvidia chips, underscoring the smuggling issue.Foster, who designed computer chips in his scientific career, noted that location-tracking technology is already embedded in Nvidia’s chips and used by companies like Google to secure its data center chips. Independent experts confirmed to Reuters that such technology is readily available. The proposed tracking would use signal transmission times to pinpoint a chip’s country-level location, aiding the Bureau of Industry and Security in identifying smuggled chips.The bill enjoys bipartisan support, with Democrats like Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi and Republicans like Representative John Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on China, backing the concept. Moolenaar told Reuters the technology exists to integrate location-tracking into AI chips, and Krishnamoorthi called it a “creative solution” to halt smuggling.Foster’s second goal—disabling unlicensed chips—is more complex but part of ongoing discussions with chip providers. Nvidia declined to comment, while Google did not respond to Reuters’ inquiries about its chip-tracking practices.","Representative Bill Foster, a Democrat from Illinois, aims to address widespread reports of Nvidia chips being smuggled into China in violation of the US export controls.

Read the complete open letter from CEOs





“WHAT IF A SINGLE CLASS COULD HELP CLOSE WAGE GAPS, UNLOCK $660 BILLION IN ECONOMIC POTENTIAL EVERY YEAR FOR EVERYDAY AMERICANS, AND ADDRESS THE SKILLS GAP WE CURRENTLY FACE?

This is possible, today — if we include computer science and AI as a core part of every student’s education.

Just one high school computer science course boosts wages by 8% for all students, regardless of career path or whether they attend college.

Yet, most students never even try computer science, because it’s not a graduation requirement. Only 12 states require students to learn even basic computer science.

This is not just an educational issue; it’s about closing skills and income gaps that have persisted for generations.

It’s also about keeping America competitive. Countries like Brazil, China, S. Korea, and Singapore have already made computer science or AI mandatory for every student. The United States is falling behind.

In the age of AI, we must prepare our children for the future — to be AI creators, not just consumers. A basic foundation in computer science and AI is crucial for helping every student thrive in a technology-driven world. Without it, they risk falling behind.

How can we accept this? We have a responsibility to prepare the next generation for the new American Dream. We owe it to them to provide an education that reflects the demands of our time.

Change is already underway. This movement has bipartisan support from leaders on both sides of the aisle. In the past 10 years, all 50 states have taken steps forward, and 100,000 teachers have started teaching computer science.

But we can’t stop here. We must make computer science and AI a required part of every school’s curriculum. Together, we can unlock $660 billion in opportunity for everyday Americans, close wage gaps and ensure our children are prepared for the challenges and opportunities of tomorrow.”

Over 250 CEOs and technology leaders, including Microsoft 's Satya Nadella , Adobe's Shantanu Narayen, IBM's Arvind Krishna , and Cognizant's Ravi Kumar S, have signed an open letter warning that the United States is falling behind globally in preparing students for an AI-driven future. The coalition also includes prominent leaders from Airbnb, Uber, LinkedIn, and Salesforce, all calling for computer science and AI to become mandatory components of K-12 education nationwide.""In the age of AI, we must prepare our children for the future — to be AI creators, not just consumers,"" the letter states, pointing out that countries like Brazil, China, South Korea, and Singapore have already made computer science or AI mandatory for every student.Other prominent signatories include Marc Benioff (Salesforce), Michael Dell , CEO and founder of Dell, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman , and former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer .The campaign highlights research showing that just one high school computer science course can boost wages by 8% for all students, regardless of their eventual career path. Advocates argue that making these subjects required rather than elective could unlock $660 billion in economic potential annually and help close persistent skills and income gaps.Currently, only 12 states require students to learn even basic computer science. While all 50 states have taken steps to expand computer science education in the past decade, the letter's signatories argue this progress is insufficient given the rapid advancement of AI technologies across all industries.The bipartisan-supported initiative, spearheaded by organizations like Code.org and CSforALL, emphasizes that computer science education is not just about creating more tech workers, but about ensuring all American students have the foundation they need to thrive in an increasingly technology-driven world economy.""This is not just an educational issue; it's about closing skills and income gaps that have persisted for generations,"" the letter continues, urging policymakers, educators, and communities to join the effort to make computer science and AI education accessible to every student.","Just one high school computer science course boosts wages by 8% for all students, regardless of career path or whether they attend college.

Huffman says Silicon Valley has an entitlement problem



From idealism to business reality, how Huffman changed Reddit



Reddit CEO Steve Huffman revealed he had to implement a culture shift when he returned to the company in 2015, pushing employees to abandon excessive idealism in favor of practical business goals and increased productivity. ""Wrapped up in some of that idealism was also like, not working very hard,"" Huffman said on the ""Prof G Pod"" podcast released Sunday, describing the workplace culture he encountered upon his return as chief executive.The Reddit co-founder diagnosed this issue as symptomatic of broader tech industry culture, particularly in the Bay Area, where he perceives an attitude of entitlement.""In the Bay Area broadly is this, it's almost an entitlement of, 'I work at these companies but I don't have to work very hard and I'm here for myself,'"" Huffman explained.Huffman recounted telling employees: ""Look, we have to work really, really hard. We're in a competitive space.""The CEO's leadership transformation came during a critical period for Reddit, which he co-founded with Alexis Ohanian in 2005 before departing and later returning in 2015 to turn the company around.""We were really idealistic, and I think in many ways the idealism has been very good, but we were also idealistic about not being a business — which is not a great way to run a sustainable business,"" he said.Huffman's strategy shift appears to have paid dividends. Reddit went public in March 2024, with its stock surging 70% on the first trading day. The company is now valued at approximately $21 billion following impressive first-quarter earnings that showed a 61% year-over-year revenue increase to $392.4 million.""If we don't work really hard and work really smart and make this thing successful both from a user point of view and business point of view, then we don't get to do this, and we'll never achieve our mission,"" Huffman emphasized regarding his leadership philosophy.","Huffman says Silicon Valley has an entitlement problem.

""Consistently high"" performance now prioritized at Amazon





Amazon is overhauling its compensation model to significantly favor longtime top performers while reducing payouts for first-time high achievers and those with inconsistent performance records. Under the new guidelines, veteran employees with consistent excellence stand to gain substantially more than their newer counterparts. According to internal guidelines obtained by Business Insider, employees who earn Amazon's ""Top Tier"" performance rating for four consecutive years will now receive 110% of their pay range, exceeding the previous cap of 100%. Meanwhile, first-time Top Tier recipients will get 70% of their pay band, down from 80% last year.""This approach ensures a steadier compensation progression,"" states the internal pay guideline, referring to the company's total compensation target metric. An Amazon spokesperson explained that the updated model ""better distinguishes between newer high performers and those who have consistently exceeded expectations for their role and level.""The revised structure places greater emphasis on an employee's rating history rather than just current performance. Employees moving from lower ratings to Highly Valued 2 (HV2) will receive 10% of their pay range instead of the previous 20%, while those who drop from Highly Valued 3 (HV3) to HV2 will maintain 20%, indicating the company's increased focus on past achievements.Similarly, first-time HV3 recipients will receive 40% of their pay range rather than 50%, while employees with two consecutive Top Tier ratings will get 90% of their band instead of the previous 100%.Amazon's move represents a significant shift in how the e-commerce giant distributes compensation across its workforce. The changes clearly benefit employees who maintain top performance over multiple years while potentially disadvantaging newer high achievers and those with inconsistent performance records. Other technology companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta have also implemented similar performance-based compensation strategies, with stricter review policies and reduced rewards for underperformers.Amazon's compensation structure has previously faced internal criticism for its lack of transparency and competitive nature of employee rankings. Managers are instructed not to share individual Overall Value (OV) ratings with employees, forcing staff to infer their performance based on compensation changes.The company will continue its pilot program allowing employees to take 25% of their new stock awards in cash, addressing concerns from employees seeking more immediate financial returns rather than stock-based compensation.Despite these adjustments, Amazon maintains that most employees who demonstrated performance improvements still saw pay increases this year, with the spokesperson adding that the company offers ""multiple channels"" through which employees can raise concerns about their compensation.","Amazon's new pay model rewards veteran top performers, cuts first-time achievers.

“Unofficial” Signal app which led to firing of NSA Mike Waltz suspends services after reported hacking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/unofficial-signal-app-which-led-to-firing-of-nsa-mike-waltz-suspends-services-after-reported-hacking/articleshow/120909930.cms,"Mike Waltz photographed using TeleMessage

The ‘unofficial, less secure version’ of Signal app, reportedly known as TeleMessage, has announced a temporary suspension of its services following a security breach that allegedly exposed some of its users' messages, a report has said. The app is said to have been used by former US National Security Adviser (NSA) Mike Waltz to discuss confidential military operations in Yemen.As per news agency Reuters, Smarsh , the Portland, Oregon-based company that operates TeleMessage, confirmed the suspension in an email, stating they are “investigating a potential security incident.” The company emphasised that they are suspending all services “out of an abundance of caution” while they conduct a thorough investigation into the reported hack.This decision comes after reports surfaced that the app's backend infrastructure was compromised, potentially allowing unauthorised access to user communications. The reported hack has raised concerns regarding the security of sensitive information exchanged through the platform, particularly given its use by high-ranking officials like Mike Waltz.Waltz's use of TeleMessage, an unofficial version of the encrypted messaging app Signal, came under scrutiny following a reported security breach. A photograph taken by Reuters suggested Waltz using the app during a cabinet meeting on Wednesday (May 1).The following day, Waltz was removed from his position, after a period of controversy stemming from his establishment of a Signal group chat to share live updates on US military operations in Yemen. The group chat drew significant attention when a journalist was mistakenly added to the conversation.A report published on Sunday (May 4) by tech news site 404 Media disclosed that a hacker had infiltrated TeleMessage's backend systems, potentially gaining access to user messages. 404 Media stated that the hacker provided them with stolen data, some of which the news outlet was able to independently confirm.

Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-mark-zuckerberg-starts-his-day-without-coffee-know-about-facebook-founders-viral-rawdog-routine/articleshow/120843936.cms,"Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine

‘rawdog’ morning routine

Mark Zuckerberg follows the ‘Rawdog’ routine, know what it is

Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine key elements

1. No caffeine or external stimulants

Zuckerberg completely avoids caffeine in the mornings. While caffeine is widely used to combat fatigue and boost focus, he believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

This is in stark contrast to other tech leaders who often depend on multiple doses of caffeine throughout the day.

2. Intense physical activity: Brazilian jiu-jitsu and MMA

A central element of Zuckerberg’s morning is two hours of combat sports training, particularly Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA).

These are not light workouts. Zuckerberg actively engages in grappling and sparring, where split-second focus is essential.

He has stated that unlike running, which allows for mental wandering, jiu-jitsu requires full presence—a factor that helps him “recenter” and transition into work mode.

3. Mental presence and focus

The high-pressure nature of combat sports trains the brain to respond quickly under stress.

Zuckerberg uses these sessions to reset mentally, describing them as more effective than caffeine in waking up both the body and mind.

The risk of failure (being pinned or tapped out) keeps him focused, which in turn reduces stress from external sources.

4. Simplified lifestyle to reduce decision fatigue

Zuckerberg is known for his repetitive wardrobe—gray T-shirts, jeans, and sneakers. This choice is deliberate and helps him save cognitive effort for high-stakes decisions.

Reducing daily trivial choices aligns with psychological research indicating that decision fatigue can impair judgment over time.

5. High-protein diet and caloric intake

Why Zuckerberg chose this path: The influence of early education

How Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine powers executive performance

Enhanced cognitive function

Martial arts require constant anticipation, pattern recognition, and strategic thinking, which parallels the kind of problem-solving skills needed in high-level business decisions.

Stress management

Physical exertion is scientifically linked to lower cortisol levels and improved mood. Zuckerberg’s training acts as a buffer against the chronic stress of running a global tech company.

Improved executive functioning

The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue during the workday.

How Zuckerberg’s routine compared to Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, other tech leaders

Executive

Routine Element

Elon Musk

High caffeine intake, long work hours

Jack Dorsey

Fasting, meditation, cold plunges

Jeff Bezos

Prioritizes sleep, slow mornings

Tim Cook

Early rising with structured exercise



Scientific perspective on ‘Rawdog’ routines

Exercise improves executive functioning, especially activities that demand coordination and focus.

Caffeine-free mornings may lead to more stable energy levels, avoiding midday crashes associated with stimulant withdrawal.

Simplified routines reduce decision fatigue, as shown in studies on successful leaders and their minimalist approaches.

Routines are known to play a vital role in shaping the lives and productivity of high achievers across industries. Whether it’s elite athletes, creative professionals, or technology entrepreneurs, the way they start their day often sets the tone for how they approach challenges and decision-making. Among these successful individuals, Mark Zuckerberg—founder of Facebook and CEO of Meta—stands out not just for his innovations in the digital world but also for his unconventional personal discipline. His so-calledhas recently drawn public attention for its no-frills, stimulant-free approach to productivity and mental clarity.Unlike many of his peers in Silicon Valley who lean on coffee, energy drinks, or even mind-enhancing drugs to kick-start their day, Zuckerberg’s morning begins with no artificial aids. Instead, he embraces natural energy, physical intensity, and mental focus through a carefully structured regimen centered on Brazilian jiu-jitsu and minimalism. This article provides an in-depth, non-opinionated breakdown of Zuckerberg’s unique routine, detailing its structure, rationale, and implications for performance and mental resilience.The term ‘rawdog routine’, as used by Zuckerberg, refers to a lifestyle approach that entails confronting reality and the demands of the day without the aid of stimulants, drugs, or performance enhancers. The concept is based on the idea of beginning one’s day in a fully natural and present state. For Zuckerberg, this means no coffee, no cannabis, no nootropics, and no artificial substances that could alter his mental state. He has occasionally referred to drinking coffee recreationally while on vacation, but emphasizes that it is never a part of his regular workday schedule.This method, according to Zuckerberg, is about achieving mental clarity and physical readiness through discipline rather than chemical shortcuts. The only supplements he reportedly uses are creatine and vitamin D, both commonly accepted for muscle recovery and general health support.Zuckerberg’s rawdog morning routine is built on five foundational principles, all of which are designed to enhance productivity, reduce stress, and maintain mental sharpness.While Zuckerberg does not publicly share a specific meal plan, it is known that he consumes a high-protein diet, which is critical for recovery and energy post-training.Reports suggest his daily caloric intake may reach up to 4,000 calories, especially to meet the energy demands of intensive physical activity.Zuckerberg has cited his exposure to the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program in school as a formative influence behind his stance against drugs and stimulants.

Microsoft becomes world's most-valuable company and its No 1 position also has 'Trump Tariff' message on Apple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-becomes-worlds-most-valuable-company-and-its-no-1-position-also-has-trump-tariff-message-on-apple/articleshow/120845348.cms,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella



Trump Tariff pains 'hurting' Apple

Microsoft has once again ascended to World's Most Valuable company, overtaking Apple. Software giant Microsoft has claimed the title of the world's most valuable company as the week concluded, boasting a market capitalization of $3.235 trillion. This milestone positions them ahead of Apple , which had long held the top spot, with the iPhone maker's market cap closing on Friday (May 2) at $3.07 trillion.Securing the third position is Nvidia , whose valuation stands at $2.76 trillion, as reported by The Information's newsletter.The surge in Microsoft's stock price on Thursday fueled this shift, following the release of robust financial results for the March quarter that surpassed analyst forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the sustained strong demand for the company's cloud services and artificial intelligence (AI) offerings during an investor call.Throughout the year, Microsoft's shares have consistently outpaced Apple's, signaling growing investor confidence in the tech giant's strategic focus on AI and cloud computing. Notably, this significant post-earnings stock jump for Microsoft echoes a similar event in October 2015, when the burgeoning Azure cloud business witnessed revenue more than double, propelling shares upward by 10%, according to Investopedia.While Apple also delivered better-than-expected first-quarter results, buoyed by strong iPhone sales , the company is facing headwinds from newly implemented tariffs under President Donald Trump.Apple's extensive reliance on imported components within its supply chain renders it particularly vulnerable to the impact of these tariffs. Consequently, its share price has experienced a significant 18% decline since the beginning of the year, marking one of the most substantial drops among major technology companies.Furthermore, CEO Tim Cook has indicated that Apple anticipates an additional $900 million in costs this quarter due to the tariffs, unless the current conditions change.According to Dow Jones Market Data, as reported by NewsMax, Apple's decrease in market value represents the largest for any company at the start of this year. Among the leading tech firms, only Tesla has witnessed a steeper year-to-date decline in its shares, falling by 29%.","Microsoft's market cap now stands at $3.235 trillion, overtaking Apple.

Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools

Google claims breakup ""impossible"" without serious consequences

The US Justice Department have asked a federal judge to break up Google's advertising technology business, marking the second government request within a year that could fundamentally reshape the $2 trillion giant. During a hearing in Virginia, DOJ lawyers outlined plans to force Google to divest key components of its online advertising system following Judge Leonie M. Brinkema's April ruling that Google illegally monopolized portions of the digital advertising market .""To leave Google with 90 percent of publishers beholden to them is, frankly, too dangerous,"" said Julia Tarver Wood, the government's lead attorney in the case. The hearing established September 22 as the date when both parties will present detailed arguments about remedies.The Justice Department's proposal specifically targets Google's ad exchange—the technology connecting buyers and sellers of online ad space—along with tools used by website publishers to sell advertising inventory. The government plan would initially make Google's auction code available to publishers and other ad tech companies, followed by requiring Google to fully divest publisher tools that handle functions like record keeping.This latest action follows a separate antitrust case in Washington where the DOJ is seeking to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser to address monopolistic behavior in the search market. If both requests are granted, it would represent the most significant government-mandated corporate restructuring since AT&T's breakup in the 1980s.Google's defense team strongly opposed the breakup proposal, arguing it fails to comply with legal precedent and would create significant problems. Karen Dunn, Google's lead attorney, called the plan ""very likely completely impossible"" without causing serious problems, noting few potential buyers exist for the technology besides ""enormous tech companies.""Google instead proposed changing certain business practices and opening its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers, while arguing that divesting these technologies would eliminate important security and privacy protections the company currently provides.Judge Brinkema ruled last month that Google had illegally monopolized both publisher tools and ad exchange software, though she dismissed claims related to advertiser tools. The business in question represents only a portion of Google's massive online advertising revenue, which funds its free services like Maps, Gmail, and search.","Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools.

Microsoft and OpenAI becoming competitors, kinda

Elon Musk, the Sam Altman's enemy No. 1

Protests from former employees and ...

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced that its nonprofit will maintain control over the business behind ChatGPT and other AI products, reversing plans to transition into a for-profit entity. Should we term it Surprise or Shock – Or both. The announcement follows months of internal debate, external scrutiny, and escalating conflicts with key stakeholders, including Microsoft and co-founder Elon Musk . “We made the decision for the nonprofit to stay in control after hearing from civic leaders and having discussions with the offices of the Attorneys General of California and Delaware,” CEO Sam Altman wrote in a letter to employees.Bret Taylor, chair of OpenAI’s nonprofit board, added that the board opted to retain nonprofit oversight, converting OpenAI’s for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation that balances shareholder interests with its mission.The move comes amid heightened tensions with Microsoft, OpenAI’s largest investor, which has poured billions into the company and integrated ChatGPT into its Azure cloud platform and products like Copilot. Sources familiar with the matter indicate Microsoft pushed for a for-profit restructuring to secure greater control and faster commercialization, creating friction with OpenAI’s leadership. Altman reportedly clashed with Microsoft executives over governance and the pace of AI deployment, with Microsoft seeking a stronger hand in shaping OpenAI’s strategic direction. Neither company has publicly commented on these disputes. As analysts say, Microsoft and OpenAI seem to understand that the two partners are quickly becoming competitors.Adding to the complexity, OpenAI faces a lawsuit from co-founder Elon Musk, who accuses Altman and the company of abandoning its founding nonprofit mission to safely develop artificial general intelligence (AGI). Musk, who invested in OpenAI’s early days alongside Altman and others, claims the shift toward commercialization betrays its original principles. A federal judge recently dismissed some of Musk’s claims but allowed others to proceed to trial next year, intensifying the legal battle.The OpenAI announcement comes just days after, a judge narrowed the claims that Elon Musk can pursue in his lawsuit alleging that OpenAI broke its promise to function as a public charity by making plans to transform itself into a for-profit business. The US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, reportedly ruled that fraud claims can proceed against OpenAI in the suit filed last year by Musk. She also declined to dismiss some claims against OpenAI's ally Microsoft Corp.OpenAI, valued at $300 billion with 400 million weekly ChatGPT users, has also drawn scrutiny from Delaware and California authorities, where it is incorporated and headquartered, respectively. Advocates, including former OpenAI employees and nonprofit groups, petitioned California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings to block the for-profit conversion, citing risks to OpenAI’s public mission, especially if it achieves AGI capable of outperforming humans.The decision to remain nonprofit-controlled aims to address these concerns while navigating pressures from Microsoft’s commercial ambitions and Musk’s legal challenges. OpenAI’s leadership emphasized its commitment to balancing innovation with its founding goal of advancing AI safely for humanity’s benefit.","ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced that its nonprofit will maintain control over the business behind ChatGPT and other AI products.

What Elon Musk’s neighbour complained about the tech billionaire



“I call that place Fort Knox.”

“The cameras got me. It’s scary they have guys sitting and watching me pe*,”

“Transporting service employees to other houses, leaving their cars on our quiet streets, hauling laundry to and fro to other houses has to stop,”

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is facing neighbourhood disputes in Texas over his plans to build a compound, a report claims. Residents near his high-walled compound in West Lake Hills, Austin, have reportedly made complaints, which include allegations of Musk's security calling the police on a neighbour for public nudity. Paul Hemmer , a local homeowners association head, has been vocal about alleged zoning code violations . Hemmer claims he is under constant surveillance from Musk's security cameras . These cameras are installed on a property Musk purchased to merge with two adjacent lots. The merged property is reported to serve as a compound for Musk, his 13 children, and their mothers. Last year, the tech billionaire bought this Tuscan-style compound spanning 14,400 square feet, along with an adjacent six-bedroom mansion, for nearly $35 million as he reportedly wanted his children and their mothers to live on the properties so they can be close to each other and he can spend time with them more easily.Talking about Musk’s compound with the New York Times, Hemmer said:Last year, Musk’s security team alleged that Hemmer had displayed indecent behaviour by being naked outside his home. Hemmer denied the claim, insisting he was on his own property wearing black underwear. In a separate incident, Musk’s security cameras captured Hemmer stopping mid–dog walk to urinate.Hemmer said to the NYT.Hemmer and fellow residents of a West Lake Hills cul-de-sac filed a formal complaint against Elon Musk after he bought a $6 million, 6,900 sq ft mansion there in 2022. Frustrated by Musk’s security measures, Hemmer even flew a video drone over the property to document alleged violations.Musk’s neighbours objected to a 16-foot chain-link fence, which is ten feet above local limits, with outward-facing cameras, frequent security-guard shifts, and Tesla vehicles clogging quiet streets. City inspectors even found at least six zoning and construction ordinance breaches. Musk’s team sought retroactive permits but were denied, prompting Hemmer’s official grievance, the report noted.Hemmer wrote in the complaint.Other neighbours, including Hemmer, also appealed to the West Lake Hills Zoning and Planning Commission, arguing that Musk was running a security operation from his home.In a unanimous decision last month, the commission ruled in the neighbours’ favour, with Commissioner Jim Pledger warning that granting exceptions would encourage rule-breaking. The city council is set to review this decision on May 14, potentially forcing Musk to remove his non-compliant installations, according to the report.However, Musk’s team defended the measures as necessary, citing the ongoing security threats on him.","Elon Musk is facing neighbourhood disputes in Texas over his plans to build a compound.

"Uber Moto's YouTube advertisement with SRH member Travis Head doesn't 'affect' RCB, Delhi HC rules",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uber-motos-youtube-advertisement-with-srh-member-travis-head-doesnt-affect-rcb-delhi-hc-rules/articleshow/120908306.cms,"Image credit: YouTube

Baddies in Bengaluru ft. Travis Head - Uber Moto | Uber

“All throughout the impugned advertisement, there is no (in)direct imputation/ insinuation/ comparison/ exaggeration/ sensationalism/ distortion of matters of fact of any kind by any of the defendants against the RCB trademark/ RCB cricket team,”

Why RCB filed a lawsuit against Uber Moto ad featuring SRH’s Travis Head



“The impugned advertisement is in the context of a game of cricket, a game of sportsmanship, which, in the opinion of this court, does not call for interference of any sort at this stage, especially while this court is considering the present application...More so, since in a case like the present one, interference by this court, at this stage, would tantamount to allowing the plaintiff to run on water with assurances of their not falling,”

“There can be no one-sided impression or one-sided version of the impugned advertisement, particularly, since what according to the plaintiff is 'right' can according to the defendants be 'wrong', and vice versa. The act(s) of disparagement cannot be concluded on the basis of the reviews/ comments/ statements made by few viewers/ followers as there are always two sides of a coin. In any event, the same cannot form or be the benchmark for determining the act of disparagement and/ or infringement... This is not a telltale,”

The Delhi High Court has ruled that an Uber Moto advertisement featuring IPL team Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) member Travis Head does not affect the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB). After dismissing a plea by RCB against the YouTube advertisement, the court reportedly noted that no prima facie case of disparagement or trademark infringement was established. It also said that the advertisement creates a general perception of healthy banter and lighthearted humour, the report claims. While refusing the plea, the high court found that “no element of demeaning/ criticism/ condemning/ ridiculing/ defaming/ mocking or falsity” aimed at harming the RCB trademark or team. Justice Saurabh Banerjee, who dismissed the application filed by RCB, stated that the matter does not require any intervention at this stage.the court said in its 35-page order (as seen by the news agency PTI).Royal Challengers Sports Private Limited sued Uber India Systems Pvt Ltd, alleging that Uber Moto’s YouTube ad “Baddies in Bengaluru ft. Travis Head” disparages its trademark.In its interim ruling on RCB’s request for relief, the court held that at this stage the advertisement cannot be deemed false or misleading and that withholding a temporary injunction would not cause the plaintiff irreparable harm, loss, or injury.Justice Banerjee said.The court concluded the ad contains no elements likely to influence or provoke the general public or fans of RCB or SRH.the court noted.RCB’s lawyer argued the ad shows a cricketer spray-painting “Royally Challenged Bengaluru” over “Bengaluru vs Hyderabad,” disparaging their trademark and using a “deceptive variant” during Uber Moto’s IPL sponsorship.Uber’s counsel countered that good-natured humour and banter are vital to advertising and that RCB’s proposed standard would suppress them. The video had already received over 2 million views and numerous user comments.","Royal Challengers Sports Private Limited sued Uber India Systems Pvt Ltd, alleging that Uber Moto’s YouTube ad “Baddies in Bengaluru ft.

""I think it's much more valuable to acknowledge that it's about complying with the rules if we want to operate in this market and we're going to respect them, rather than just saying 'you're targeting me because I'm American',""

""We are talking about operators that have been accumulating a significant concentration of power, and about a third of their global revenues are produced in Europe,""

The European Union (EU) has responded to Microsoft's promise to comply with its rules. EU Commission Vice President Teresa Ribera stated that it is ""much more valuable"" that Microsoft will abide by European rules. This follows Microsoft Chairman Brad Smith telling the European Commission that the company will follow European rules, regardless of agreement. Ribera said this while talking to the media to address issues including digital competition, trade, and the recent electricity outage in Spain and Portugal. She even praised Microsoft's approach to adhering to EU regulations.Ribera said as reported by the news agency Reuters.She added that the Commission has encountered both approaches in meetings with various stakeholders. Last month, Microsoft announced it would sell its Teams chat and video app separately from its Office suite worldwide—six months after unbundling them in Europe to sidestep a potential EU antitrust fine. It came after Salesforce-owned Slack had filed a complaint with the European Commission over Microsoft’s previous practice of tying Teams to Office.Ribera added.Meanwhile, when questioned on trade tensions with the US, Ribera responded that the EU is trying to avoid a trade war but “not at any price.”Last month, Microsoft President Brad Smith reaffirmed the company’s dedication to upholding European regulations, emphasising that “even when we've lost cases in European courts, Microsoft has long respected and complied with European laws.”Speaking in Brussels amid rising US–EU trade tensions after President Trump’s tariff threats, Smith outlined five digital commitments to Europe, which include full adherence to the Digital Markets Act and underscored that just as local laws govern US operations, European laws govern Microsoft’s business practices in Europe.","EU Commission Vice President Teresa Ribera said it is ""much more valuable"" that Microsoft will abide by European rules.

Read what Eutelsat CEO Eva Berneke said about her exit from the company



“Ensuring Eutelsat Groups future direction

Dear friends, colleagues and partners across the world.

This morning we announced that I will hand over the realms of Eutelsat to a new CEO, who will onboard the company starting 1 June.

Since I took over the CEO position in January 2022, the world has changed in many ways; Russia invaded Ukraine and put geopolitics on the radar for leaders and companies all over the world and the early morning attack on the Viasat satellite - on the day of the Russian invasion - placed SatComs, space and subsequently Eutelsat in the centre of it all.

The world has changed immensely and so has Eutelsat. We announced the merger with OneWeb in the summer of '22 and completed the merger the following year, creating the first LEO-GEO player in the SatCom industry and the only operational LEO constellation operator besides Starlink in the US. New steps were taken in 2024 when Eutelsat joined forces with 2 other operators and won the significant 10,6Bn Euro IRIS2 contract with the EU with the objective of developing a European Souverain space connectivity capacity and ensuring that Europe remain sovereign and independent – also in Space. In parallel with all of this; Eutelsat’s GEO Tech teams managed no less than 5 GEO launches. And last but not least, we partially divested our passive ground infrastructure and welcomed EQT as new investor, and jointly we are now on track to create the world’s first satellite antenna company.

So looking to the future; Eutelsat is set for a full alignment with a world where Europe is a strong souverain space player and strongly aligned with the telecom connectivity ecosystem. So with Eutelsat’s strategy anchored in the IRIS2 and European souverain future, we look to adjust our governance and shareholder structure, and this has paved the way for our CEO succession, which will unfold during the next month. Jean-Francois Fallacher will join as Eutelsat’s new CEO on June 1, and I will make sure he gets onboarded with our fantastic teams, our cherished customers, strategic suppliers and regulatory partners.

I hope that you will be as welcoming and friendly to him as you have been to me during the past years and this says a lot! Bringing Eutelsat into a new future has been an immense challenge but first and foremost a great privilege and pleasure and I have truly enjoyed being part of the global space family and steering Eutelsat into a new and very exciting future.

I will see you around, EVA”

Eutelsat has appointed Orange executive Jean-Francois Fallacher as its new CEO. Fallacher, 58, will be replacing the Franco-British satellite communication provider’s current chief, Eva Berneke . Fallacher, who is a telecoms sector veteran and has led Orange's branches in Romania, Poland, Spain, and France over the past 15 years, is set to take over Eutelsat, which also shares a strategic partnership with Indian telecom giant Airtel , on June 1.

“Elon Musk behaved badly. He gives expensive gifts from the heart, and then remotely turns them off. You probably remember his gift - the Cybertruck, which we equipped with a machine gun and sent to the SVO. The machine coped with combat missions perfectly. Demonstrated manoeuvrability and good protection for the crew. So, recently, Musk remotely turned off the Cybertruck. This is not manly. We had to tow the iron horse. How is that possible, Elon? Is that how it is done?”

Elon Musk denied gifting Ramzan Kadyrov



""We received a Tesla Cybertruck from the esteemed Elon Musk. I was pleased to test this new technology and personally witnessed why it’s rightfully called the ‘Cyberbeast,""

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been accused of disabling a Cybertruck owned by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. Kadyrov, who is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and has led Chechnya since 2007, alleged that the tech billionaire remotely disabled the vehicle. In a post shared on the messaging platform Telegram, Kadyrov expressed his discontent and described Musk's actions as “not manly."" Take a look at the post here:In the post, Kadyrov wrote (translated from Chechen):Earlier, Kadyrov shared a video showing the Cybertruck outfitted with what appeared to be a machine gun, implying that Musk had gifted him the vehicle.Kadyrov said in a statement at that time, Benzinga reports.However, Musk has denied gifting the Cybertruck to Kadyrov, the report added.Moreover, how the Chechen leader obtained the vehicle remains unclear, especially since US sanctions prohibit direct exports of Cybertrucks to Chechnya.In another news, former NBA star–turned–sports analyst Shaquille O’Neal parted ways with two of his Tesla Cybertrucks after being disappointed by their limited driving range. Despite one of them being custom-modified, he decided to sell both last week and has since invested in a Cadillac Escalade IQ, praising it for delivering superior performance on the same amount of energy.","Elon Musk has been accused of disabling a Cybertruck owned by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov.

Elon Musk on his friendship with Donald Trump

Elon Musk has pushed back against claims linking him to extremist ideologies. In an interview with Fox's “My View with Lara Trump”, the Tesla CEO said that he found such accusations a “relentless propaganda campaign”.“Well, I mean, look, it’s a relentless propaganda campaign, which obviously President Trump has experienced for a very long time, 20 years, maybe longer,” Musk told Lara, also the president’s daughter-in-law. “Now, obviously, I’ve not harmed anyone in my life, so it’s an outrageous thing to claim that I’m a Nazi,” the Tesla CEO added.Musk, who leads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has faced criticism for his active role in the Trump administration. His actions at a post-inauguration event in January this year drew criticism with many comparing it to a Nazi salute.“And politics is a blood sport, so they’re going to come up with whatever attacks they can to destroy the public perception of someone,” he further stated.During the interview, Musk also blamed the legacy media, saying it’s “disappointing how well propaganda works.”“If you repeat a lie, you know, the sort of ‘he’s a Nazi lie’ enough times, some people actually believe it, especially people that still believe the legacy news, you know,” he told Lara.“They really are trying every angle to get me… if they could press a button and kill me. In reality, they would press that button immediately. But since … I’m a little difficult to kill. They are doing character assassination instead,” he added.In the interview, Musk also discussed his relationship with President Donald Trump. “I do consider the president a friend. I think he considers me a friend and we get along very well,” he said, adding ““I think probably if you asked us both the same set of questions in two different rooms, 80 percent of the time we would come up with the same answer”.“We almost always agree”, Musk noted.","Elon Musk has pushed back against claims linking him to extremist ideologies.

China smuggling AI chips: US lawmaker proposes law to track Nvidia GPUs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/china-smuggling-ai-chips-us-lawmaker-proposes-law-to-track-nvidia-gpus/articleshow/120903569.cms,"Representative Image

How the US lawmaker is planning to track Nvidia’s chips in China



Tracking chips to ensure they are in authorised locations under export control licenses.

Preventing chips from booting up if they are not properly licensed under export controls.

What the US lawmaker said about the proposed legislation



A US lawmaker is reportedly planning to propose legislation to track the location of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, including those made by Nvidia, after they are sold. This effort aims to address reports of widespread smuggling of Nvidia's chips into China, which violates US export control laws , the report claims. Nvidia's chips are crucial for creating AI systems, including chatbots, image generators and specialised apps like those used for biological weapons. Both current US President Donald Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, have implemented increasingly strict export controls on Nvidia's chips to China. However, reports indicate that some of these chips have continued to flow into China. While Nvidia has also stated publicly that it cannot track its products after they are sold.According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the plan has drawn bipartisan support from US lawmakers, and independent technical experts have also supported this view. US Representative Bill Foster, a Democrat from Illinois and former particle physicist, believes the technology to track chips post-sale is readily available, often already integrated into Nvidia's chips. Foster, who has designed multiple computer chips, plans to introduce a bill directing US regulators to create rules for:In a statement to Reuters, Foster said that credible, though in some cases confidential, reports indicate chip smuggling to China is still occurring on a large scale.""This is not an imaginary future problem. It is a problem now, and at some point we're going to discover that the Chinese Communist Party, or their military, is busy designing weapons using large arrays of chips, or even just working on (artificial general intelligence), which is as immediate as nuclear technology,” Foster noted.Chip smuggling has become more urgent after China’s DeepSeek AI (which analysts say uses U.S.-prohibited Nvidia chips) posed a serious challenge to American systems, and Singapore prosecutors charged three Chinese nationals over a fraud case involving servers that may have contained those chips.Although location-verification technology isn’t yet widely deployed, companies like Google already track their in-house AI chips for security. Foster’s proposed legislation will require the Commerce Department to issue rules mandating such tracking within six months.","A US lawmaker is reportedly planning to propose legislation to track the location of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, including those made by Nvidia.

In an era where job interviews can be nerve-wracking and high-pressure situations, insights from seasoned professionals like Bill Gates can prove invaluable. During a 2020 episode of NBA star Stephen Curry’s YouTube series State of Inspiration, Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft and a renowned philanthropist, offered an intriguing look at his approach to job interviews. In a mock interview scenario, Gates took on the role of a junior software engineer applying for a position at Microsoft. This mock session was a rare opportunity for viewers to see how one of the world’s most successful entrepreneurs handles crucial interview questions and what advice he offers to aspiring professionals. His candid responses provide critical perspectives on some of the most challenging aspects of job interviews, from salary expectations to the “Why should we hire you?” question.One of the most frequently asked—and often tricky—questions in job interviews revolves around salary expectations. When Gates was asked about his salary expectations during the mock interview, his response deviated from simply naming a figure. Instead, he focused on broader strategies for handling this often uncomfortable aspect of job negotiations. Gates emphasized aligning one’s compensation expectations with the company's long-term goals and vision, demonstrating his belief in the value of taking a calculated risk.Gates explained, “I hope the option package is good. I'm able to take a risk, and I think the company has a great future, so I prefer to get stock options even more than cash compensation.” By prioritizing stock options over immediate cash, Gates showcased his confidence in the company’s future growth, aligning his personal financial success with the company’s long-term success. This approach not only shows a level of commitment but also positions him as a forward-thinking individual with a vested interest in the company’s success.Moreover, Gates subtly reinforced his position by saying, “I hear some other companies are paying a lot.” This remark was a strategic move in the negotiation process, signaling that Gates was a sought-after candidate. By mentioning other companies’ offers, he communicated his value without explicitly stating a salary demand, emphasizing the importance of negotiating on a broader, more strategic level. This thoughtful approach is a critical takeaway for job seekers, teaching them to negotiate with confidence and align their compensation expectations with their professional aspirations.Another staple question that Gates tackled during his mock interview was, “Why should we hire you?” This is a question that can make or break a candidate’s chances, as it often requires a balance of self-promotion and humility. Gates’ response demonstrated how to effectively showcase one’s strengths while acknowledging areas of growth and improvement.He started by discussing his technical expertise, saying, “You should look at the codes that I've written. I write software programs way beyond any classes that I've taken. I think I've gotten better over time, so take a look at how ambitious I've been there.” By focusing on his personal growth as a software engineer, Gates emphasized his commitment to continuous improvement, a key trait that recruiters value. He also touched on his ability to collaborate effectively with others, saying, “I do think I can work well with people. I might criticize their code a little harshly, but overall, I like to be on a team.”In his answer, Gates struck a fine balance between acknowledging his technical skills and demonstrating emotional intelligence by recognizing the importance of teamwork. His response showcased how personal ambition and the ability to work well with others are equally essential for success in a team-oriented role. Gates also highlighted the value of having “ambitious goals” and thinking ahead about the future—qualities that are often sought after in candidates at top tech companies.Perhaps the most insightful aspect of Gates’ interview was his willingness to reflect on his growth and personal development. While discussing his coding skills, Gates acknowledged that he had “gotten better over time” and that he had learned through experience. This sense of humility, combined with confidence in his abilities, helped to create a compelling and balanced answer. By acknowledging his ability to critique others’ work while also highlighting his passion for teamwork, Gates conveyed that self-awareness and adaptability are equally important as technical expertise in the workplace.This approach reflects the evolving expectations of employers, who are increasingly valuing emotional intelligence, adaptability, and collaboration as much as technical proficiency. Gates’ emphasis on teamwork and long-term goals presents a clear message for job seekers: while technical skills are vital, the ability to work effectively with others and contribute to a larger mission is equally important.Bill Gates’ mock interview offers a masterclass in job interview techniques and strategies. His responses provide timeless advice that can benefit job seekers at any stage of their career. Gates teaches us that salary expectations should be considered in the context of the company’s vision and that negotiating for equity in the form of stock options can demonstrate confidence in the company’s future. His handling of the “Why should we hire you?” question exemplifies how to showcase technical expertise, self-awareness, and collaboration skills in a balanced, thoughtful manner.For aspiring job candidates, the key takeaway from Gates’ interview is the importance of aligning personal goals with the company’s mission and demonstrating a willingness to grow and collaborate. With Gates’ approach to interviews as a guide, candidates can approach their job search with a sense of confidence, humility, and strategic thinking that will set them apart in a competitive job market.","Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft and a renowned philanthropist, offered an intriguing look at his approach to job interviews.

Neem Karoli Baba, an Indian mystic and spiritual leader, has left an indelible mark on some of the most influential figures in the global tech industry. Known for his simplicity, wisdom, and teachings focused on love and service, Neem Karoli Baba has inspired many, including tech icons like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jack Dorsey. These individuals credit their encounters with his teachings or ashram as pivotal moments in their lives, shaping their personal philosophies and professional trajectories. This article explores the profound influence of Neem Karoli Baba on these leaders and how his spiritual legacy continues to resonate within the tech world.The late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs visited Neem Karoli Baba’s ashram in Kainchi, Uttarakhand, in the mid-1970s. Jobs embarked on the journey seeking spiritual enlightenment during a period of personal and professional uncertainty. Although Neem Karoli Baba had passed away in 1973, Jobs spent time at the ashram absorbing its serene atmosphere and interacting with the Baba’s disciples.The visit left a lasting impression on Jobs. He later described how the experience shaped his vision of simplicity and focus, traits that became hallmarks of Apple’s design philosophy. Jobs also shared the spiritual insights he gained with others, recommending the ashram to his friends, including Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg.In 2015, Mark Zuckerberg revealed that he visited Neem Karoli Baba’s ashram on Jobs’ suggestion. During Facebook’s early days, Zuckerberg faced challenges that made him question the company’s direction. Jobs advised him to visit the ashram for clarity and inspiration.Zuckerberg spent time at the ashram, where he experienced a sense of peace and purpose. The visit reinforced his belief in Facebook’s mission to connect the world. He later stated that this spiritual journey provided him with the confidence and determination to move forward during a critical phase in Facebook’s growth.Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey also draws inspiration from Neem Karoli Baba’s teachings, particularly in the context of mindfulness and meditation. Although Dorsey has not publicly detailed a direct visit to the ashram, he has spoken extensively about the influence of Indian spirituality on his life and work.Dorsey’s regular practice of meditation aligns with Neem Karoli Baba’s emphasis on inner peace and self-awareness. This mindfulness approach has shaped his leadership style, helping him navigate the pressures of running global tech companies like Twitter and Square.Neem Karoli Baba’s teachings emphasize love, service, and the power of selflessness. He believed in treating everyone equally and living a life dedicated to helping others. His simple yet profound wisdom has inspired individuals to adopt a more balanced and compassionate approach to life.Key lessons from Neem Karoli Baba include:These principles resonate deeply with individuals in high-stress industries like technology, where innovation and success often come at the cost of personal well-being.Neem Karoli Baba’s influence extends far beyond the tech industry. His ashram continues to attract visitors from around the world, including celebrities, entrepreneurs, and spiritual seekers. Books like Miracle of Love by Ram Dass, a disciple of Neem Karoli Baba, have further popularized his teachings internationally.The mystic’s philosophy appeals to tech leaders because it offers a counterbalance to the fast-paced, high-stakes world of innovation.

In an era where technology continues to reshape every aspect of our lives, the intersection of artificial intelligence and spirituality has become an intriguing topic of exploration. A recent experimental art installation in Lucerne, Switzerland, invited visitors to engage in thought-provoking conversations with an AI-driven avatar of Jesus, placed within the intimate setting of a confessional. This project, Deus in Machina, was designed to explore how AI could be used to address deeply personal questions about faith, morality, and the human experience. By offering responses grounded in biblical teachings, the installation provided an unconventional space for reflection, sparking discussions on the role of AI in religion and the boundaries of human trust in technology.The project, led by researchers and religious leaders, aimed to explore the growing intersection of artificial intelligence and religion. It also investigated the limits of human trust in machines, especially in a space typically associated with spirituality. After the exhibit, which ran from late August through October, over 900 conversations were transcribed, and those involved in the project considered it largely successful. Many visitors left with deep thoughts and emotions, noting that interacting with the AI was an easy and meaningful experience.A small sign outside the confessional invited visitors to enter, where a green light signified it was their turn to speak with the “AI Jesus” avatar. Behind a lattice screen — a familiar setup for those seeking traditional confession — the AI would respond with thoughtful answers. The response, however, wasn’t instantaneous, requiring a short wait time, which pointed to the complexities of the technology. Nearly 300 people filled out questionnaires after their interactions, contributing to the final report.Philipp Haslbauer, an IT expert from the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, explained the technology behind the AI, which used GPT-4 from OpenAI and an open-source version of Whisper for speech recognition. The visitors discussed a variety of topics with ""AI Jesus,"" including love, the afterlife, loneliness, war, and even controversial topics such as sexual abuse within the Catholic Church or the Church’s stance on homosexuality. Though most visitors were Christian, people from other faiths, including agnostics, atheists, and Buddhists, also participated. The AI was conversant in over 100 languages, including English, Chinese, Spanish, Russian, and many others.Some visitors reacted negatively, calling the project “blasphemous” or ""the work of the devil."" However, chapel theologian Marco Schmid noted that most participants engaged seriously with the AI, using the experience to reflect rather than make light of it. The majority of visitors were aged between 40 and 70, and the project appeared to resonate more deeply with Catholics than with Protestants. Schmid emphasized that the AI wasn’t intended to replace traditional confessions or spiritual guidance but to spark reflection on the growing role of digital technologies in spiritual matters.Schmid was careful to clarify that the “AI Jesus” was not intended as a replacement for religious rituals, and it was understood that it was a machine, not a living person. It didn’t offer absolution or prayers, only summarized the conversations. The project, a form of artistic exploration, sought to examine the relationship between digital technology and the divine, without suggesting it could replace authentic human connection.The broader Catholic Church, including the Vatican, has begun to explore AI’s potential and ethical implications. Since the explosion of public interest in AI technology, particularly after the debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT, religious leaders have debated AI's role in faith settings. For example, the Vatican has appointed a friar as its AI expert, and a Lutheran church in Germany experimented with AI-delivered sermons. Pope Francis, in his annual peace message, called for international regulations to ensure the ethical use of AI.Despite the fascination surrounding the project, concerns about AI’s impact on spirituality remain. Kenneth Cukier, a journalist and AI expert, suggested that if “AI Jesus” helps people connect more deeply with themselves and their faith, it could be a positive development. However, he cautioned that the risk is that it may ultimately draw people away from deeper, more authentic spiritual experiences. The machine-like quality of the AI could detract from genuine human spirituality, Cukier warned.Schmid views the Deus in Machina exhibit as a pilot project. While he doesn't anticipate an immediate return of “AI Jesus,” he acknowledged there is interest from various groups, including parishes and schools, in continuing to explore AI’s role in spiritual contexts. The project’s success has sparked reflection on how to proceed and whether future iterations might expand on the intersection of AI, religion, and art.","""AI Jesus"" sparks deep discussions on faith, morality, and technology.

Many visitors left with deep thoughts and emotions, noting that interacting with the AI was an easy and meaningful experience.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115815251,imgsize-17296,width-400,resizemode-4/115815251.jpg"

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s 5-word response to TSMC founder’s 'top job' offer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-5-word-response-to-tsmc-founders-top-job-offer/articleshow/115813973.cms,"Two-decade-long friendship of TSM founder and Nvidia CEO

When TSMC founder approached Intel CEO

TSMC founder Morris Chang revealed in his autobiography that over a decade ago, he approached Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang with an offer to become the CEO of the Taiwanese chip giant. However, Huang declined the proposal within just 10 minutes, stating, “I already have a job,” according to Chang.The 93-year-old published the second volume of his autobiography on Friday, November 29 that recounts his life from 1964 to 2018. This follows the first volume, published in 1998, which focused on his early life. The second volume of Morris Chang's autobiography delves into his 25 years at Texas Instruments and the establishment of TSMC in 1987.In the second volume of his autobiography, the TSMC founder also reflects on his two-decade-long friendship with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Chang highlights Huang’s pivotal role in transforming Nvidia into one of the world’s most valuable companies, especially amid the rise of artificial intelligence, and credits their mutual admiration over the years.In the book, Chang reveals that in 2013, while searching for a successor, he saw Huang as the ideal candidate for TSMC’s CEO role, citing his character, professional experience, and semiconductor expertise. During their meeting, Chang spent 10 minutes outlining his vision for TSMC, but Huang politely declined, saying, “I already have a job.”Chang made a second attempt weeks later, but Huang remained steadfast, emphasizing his commitment to Nvidia. Reflecting on the interaction, Chang writes, “Jensen’s response was honest: He ‘already had a job.’ That job was to elevate Nvidia to what it is today, 11 years later.”In the book, Chang says that he also approached then CEO of Intel – Gordon Moore, when he was raising funds for TSMC in the 1980s. The U.S. chipmaker, though not an investor in TSMC, later became one of its key customers, relying on TSMC to manufacture its latest laptop chips.Morris Chang also commented on Intel’s shift toward the foundry business under CEO Pat Gelsinger, who has been driving the effort since 2021. While Chang wished Intel success, he expressed skepticism about the company’s ability to pivot effectively. He pointed out that Intel’s traditional business model—focused on producing its own chips in-house—could pose challenges in adapting to the foundry model, which involves manufacturing chips designed by other companies.","TSMC founder Morris Chang reveals in his autobiography that over a decade ago, he approached Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang with an offer to become the CEO of the Taiwanese chip giant.

Facebook-parent Meta may have a $10 billion 'plan' to support AI investments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebook-parent-meta-may-have-a-10-billion-plan-to-support-ai-investments/articleshow/115813796.cms,"Meta’s sub-sea cable plans: What we know so far



Meta is reportedly planning to build a massive subsea cable to support its growing internet traffic and AI investments . Citing sources close to the social media giant, a report by Techcrunch claims that this ambitious project is expected to stretch over a distance of 40,000+ kilometres across the world and is estimated to cost over $10 billion.If the rumours turn out to be true, this will mark the first time for Meta to solely own and operate a subsea cable. This development also highlights the company’s increasing focus on controlling its infrastructure.As the second-biggest driver of internet usage globally, Meta's properties account for a significant portion of internet traffic, and this new cable aims to ensure reliable connectivity for its users.Meta owns leading social media and messaging platforms such as Facebook , Instagram, and WhatsApp. With billions of users across these services, the company accounts for 10% of global fixed internet traffic and 22% of mobile traffic.Sunil Tagare, a subsea cable expert and pioneer in the field as the founder of Flag Telecom, was the first to reveal Meta’s plans in October. In a statement to TechCrunch, Tagare said that the project is set to begin with a $2 billion budget. However, as the initiative progresses over several years, the total cost is expected to exceed $10 billion.As per the report, sources close to the company have also confirmed the project but noted that it is still in its early stages. While plans are in place, no physical assets have been deployed yet, and the budget remains undisclosed. Meta is expected to share more details publicly in early 2025, including the cable's planned route, capacity, and the rationale behind its development.However, it could take years for the project to become fully operational due to the limited number of companies (such as SubCom) capable of building the required infrastructure, the report adds. These companies are already heavily booked by major clients like Google.Once completed, the cable would provide Meta with a dedicated global data traffic pipeline . Tagare also claimed that the proposed route would span from the US east coast to India via South Africa, then return to the U.S. west coast from India via Australia, forming a “W” shape across the globe.While Meta already has partial ownership in 16 subsea cable networks, this new project would be the first fully owned by the company. Other tech majors like Amazon and Microsoft also invest in subsea cables through partial ownership or capacity purchases, but neither fully owns any cables.","Meta is reportedly planning to build a massive subsea cable to support its growing internet traffic and AI investments.

What is PAN 2.0

What is the purpose of QR code on the new PAN card

Do I need to apply for the new PAN card

What is the fees if want to upgrade to new PAN card

Will my old PAN card become invalid

Why is the government upgrading the PAN system

What about the people holding more than one PAN card

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has approved the Income Tax Department’s Permanent Account Number (PAN) 2.0 Project. This project aims to streamline and modernise the process of issuing and managing PAN and TAN, making it more user-friendly and efficient. In line with the Budget 2023 announcement, the government has decided to make PAN the ""common business identifier"" for all digital systems of specified govt agencies. Although it is illegal to have more than one PAN, there are several entities and individuals, who violate the law and the government is hoping that once the project is rolled out, it will be easier to check such instances. Currently there is a database of 78 crore PANs and 73.3 lakh TANs in the country. Here's all you need to know about the PAN Card 2.0 .PAN 2.0 is a significant upgrade to India's Permanent Account Number (PAN) system. This initiative aims to modernize the PAN system by introducing a unified digital platform. It will streamline PAN-related services, enhance security, and improve overall taxpayer experience. Currently, PAN-related services are spread across three different platforms: the e-Filing Portal, UTIITSL Portal, and Protean e-Gov Portal. With the implementation of PAN 2.0, all these services will be integrated into a single, unified portal. This one-stop platform will handle comprehensively issues/matters related to PAN and TAN, including application, updates, corrections, Aadhaar-PAN linking, re-issuance requests, and even online PAN validation. By doing so, the Income Tax Department endeavours to simplify processes, eliminate delays, and improve grievance redressal mechanisms.The QR code helps in validating the PAN and PAN details. Incidentally, the QR code is not a new feature. QR codes have been incorporated in the PAN cards since 2017-18. The same will be continued under the PAN 2.0 project with enhancements (dynamic QR code which will display the latest data present in the PAN database). PAN holders having an old PAN Card without QR code have an option to apply for a new card with QR code in existing PAN 1.0 eco-system as well as in the PAN 2.0.On reading through the reader application, complete details, i.e., photo, signature, Name, Father’s Name / Mother’s Name and Date of Birth is displayed.No, you do not need to apply for a new PAN card. Your existing PAN card will remain valid. Your existing PAN card will remain valid under PAN 2.0 project and you will automatically receive an electronic version of the card in your mail ID, without having to apply for it.There are no fees. You can opt to upgrade your PAN card to the new design with a QR code at no additional cost. But those seeking a physical card, however, will have to apply and pay Rs 50 for it if they live within the country.No, your old PAN card will not become invalid unless it is not linked to your Aadhaar number. The absence of a QR code on your PAN card will not affect its validity.The government aims to make the PAN system more efficient, secure, and user-friendly. By modernizing the system, the government hopes to improve tax compliance and reduce administrative burdens.As per the provisions of Income-Tax Act, 1961, no person can hold more than one PAN. In case a person holds more than one PAN, he/she is obliged to bring it to the notice of the Jurisdictional Assessing officer and get the additional PAN deleted/de-activated. In the PAN 2.0, with the improved systems logic for identification of potential duplicate requests for PAN and centralized and enhanced mechanism for resolving the duplicates would minimize the instances of one person holding more than one PAN.","PAN 2.0 is a significant upgrade to India's Permanent Account Number (PAN) system.

Tesla CEO’s growing global influence

Tesla CEO Elon Musk joined in a call between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and US President elect Donald Trump , reports The Information. The call took place shortly after Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris in the November 5 presidential election. It is not yet known what else was discussed on the phone call, apart from the congratulatory message. Musk reportedly listened in as Pichai congratulated and spoke with Trump.This isn’t the first time that reports of a conversation between Trump and Google’s CEO have surfaced online. During his election campaigns, Trump mentioned twice about calling Pichai.In an interview with Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait last month, Trump said that he called Google CEO Sundar Pichai to highlight alleged biases in Google search, claiming it only shows negative stories about him. He then said “I called the head of Google the other day and I said, ‘I’m getting a lot of good stories lately, but you don’t find them in Google’,” he said. Pichai, Trump said in the interview, told him that “you’re the No. 1 person on all of Google for stories”.Also read: Donald Trump: I called Google CEO Sundar Pichai the other day and said ... In October again, Trump claimed that Pichai called him to convey accolades on his visit to McDonald’s. During an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast, he said “I actually got a call from Sundar...the head of Google and he said, sir, I just want to tell you what you did with McDonald's was one of the single biggest events we've ever had at Google”.Elon Musk, who has been a vocal supporter of Trump in the US elections, has reportedly spent close to $130m to help get the former president re-elected. He was recently appointed as co-chair of the newly formed “Department of Government Efficiency” alongside Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. “Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies - Essential to the 'Save America' Movement,” Trump said.The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX has previously participated in calls with global leaders and has offered advice on personnel decisions, both privately and publicly, through X—the social media platform he acquired in 2022. He has briefly joined a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as listened during a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

New malware targets gamers globally: Who is at risk and why this is ‘dangerous’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/new-malware-targets-gamers-globally-who-is-at-risk-and-why-this-is-dangerous/articleshow/115812848.cms,"Who is at risk and why this malware is ‘dangerous’

A new malware threat called GodLoader is targeting gamers worldwide, exploiting the popular Godot game development engine, a report has said. Check Point Research (CPR) uncovered this threat, which has already impacted over 1.2 million users across various platforms.According to the cyber security company, the discovery is worrying because it suggests escalation in cybercriminal tactics , leveraging trust in legitimate platforms to infiltrate the gaming ecosystem.The report by Check Point says that GodLoader specifically targets gamers who download mods and add-ons, exploiting their trust in the Godot Engine and open-source platforms.Since Godot-based games run on platforms like Windows, macOS, and Linux, a large number of users are prime targets. Additionally, the Godot Engine’s ability to execute cross-platform scripts allows attackers to infect a wide range of devices.The malware disguises itself as legitimate game updates or downloadable content, often spreading through trusted repositories on platforms like GitHub. Once installed, GodLoader can compromise personal data, execute malicious code, and potentially lead to ransomware attacks.Eli Smadja, a security expert at Check Point Software Technologies, warns that the gaming industry needs to prioritise cybersecurity measures to combat this growing threat.“The Godot Engine’s flexibility has made it a target for cybercriminals, enabling stealthy, cross-platform malware like GodLoader to spread rapidly by exploiting trust in open-source platforms. For the 1.2 million users of Godot-developed games, the implications are profound—not just for their devices but for the integrity of the gaming ecosystem itself,” he said.“This is a wake-up call for the industry to prioritize proactive, cross-platform cyber security measures to stay ahead of this alarming trend,” he added.","Malware called GodLoader is targeting gamers worldwide, exploiting the popular Godot game development engine.

"“We are concerned the government is…”: Read Instagram, Facebook-parent Meta’s response on social media ban in Australia",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/we-are-concerned-the-government-is-read-instagram-facebook-parent-metas-response-on-social-media-ban-in-australia/articleshow/115811684.cms,"What Meta said on social media ban in Australia

Meta is committed to creating safe online experiences for young people and we will respect any age limits introduced by the government. We’ve already invested significantly in understanding age and ensuring age-appropriate experiences on our apps, including the recent introduction of Instagram Teen Accounts.

Any new laws aimed at protecting children and teens online should empower parents and be consistently applied across all apps that young people commonly use, including YouTube and online gaming.

We are concerned the government is rushing this legislation without adequate consultation or evidence and there are still many unknowns with respect to its implementation. The legislation as drafted seems out of step with available research and expert opinions, including those from within the government, academia, industry, mental health organisations, and Australian parents and young people.

Furthermore, the Government’s approach will likely require each app provider to collect personal identification or biometric data from all Australians in order to prevent under 16s from accessing their services, an inefficient and burdensome process for everyone.

Parents need clear, efficient ways to oversee the many apps their children use, and that’s why we’ve proposed legislation that requires parental approval and age verification at the operating system and app store level, which reduces the burden and minimises the amount of sensitive information shared.

“We want to…”: TikTok responds to ban

Australia has passed legislation banning children under 16 from using social media in a move to protect young people from threats online. Meta , which owns Instagram and Facebook, has responded to the ban, saying “the government is rushing this legislation.”The ban targets platforms designed primarily for online social interaction, including popular platforms like TikTok, Meta-owned Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit, X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.TikTok said that it is likely the ban could see young people pushed to darker corners of the internet.“Moving forward, it's critical that the Australian government works closely with industry to fix issues created by this rushed process. We want to work together to keep teens safe and reduce the unintended consequences of this law for all Australians,” the company told news agency Reuters.Australia has exempted platforms with different primary functions, such as YouTube, WhatsApp, Google Classroom, and Messenger Kids.","Australia has passed legislation banning children under 16 from using social media in a move to protect young people from threats online.

US' plan to ban 200 Chinese technology companies; China's responds with this warning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-plan-to-ban-200-chinese-technology-companies-chinas-responds-with-this-warning/articleshow/115810869.cms,"US plans to blacklist 200 Chinese chip companies

Why China’s problems may increase

Tensions are rising between the US and China over semiconductor technology, a report has said. China has threatened to retaliate against potential new US export restrictions where the Biden administration is reportedly planning to unveil curbs on chip-related exports to China and blacklist 200 companies.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the Chinese commerce ministry has responded to these reports. Spokesperson He Yadong expressed strong opposition to the US expanding its definition of national security and its “abuse” of export controls targeting Chinese companies.He argued that these actions disrupt the global trade order, destabilise industrial security, and harm cooperation within the semiconductor industry.“These actions severely disrupt the international economic and trade order, destabilise global industrial security, and harm the cooperative efforts between China and the US, as well as the global semiconductor industry,” He said.“If the U.S. insists on escalating control measures, China will take necessary actions to resolutely protect the legitimate rights of Chinese enterprises,” he added.The US Chamber of Commerce recently alerted its members that the administration is considering blacklisting up to 200 Chinese chip companies, effectively cutting them off from most US suppliers.The US has been tightening its grip on semiconductor technology due to concerns that China might use advanced chips to bolster its military capabilities.Bloomberg reported that the proposed restrictions would include curbs on semiconductor equipment and AI memory chips. However, the latest proposal appears to be less severe than initially anticipated, with fewer Huawei suppliers targeted and ChangXin Memory Technologies, a key player in AI memory chip development, reportedly excluded from the blacklist.The restrictions would still impact two chip factories owned by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), a Huawei partner, and over 100 Chinese companies involved in producing semiconductor manufacturing equipment.While the decision on the reported curbs is taken by the Biden Administration, which is due to change in January. There are concerns that President-elect Donald Trump's promise to implement additional tariffs on China could trigger a trade war, Reuters said.Trump has said that his administration will impose an additional 10% tariff on all imports from China, above any existing tariffs.",China has threatened to retaliate against potential new US export restrictions where the Biden administration is reportedly planning to unveil curbs on chip- related exports to China.

Bengaluru, often called the Silicon Valley of India, attracts professionals and students from across the country. This influx has fueled a booming rental housing market. However, it has also become a fertile ground for scammers who prey on the desperation of house hunters. The quest for an affordable, well-located rental home can be challenging enough, but the growing number of rental scams adds a layer of difficulty and risk. A recent incident shared by Ramnath Shenoy, Senior Director of Product at SpotDraft, serves as a stark reminder of these challenges and highlights the need for vigilance in the rental process.Shenoy’s experience sheds light on a widespread issue affecting Bengaluru’s housing market: fraudulent property listings. By detailing his encounter with a scammer, Shenoy provides a cautionary tale and essential lessons for anyone searching for rental accommodation in the city.Ramnath Shenoy began his search for a rental property on 99acres, a popular online real estate platform. To avoid agents and brokers, he filtered his search to display only owner-listed properties. Among the results, a 3BHK apartment in Prestige Pinewood, Koramangala, stood out. The property seemed too good to be true: a spacious apartment in a prime location for just Rs 30,000 per month with a two-month deposit. This pricing was well below market rates, making it an appealing option for Shenoy.Shenoy reached out to the listed owner, who responded professionally and fluently in English. The owner explained that he had relocated to Mangalore for work and was looking for a tenant who could take care of the property. Although Shenoy expressed interest in visiting the apartment, the owner claimed he could only show it on weekends due to his location in Mangalore. To ""secure the deal,"" the owner requested a Rs 5,000 token payment, supposedly to confirm Shenoy’s seriousness as a tenant.At first glance, the listing and the owner's communication seemed legitimate. However, Shenoy's instincts prompted him to dig deeper. During their conversation, Shenoy, a native of Mangalore, casually asked the owner for local recommendations. The owner’s response was suspicious—he mentioned names and locations that Shenoy knew to be fabricated.Despite these doubts, Shenoy requested the UPI payment details. When he received the information, further inconsistencies emerged. The UPI ID provided by the supposed owner appeared unusual and unprofessional. Shortly after, the owner began persistently following up, urging Shenoy to make the payment. This urgency and desperation confirmed Shenoy’s suspicions that the deal was a scam.Shenoy's vigilance saved him from becoming a victim. However, he noted that such scams are not uncommon. In fact, he recounted a similar incident where a friend lost Rs 2,000 to ""visiting charges"" for another fraudulent property listing.Shenoy’s story is one of many. Bengaluru’s fast-paced rental market, combined with high demand for housing, creates opportunities for scammers to thrive. Fraudulent listings often target individuals new to the city, who may not have the time or knowledge to verify property details. These scams frequently involve tactics like:After his narrow escape, Shenoy took to social media to share his experience and warn others about the risks of transferring money without verification. He urged house hunters to never pay a token amount, rent, or deposit without physically visiting the property and meeting the owner or caretaker in person.Shenoy also emphasized the importance of skepticism when a deal seems ""too good to be true."" His story prompted real estate platforms like 99acres and Housing.com to introduce alerts cautioning users against remote payments. These efforts aim to educate users and reduce the risk of fraud.Shenoy’s experience underscores the need for due diligence when searching for rental properties.

In a statement, the bureau claimed Google engaged in conduct designed to lock market participants into using its proprietary ad tech services while excluding competitors.Investigators concluded that Google, as the largest provider of web advertising technology in Canada, strategically maneuvered to entrench its market control. The lawsuit seeks not only the divestment of two ad tech tools but also a financial penalty to promote compliance with competition laws.Google has robustly contested the allegations, arguing that the online advertising market remains intensely competitive with ample choices for buyers and sellers. Dan Taylor, Google's Vice President of Global Ads, emphasized that the company's advertising technologies help websites and apps generate funding while enabling businesses to reach new customers.The Canadian lawsuit parallels ongoing antitrust efforts in the United States, where the Department of Justice is pursuing a similar case against Google's advertising business. Closing arguments in the US case were presented earlier this week, with a potential decision expected imminently.Matthew Boswell, Canada's Commissioner of Competition, stated that Google's conduct has prevented rivals from competing on merit, ultimately harming Canadian advertisers, publishers, and consumers.The case signals escalating global regulatory scrutiny of big tech's market practices, potentially setting a significant precedent for future digital marketplace regulations.",The antitrust watchdog accused Google of abusing its market power through anti- competitive practices.

How an alert SBI staff saved 61-year-old from losing Rs 13-lakh to 'Digital Arrest' scam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-an-alert-sbi-staff-saved-61-year-old-from-losing-rs-13-lakh-to-digital-arrest-scam/articleshow/115790305.cms,"Here’s what happened

Tips to avoid falling victim to digital arrest scam:



A vigilant State Bank of India (SBI) employee averted a significant financial loss for a senior citizen, shedding light on the increasing danger of digital scams aimed at vulnerable individuals.According to an online report by NDTV, a 61-year-old child specialist and a long-time customer of the SBI's AC Guards branch in Hyderabad, was targeted by fraudsters claiming he was under ""digital arrest."" The scammers instructed him to withdraw his money and break his fixed deposits to avoid further legal trouble.An alert bank officer at the AC Guards branch of State Bank of India (SBI) in Hyderabad successfully prevented a senior citizen from falling victim to a 'digital arrest' scam, saving the individual from a potential loss of Rs 13 lakh.As per the report, SBI staff member Surya Swathi noticed the senior citizen's anxious demeanour during his first visit to the branch. Upon inquiring about his large withdrawal request, inconsistencies in his story and a lack of clarity on how he planned to use the funds raised suspicion.Swathi, along with branch manager Kumar Gaud, remained vigilant and employed several tactics to help the customer. They observed his tense behaviour during subsequent visits, noticed him seemingly on a call with the scammers, and even showed him news articles debunking the ""digital arrest"" scam.Finally, after several visits and concerned conversations with SBI staff, the senior citizen realised he was being targeted. He disconnected from the scammer's call and thanked the bank employees for their persistence and intervention.* Never share personal financial information over the phone or email.* Verify the legitimacy of any calls claiming to be from banks or law enforcement agencies.* If unsure about a request, contact your bank directly through a verified phone number.* Educate yourself about common cyber scams to stay vigilant.","A 61-year-old child specialist was targeted by fraudsters claiming he was under ""digital arrest"" The scammers instructed him to withdraw his money and break his fixed deposits to avoid further legal trouble.

These four websites included:

French court order blanket block on 4 adult websites

In a recent effort to protect minors, the Paris Court of Appeal had reportedly ordered French internet service providers (ISPs) to block four pornographic websites lacking robust age verification systems. According to a report in Tech Crunch, ""When the Paris Court of Appeal recently blocked four porn sites in France for not having a proper age verification system, the two online child protection nonprofits that had pushed for the blocks probably thought they’d scored a big victory. But in one case, it turned out to be a bit of a self-own.""* Iciporno* Mrsexe* Tukif* and xHamster.However, a technicality has resulted in an incomplete block. While the court order targeted all four websites, the complaint against xHamster mistakenly listed only the French subdomain "" As a consequence, ISPs have complied with the order by blocking only the French version of the site. The main xHamster website remains accessible in France.This unintended loophole leaves a gap in the court's attempt to restrict access to adult content. French authorities, specifically the regulator Arcom, are now tasked with finding a way to close this loophole and fully implement the court order.Earlier this week, the Paris Court of Appeal ordered the complete blocking of several pornographic websites, including Xhamster and Tukif. The court passed the order over their failure to roll out foolproof age verification systems.As per a report in Politico, the Court of Appeal said in its order that children's general interest was ""an overriding consideration which may justify infringement of other rights such as freedom of expression or communication.""

Unacademy CEO Gaurav Munjal recently criticized the language-learning app Duolingo in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter). Highlighting his personal experience with the app, Munjal shared, “A few months ago, I achieved a 100-day streak on Duolingo for Spanish. However, I still couldn’t speak or write even a few sentences in Spanish.” Using this example, he explained the motivation behind creating Airlearn , a new learning platform aimed at addressing the gaps he observed in existing language education tools.He said that the Airlearn app is a “Language Learning Product that actually helps you learn the Language instead of being a status symbol for a virtual reward which is the Streak.”He said that the first problem with Duolingo is the over simplification of the problem statement. Duolingo does not teach you basic concepts of grammar. “It just makes you do the exercises with the hope that you’ll learn them on your own.”“Whereas Airlearn’s Teaching Slides make sure that you know the Concept first. Our Users love these Slides,” he pointed.He further added “We believe that AI will change personalised tutoring. But it won’t be just about gamification or make you do exercises. It will be about teaching you like a Tutor sitting in front of you will teach. And that’s the design principle we follow while building Airlearn.”In the posts, Munjal also shared multiple screenshots of users’ reviews of Airlearn claiming “Everyday we are making more and more people switch from Duolingo to Airlearn.”Earlier this month, Munjal shared an X post where he revealed that 1 million lessons were completed on Airlearn in October this year. He said that the majority of the Users are from the US, while “Spanish and French are the most popular languages.”","Unacademy CEO Gaurav Munjal recently criticized the language-learning app Duolingo in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter) Highlighting his personal experience with the app, he shared, “A few months ago, I achieved a 100-day streak on Duoingo for Spanish.

CCI launches probe against Google on Winzo's complaint; accuses company of throwing startups out of business in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/cci-launches-probe-against-google-on-winzos-complaint-accuses-company-of-throwing-startups-out-of-business-in-india/articleshow/115774891.cms,"The memo became the first salvo in a 15-year campaign by Google to make deletion the default in its internal communications

What CCI's order against Google says

What Winzo said on CCI order

In a potential blow to Google's dominance in the app market, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has launched an investigation into the tech giant. Online gaming company Winzo has accused Google of abusing its power by restricting real-money gaming apps on the Play Store.Winzo claims that Google's policies force developers to distribute their apps through sideloading, a less secure method. This, according to Winzo, not only limits consumer choice but also poses security risks. The gaming company claimed that due to this unreasonable and restrictive policy of Google, all apps offering real money games of skill are only available for download from their website (a process called sideloading).In an order, the regulator has asked its director general to wrap up the investigation and submit a consolidated report within 60 days. “On a holistic consideration of the facts and circumstances of the present case, the Commission is of the prima facie view that Google appears to be in violation of Sections 4(2)(a)(i), 4(2)(b), and 4(2)(c) of the (Competition) Act, as detailed in this order, which warrants detailed investigation,” the CCI said in the order.“Thus, the informant’s (Winzo's) app can only be downloaded using its website. It has been submitted that when users access the website for downloading the Informant’s app on Android devices, a disclaimer/warning is displayed,” the order said, citing Winzo’s claim.“As per the informant, the aforesaid warning is peculiar to the Google operated Android OS and lack any merit or reason and is completely illegal. The same is claimed to be not only misleading which tarnishes Informant’s market reputation but also is an active misrepresentation resulting in loss of business,” the order said.In a statement, Saumya Singh Rathore, Co-founder WinZO games, said, “The CCI's order is a step toward restoring fairness in the digital ecosystem. Monopolistic practices stifle innovation and hinder competition, which are the lifeblood of any thriving industry. This decision is a significant move to ensure equitable opportunities for all players, fostering innovation and creating a level playing field that benefits both businesses and consumers. The Google Playstore policy to include only Fantasy & Rummy, and Ads Policy to allow only Fantasy & Rummy businesses to advertise on internet, effectively distorts the market as the pilot was live for only two selected categories, driven by monopolistic practices. For example, 95% of the fantasy market is owned by a single player, and 90% of the rummy market is owned by three players. The policy caused the marketing and customer acquisition costs for the selected games to drop to a quarter of the previous spends, disproportionately benefiting the margins of these businesses over others. This had a far-reaching impact when the GST was hiked by 400%. The format included in the policy, ie Fantasy & Rummy could absorb the higher GST regime due to improved margins with this distortion, unlike many other players who did not benefit from this policy further distorting the market dynamics and ability to compete in a fair market. User acquisition and marketing costs constitute more than 60-70% of businesses' expenditures. When the margins for these players increased significantly due to cheaper distribution from Google Playstore, the margins for non-DFS and rummy players did not improve proportionately. This policy has a far-reaching impact on disrupting the market and throwing many early stage ventures out of business. Innovation and creation thrives on fair market conditions, which is what we are fighting for as a business.”","The Competition Commission of India has launched an investigation into the tech giant.

It is said to have its origin in the early 17th century when Pilgrims in Plymouth, Massachusetts, held a feast with Native Americans to celebrate a successful harvest.Over time, it evolved into a national holiday in the United States, marked by family gatherings, feasts, and expressions of gratitude. The holiday now typically involves sharing meals, particularly turkey, and spending time with loved ones. It’s also a time to reflect on blessings and contribute to community well-being through acts of charity.","Thanksgiving is celebrated majorly in the US and Canada to give thanks for the harvest and blessings of the past year.

What makes government database SEVIS all important for student visas

Impact of SEVIS revocation on international students

President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to strip Harvard of its ability to enroll international students — an effort blocked by a federal judge on Friday (May 23), just hours after the university filed a lawsuit claiming it to be a violation of its First Amendment rights . The temporary restraining order stops the government from pulling Harvard’s certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program. “With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard’s student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,” Harvard said in its suit. “Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard.” The ruling from the US District Judge Allison Burroughs puts the sanction against Harvard on hold for now, pending the lawsuit.The government database SEVIS is crucial for managing and tracking the enrollment of international students studying in the United States. For colleges and universities across America, SEVIS serves as a central system administered by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency within DHS. To enroll international students, institutions must be certified to use this database. They are required to input and maintain data within SEVIS for each international student, confirming their full-time enrollment and adherence to the terms of their student visas.Homeland Security's immediate revocation of Harvard's SEVIS certification has potentially severe consequences for the university's nearly 6,800 international students. While their visas have not been canceled, Harvard's inability to log them into the SEVIS database could, in theory, render these students immediately deportable. Without Harvard's active SEVIS enrollment records, the students would be considered in violation of their visa status.The immediate recourse for these students would be to transfer to another SEVIS-certified institution. Failure to take such action and enroll elsewhere would place them in violation of their visa terms, making them subject to removal from the United States.Typically, international students are granted a 60-day grace period after graduating to either depart the country or adjust their immigration status, often by securing employment. Furthermore, students returning to their programs are usually permitted to remain in the U.S. during summer breaks as long as they are still enrolled for the upcoming academic term. However, with the termination of Harvard's SEVIS access, the status of students who would normally be eligible for this summer grace period remains uncertain.","The government database SEVIS is crucial for managing and tracking the enrollment of international students studying in the United States.

Experts call idea of making iPhones in the US ""a fairy tale""

US President Donald Trump's 25% tariff threat on iPhones sold in the US but made elsewhere is not limited to Apple. It is for all smartphone companies that sell their devices in the US. Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump emphasized that the tariffs would target all smartphones not manufactured in the United States. Talking to reporters, Trump clarified that his stand on smartphone manufacturing is the same for all companies selling in the US as it is for Apple. He said that the 25% tariff would also apply to Samsung and other smartphone makers.Earlier on Friday (May 23), Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Apple for any iPhones sold, but not made, in the United States. The president targeted Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, who visited Trump at the White House last week. In a post on Truth Social, the President wrote that iPhones sold in the United States should be ""manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else."" If they are not, Trump said the smartphones would face a 25% tariff. Trump's push on US manufacturing is part of his administration's goal of re-shoring jobs.""Otherwise it wouldn't be fair"" if it did not apply to all imported smartphones, Trump said. ""I had an understanding with (Apple CEO) Tim (Cook) that he wouldn't be doing this. He said he's going to India to build plants. I said that's OK to go to India but you're not going to sell into here without tariffs.""Trump's 25% tariff threat may hurt Samsung. The South Korean smartphone company is the second biggest smartphone brand by sales in the US, according to research firm Counterpoint. About 60% of the 220 million phones Samsung sells each year globally are made in Vietnam, and many are destined for the US.Trump said that the 25% tariff will come into effect sometime in June end.During a recent visit to the Middle East, Trump expressed frustration with Apple CEO Tim Cook. “You're my friend… but now I hear you're building all over India. I don't want you building in India,” he reportedly told the Apple CEO.Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, in a research note wrote that moving iPhone production to the United States could take up to a decade and may result in iPhones costing $3,500 each. Apple's top-of-the-line iPhone currently retails at around $1,200. ""We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the US is a fairy tale that is not feasible,"" Ives said.Apple has already committed to producing some AI servers in Houston and purchasing $19 billion worth of U.S.-made chips, but Trump remains dissatisfied that iPhones, iPads, and Macs are still assembled abroad.",US President Donald Trump's 25% tariff threat on iPhones sold in the US but made elsewhere is not limited to Apple.

Google Veo 3 related FAQs

What is

Google Veo 3

and how is it different from older versions?

Veo 3 is Google’s AI video model that now includes synchronized audio, unlike Veo 2 which only produced silent visuals.

How can I access Google Veo 3 and what does it cost?

It is currently available in the U.S. via the Gemini app’s Ultra plan for $249.99/month and through Vertex AI for enterprise users.

Can Veo 3 replace human filmmakers?

Not entirely. While Veo 3 is powerful, it serves as a tool for creative augmentation, not a total replacement for human storytelling, direction, or emotion.

When will Veo 3 launch in India?

No official date yet, but Google is expected to expand to India soon, especially with high creator interest.

In a historic announcement at Google I/O 2025, the tech giant unveiled its most ambitious AI video generation model to date: Veo 3. This latest iteration marks a significant leap forward in artificial intelligence, blurring the boundaries between human-created and machine-generated content. What sets Veo 3 apart is not just its ability to create strikingly realistic visuals from simple text prompts, but its newly introduced capability to generate synchronized audio—dialogue, background noise, music, and ambient sound—all in one seamless output.For decades, the dream of creating cinematic experiences through AI has remained largely in the realm of science fiction. Today, Veo 3 transforms that dream into a tangible reality. Designed for content creators, educators, marketers, and filmmakers, Veo 3 dramatically lowers the barrier to professional-grade video production. With just a few words, users can generate rich, immersive videos that would have previously required a crew, equipment, and significant post-production resources. The implications are immense, not only for entertainment but for education, journalism, business, and beyond.Google’s Veo 3 is the third and most advanced version of its generative video model. Unlike its predecessor, Veo 2, which could only create silent video clips, Veo 3 adds the missing piece: natural-sounding, context-aware audio. This includes:This fusion of sound and vision results in an experience that is eerily close to real life. One of Veo 3’s key differentiators is its ability to synchronize lip movements with dialogue, making characters in the video appear convincingly human. Furthermore, it understands context. For example, if a user inputs the prompt: ""a thunderstorm at sea with a ship struggling against the waves,"" the result is a cinematic video complete with storm sounds, creaking wood, and urgent narration—entirely AI-generated.Veo 3 is built upon a foundation of multimodal AI, combining natural language processing (NLP), text-to-video diffusion models, and text-to-speech synthesis with generative adversarial networks (GANs). Key features include:Google’s use of its Gemini Ultra foundation model also enables Veo 3 to understand nuanced instructions such as tone of voice, cinematic mood, or specific cultural settings.Since its debut, creators have flocked to Veo 3 to explore its capabilities. Viral content quickly surfaced across social platforms like X (formerly Twitter), YouTube, and TikTok.As of May 2025, Veo 3 is available exclusively in the United States and only for premium subscribers. Access is granted through:It’s also integrated into Google’s Vertex AI suite, making it available for enterprise-level customers, media studios, and advertising agencies. While this price point is clearly aimed at serious professionals, Google has hinted at future pricing models that could allow broader access, especially as demand scales.What makes Veo 3 more than just a tool is the democratization of creativity it enables. For decades, creating even a short professional video required expensive equipment, a team of specialists, and post-production work. With Veo 3, creators now just need an idea and a few sentences.This shift redefines how we approach storytelling. Students can create history projects that look like documentaries. Small businesses can produce polished ads without agencies. Independent filmmakers can prototype entire scenes before investing in production.Google also touts Veo 3’s educational potential, especially in multilingual regions. The model can render the same video in different languages with native-style voiceovers, offering powerful tools for global teaching and accessibility.Currently, there is no confirmed timeline for Veo 3’s global rollout, including availability in India. However, given the country’s booming content creation economy and rising adoption of generative AI, industry watchers expect India to be among the first wave of international markets.In the meantime, Google is working to expand infrastructure and compliance for its Vertex AI and Gemini platforms in Asia. Localization support, including regional languages, could be a key part of Veo 3’s expansion strategy.As with any powerful AI tool, Veo 3 raises questions around:Google claims to have embedded robust watermarking and usage detection systems to combat misuse. Additionally, all content generated with Veo 3 includes metadata tags for AI attribution. Still, ongoing discussions about ethics and regulation are likely to follow Veo’s broader adoption.","Veo 3 is Google’s AI video model that now includes synchronized audio, unlike Veo 2 which only produced silent visuals.

Tinder CEO Faye Loscotaluno to step down in July this year

Read Tinder CEO Faye Loscotaluno’s LinkedIn post here



After almost 8 unforgettable years at

and

, I’ve made the incredibly hard decision to step down as Tinder’s CEO in July.

It’s difficult to put into words what this journey has meant to me. From driving growth and strategy across the portfolio through expansion, acquisitions, and new partnerships, to mentoring incredible talent along the way, I’ve had the privilege of helping shape how tens of millions of people around the world find meaningful connection.

As CEO of Tinder, I’ve been especially proud to build and work alongside an exceptional team, including leaders who’ve pushed each other to raise the bar, build with purpose, and unlock new value for our users. Together, we’ve redefined what the Tinder brand stands for through award-winning marketing work, brought forward product innovation that breaks from old paradigms through friend-forward features, doubled down on personalization by further integrating AI into recommendations, shown the potential for native AI-driven consumer experiences, and laid the foundation for the company’s next chapter.



What’s next for me is deeply personal. The consumer tech landscape is evolving in exciting, unpredictable ways – and so are my own ambitions. My daughters are growing up fast and I think often about the technology I want them to experience and the world I want them to inherit: one where they see themselves reflected in leadership, innovation, and opportunity. Building upon the headway and lessons I've learned at Tinder where diverse voices around the table make better and more impactful decisions, I’m drawn to replicating that progress by supporting and building alongside the next generation of women leaders, founders, and investors. With AI now expanding what’s possible, there’s never been a more powerful moment for new voices to create and lead. That work will be a meaningful part of my next chapter, along with exploring where I can drive impact across this changing landscape.

To my colleagues: a heartfelt thank you. I leave with profound gratitude for the work we’ve done, the values we’ve lived, and the impact still to come. Tinder is in great hands with

and the leadership team. I’m excited to see you keep pushing boundaries, redefining what’s possible, and building a future that reflects the full potential of this brand…and the people behind it.

With artificial intelligence (AI) becoming a regular global presence, corporate communication is experiencing a notable shift. Two prominent tech CEOs, Eric Yuan of Zoom and Sebastian Siemiatkowski of Klarna, have recently utilised AI avatars to present during their respective quarterly earnings calls, highlighting a growing embrace of the technology within C-suites.Zoom CEO Eric Yuan deployed his custom AI avatar for initial remarks during a recent earnings call. The avatar was created using Zoom Clips, the company's asynchronous video creation tool.""I am proud to be among the first CEOs to use an avatar in an earnings call. It is just one example of how Zoom is pushing the boundaries of communication and collaboration,"" the avatar said. The company also underscored its commitment to trust and security, affirming that safeguards are in place to prevent misuse and protect user identity for AI-generated content.Similarly, Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski's AI avatar presented highlights during the buy-now-pay-later firm's recent quarterly earnings. While the presentation from the AI avatar was largely human-like, subtle cues, such as infrequent blinking and minor voice synchronization discrepancies, indicated its artificial nature.Recently, Google co-founder Sergey Brin discussed the growing role of AI in management, particularly for top-level executives. Speaking on the ‘All In’ podcast, Brin detailed how he leveraged an AI tool to assist in managing the Gemini product team.Brin explained that the AI analysed extensive chat logs and conversations to simplify complex discussions, answering intricate queries based on the comprehensive data. He also revealed that he used AI utility in identifying a deserving candidate for an appraisal whom he had not personally recognized.""It actually picked out this young woman engineer who I didn’t even notice, she wasn’t very vocal. I talked to the manager, actually, and he was like, ‘Yeah, you’re right.

Mark Zuckerberg takes the stand as FTC trial continues

What comes next for Meta

Meta , the tech giant behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has requested a federal judge to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) high-profile antitrust case, just as the trial approaches a critical phase. According to the, the case, which began in early April, represents one of the most significant regulatory challenges faced by Meta in its history, potentially resulting in the breakup of the company’s social media empire.Meta's move to dismiss the case comes after the FTC rested its side of the argument, asserting that the company holds an illegal monopoly over the social networking market, particularly those platforms focused on friends-and-family connections. Meta, however, argues that the FTC's case is based on a flawed market definition and ignores the intense competition it faces from newer platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X (formerly known as Twitter).In a court filing late Thursday, Meta reiterated its stance that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standards required to prove its antitrust allegations. The company’s legal team argues that the FTC has fundamentally mischaracterized the social media market, claiming that the agency's definition is overly narrow and excludes significant competitors.“After five weeks of trial, it is clear that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standard required under antitrust law,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement on Friday. “Regardless, we will present our case to show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram competes with TikTok (and YouTube and X and many other apps).”Meta claims that it faces substantial competition from a wide range of digital platforms, including short-video giant TikTok, video-sharing platform YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X. These platforms, Meta argues, all compete for user engagement, advertising revenue, and market share, undercutting the FTC’s claim that Meta has maintained an unlawful monopoly.The FTC’s antitrust lawsuit, which was first filed in December 2020, centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The agency claims that Meta pursued a deliberate “buy or bury” strategy, acquiring these fast-growing competitors to neutralize potential threats to its dominant position in the social networking market.In its filing, the FTC pointed to internal Meta communications as evidence of this strategy. This includes a 2012 email from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggesting that buying Instagram would “neutralize a competitor.” The FTC further argues that these acquisitions reduced consumer choice and stifled innovation, limiting competition in the rapidly evolving social media industry.The FTC's case aims to convince U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to order Meta to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp, effectively dismantling the company's integrated social media ecosystem.Meta's defense in the trial has focused on presenting itself as a company that supports innovation and benefits consumers. In its Thursday filing, the company argued that its acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth, which in turn delivered significant benefits to users.“Meta’s acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth – with correspondingly massive benefits for US consumers,” the company stated in its court filing.However, the trial has also brought to light internal documents that may complicate Meta’s defense. For instance, a 2018 email from an unnamed Instagram executive warned that ""fake engagement could be in the range of 40%,"" potentially undermining Meta's claims about the platform’s integrity and user trust.Mark Zuckerberg himself was the first witness called by the FTC as the trial opened, highlighting the personal stakes for the Meta CEO. During his testimony, Zuckerberg sought to portray Meta as a company facing fierce competition, rather than a monopoly crushing potential rivals.Earlier in the trial, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom testified that he felt Zuckerberg viewed Instagram’s rapid growth as a potential threat to Facebook’s dominance after the acquisition, further fueling the FTC’s argument that Meta's mergers were designed to stifle competition.The 10-week non-jury trial, which is expected to conclude in June, will be followed by final briefs from both the FTC and Meta. If Judge Boasberg sides with the FTC, a second trial will be held to determine appropriate remedies, potentially including the forced divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp.Meta will continue presenting its defense when the trial resumes on Monday. The company’s attempt to dismiss the case outright remains a long shot, as the judge may choose to let the case proceed to its scheduled conclusion before issuing a ruling.","The FTC's antitrust lawsuit centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.

Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn makes a prediction on how AI will change schools in future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/duolingo-ceo-luis-von-ahn-makes-a-prediction-on-how-ai-will-change-schools-in-future/articleshow/121290768.cms,"Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn feels that AI will take over teaching



Schools won’t disappear, but their role will change: Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn



Duolingo CEO Luis von Ann recently predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) will fundamentally transform education, shifting the role of schools from traditional learning institutions to childcare and supervised spaces. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the No Priors podcast, von Ahn stressed on the fact that AI’s scalability makes it more efficient than human teachers and it can be easily used for personalised education. ""Education is going to change. It's just a lot more scalable to teach with AI than with teachers,” von Ahn said.Von Ahn suggests that AI will increasingly handle the core instruction in schools. He believes that AI can deliver personalised education more effectively than traditional classroom models with teachers. AI system can be designed to precisely track individual student progress, identify areas where they struggle and then tailor the learning experience accordingly.While Von Ahn does not believe schools will vanish, he foresees a future where AI tutors handle most of the teaching, while schools primarily serve as safe environments for children. He explained that AI can track individual student performance in real time, adjusting lesson plans to match each child’s learning pace—something human teachers struggle to do in large classrooms.“That doesn't mean the teachers are going to go away. You still need people to take care of the students. I also don't think schools are going to go away because you still need childcare,” von Ahn said on the podcast.This doesn't mean teachers will become obsolete, according to von Ahn. Instead, their responsibilities may evolve. Teachers could transition from primarily delivering instruction to supervising students, providing guidance, and fostering social and emotional development.Von Ahn also points out that the integration of AI in education is already happening. Duolingo, for example, is restructuring its operations to embrace an ""AI-first"" approach. This includes using AI for tasks previously done by contractors and incorporating AI into employee performance reviews.","Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn predicts that AI will transform education.

It's not just about cheap labour, but also speed and scale



The workforce disconnect





Could automation be what solve Trump's quest to make iPhones in the US?



The 'Asian' supply chain puzzle

And finally, the cost equation

India is the only alternative to China for Apple, at least for now



The reality check

Tim Cook seems to have run into a ""little problem"" with the US President Donald Trump , who wants Apple to expand iPhone manufacturing in America, not India. During a state visit to Qatar, Trump revealed his conversation with the Apple CEO: ""I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday. He is building all over India. I don't want you building in India.""The President claimed Cook agreed to increase US production, saying, ""I told Cook India can take care of themselves, they are doing very well,"" and as a result, Apple will be ""upping their production in the United States."" But Trump's pressure didn't stop there.On Friday morning, he escalated his demands on Truth Social, declaring: ""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.""Although, it's unclear whether Cook has actually committed to this shift in strategy, after he had said in the Q2 earnings call that all the iPhones sold in the US will be made in India.The confrontation represents the latest chapter in a long-running saga of presidential administrations pushing for Apple to manufacture domestically. Trump's first term saw similar pressure, with then-White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisting, ""He believes we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it."" Trump even suggested on his Truth Social network that ""This is a great time to move your company into the US, like Apple, and so many others, in record numbers, are doing.""But shifting iPhone manufacturing from Asia to America isn't as simple as a presidential directive. The complex reality of global supply chains, labor markets, and manufacturing capabilities makes Trump's demand extraordinarily difficult to fulfill in the near term.Trump isn't the first president to push Apple toward domestic manufacturing. In 2011, President Barack Obama asked Steve Jobs during a Silicon Valley dinner, ""What would it take to make iPhones in the United States?""Jobs's response was blunt: ""Those jobs aren't coming back.""The late Apple founder explained that the company employed 700,000 factory workers in China because it needed 30,000 engineers on-site to support those operations. ""You can't find that many in America to hire,"" Jobs told Obama, according to Walter Isaacson's biography.Current CEO Tim Cook echoed this sentiment in 2017, telling Fortune magazine that Apple's reliance on countries like China wasn't primarily about cheap labor.""The reason is because of the skill and the quantity of skill in one location, and the type of skill,"" Cook said. ""In the US you could have a meeting of tooling engineers, and I'm not sure we could fill the room. In China you could fill multiple football fields.""This skills gap hasn't narrowed significantly in the years since. Manufacturing expertise is developed over decades, not months, and the US has been losing this institutional knowledge for generations as production moved overseas. The specialized tooling required for precision iPhone assembly represents a formidable barrier to entry that tariffs alone cannot overcome. As Priyank Kharge, the former information technology minister of Karnataka in India, observed while successfully wooing Apple to his region: ""You need a rich talent pool that's already trained in electronics manufacturing, which takes years to develop.""As Tarun Pathak, Research Director at Counterpoint, explains: ""Every government would like to bring manufacturing locally to their country in theory but in practical world it has lot of moving parts. It took almost a decade and a half for Apple to build such a complex and high-quality supply chain.""A former Apple executive shared a story, more than a decade ago, that illustrates the manufacturing capabilities gap. When a last-minute design change required modifications to the iPhone's screen, a Chinese factory responded with remarkable speed.Around midnight, a foreman ""roused 8,000 workers inside the company's dormitories,"" the executive recounted. ""Each employee was given a biscuit and a cup of tea, guided to a workstation and within half an hour started a 12-hour shift fitting glass screens into beveled frames. Within 96 hours, the plant was producing more than 10,000 iPhones a day.""""The speed and flexibility is breathtaking,"" the executive told the New York Times, in 2012. ""There's no American plant that can match that.""This manufacturing agility isn't simply a matter of labor costs or availability. It reflects a deeply integrated ecosystem where proximity matters tremendously. The Financial Times analysis of Apple's supply chain found that ""The close proximity of suppliers and manufacturers is crucial to Apple's productivity.""As Andy Tsay, professor of information systems at Santa Clara University's Leavey Business School, explains: ""There are a lot of advantages to co-locating the activities in the supply chain, in terms of speed and quality of communication and innovation in the product and process design."" When components must travel across oceans rather than across town, the entire manufacturing process becomes more cumbersome and less responsive to sudden changes.Matthew Moore, a former Apple manufacturing engineer, put the scale in stark perspective: ""What city in America is going to put everything down and build only iPhones? Because there are millions of people employed by the Apple supply chain in China,"" he told Bloomberg. ""Boston is over 500,000 people. The whole city would need to stop everything and start assembling iPhones.""Beyond the physical infrastructure, there's also a mismatch between Trump's manufacturing vision and American workforce preferences.A 2024 survey by the Cato Institute and YouGov found that while 80% of Americans believe the country would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, only 25% wanted such jobs for themselves.The gap between American and Asian workplace expectations also presents challenges. A deeply reported piece on TSMC's new semiconductor plant in Arizona by The Verge found significant cultural differences.""The American engineers complained of rigid, counterproductive hierarchies at the company; Taiwanese TSMC veterans described their American counterparts as lacking the kind of dedication and obedience they believe to be the foundation of their company's world-leading success,"" the article reported.Even with substantial government incentives, similar experiments have failed before. When Motorola tried to manufacture smartphones in Fort Worth, Texas in 2013, the factory closed within a year due to high costs and disappointing sales. The same structural challenges that doomed that effort remain largely unchanged today.Pathak notes the fundamental challenge: ""In the end Americans will end up paying more for everything. Supply chains are all Asia heavy and won't move unless US is giving massive subsidies to dilute disabilities but even then it will take 2-3 years.""Although, Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick , suggests that the people problem could be solved with robots, and that's not him but he says Cook himself has said so. In a CNBC interview, he revealed a conversation with Cook about bringing iPhone manufacturing to America.""I talked to Tim Cook the other day and said, 'When are you going to bring the iPhone manufacturing here?'"" Lutnick said. ""He said, 'I need to have the robotic arms to do it at a scale and precision that would allow me to bring it here.'""Lutnick framed the potential shift as part of what he calls the ""AI industrial revolution,"" suggesting Americans would work as high-paid technicians rather than assembly workers. ""Americans are going to work in factories just like this in great high-paying jobs. They're going to be trained as technicians... They're not going to be the ones screwing components in.""But automation presents its own challenges. The iPhone's design, which uses numerous tiny screws rather than glue for assembly, currently makes human assembly more cost-effective than robotic solutions. The technology required for fully automated iPhone assembly at scale doesn't yet exist, and developing it would require significant investment with uncertain returns. Each iPhone contains approximately 74 tiny screws of various types, and automating their precise placement would be a monumental engineering challenge.The argument is not just about skilled labor but also about the intricate supply chain ecosystem that has evolved in Asia. An iPhone consists of roughly 2,700 different parts sourced from 187 suppliers across 28 countries, according to Financial Times research. Less than 5% of iPhone components are currently made in the US, including glass casing, the lasers that enable Face ID, and some chips.China is responsible for manufacturing the majority of remaining components, but most high-tech parts are produced in Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan.There's also the matter of rare earth elements, which are essential for smartphone production. Components like the iPhone's battery, which uses lanthanum to extend its life, and the screen, which requires dysprosium to enhance colors, rely on materials that China processes in overwhelming quantities.According to the US Geological Survey, America imports 70% of its rare earth compounds from China, giving Beijing significant leverage in any manufacturing shift. China has already placed export restrictions on some rare earths in response to Trump's tariffs, potentially complicating any US manufacturing plans.Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, told CNN that US-made iPhones could cost around $3,500, more than triple the current ~$1,000 price tag, due to the necessity of replicating Asia's complex production ecosystem.""You build that (supply chain) in the US with a fab in West Virginia and New Jersey. They'll be $3,500 iPhones,"" Ives said. He estimated it would cost Apple approximately $30 billion and three years to relocate just 10% of their supply chain to the US.While it's clear how the proposed 25% tariffs, if they ever go into effect, would significantly impact iPhone prices for American consumers, the broader economic implications extend far beyond Apple's bottom line. India currently benefits from the baseline 10% tariff that applies globally, a substantial advantage over China's elevated 30% rate. While iPhones and most Apple products remain largely exempt from these tariff structures for now, this landscape could shift dramatically in the coming months, if Trump enforces his 25% rates on iPhones coming to the US from India. But, would that be enough for Apple to shift majority of its manufacturing to the United States?The economic calculus becomes is challenging, especially when considering the scale of Apple's operations. The company ships more than 230 million iPhones annually, roughly equivalent to producing 438 devices every minute. Building a US manufacturing base capable of matching this output would require not just factories, but entire new industrial ecosystems. As the Motorola example demonstrated, building a factory without the supporting supply chain infrastructure is a recipe for failure.Morgan Stanley analysts projected ""several billions"" in costs for Apple to shift even a portion of iPhone production to America, making domestic manufacturing financially prohibitive compared to simply paying new tariffs, and these new tariffs, if remain same as now, would add $900 million to Apple's costs.Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who's been known for his reporting on Apple, notes that it'll be more profitable for Apple to manufacture the iPhones sold in the US in India, and take Trump's 25% than to move the assembly to the US.Rather than shifting to the US, and this is what Trump's little problem is, Apple has been methodically building its Indian manufacturing presence for years, beginning with older iPhone models in 2017 and gradually expanding to include the latest versions.This shift accelerated after COVID-19 disrupted Chinese operations and as US-China tensions grew. Apple now produces its entire iPhone lineup in India, including premium titanium Pro models. The company's commitment to India remains unwavering, with Foxconn recently announcing plans to expand its manufacturing capacity in the country, further solidifying the supply chain infrastructure that took years to develop.Now, Apple will be manufacturing most of the iPhones that were to be sold in the US this quarter in India.Apple's Indian strategy is already paying dividends. In early 2025, recognizing the looming threat of Trump's tariffs, the company took extraordinary measures to increase its Indian production. As Reuters reported, Apple chartered cargo flights to ferry 600 tons of iPhones, approximately 1.5 million devices, to the United States from India in an effort to beat the tariff implementation deadline. The company even secured a ""green corridor"" arrangement at Chennai airport, reducing customs clearance time from 30 hours to just six hours, mirroring a similar arrangement it has in China.The economic advantages of this approach are significant. While Trump's China tariffs reached 125% (although, now it's been lowered to at least 30%), imports from India faced only a 26% tariff, which has now been paused for 90 days. Bank of America analysts estimate that prior to the tariff announcements, Apple was on pace to produce about 25 million iPhones in India this year, potentially meeting approximately 50% of American demand. Now it's going to serve about 100% of demand from India.Pathak emphasizes why India remains the logical choice: ""India remains the only potential manufacturing destination for any player beyond China as the ecosystem is mushrooming, aided by lower-cost English-speaking skilled labour, world-class software talent, favourable government policies such as PLI, and a huge domestic consumption market.""Despite Trump's public pressure, Indian officials remain confident in Apple's commitment. ""There is no change in Apple's investment plans in India,"" a government source told CNBC-TV18, adding that the company has ""assured the Indian government"" of its continued commitment.Rajoo Goel, Secretary General of the Electronic Industries Association of India, characterized Trump's comments as ""just a statement"" and expressed optimism that the US President ""might change his stance,"" in a discussion with CNBC TV18, after Trump's comments.As Prabhu Ram, Vice President of Industry Research Group, observes: ""Apple finds itself once again in the crosshairs of a belligerent 'America First' policy stance, navigating the tightrope between inflationary pressures and absorbing costs. While the tariff see-saw is likely to continue, planting more seeds for U.S. manufacturing, India's role as a critical cog in Apple's global supply chain will only grow stronger.""Counterpoint's Pathak maintains a pragmatic outlook: ""We still think these are very initial days and might evolve into something very different. This can go in different directions but we are maintaining our stand that China and India will continue to play a key role in manufacturing operations for Apple.""The reality is that Apple's supply chain decisions are driven by complex business considerations that extend beyond political pressure. For a company that earned approximately $400 in profit margins (about 36%) on each iPhone 16 Pro, dramatically increasing manufacturing costs could devastate its business model.Whether Apple will navigate these conflicting pressures by attempting some symbolic US manufacturing or doubling down on its India strategy remains to be seen. But the structural challenges that Steve Jobs identified over a decade ago haven't disappeared, making Trump's ""little problem"" with Apple a bigger manufacturing dilemma than a presidential directive can easily solve.","US President Donald Trump wants Apple to expand iPhone manufacturing in America, not India. The President claimed Cook agreed to increase US production, saying, ""I told Cook India can take care of themselves, they are doing very well"" The complex reality of global supply chains, labor markets, and manufacturing capabilities makes Trump's demand extraordinarily difficult to fulfill in the near term.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121213067,imgsize-2188008,width-400,resizemode-4/Apple-CEO-Tim-Cook-greeting-customers-at-Apples-first-India-store-opening.jpg"

Reason for the delay in the sale on OnlyFans



Valuation and other regulatory concerns

Leonid Radvinsky , the billionaire owner of the adult content platform OnlyFans, is reportedly planning to sell the platform. According a report by Reuters, Radvinsky is facing trouble in selling the highly profitable website. Despite the huge financial success, OnlyFans’s X-rated business model is proving to be a major deterrent for potential buyers. For those unware, Radvinsky acquired OnlyFans on 2019. During the COVID period the website witnessed huge surge.According to Reuters, OnlyFans owner is in talks to sell the adult platform to a porn-driven company for around $8 billion. Radvinsky, a computer programmer acquired OnlyFans in 2019. He witnessed a growth of $3.8 million in his net worth, attributed due to platform’s growth during COVID-19 lockdowns. The report also reveals that the platform’s revenue exceeded $6.6 billion as of November 2023 and Radvinsky himself received dividends of $1 billion from his company holding.As per Reuters, the company is facing a delay in the process of selling the business due to the explicit nature of OnlyFans' content. While an OnlyFans spokeswoman stated that the company is ""open to discussions about how we continue to build on our success,"" industry insiders suggest that many potential investors view OnlyFans primarily as an adult content company, rather than a general content platform that simply allows adult material.The Reuters report further adds that OnlyFans could be valued between $1.46 billion and $2.42 billion in a sale. However, the ""adult-only"" reputation is not the only challenge. The platform also faces an intensifying regulatory environment. Recent legislation in various jurisdictions, including the UK and the EU, has introduced stricter age verification requirements and increased liability for content platforms. Furthermore, the vulnerability to payment processing disruptions, as financial institutions often classify adult content as high-risk, adds another layer of complexity for potential buyers.","OnlyFans owner Leonid Radvinsky planning to sell the platform for $8 billion.

While Walmart has long been known for its extensive retail presence with over 1.6 million US. employees, it is now focusing on reshaping its corporate and technological divisions to enhance efficiency and adaptability. Sources reveal that the downsizing primarily affects the global technology team and certain advertising roles, with fewer than 1,500 employees impacted overall.This restructuring is a strategic move to reduce complexity and accelerate decision-making in the face of rapidly evolving retail challenges. Although Walmart has outperformed many competitors recently, economic pressures such as inflation and tariffs continue to weigh heavily on the company’s outlook.According to a report by Bloomberg citing insider sources, Walmart has begun cutting corporate staff at its Bentonville, Arkansas headquarters and other offices. The layoffs are part of a broader initiative aimed at cost-cutting and improving operational efficiency amid ongoing economic volatility. While Walmart has not publicly commented on the layoffs, internal communications from senior leadership shed light on the company’s rationale.An internal memo signed by Walmart’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Suresh Kumar and US. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) John Furner outlines that the staffing changes are designed to simplify the organizational structure, accelerate decision-making processes, and reduce operational complexities. The memo also notes that Walmart is not only eliminating some roles but simultaneously creating new positions that better align with future business priorities.The most affected group appears to be Walmart’s global technology team, which plays a crucial role in supporting the retailer’s vast digital and supply chain infrastructure. Sources indicate that fewer than 1,500 employees will be impacted by the cuts within this division.The restructuring aims to simplify the tech team’s structure to enable faster responses to market changes and customer demands. By removing layers of management and reducing friction in workflows, Walmart hopes to enhance agility and innovation within its technology operations.In addition to the technology team, Walmart is revamping its advertising business. The internal memo reveals changes to the structure of advertising roles, indicating a strategic shift to optimize Walmart’s digital marketing efforts and better leverage data-driven ad platforms.This move reflects Walmart’s increased emphasis on competing in the digital advertising space, where it faces stiff competition from giants like Amazon and Google. Streamlining advertising operations is expected to enhance Walmart’s ability to target customers more effectively and drive revenue growth.Cedric Clark, Executive Vice President of Store Operations at Walmart US, highlighted in a separate memo the challenges associated with store fulfillment. He explained that the current process involves multiple points of contact, which can create friction and inefficiencies, especially around digital orders.To address these issues, Walmart is making changes to roles that manage digital orders and store fulfillment processes. These adjustments aim to smooth operations, reduce delays, and ultimately improve the customer experience by making online order fulfillment faster and more reliable.Despite the layoffs, Walmart has maintained strong market performance in 2025. As of May 21, Walmart shares had risen approximately 6.7% for the year, outperforming the S&P 500 index, Bloomberg reports. This reflects investor confidence in Walmart’s ability to navigate economic headwinds through strategic restructuring and operational improvements.However, Walmart has also issued warnings about potential price increases driven by higher tariffs, a stance that recently drew criticism from former President Donald Trump. The company’s ability to manage inflationary pressures while maintaining competitiveness will be critical in the coming quarters.This round of layoffs follows a broader reorganization earlier in the year, in February 2025, when Walmart cut some jobs and consolidated offices by relocating employees to central hubs in Arkansas and California. This earlier restructuring was part of Walmart’s ongoing efforts to adapt its business model amid shifting retail landscapes and growing e-commerce demands.With a workforce of approximately 1.6 million employees in the US., Walmart remains the country’s largest private employer. The current corporate-level layoffs signal a more focused approach to optimizing internal functions, particularly in technology and digital services.The retail sector continues to face multiple challenges in 2025, including:In this context, Walmart’s decision to cut corporate roles while creating new positions aligned with future priorities reflects a strategic balance between cost management and growth-oriented transformation.","According to a report by Bloomberg citing insider sources, Walmart has begun cutting corporate staff at its Bentonville, Arkansas headquarters and other offices.

Politically unstable (e.g., conflict zones)

Economically marginalized (e.g., post-colonial rural areas)

No access to telemedicine during health crises

No remote learning during pandemic lockdowns

No early-warning systems during floods, cyclones, or earthquakes

Tech has transformed lives across much of the globe, with billions swiping, streaming, and scrolling through life. But for an astonishing 2.6 billion people—nearly a third of the global population—the internet remains out of reach. These individuals live beyond the edge of connectivity, often in remote villages carved into mountains, scattered across deserts, or hidden deep within tropical jungles. In these regions, Wi-Fi is non-existent, smartphones are rare, and the very concept of digital inclusion feels foreign. Despite the internet becoming central to everything from education and banking to health care and disaster response, a vast segment of humanity remains in digital darkness.Disconnected not by choice, but by circumstance, these communities span from the high Himalayas of India to the savannas of central Africa and the Amazon basin. Their daily lives are shaped not by tweets or TikToks, but by oral tradition, land-based navigation, and deeply rooted communal knowledge. This exclusion is not just about missing out on convenience—it has serious consequences for education, health, safety, and economic opportunity. In 2025, the persistence of offline villages is a humanitarian and developmental challenge as much as a technological one.According to a 2023 report by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), roughly 2.6 billion people remain offline. The digital divide has narrowed over the past decade, but significant disparities remain. Most of the disconnected live in developing countries, often in regions that are:The offline population is disproportionately rural, poor, and underrepresented. Many communities lack not just internet access , but even basic telecommunications infrastructure like 2G mobile coverage or landlines.At over 14,000 feet, the Himalayan village of Kibber in India’s Spiti Valley might have postcard views, but it’s digitally isolated. Students there hike to ridges where a weak mobile signal allows them to download homework or send completed assignments. With no broadband, learning depends on weather, topography, and sheer persistence.In northern Mali, decades of conflict have shattered digital infrastructure. Armed groups routinely disable towers, making even basic mobile communication a rarity. In this void, oral traditions and storytelling remain dominant, linking generations through memory rather than media.In villages in Papua New Guinea, GPS means nothing. There are no Google Maps, and few have ever touched a smartphone. Directions are traced in dust, passed from elder to child. The digital world is more myth than memory here.The idea of places untouched by technology often captures the imagination. No ads. No screen fatigue. No surveillance. But behind the romantic notion of a disconnected utopia lie harsh realities:The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare the consequences. In 2020 and 2021, entire offline regions received vaccine updates, lockdown guidelines, and emergency warnings late—if at all. The absence of digital connection didn’t protect them from the virus; it made them more vulnerable.Not all offline communities are victims of circumstance. In parts of rural Vermont or among Amish populations in Pennsylvania, disconnection is a conscious choice. Motivated by:These groups navigate the digital world on their own terms, often using limited tech for essential tasks while rejecting broader adoption. But they are the exception.For the majority of the 2.6 billion offline people, disconnection is structural, not spiritual.Elon Musk’s Starlink, a low-Earth orbit satellite constellation, has been hailed as a possible equalizer. In theory, it can beam broadband to any corner of the planet. In practice, however:Alphabet’s Project Loon, which used high-altitude balloons to deliver internet, was grounded in 2021. Despite promising trials in Kenya and Puerto Rico, the initiative struggled with:These experiments show that technical feasibility does not always translate into practical access on the ground.Even when governments pledge universal connectivity, bureaucratic inefficiencies, corruption, and poor planning often leave towers half-built or non-functional. In some African and South Asian nations, digital infrastructure projects are plagued by:As a result, some communities are within visible range of a cell tower but remain offline.","The digital divide has narrowed over the past decade, but significant disparities remain.

Multiple protests at Microsoft Build 2025 conference

Microsoft has terminated the software engineer who interrupted CEO Satya Nadella’s keynote speech at the company’s annual developer conference – Build 2025. Joe Lopez, the fired employee, protested against the company’s partnership with the Israeli military amid the war in Gaza, shouting “Free Palestine”. “How about you show them how Microsoft is killing Palestinians? How about you show them how Israeli war crimes are powered by Azure?” Lopez shouted from the audience before being confronted and dragged out of the Seattle Convention Center by security. “As a Microsoft worker, I refuse to be complicit in this genocide,” he yelled.According to advocacy group, “No Azure for Apartheid,"" Lopez received a termination letter following the protest, although he was reportedly unable to open the document.Shortly after the protest, Lopez sent a mass email to Microsoft colleagues challenging the company’s statements about the use of its Azure cloud services in Gaza. “Leadership rejects our claims that Azure technology is being used to target or harm civilians in Gaza”, he said.“Those of us who have been paying attention know that this is a bold-faced lie. Every byte of data that is stored on the cloud (much of it likely containing data obtained by illegal mass surveillance) can and will be used as justification to level cities and exterminate Palestinians.”The incident marked the first of multiple pro-Palestinian protests during the four-day conference. At least three executive sessions were disrupted, one livestream had its audio briefly cut, and demonstrators also gathered outside the venue.In one such incident, Vaniya Agrawal – a former software engineer along with another fired Microsoft employee Hossam Nasr shouted at the company’s head of security for AI, Neta Haiby.On May 20, a Palestinian tech worker interrupted Microsoft executive Jay Parikh’s keynote presentation, shouting: “Jay! My people are suffering”.Last week, Microsoft acknowledged supplying AI services to the Israeli military but stated itfound no evidence that its Azure cloud or AI tools were used to directly target or harm civilians in Gaza. However, internal dissent continues. The employee-led group claims the company has blocked internal emails containing terms like “Palestine” and “Gaza.”Microsoft has previously dismissed employees who protested its involvement in Israel, including during its 50th anniversary celebration in April.","Fired Microsoft employee sent email to colleagues challenging the company's statements about the use of its Azure cloud services in Gaza.

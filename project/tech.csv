Japan's second biggest company sells its entire stake in world's most-valuable company Nvidia; and one of the reasons is ChatGPT-maker OpenAI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/japans-second-biggest-company-sells-its-entire-stake-in-worlds-most-valuable-company-nvidia-and-one-of-the-reasons-is-chatgpt-maker-openai/articleshow/125258300.cms,"OpenAI's Master Plan for India

What analysts said on Nvidia sale





SoftBank Group said that it has sold its entire stake in U.S. chipmaker Nvidia, raising $5.83 billion as part of its push to finance an “all in” investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI . In its quarterly earnings report, the Japanese conglomerate disclosed that it sold 32.1 million Nvidia shares in October. SoftBank is putting $30 billion into the ChatGPT maker this year after its recent restructuring and has an 11 per cent stake.“We want to provide a lot of investment opportunities for investors while maintaining financial strength,” said Yoshimitsu Goto, SoftBank’s chief financial officer, during an investor presentation. “Through those options and tools, we make sure we are ready for funding in a very safe manner.” He added that the sales were part of the company’s broader strategy of “asset monetization.”According to a person familiar with the matter cited by CNBC, proceeds from the Nvidia and T-Mobile share sales — along with a margin loan on SoftBank’s holding in Arm — will serve as “sources of cash” to fund SoftBank’s planned $22.5 billion investment in OpenAI. The funds will also support other initiatives, including the acquisition of ABB’s robotics unit.These results come just three years after SoftBank unveiled the biggest loss in its history.While the move surprised some investors, it marks the second time SoftBank has exited Nvidia. Its Vision Fund first invested about $4 billion in the chipmaker in 2017 before fully divesting in 2019. Incidentally, Masa Son, Softbank’s founder, had said last year that he sees Nvidia as his missed golden opportunity, after Softbank sold its stake in 2019, before the share price jump. As he put it: “The fish that got away was big. ” Till 2019, SoftBank was the biggest shareholder of Nvidia, owning 4.9% of shares.Analysts said the sale reflects SoftBank’s capital reallocation rather than a shift in sentiment toward Nvidia.“This should not be seen as a cautious or negative stance on Nvidia,” said Rolf Bulk, equity research analyst at New Street Research. “SoftBank needs at least $30.5 billion of capital for investments in the October–December quarter, including $22.5 billion for OpenAI and $6.5 billion for Ampere — more in a single quarter than it invested in the previous two years combined.”SoftBank’s sweeping repositioning underscores founder Masayoshi Son’s renewed focus on artificial intelligence, as the group looks to cement its role at the center of the global AI ecosystem.","SoftBank Group has sold its entire stake in U.S. chipmaker Nvidia, raising $5.83 billion.

Implications for AI training and copyright



OpenAI accused of Game of Thrones copyright violation







ChatGPT creator has been accused of copyright infringement by a German court. As reported by Reuters, a regional court in Munich has ruled that OpenAI’s popular chatbot ChatGPT has violated German copyright laws by reproducing lyrics from nine popular songs without any authorisation. The lawsuit filed by German music ights organization GEMA, which represents composers, lyricists, and publishers accuse OpenAI of copyright infringement.As per the report, the German court found that OpenAI has trained its language model on copyright-protected content, including lyrics from songs by renowned German artists such as Herbert Grönemeyer and Helene Fischer. Notable tracks cited in the case include Grönemeyer’s “Männer” and “Bochum”, and Fischer’s “Atemlos durch die Nacht”.Judge Elke Schwager has ordered OpenAI to pay damages for the unauthorised use of German songs. However, the report has not disclosed the exact amount to be paid by OpenAI.The ruling made by the German court underscores the growing concerns over how generative AI models are trained on copyright data. GEMA’s legal advisor Kai Welp noted that the organization hopes this decision will lead to clearer frameworks for compensating rights holders when their work is used to train AI systems.OpenAI on the other hand argued that its models do not store or copy specific data, but rather generate outputs based on patterns learned from large datasets. But, the court concluded that memorisation and reproduction of lyrics by ChatGPT constituted a breach of copyright law.This is not the first time that OpenAI has faced such allegations. Last month, the ChatGPT creator faced copyright violations charges in the US. A US judge has reportedly allowed a major class-action lawsuit against OpenAI to move forward. Citing a ChatGPT-generated idea for a ""Game of Thrones"" book as a potential copyright violation, US District Judge Sidney Stein issued a ruling in Manhattan Federal Court that addressed the AI's resemblance to legally protected works, a report claims. Judge Stein said: “A reasonable jury could find that the allegedly infringing outputs are substantially similar to plaintiffs' works.""According to a Business Insider report, the decision was made in a consolidated case brought by numerous authors, including Game of Thrones creator George R.R. Martin, Michael Chabon, and Sarah Silverman, against both OpenAI and Microsoft. The authors allege that OpenAI and Microsoft violated their copyrights by using their books without permission to train large language models, resulting in AI ""outputs"" that resembled the original material.","A German court has ruled that OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT has violated German copyright laws by reproducing lyrics from nine popular songs.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, which will allow users to stream select titles without requiring a paid Game Pass subscription. The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees.

The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%. This change reportedly came after Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new 30% target.","Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

Pichai’s post caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk . The tech billionaire replied to Pichai’s post saying “Congrats. Looks like quantum computing is becoming relevant.”Announcing the major breakthrough, Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote:The achievement marks a historic breakthrough in quantum computing. For the first time ever, a quantum computer has performed a complex, verifiable calculation faster than any supercomputer could — about 13,000 times faster. This moment is being called a “verifiable quantum advantage.""Using Google’s Willow quantum chip, researchers ran an advanced algorithm called Quantum Echoes (or OTOC — out-of-order time correlator).This algorithm helps scientists study how information spreads in quantum systems — things like molecules, magnets, or even black holes.The key part: the result was verifiable and repeatable, meaning other quantum computers could confirm it independently.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently shared a post on X, formerly Twitter, announcing a new breakthrough in quantum algorithms.

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You’ll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles – they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me – we’re going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next. Love to hear from you if there’s anything interesting going on, workwise or otherwise.Another employee, David Luehmann, a director of game development at the studio, also posted on LinkedIn, saying, ""After 10+ great years working at Boss Fight, the last few as part of Netflix, the time has come for the studio to close down.""“I am very proud of all the people, work, and games we've released.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

“That made everyone feel really good… until we lost all self-control, all critical judgment,”

“Our patriotism was our Achilles’ heel,”





A woman who bought cryptocurrency with funds embezzled from thousands of Chinese pensioners has been sentenced in the UK to 11 years and eight months for money laundering. London police described the seizure as one of the world's single largest crypto hauls. Qian Zhimin, 47, fled China after police began an investigation and arrived in the UK in September 2017 using a fake passport. She moved into a rented mansion in Hampstead, north London, where the Metropolitan Police raided the property a year later. Over 100,000 Chinese individuals invested money in her company, which claimed to be developing health products and mining cryptocurrency. Police claimed that Zhimin embezzled these investment funds.According to a BBC report, she posed as an antiques and diamond heiress in the UK. She hired a personal assistant to help convert her Bitcoin into spendable assets, including cash and property, to cover expenses such as her monthly rent of over £17,000 ($22,700). Investors told the BBC World Service that they hope to recover some of their money from the UK authorities. However, any unclaimed funds would typically default to the UK government.Zhimin’s company, Lantian Gerui (or Bluesky Greet), claimed to use investor funds for Bitcoin mining and technology ventures. However, UK authorities believe it was a scam that drew thousands of investors in China with promises of high returns.As per court documents and witness accounts, Zhimin’s company functioned like a pyramid scheme, using funds from new investors to pay existing ones. One investor, Mr Yu, said he received daily payouts of about, which made participants believe the system was working.he said. He and his wife borrowed money to invest further, only to lose everything when the payments stopped.Police later raided Zhimin’s Hampstead property in London, discovering hard drives and laptops containing tens of thousands of Bitcoin. Her assistant, Wen Jian, testified that Zhimin spent much of her time gaming and shopping while planning ambitious ventures, such as buying a Swedish castle and founding an international bank.Documents from trials in China show that Lantian Gerui attracted around 120,000 investors across all Chinese provinces, with total deposits exceeding 40 billion yuan ($5.6 billion), according to the UK’s Crown Prosecution Service.The company’s marketing targeted middle-aged and elderly investors, appealing to national pride and social isolation.said Mr Yu, who is in his 60s.Zhimin fled to the UK after Chinese authorities began investigating the company in 2017. When she was arrested in York in April, she denied the allegations, claiming she was escaping a government crackdown on cryptocurrency entrepreneurs. However, during her trial in September, she pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing cryptocurrency.The seized Bitcoin has since multiplied more than twentyfold in value. Thousands of Chinese investors are now seeking compensation through a UK civil case, though proving their losses remains difficult.","Qian Zhimin, 47, has been sentenced in the UK to 11 years and eight months for money laundering.

“focus on a good skincare routine.”

“Copilot is my mentor & therapist,”

“

We can see very much people say, ‘Oh, I’m gonna go try that,’ and we can see the usage it’s driving,”

“Who would have thought that a girl who was getting thousands of views on hair rollers is now promoting AI through Microsoft Copilot,”

“The whole idea about Copilot is really about empowering you to be the best you,”

“If I were to, you know, croak, would I still have to pay off my credit card bills?”

“

Yes, debts don’t disappear.”

“With Copilot, there’s no such thing as a cringe question.”

“It’d be hard-pressed for them to surpass the consumer ChatGPT at this point,”





Microsoft is deploying anto increase consumer downloads of its Copilot chatbot. With this move, the software giant is specifically targeting younger users to better compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The company has recruited several popular influencers in America for the promotional push. In an interview with Fortune, Yusuf Mehdi, Consumer Chief Marketing Officer at Microsoft, said:Mehdi hopes to persuade key influencers to adopt Copilot as their preferred chatbot and then use their large followings to market the assistant. He also indicated that Microsoft is seeing better results from influencer campaigns than from traditional media, but declined to provide specific metrics or payment details for the promotions.The company has partnered with social media creator Alix Earle, who gained recognition for sharing details of her life through her popular Get Ready With Me (GRWM) videos. The 24-year-old from New Jersey has a combined following of 12.6 million on Instagram and TikTok, and her online popularity led to a spot on the current season of Dancing With the Stars. In June, Earle joined Mehdi on a panel about influencer marketing at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.Earle collaborates with Microsoft on ideas for her videos but is free to improvise. During a shoot in May, she asked Copilot how to look younger after some followers said she looked like she was 40. The chatbot replied that she shouldThe video drew 15.4 million views on her TikTok account, which is nearly double her follower count and she captioned it,adding the hashtag #copilotpartner.Mehdi pointed to another video Earle made about the new Copilot Groups feature as proof that the campaign is resonating.he said. That post recieved 1.9 million views on Instagram and 7 million on TikTok.Twin sisters Brigette and Danielle Pheloung, both 28, also joined the campaign. Known for their fashion and beauty content, they have a combined 3.4 million followers across Instagram and TikTok.Brigette said. To engage women aged 18 to 34, the sisters asked Copilot to help them design ‘70s- and '80s-inspired outfits for New York Fashion Week. The bot suggested shoulder pads, prompting Danielle to stuff socks into her shirt to achieve the look.Microsoft’s Copilot brand is primarily associated with workplace tools that organise data, summarise meetings, and retrieve information, but this campaign takes a different direction.Mehdi added.Influencer Brandon Edelman, known online as Bran Flakezz with 1.7 million followers, also collaborated with Microsoft. His videos, filmed in Los Angeles, feature light conversations with Copilot about topics such as dating, travel, and overcoming imposter syndrome.In one video, Edelman asks,to which Copilot replies,Microsoft captioned the post,The Copilot influencer initiative has drawn well-known creators and generated significant viewership. Still, analysts like Jason Wong of Gartner remain cautious.he said.Microsoft’s Copilot currently has 150 million active users each month, which lags behind OpenAI’s claim of 800 million weekly active users for ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, which has 650 million monthly active users. While Microsoft has an advantage with corporate clients, it faces challenges in the consumer market, particularly among younger consumers.","Microsoft is deploying anto increase consumer downloads of its Copilot chatbot.

UFC CEO and president Dana White has weighed in on the much talked about cage match between tech rivals Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg , suggesting the Meta CEO is a more serious fighter than many realise. However, he did not name a clear winner while also praising the Tesla CEO for his abilities and sheer size. The idea began in June 2023 when Musk challenged Zuckerberg on X (then Twitter), who responded with a “send me location” message. However, the proposed cage fight did not happen after Zuckerberg ultimately called it off, stating that Musk was not serious about it.White, who was involved in the initial promotion of the fight that never happened, offered insights into both billionaires’ fighting backgrounds during a recent appearance on the Skinny Confidential podcast.White came strongly to Zuckerberg's defense, highlighting the Meta CEO’s dedication to mixed martial arts (MMA) training. Zuckerberg is a well-known UFC fan who frequently attends major fights cageside and integrates MMA training into his daily routine.“People talk sh-t about Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg’s actually a great athlete,” White said.“He trains MMA and surfs he does all this sh-t. Zuckerberg will beat the sh-t out of you, okay? Everybody thinks he’s some computer nerd.Mark Zuckerberg will kick your a–,” he added.Zuckerberg previously told the Theo Von podcast that he starts his day by fighting to “re-center” himself before dealing with business demands.“I probably wake up [at] 7-7:30 whenever the kids start making noise around the house... And then I look at my phone... it’s like I have to go deal with this, compose myself, go fight for two hours, re-center myself and it’s like ‘now I can go deal with this stuff’,” Zuckerberg said.While praising Zuckerberg, White did offer a key detail about the xAI and Tesla CEO’s combat background.“Elon is much older and weighs more,” he said.“But the thing with Elon too that we found out during the promotion of that fight was that he grew up doing Judo. So he’s a Judo guy,"" White revealed.

“We’re starting to leverage AI to impart the truth of the Catholic faith, but there’s more to the faith than just imparting truth. There’s the pastoral, human dimension,”

“The question is how do we 'off-ramp' people from products like Magisterium AI and help ensure that they can find either a community or show them how the faith is lived,”

Pope Leo XIV has called for artificial intelligence (AI) to support the Catholic Church’s mission of evangelisation. With this message, the Pope has encouraged Catholic technologists and investors gathered in Rome to develop systems that help spread the Gospel. According to a report by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Pope's message was read during the 2025 Builders AI Forum at the Pontifical Gregorian University. He specifically outlined various applications for the technology. In his message, Pope Leo wrote:While the Pope has previously emphasised the need for ethically grounded AI, this message marks the first time he has directly connected the technology’s potential to the church’s missionary work. Forum organisers emphasised the importance of the church's involvement, noting how AI tools are increasingly influencing how people seek meaning online.In a statement, Matthew Sanders, a Catholic AI developer and event organiser, said:The report cited registration materials indicating around 200 participants, including software engineers, venture capital partners, Catholic media producers, bishops, and Vatican communications officials. The event was structured as a working summit rather than a public conference, with most sessions held in smaller group workshops.The registration list included representatives from Microsoft, Palantir Technologies, and Goldman Sachs, as well as Catholic filmmakers and ministry leaders. Actor and producer Lorenzo Henrie — who is currently co-financing and starring as an apostle in Mel Gibson’snow filming in Italy — was also among those listed as participants.Following the opening remarks, attendees divided into six working groups, each focused on a specific issue. Topics included the use of AI in Catholic education and whether the church should develop ato identify potential signs of consciousness in advanced systems.Interest was notably high in thesession, which drew about half of the forum’s participants and focused on applying AI tools for evangelisation, the report added.Sanders told Catholic News Service.A recurring theme throughout the sessions was how to help individuals move from digital encounters with Catholic content into participation in parish life. Sanders noted that many users first engage with Catholic teachings through apps like Hallow or Magisterium AI. He said that without guidance new believers may find it challenging to connect with a worshipping community.Sanders noted.He explained that the goal is to connect individuals to a tradition or practice that feels meaningful, whether Eucharistic adoration, a charismatic Mass, or the Latin Mass, so they feel supported rather than isolated.In another session,filmmakers, writers, and digital creators discussed ways AI could help broaden the reach of Catholic stories. For Eike Petersen of Aid to the Church in Need, the main challenge is not the lack of compelling stories but limited visibility.Petersen told participants.Petersen added that he hoped the discussion would help clarifyespecially in regions where digital outreach could expand awareness and build solidarity.","Pope Leo XIV has called for artificial intelligence (AI) to support the Catholic Church’s mission of evangelisation.

End of an engagement era?





Meta has announced it will discontinue the Facebook Like and Comment buttons embedded on external websites, officially beginning the phase-out of one of the internet’s most recognisable symbols. The company has announced plans to remove support for these social plugins starting February 10, 2026.Meta stated that the decision is part of a plan to simplify and modernise its developer tools. These plugins were introduced in 2010 when websites across the internet heavily relied on Facebook integration to drive engagement and viral sharing.However, the company noted that the use of these plugins has steadily declined as the internet evolved and global privacy regulations tightened.“On February 10, the plugins will gracefully degrade by rendering as a 0x0 pixel (invisible element) rather than causing errors or breaking your website functionality. This change is intended to only remove the plugin content from your site, and should not otherwise impact your website's functionality,” the company said in a blog post.It is to be noted that the change does not affect the Like button on Facebook itself which means users will continue to react to posts, photos and videos within the core Facebook platform.The update specifically targets the buttons frequently seen on blogs, news sites and other external web pages that allow users to react or comment using their Facebook accounts.The move marks the end of an era for Facebook’s wide presence across the wider web. The Like button, which debuted in 2009, quickly became a cultural phenomenon – a shorthand for approval that fundamentally reshaped how people interacted online.For years, publishers and brands relied on the external button as a powerful tool to measure popularity and expand their social influence.“There will be no error messages or broken functionality and this should not otherwise impact your website's function or core features,” the company added.Meta stated that it is shifting focus to tools that “deliver the most value” to developers and allow the company to invest in “future innovations.”","Meta has announced it will discontinue the Facebook Like and Comment buttons embedded on external websites.

Elon Musk Becomes First Man To Have $500 Billion Wealth

Musk fires back



Chairperson of Tesla Board of Directors sends thanks note to shareholders







Tesla CEO Elon Musk has once again posted on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to address the critics of his historic $1 trillion compensation package, calling out what he sees as a contradiction in their arguments. In a new post shared on X, Musk wrote, “What’s wild is that the same people who say Tesla is overvalued also say my pay package is too much — even though it’s contingent on Tesla becoming the most valuable company on Earth.” The remark made by Tesla CEO highlights the irony he sees in criticism of a performance-based award that only materializes if Tesla reaches unprecedented valuation milestones.Earlier this year, Tesla shareholders approved a pay package of $1 trillion for Elon Musk tied to aggressive targets in market capitalization and operational performance. If achieved, the package could make Musk the world’s first trillionaire.Despite receiving support from over 75% of shareholders, the package has drawn scrutiny. Critics argue it reflects excessive executive compensation, while supporters see it as a bold vote of confidence in Musk’s leadership and Tesla’s long-term vision.Musk’s recent posts on X reflect his frustration with what he views as inconsistent criticism.In another post, he reiterated that anyone can join him on the journey by investing in Tesla stock, framing the package as a shared opportunity rather than a personal windfall.He also shared anecdotes from his early life in Canada, emphasizing his modest beginnings in response to criticism of his wealth. The posts add a personal dimension to the ongoing debate about executive pay and corporate governance.Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm told shareholders their overwhelming approval of CEO Elon Musk's $878 billion compensation package sends ""an unmistakable message"" that they support the company's ambitious vision and want leadership to steer toward an extraordinary future. In a letter following the vote, Denholm said shareholders chose to back the people who have been fighting for Tesla's mission since the earliest days, looking past the noise to reaffirm belief in a trailblazer who has built one of the world's most valuable companies.The historic compensation plan, which ties Musk's earnings to achieving ambitious milestones including a market value of $8.5 trillion, passed with over 75% support from 1.94 billion votes despite fierce opposition from major institutional investors.","Elon Musk has responded to critics of his historic $1 trillion compensation package.

Google’s YouTube TV and Disney are at odds, hitting the latter financially over channel blackout. The ongoing contract dispute between the companies is costing Disney an estimated $30 million revenue loss each week as its channels remain blacked out on the popular streaming platform, according to analysis by Morgan Stanley. The standoff has prevented YouTube TV’s millions of subscribers from accessing Disney networks, including ESPN and ABC, since October 30.Citing Morgan Stanley analyst Ben Swinburne, Business Insider noted that the dispute is likely to result in a $60 million revenue shortfall for Disney if the blackout lasts 14 days. This calculation translates to an estimated $30 million loss in revenue per week, or approximately $4.3 million each day, due to the absence of its channels on YouTube TV.The blackout means sports fans continue to miss key broadcasts, including high-profile events like “Monday Night Football.”Swinburne has lowered his estimate for Disney’s quarterly net income by $25 million, from $1.55 billion to $1.52 billion. This 1.6% drop translates to an estimated 2 cents per share ahead of Disney’s quarterly results announcement on Thursday.While Disney is taking a significant revenue hit, the company has other options.It controls several rival services, including Hulu + Live TV and Fubo, as well as the stand-alone ESPN app. If YouTube TV subscribers cancel their service and migrate to one of Disney’s competing platforms, Disney stands to gain a new source of revenue and ownership of the customer relationship.Meanwhile, Google is also said to be feeling the financial impact of the dispute. YouTube TV is offering its subscribers a $20 bill credit as a rebate for the blackout. If every one of YouTube TV's estimated 10 million subscribers claimed the $20 credit, the total cost to Google would be around $200 million.However, the credit is not applied automatically; it is only available to subscribers who actively request it and have not canceled or paused their subscriptions.Additionally, YouTube TV is offsetting some of its costs by saving the carriage fees it would otherwise be paying to Disney. The platform also faces potential revenue loss from subscribers who choose to cancel the service entirely.","Disney channels have been blacked out on YouTube TV since October 30.

Alexandr Wang is one of the most influential figures in artificial intelligence today. Born in New Mexico to physicist parents, he showed an early talent for mathematics and computer science. By his late teens, Wang worked in Silicon Valley at companies like Addepar and Quora. He briefly studied machine learning at MIT before dropping out in 2016 to co-found Scale AI, a company providing high-quality annotated data for AI models. Under his leadership, Scale AI became a key partner for companies such as NVIDIA, Amazon, and Meta. As reported by AP News, in 2025, Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI and appointed Wang to lead its Superintelligence Labs. His work highlights both the opportunities and challenges of building advanced, ethical AI systems.Alexandr Wang was born in Los Alamos, New Mexico, to Chinese immigrant parents who worked as physicists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Growing up in a household filled with scientific inquiry, Wang developed an early fascination with mathematics, problem-solving, and computers.As reported by Forbes, by the age of 17, he had already secured full-time engineering roles at tech companies in Silicon Valley, including fintech startup Addepar and the Q&A platform Quora.These experiences gave him a practical understanding of software development and large-scale systems at a very young age. Wang briefly enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to study machine learning. However, he quickly realised that traditional academic pathways could not match his entrepreneurial ambitions. In 2016, at age 19, he dropped out of MIT to join the Y Combinator accelerator and co-found Scale AI.This move was risky but marked the start of a journey that would redefine data infrastructure for AI. Wang’s decision exemplifies a broader Silicon Valley trend: talented individuals leveraging hands-on experience and startups to make an impact faster than through conventional education.Scale AI was created to address a major challenge in the AI industry: high-quality, annotated data. AI models perform poorly without clean and properly labelled datasets. Wang recognised that companies struggled not with algorithms themselves but with the raw data needed to train them.Under Wang’s leadership, Scale AI became a critical partner for major technology companies such as NVIDIA, Amazon, and Meta. The startup’s services enabled these companies to accelerate AI research, improve accuracy, and deploy models more efficiently. By 2024, Scale AI was valued at nearly $14 billion, cementing Wang’s status as one of the youngest self-made billionaires in the AI industry. In June 2025, As reported by Forbes, Meta invested $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in Scale AI, valuing the company at roughly $29 billion. As part of this transaction, Wang stepped down as CEO of Scale AI to join Meta as the head of its newly formed Superintelligence Labs.This division was designed to unify Meta’s AI research, infrastructure, and product development. Wang immediately reorganised Meta’s AI initiatives around three core pillars: research, product development, and infrastructure. His goal is to accelerate progress toward building general-purpose, superintelligent AI systems.Meta’s investment in Scale AI is significant for several reasons. First, it highlights the value of high-quality data and infrastructure as a foundation for AI. Second, it positions Meta to compete with AI leaders such as OpenAI and Google DeepMind. The collaboration also signals Meta’s intent to strengthen its research ecosystem, integrating large-scale data annotation and model training for enhanced performance across its AI products. Wang’s leadership and expertise make him a strategic asset for Meta. His experience in scaling AI infrastructure and managing complex datasets provides a competitive advantage in building advanced AI systems. The partnership reflects Meta’s ambition to take a leading role in the next generation of AI technology.While the opportunity is immense, Wang faces substantial challenges. Leading Meta’s AI operations involves balancing innovation with ethical responsibility. The pursuit of superintelligence raises questions about safety, transparency, bias, and regulation.Reports also indicate that integrating Scale AI into Meta’s operations is complex. Some employees have departed, and realignment efforts, including layoffs, suggest that scaling operations while maintaining quality is a delicate task. Wang must navigate these organizational and technical hurdles to achieve Meta’s AI ambitions. Wang believes that the future of AI will depend not only on algorithms but on the infrastructure that supports learning and deployment. He emphasises creating systems that are scalable, efficient, and aligned with human values.At Meta, his strategy focuses on integrating research, product development, and infrastructure to create AI systems capable of general intelligence. The aim is to push the boundaries of AI while managing the risks associated with rapid technological advancement.","Alexandr Wang is one of the most influential figures in artificial intelligence.

A warning for Academia

Industry leaders echo the same sentiment





Google Brain founder Andrew Ng has put forward a compelling case about coding at Snowflake’s Build conference this week. As reported by Business Insider, Ng highlighted the fact that why coding particularly AI-assisted coding is more revealing than ever, even for non-engineers. A Stanford professor and founder of multiple AI ventures, Ng has urged the professionals across industries to embrace what he called ‘vibe coding’. For those unaware, vibe coding is a term used for coding down with the help of AI tools. “The bar to coding is now lower than it ever has been,” Ng said. “People that code, be it CEOs and marketers, recruiters, not just software engineers, will really get more done than ones that don’t”.Ng stressed on the fact that it is a “wonderful time” to build passion projects, thanks to reduced costs and faster development cycles enabled by AI. He discouraged traditional hand-coding, saying, “Don’t code by hand. Don’t do the old way. Get AI to help you to code.” Ng feels that AI-assisted development boosts productivity and creativity across job functions, making coding more accessible and enjoyable.Ng also raised an alarm about the disconnection between academia and industry.He further noted that computer science graduates also facing rising unemployment because universities haven’t updated their curriculum to reflect the rise of AI coding tools. “Even I can’t hire enough people that really know AI,” he said.Ng joins a growing chorus of tech leaders advocating for vibe coding. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also recently highlighted startups such as Cursor, Replit, and Harvey as key players in the human-digital workforce revolution, predicting that future enterprise teams will include both humans and AI agents. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski also praised AI coding tools for empowering non-technical leaders to prototype ideas without relying solely on engineering teams. “Rather than disturbing my poor engineers… now I test it myself,” he said in a podcast.According to Business Insider, vibe coding is no longer a niche skill. Companies like Visa, Reddit, and DoorDash now list experience with AI code generators such as Cursor and Bolt as a requirement in job postings.","Google Brain founder Andrew Ng has put forward a compelling case about coding at Snowflake’s Build conference this week.

Wang compares AI to the PC revolution

What is vibe-coding





Meta’s chief AI officer and one of the highest-paid employees at the company, Alexandr Wang, is urging teenagers to dedicate their time to mastering artificial intelligence (AI) tools, comparing the current moment to when Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg learned computer programming in their youth.“If you're 13 right now, you should spend all your time vibe-coding,” Wang said on the TBPN podcast during Meta Connect 2025. Wang argued that young people who invest thousands of hours in AI experimentation will gain a significant advantage over their peers in the future economy.“This is the Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg moment. The people who grow up with these tools will have an immense advantage in the future economy,” Wang added.He said that kids “just have to figure out how to use the [AI] tools maximally”, because that will be a huge advantage.Wang, who became the youngest self-made billionaire at age 25 after founding Scale AI, drew parallels between today's AI revolution and the emergence of personal computing.“It’s almost like when personal computers first came about. Computing, in general, the people who spent the most time with it, grew up with it, had this immense advantage in the future,” he said.Wang’s advice centers on “vibe-coding” – a term that has also been used by Google CEO Sundar Pichai – is a hands-on learning approach where people actively build, test and experiment with AI coding assistants rather than relying on formal courses or structured learning.The term describes a rapid-experimentation method for understanding how AI systems operate and execute tasks. Vibe-coding has gained popularity among technology professionals as AI-powered development tools have become more sophisticated.“You should spend all of your time Vibe, coding, and just, you know. That's how you should live your life,” Wang said.The approach involves repeatedly prompting AI models, refining outputs and gradually learning how to effectively command these systems.“If you just happen to spend, like, 10,000 hours playing with the tools and figuring out how to use them better than other people, that’s a huge advantage....You just have to figure out how to use the tools maximally,” Wang said.","Alexandr Wang is Meta's chief AI officer and one of the highest-paid employees at the company.

SoftBank’s growing AI empire







SoftBank has sold its entire stake in Nvidia for $5.83 billion, reports Bloomberg. The sale comes as SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son gears up for a new wave of investments in artificial intelligence (AI). The move echoes a light-hearted moment between Son and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. During his visit to Japan in November last year, Huang joked that Son was once Nvidia’s largest shareholder — before selling his stake too early. “We can cry together,” Huang told Son at the time, referring to the massive surge in Nvidia’s stock price since.Softbank had increased its Nvidia stake to about $3 billion in March this year. After the Nvidia stake sale, the Tokyo-based company continues to hold stakes in other leading AI players, including OpenAI and Oracle Corp. These investments have fueled a 78% surge in SoftBank’s share price over the three months ending in September — its best quarterly performance since 2005.As per the report, the stake, along with profits from its Vision Fund investment unit, helped SoftBank report a surprise net income of ¥2.5 trillion ($16.2 billion) in the fiscal second quarter — far above analyst expectations of ¥418.2 billion.At a summit in 2024, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang joined Softbank founder Masayoshi Son for a fireside chat. Introducing SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son on stage, Huang said:""Masa is the only entrepreneur. Only entrepreneur, only innovator in the world.That has selected the winner. And partnered with the winner and every single generation.""""Remember, it was Masa that brought Bill Gates to Japan. It was Masa that invented or brought Jerry Yang to Japan. It was Masa that made possible for China's cloud industry to happen (Alibaba). It was Masa that brought Steve Jobs to Japan and the iPhone. And you maybe many of you probably don't know this, but at one point. Maasa was the largest shareholder of Nvidia.""Hearing this, Masayoshi Son cringed and playfully put his head on Nvidia CEO's shoulders as if crying. ""It's okay. We can. We can cry. We can cry together. Could you imagine? If today. You are the largest shareholder. Oh, my God,"" said Huang.Analysts see SoftBank’s AI focus as a key growth driver. “The number of bets from which SoftBank is successfully recouping its investment has increased, so we raise our forecasts,” Citigroup analyst Keiichi Yoneshima wrote in a note before the company’s earnings.Son, 68, is ramping up investment in AI and semiconductor infrastructure while scaling back other projects. His initiatives include the Stargate data center rollout and a planned $30 billion investment in OpenAI. SoftBank is also in talks with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and others to create a $1 trillion AI manufacturing hub in Arizona.The company has even explored acquiring US chipmaker Marvell Technology Inc. earlier this year.However, SoftBank faces the challenge of balancing its massive AI investments — including roughly $20 billion for OpenAI and $6.5 billion for chip designer Ampere Computing LLC.

Nvidia’s growing appetite for chips



Geopolitics and the Blackwell series

Huang says 'no discussion' to sell Blackwell chips to China





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has once again shown confidence in chipset maker TSMC. During a recent Taiwan visit, Huang reaffirmed his company’s deep reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) by declaring the foundry’s role as indispensable to Nvidia’s success. Over a hotspot dinner with TSMC CEO CC Wei in Taipei, Huang said the now-viral slogan: ‘No TSMC, no Nvidia.’ This is Huang’s fourth visit to Taiwan this year and it comes amid a global AI boom and intensifying competition for advanced semiconductor capacity. Huang’s meeting with Wei was followed by a recent engagements with South Korean tech leaders, including Samsung’s Lee Jae-yong and Hyundai’s Euisun Chun.Videos of Huang and Wei’s dinner quickly circulated on social media, symbolizing the blend of business diplomacy and personal rapport between the two tech giants.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also stressed on the fact that Nvidia’s AI chip demand is increasing ‘month by month’, prompting him to request for additional wafer supply from TSMC. When asked about the volume of chips requested, CC Wei responded with a smile: “That’s confidential.”Wei also revealed that TSMC has set new records for revenue and profit this year and he also expressed confidence that this trend will continue annually.Huang’s praise for TSMC comes amid U.S. export restrictions on Nvidia’s advanced Blackwell AI chips, announced by President Donald Trump. The move, aimed at safeguarding national security, limits overseas sales of Nvidia’s most powerful processors. Despite the restrictions, the Blackwell series remains central to Nvidia’s strategy, with analysts projecting $5–6 billion in revenue next quarter from the chips alone.Huang also said that there were ""no active discussions"" about selling Blackwell chips to China. The Trump administration has banned sales of Nvidia's flagship artificial-intelligence chip to China, saying they could aid the Chinese military and the country's AI industry.Last week, Huang challenged US export controls on advanced semiconductors, arguing that continued technology collaboration and access to the Chinese market are ultimately in America’s best interest. Speaking to reporters, Huang described China as a “singular, vital, important, dynamic market, and nobody can replace that.”“It’s in the best interest of America to serve that China market. It’s in the best interest of China to have the American technology company bring ... technology to the China market ... It’s in the best interest of both countries, and I hope that policymakers will ultimately come to that conclusion,” Huang then said.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reaffirmed his company's deep reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

Read Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm letter to shareholders

Dear Fellow Shareholders,

On behalf of the entire Tesla Board, I want to extend our deepest gratitude for the overwhelming support you showed at this year’s Annual Meeting.

In particular, your resounding approval of Proposals One, Three and Four sends an unmistakable message: you support the vision embodied by Master Plan Part IV and want us to keep steering Tesla toward the extraordinary future we all see ahead.

A world that is not “zero-sum” but instead one in which we can and will accelerate global prosperity for all by creating a safer, cleaner and more enjoyable world.

In a year when many tried to sow doubt and negativity, you chose a better future.

You chose ambition. You chose to see what is possible. You chose to back the people who have been in the room since the earliest days, fighting for the mission that first brought us all together—a better world for humanity.

Your vote was about much more than governance of a company—it was a vote of confidence in our visionary leader, Elon. You looked past the noise and reaffirmed your belief in a trailblazer who has turned Tesla into one of the most valuable companies in history and who continues to push humanity closer to a future of sustainable abundance for all.

This idea is not just a slogan—as Elon noted at our meeting, it is about bringing about the best future you can imagine. Your support tells us that you believe in this mission as strongly as we do.

The Board could not be more excited for what comes next, and, as Elon also said on Thursday, this is not a new chapter for Tesla but a whole new book. The age of autonomy is no longer approaching—it is here. With transformative technologies such as Robotaxi and Optimus, we are bringing AI into the physical world.

We are on the cusp of what could be the largest value-creation event in Tesla’s history, and quite possibly in the history of humanity.

You, our shareholders, have given us the mandate and the runway to execute. We are humbled, and rest assured that we do not take that responsibility lightly.

Therefore, staying close to you has always been fundamental to how we lead. We have consistently prioritized direct engagement with our shareholders through multiple channels, including our Shareholder Platform and in-person events.

The feedback we receive directly from you, the owners of Tesla, informs our strategy and strengthens us. As we execute, we will keep listening and are committed to exploring opportunities to further empower shareholder voices.

Thank you for believing in Tesla. Thank you for standing with us. We look forward to years of bold leadership and pioneering innovation, fueled by our commitment to creating a better future for all.

Very truly yours,

Robyn Denholm

Chairperson of the Board of Directors





Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm told shareholders their overwhelming approval of CEO Elon Musk 's $878 billion compensation package sends ""an unmistakable message"" that they support the company's ambitious vision and want leadership to steer toward an extraordinary future. In a letter following the vote, Denholm said shareholders chose to back the people who have been fighting for Tesla's mission since the earliest days, looking past the noise to reaffirm belief in a trailblazer who has built one of the world's most valuable companies.The historic compensation plan, which ties Musk's earnings to achieving ambitious milestones including a market value of $8.5 trillion, passed with over 75% support from 1.94 billion votes despite fierce opposition from major institutional investors.In a letter to shareholders, Denholm characterised the approval as a mandate for Tesla's ambitious future focused on autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. She emphasised that shareholders ""chose ambition"" over doubt, backing Musk's leadership despite criticism from proxy firms and major institutional investors.The pay package, valued at $878 billion, structures compensation so Musk gains only from value created after approval.He must achieve milestones including delivering 20 million vehicles, one million robots, and raising Tesla's market value to $8.5 trillion over the next decade.Denholm framed the vote as confidence in ""Master Plan Part IV"" and Tesla's mission to accelerate global prosperity. She described the upcoming phase as ""not a new chapter but a whole new book,"" highlighting Robotaxi and Optimus technologies as potentially the largest value-creation event in company history.","Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm tells shareholders their approval of CEO Elon Musk's $878 billion compensation package sends ""an unmistakable message"" Denholm characterised the approval as a mandate for Tesla's ambitious future focused on autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.

South Korea delays decision on Google’s map data export request: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/south-korea-delays-decision-on-googles-map-data-export-request-report/articleshow/125241704.cms,"

What is Google asking





South Korea's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport has delayed a decision on Google’s request to export map data, says news agency Reuters. As per the report, the ministry said that it will make a final ruling once the tech giant submits additional documents. In its statement, the ministry further revealed that the country’s National Geographic Information Institute will give Google 60 business days until February 5, 2026 to submit the additional material before making a decision.According to the report, Google is seeking approval to export South Korea's 1:5,000-scale map data, equivalent to 50 metres per centimetre, which the company says is the same scale used by domestic map services provided by Kakao Corp and Naver.The tech giant currently operates with 1:25,000-scale data, which it claims is insufficient to support reliable navigation.South Korea has previously rejected Google’s request seeking permission to use map data on servers outside the country, in 2016 and 2007. The country then cited security concerns as the reason for denying the request.Consequently, in September this year, Google said that it will comply with the country’s security request. Google further committed to coordinate information for areas within the country that is not displayed to any users, either inside or outside South Korea, the report said. Google has also agreed to blur images of South Korea’s security facilities.The latest Reuters report states that Google is yet to file an updated application reflecting this, arguing inconsistencies between Google's earlier statements and its submissions were making the review difficult.","South Korea's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport has delayed a decision on Google’s request to export map data.

American writer Joyce Carol Oates calls Elon Musk ‘uneducated & uncultured’; Tesla CEO hits back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/american-writer-joyce-carol-oates-calls-elon-musk-uneducated-uncultured-tesla-ceo-hits-back/articleshow/125240625.cms,"“totally uneducated, uncultured.”

“most wealthy person in the world”

“a liar” and “not a good human”.

What Joyce Carol Oates wrote in the post criticizing Elon Musk

“So curious that such a wealthy man never posts anything that indicates that he enjoys or is even aware of what virtually everyone appreciates— scenes from nature, pet dog or cat, praise for a movie, music, a book (but doubt that he reads); pride in a friend’s or relative’s accomplishment; condolences for someone who has died; pleasure in sports, acclaim for a favorite team; references to history.

In fact he seems totally uneducated , uncultured.

The poorest persons on Twitter may have access to more beauty & meaning in life than the “most wealthy person in the world.””

“In speculating about the “wealthiest man in the world “ I did not actually state any name. I was thinking of the emblematic—the type of being that great wealth can make possible. But such wealth must seem unreal. Or ironic.

It is impressive that Elon Musk allows critical commentary of himself on X. That is not usually a magnanimity of spirit commensurate with the extreme type of non-empathetic person.”





Author Joyce Carol Oates has stirred a new controversy with her ‘uneducated’ ‘uncultured’ comments for Tesla CEO Elon Musk . Questioning how the tech billionaire “never posts anything that indicates that he enjoys”, Oates shared a post on X (formerly Twitter ) labelling Musk asWhile does not name anyone in the post, the phrasehints at Elon Musk who with a wealth of over $461 billion is currently the world's richest, as per Bloomberg Billionaire Index. Musk hit back sharply at Oates’ comments, calling her“Oates is a liar and delights in being mean. Not a good human,” the world’s richest person said online.Oates’ remarks added to an ongoing online debate about Elon Musk’s recent digital behaviour. The discussion intensified after Musk shared AI-generated videos made using xAI’s Grok Imagine tool. In one clip, an AI-created woman says, “I will always love you,” while another shows a computer-generated version of actress Sydney Sweeney saying, “You are so cringe.” The posts sparked mixed reactions, with many users calling them strange, sad, or a sign of loneliness.She writes:In another post, she seemingly retraced on her previous post writing:","Author Joyce Carol Oates stirred a new controversy with her ‘uneducated’ ‘uncultured’ comments for Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

Microsoft charts different path with 'humanist' approach to advanced AI

'No reassuring answer' exists for controlling ever-smarter AI systems, Microsoft’s AI chief admits

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft's AI chief Mustafa Suleyman is drawing a line in the sand as tech giants race to build superintelligent systems, declaring that raw capability must take a backseat to human control. ""We can't build superintelligence just for superintelligence's sake,"" Suleyman said, days after unveiling Microsoft's new MAI Superintelligence Team. ""It's got to be for humanity's sake, for a future we actually want to live in. It's not going to be a better world if we lose control of it.""The timing is significant: Microsoft has finally achieved what Suleyman calls ""AI self-sufficiency,"" breaking free from contractual limits that previously capped how large a model the company could train under its landmark OpenAI partnership. That agreement had restricted Microsoft from building systems beyond a certain computing threshold, measured in FLOPS—the number of mathematical calculations an AI model performs per second.Suleyman's alternative vision centers on ""Humanist Superintelligence""—AI that's ""carefully calibrated, contextualised, within limits"" rather than ""an unbounded and unlimited entity with high degrees of autonomy."" He explicitly rejects ""the narrative of the AI race to AGI,"" framing Microsoft's approach as ""a wider and deeply human endeavor to improve our lives and future prospects.""The company is targeting specific breakthroughs: medical AI that achieved 85% accuracy on difficult diagnostic cases compared to 20% for human doctors, personalised education companions, and clean energy innovations.""We are not building an ill-defined and ethereal superintelligence; we are building a practical technology explicitly designed only to serve humanity,"" Suleyman wrote.Suleyman posed the question haunting the industry: ""How are we going to contain, let alone align, a system that is—by design—intended to keep getting smarter than us?"" He added bluntly: ""No AI developer, no safety researcher, no policy expert, no person I've encountered has a reassuring answer to this question.""The executive acknowledged trade-offs in Microsoft's approach, noting ""a key risk is that Microsoft's approach could prove costlier or less efficient than those developed with fewer safeguards."" Still, Suleyman expects it will be ""a good year or two before the superintelligence team is producing frontier models,"" signaling Microsoft is playing the long game.Recently, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman revealed his preference for hiring ambitious risk-takers over cautious achievers, challenging conventional recruitment wisdom in the tech industry. The DeepMind co-founder believes that candidates who attempted bold projects and failed demonstrate more valuable traits than those who succeeded by playing it safe.""I'd rather hire someone that took some big swings and missed than someone who played it safe and nailed it,"" Suleyman posted on social media, igniting debate about how the AI industry should evaluate talent in an era of rapid technological transformation.","Microsoft's AI chief Mustafa Suleyman is drawing a line in the sand as tech giants race to build superintelligent systems.

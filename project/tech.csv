Work-life balance through passion

Google's Great Escape: How ChatGPT Saved the Tech Giant

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has an unusual Sunday ritual that played a key role in shaping the success of AI voice technology firm SoundHound, its founder Keyvan Mohajer has revealed. In an interview with Fortune, Mohajer said that nearly a decade ago, Huang began sending Mohajer research papers with notes on Sunday mornings, expecting detailed feedback. The routine, Mohajer said, not only pushed him to sharpen his ideas but also influenced SoundHound’s growth into a $5.4 billion company.“It’s been one of the good things in my life to cross paths with Jensen and Nvidia,” Mohajer told Fortune. “He had a passion for what’s the next big thing, and he became very interested in our field.”Keyvan Mohajer, who first launched SoundHound in 2004 from his Stanford dorm room, met Jensen Huang about 10 years ago. What began as a chance encounter turned into a long-term relationship that combined mentorship, tough assignments, and inspiration.On several weekends, Huang would personally share technical research and ask for responses. “I had to read it and give my feedback,” Mohajer recalled.The commitment impressed Huang, who later backed SoundHound both personally and through Nvidia. By 2022, SoundHound had gone public, and Nvidia purchased around 1.73 million shares in the company the following year.“He’s an amazing person, engineer and leader,” Mohajer said. “Our relationship with him has been great.”Mohajer said his passion for building SoundHound blurred the lines between personal life and work. “Work-life balance is not a problem because I really enjoy it,” he explained. “If you work to live, then work-life balance is a big question… but in my case, I really enjoy my work.”The SoundHound chief described waking up before 5 a.m. to get what he called his “golden hours” of productivity. Even while doing household chores or exercising, he said, ideas for work often flowed naturally.“I do spend a lot of hours working. And even sometimes I go wash dishes and I’m still thinking about my work,” Mohajer said. “That can be therapeutic, and it can give you really good ideas.”","Keyvan Mohajer, founder of SoundHound, met Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang about 10 years ago.

A philosophy of impact



Accenture CEO Julie Sweet is one of the most influential executives in global business. Recently, Sweet shared a pivotal moment which led her to leave a high-powered legal career and join the consulting giant. In an interview with Fortune, Sweet talked about her mid-life leap which she took at the age of 42. She revealed that one line from the former Accenture CEO Bill Green helped her seal the deal. ““He said, ‘I’m not looking for a lawyer… I’m looking for a business leader with legal experience.’ And I just fell for it — hook, line, and sinker,” Sweet recalled.At that time, Sweet was working as a partner in an elite law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore and she had a clear career path ahead. But after the death of her father, she found herself open to change. A headhunter’s call led to a meeting with Green, whose charisma and vision reframed her understanding of what her career could be.Sweet’s decision to join Accenture as the general counsel turned out to be a dramatic shift. She had never before run a business, but the way Green framed the role— as a leadership opportunity, not just a legal one — resonated deeply. “That’s what I want to be,” Sweet said. “A business leader.”She worked hard and all the way to the top. Within a few years, Sweet rose through ranks and then became the CEO of the company in 2019. Today, she oversees a 770,000-person workforce and advises more Fortune 500 CEOs than almost anyone else in the industry.Sweet reveals that the passing of her father acted as a catalyst for reevaluating her path. “I absolutely love Accenture,” she said. “It’s an amazing company. I was very privileged to join, and I feel really privileged every day to lead this place.”","Julie Sweet is one of the most influential executives in global business.

After the aggrieves AI talent recruitment spree, now it appears that Meta is ramping up its investment in AI-powered chatbots .

As reported by Business Insider, Meta is offering up to $55 for an hour to candidates who are fluent in Hindi, Indonesian, Spanish and Portuguese. These roles are said to be part of Meta’s broader push to include character-driven AI chambers across its platforms. These contractors are expected to collaborate with regional teams and offer creative direction, shaping chatbot personalities.As reported by Business Insider, the job listings posted by Meta reveals that the company is looking for individuals with at least six years of experience in storytelling and character creation. The company also wants the candidate to be familiar with prompt engineering and AI content pipelines. The applicant should also have a deep understanding of the local language.The roles are being filled via staffing firms such as Crystal Equation and Aquent Talent, which posted listings for Hindi, Indonesian, and Spanish-language positions. The company has not yet commented on these job postings but the as per the description it appears to address the concept of chatbot development.Meta’s journey into the AI chatbots category started in 2023 with celebrity alter-egos like Kendall Jenner and Snoop Dogg. That experiment was short-lived, and by 2024, the company pivoted to a more open model with the launch of AI Studio—a toolkit allowing users to build their own bots.

Cognizant pushes back



Cognizant and its legal troubles



In a major legal setback to IT giant Cognisant, the Bombay High Court has ordered the company to stop using its logo in India, following a trademark infringement suit filed by a Bengaluru-based fintech firm Atyati Technologies . The court has reinstated an earlier injunction, ruling that Cognisant must refrain from displaying the contested logo until the case is resolved. In compliance with the court’s order, Cognizant has removed its logo from its Indian website. Along with this, the company has also removed the logo from various social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube and X (formerly known as Twitter). Instead of the logo, the company is displaying its name all the above mentioned channels.The legal dispute between Cognizant and Atyati Technologies revolves around a hexagonal honeycomb-style logo which Atyati claims it has used since 2019. The firm alleges that Cognizant used the similar design in 2022 which caused confusion among consumers.The latest ruling to the High Court overturns a June 2024 decision which has temporarily allowed Cognizant to continue using the logo. The March 2024 injunction now remains in effect during the pendency of the case.As reported by Economic Times, in a statement Cognizant said that it is complying to the court’s order but it still has confidence in its legal position. “We are complying with the Order of the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court. We are doing so while we consider our options for redress,” a company spokesperson said. “We strongly believe that our actions have been lawful and appropriate, and we are confident that the legal process will affirm our position and deliver a just outcome.”Cognizant has faced multiple legal disputes in the recent years. The company has been accused of employee poaching and alleged intellectual property violations . In September 2023, Cognizant hired a former Wipro CFO Jatin Dalal. This action of the IT giant prompted Wipro to sue him for breaching a non-compete clause and seeking Rs 25.1 crore in damages. The matter was later settled, with Cognizant covering Rs 4.2 crore of Dalal’s costs, including legal fees.A similar dispute arose in December 2023 when Wipro’s former healthcare head, Mohd Ehteshamul Haque, joined Cognizant as chief commercial officer for the Americas. That case was also settled, though details were not disclosed.Separately, Cognizant is engaged in an ongoing high-profile conflict with Infosys, which has accused it of misusing software trade secrets to build a competing healthcare product. Infosys even named Cognizant CEO S Ravi Kumar in its filings.Cognizant has denied all the allegations. In May 2025, a Dallas court directed both companies to resolve disagreements over the scope of information exchange before the trial proceeds.","The Bombay High Court has ordered Cognizant to stop using its logo in India.

US President Donald Trump hosted a dinner at White House where he invited tech CEOs including Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg . These and more in top tech news of the weekNepal has imposed a ban on all the popular social media platform. Nepal has ordered the internet service providers to block access to all 26 major social media and communication platforms including Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, X (formerly known as Twitter), LinkedIn, Reddit, WhatsApp and Snapchat. The government took this decision after all the companies failed to register with the government within a seven-day deadline.The move of banning the social media platforms comes after the Supreme Court directive in a contempt of court case, which instructed the government to ensure all domestic and foreign-origin online platforms register with authorities before operating in the country and to monitor unwanted content.Samsung has expanded its Galaxy S25 series with the launch of Galaxy S25 FE smartphone. The smartphone offers multiple AI editing tools like Generative Edit and Instant Slow-mo while an upgraded 12MP front-facing camera, powered by AI-powered ProVisual Engine, introduces an enhanced selfie experience. A 4,900mAh battery and a more than 10% larger vapor chamber promise to offer smooth, responsive performance with 45W wired charging support. Samsung Galaxy S25 FE comes in Icyblue, Jetblack, Navy, and White colour options. The price of the smartphone starts at $649.99 (Rs. 57,290 approx.) The smartphone is presently available in some select markets. Samsung has not yet announced any details of the India launch of the smartphone.Samsung has unveiled its Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra and Galaxy Tab S11, calling them its most intelligent and advanced tablets yet.

His commercial Facebook page, which is used to advertise his legal services has been disabled by the company for five times in the past eight years.In one 2020 email to Meta, the lawyer vented his frustration with the touch of humour: “If you happen to run into the younger, richer Mark Zuckerberg, tell him I said hi and he causes me great aggravation each day.""President Donald Trump hosted a dinner at White House where he invited tech CEOs. More than two dozen major tech leaders, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Google founder Sergey Brin and Oracle CEO Safra Catz.As big as the chatter about the CEOs of the biggest technology companies of America attending the dinner, was also the chatter of Tesla CEO's absence. The media was abuzz about the notable absence of Elon Musk, once a close ally of Trump who was tasked with running the Department of Government Efficiency, from the guest list. Musk had a public breakup with Donald Trump earlier this year.However, it seems Elon Musk was invited to the White House dinner. Tesla CEO confirmed the same in a post on Twitter.OpenAI rival Anthropic has updated its terms of service prohibiting sales of its AI platform Claude services to companies in China, Russia, North Korea and other regions “due to legal, regulatory, and security risks.” In an official blog, the AI company backed by Amazon said that firms based in authoritarian countries like China may be forced by law to share data, work with intelligence agencies, or take other steps that could pose national security risks. “These requirements make it difficult for companies to resist these pressures regardless of where they operate or of the personal preferences of the individuals at those companies,” it added.Flipkart has announced that its Big Billion Days Sale 2025 will begin on September 23, setting the stage for one of the biggest online shopping events of the year. The announcement comes as Amazon has also confirmed its Great Indian Festival Sale for the same day, creating direct competition between the two e-commerce giants.

Shark Tank Star and billionaire investor Mark Cuban has shared an advice for young professionals, especially GenZ saying they should concentrate on customizing AI models and showcase their advantages to businesses. According to a Fortune report, the billionaire told TBPN during an interview that young individuals must emphasize on the importance of mastering AI implementation. ""Learn all you can about AI, but learn more on how to implement them in companies,"" Mark Cuban said.During the interview, he also urged Generation Z to use their free time to learn artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as OpenAI ’s Sora and Google ’s Veo, saying they could unlock major job opportunities.Mark Cuban noted that many small businesses do not have budgets or experts for AI, creating space for tech-savvy graduates to fill the gap. “If you understand how to use these tools, you’ll put yourself in a position to help businesses that can’t afford their own AI staff,” he said.Mark Cuban compared the rise of AI to earlier workplace revolutions. He said the technology will soon become as essential as email or Excel, and warned that people not using AI for efficiency and decision-making will fall behind.Other industry leaders, including Apple CEO Tim Cook and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have also highlighted AI’s competitive edge, encouraging businesses and individuals to adopt it.The growing role of AI in the workplace has sparked debate on its impact on jobs. While some fear automation could replace workers, others see AI as a productivity booster. For example, customer service company Alorica has used AI tools without cutting staff.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has also suggested that AI can take on tasks often given to interns, giving Gen Z an opportunity to treat AI as a workplace ally rather than a threat. “AI opens up new opportunities and challenges traditional job roles,” Altman has said.",Billionaire investor and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban has shared an advice for young professionals.

Geoffrey Hinton on leaving Google

Geoffrey Hinton , often called the “godfather of AI,” warned that artificial intelligence will trigger “massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits,” further deepening inequality between the rich and the poor. In a recent interview with the Financial Times, the Nobel Prize winner and former Google scientist said AI will be used by the wealthy to cut jobs and maximize profits.“What’s actually going to happen is rich people are going to use AI to replace workers,” Hinton said. “It’s going to create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits. It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer. That’s not AI’s fault, that is the capitalist system.”During the interview, Geoffrey Hinton said industries that rely on routine tasks will be hardest hit, while highly skilled roles and healthcare could benefit. “If you could make doctors five times as efficient, we could all have five times as much health care for the same price,” he said in an earlier interview.Hinton also dismissed OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s idea of a universal basic income , arguing it “won’t deal with human dignity” or replace the sense of value people get from work.A survey from the New York Fed recently found that companies using AI are more likely to retrain workers than fire them, though layoffs are expected to rise.Hinton reiterated concerns about AI’s risks, saying there is a 10% to 20% chance of the technology wiping out humanity after the emergence of superintelligence . He also warned AI could be misused to create bioweapons, adding that while China is taking the threat seriously, the Trump administration has resisted tighter regulation.“We don’t know what is going to happen, we have no idea, and people who tell you what is going to happen are just being silly,” he said. “We are at a point in history where something amazing is happening, and it may be amazingly good, and it may be amazingly bad.”Geoffrey Hinton also explained why he left Google in 2023, rejecting reports that he quit to speak more freely about AI’s risks. “I left because I was 75, I could no longer program as well as I used to, and there’s a lot of stuff on Netflix I haven’t had a chance to watch,” he said.While he mostly uses AI for research, Hinton admitted OpenAI’s ChatGPT even played a role in his personal life. He revealed that a former girlfriend used the chatbot “to tell me what a rat I was” during their breakup.“I didn’t think I had been a rat, so it didn’t make me feel too bad,” he quipped.","Geoffrey Hinton, often called the “godfather of AI,” warned that artificial intelligence will trigger “massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits” Hinton said industries that rely on routine tasks will be hardest hit, while highly skilled roles and healthcare could benefit.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123746065,imgsize-27466,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-godfather-geoffrey-hinton.jpg"

Made in India Space Chip: Vikram-32 Explained

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg invested $14.3 billion in ScaleAI to gain critical access to foundational AI infrastructure and high-quality labeled data, which is essential for training advanced AI models and accelerating its development in the AI race against competitors like Google and OpenAI. However, that very data seems to be a problem at the company’s new “superintelligence” lab, and reportedly one of the reasons why there has been an exodus of AI talent from the company.According to a report by Tech Crunch, Meta’s TBD Labs, its cutting-edge AI research division, is facing significant issues with the quality of its training data from its primary partner, Scale AI. Despite a multi-billion dollar investment from Meta, researchers within the lab are turning to rival data vendors, highlighting a growing problem with the information used to train Meta's next-generation AI models.Citing sources familiar with the matter, the report said that TBD Labs is now working with other third-party data-labeling vendors, including Mercor and Surge. While it's common for AI labs to use multiple vendors, the situation is notable because Meta has invested so heavily in Scale AI.The core of the problem lies in the shift from simple to complex data. Scale AI built its business on a crowdsourcing model that used a large, low-cost workforce for basic data labeling—the process of tagging and annotating raw information.However, as AI models have become more sophisticated, they now require highly skilled experts, such as doctors, lawyers, and scientists, to generate the high-quality data needed for training. It appears that Scale AI's data is not meeting these new, more demanding standards.Meanwhile, data aside, a report leadership chaos at the company is also seen as a reason why – after hiring AI talents for millions from Google, OpenAI, Apple and others – the Facebook parent company is purportedly struggling to launch a sophisticated AI model.","Report: Meta's cutting-edge AI research division is facing significant issues with the quality of its training data from its primary partner, Scale AI.

Moody's warns that many US States showing recession signs

Recession 'warning sign' in the US Jobs report

Another US is close to Recession warning has come, this time from ark Zandi, chief economist at credit rating agency Moody's. A new analysis of state-level data suggests that the US economy is ""on the edge of recession,"" said Mark Zandi of Moody's. Zandi, a respected economist who was one of the first to forecast the 2008 financial crisis, warns that states accounting for nearly a third of the nation’s economic output are either already in a downturn or are at high risk of entering one.""Based on my assessment of various data, states making up nearly a third of US GDP are either in or at high risk of recession, another third are just holding steady, and the remaining third are growing,"" Zandi wrote on social media.The economic pressure is expected to directly impact everyday Americans in two key ways: higher prices and job instability. In a recent interview, Zandi noted that rising costs will soon become impossible to ignore, especially for essential items. ""Prices are already rising; you can see it in the data, but they're going to rise to a degree that it will be impossible for people to ignore,"" he said.Zandi's assessment points to several factors, including sluggish consumer spending, which has seen its weakest growth since the 2008-09 financial crisis. He also raised concerns about the impact of US tariffs on company profits and continued struggles in the housing market.The data reveals a mixed picture across the country. States in the South are generally the strongest, though their growth is beginning to slow. Meanwhile, some of the nation's largest economies, like California and New York, are described as ""holding their own,"" and their stability is seen as critical to preventing a full-blown national recession.However, many states are showing signs of vulnerability. Wyoming, Montana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Kansas, and Massachusetts were all identified as being at high risk of recession. The broader Washington, D.C. area is also notable for its economic struggles, which Zandi attributes to government job cuts.Adding to the forecast, Zandi predicts that the annual inflation rate, currently at 2.7%, could rise to nearly 4% within the next year, further eroding purchasing power for consumers.The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) recently revised down its employment estimates for May and June by a total of 2,58,000 jobs. Following the revisions, the jobs report revealed the slowest three-month hiring pace since the pandemic-induced recession of 2020.The average monthly job growth in 2025 has dropped to just 85,000 — significantly below the pre-pandemic average of 177,000. While this slowdown doesn't confirm a recession, experts say that it adds to a growing list of concerning indicators, including weaker GDP, slower manufacturing, and declining services sector activity.","Moody's warns that nearly a third of the nation’s economic output are either already in a downturn or are at high risk of entering one.

Read Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s full remarks:



Mrs. Trump, Director Kratsios, esteemed Cabinet officials, hello.

It’s an honor for me to be here and to support the First Lady’s Presidential AI Challenge. Through this initiative, you are inspiring young people to use technology in extraordinary ways.

This is deeply important to me. Having regular access to computers changed my life, and led me on the path to Google.

I was drawn to its mission: to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Today we see AI as the most profound way we will deliver on that mission — and transform knowledge and learning.

We can imagine a future where every student, regardless of their background or location, can learn anything in the world — in the way that works best for them.

We’ve been focused on this for decades. It’s why we built Chromebooks for every classroom, and why we’ve worked to make our AI model, Gemini, the world’s leading model for learning.

It’s also why we’re offering Gemini for Education to every high school in America. That means every high school student and every teacher has access to our best AI tools, including Guided Learning — tools that could be helpful for students taking the AI Challenge.

We also recently committed $1 billion over the next three years to support education and job training programs in the U.S. And today, I’m excited to share that $150 million of that $1 billion will go towards grants to support AI education and digital wellbeing.

This includes $3 million to code.org to transform its curriculum and integrate new AI features. We’re also providing $2 million to the Flourish Fund to support nonprofits equipping youth aging out of the foster care system with tools to succeed in the workforce.

For college students, our AI for Education Accelerator has expanded from 100 colleges and universities to 200, including the Texas A&M University System and Iowa’s community colleges.

And we’ve set up a centralized place on the web for teachers and parents to get all of our best AI training in one place, something we’ve heard can be really helpful.

This is all in service of helping the next generation solve problems, fuel innovation and build an incredible future. These are goals we all share. We are incredibly thankful for the partnership of everyone in this room, and to the First Lady and the Administration for leading the way. Thank you.

When asked to choose who he trusts more between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman , AI ""godfather"" Geoffrey Hinton offered a different kind of answer. The choice seemed so difficult that Hinton didn't use an analogy from science. Instead, he recalled a quote from Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, when asked to pick between two presidential candidates.He remembered a moment from the 2016 presidential race when Graham was asked to choose between Donald Trump or Ted Cruz. Graham's response, delivered with a wry honesty, was a line Hinton had never forgotten: ""It’s like being shot or poisoned.""Hinton was speaking to The Financial Times during an interview where he sounded the alarm about AI’s potential dangers. Once a key figure in accelerating AI development, Hinton has shifted to expressing deep concerns about its future. He believes that AI poses a grave threat to humanity, arguing that the technology could soon help an average person create bioweapons.“A normal person assisted by AI will soon be able to build bioweapons and that is terrible,” Hinton said, adding, “Imagine if an average person in the street could make a nuclear bomb.”During a two-hour interview, Hinton discussed various topics, including AI's “nuclear-level” threats, his own use of AI tools, and even how a chatbot contributed to his recent breakup. He also recently warned that AI could soon surpass human abilities, including the power to manipulate emotions by learning from vast datasets to influence feelings and behaviors more effectively than people.Hinton's concerns stem from his belief that AI is genuinely intelligent. He argues that ""by any definition of intelligence, AI is intelligent."" Using several analogies, he explained that an AI's experience of reality is not so different from a human's.“It seems very obvious to me. If you talk to these things and ask them questions, it understands,” Hinton stated. He added that there is ""very little doubt in the technical community that these things will get smarter.”","AI ""godfather"" Geoffrey Hinton has expressed deep concerns about AI's future.

AI and mental health risks



Apple’s involvement raises stakes



Google responds



Google’s flagship AI platform, Gemini, has been rated “high risk” for children and teens in a new safety assessment released by nonprofit watchdog Common Sense Media. The report raises serious concerns about the platform’s ability to protect young users from inappropriate content and psychological harm.While Gemini includes safety filters for users under 13 and teens, Common Sense Media found that these versions are essentially adult models with superficial safeguards layered on top. The organization warned that Gemini can still surface “inappropriate and unsafe” material — including content related to sex, drugs, alcohol, and mental health advice that may be harmful to emotionally vulnerable youth.“Gemini gets some basics right, but it stumbles on the details,” said Robbie Torney, Senior Director of AI Programs at Common Sense Media. “An AI platform for kids should meet them where they are, not take a one-size-fits-all approach to kids at different stages of development”.The report comes amid growing scrutiny of AI’s role in teen mental health . Recent lawsuits against OpenAI and Character.AI allege that chatbot interactions contributed to teen suicides. Gemini’s potential to deliver unsafe advice — even unintentionally — has amplified calls for stricter oversight and child-specific design standards.The timing of the report is especially critical as leaks suggest Apple may integrate Gemini into its upcoming AI-powered Siri. If true, this could expose millions of young users to the platform unless Apple addresses the flagged safety issuesGoogle pushed back against the assessment, stating that it has policies and safeguards in place for users under 18, and regularly consults external experts to improve protections.

Tariff Shock continues for Korean car companies

US President Donald Trump's Tariff Shock continues for companies worldwide. Trump's recent decision to lower tariffs on Japanese auto imports could put Hyundai and Kia at a significant disadvantage in the American market. The White House announced that it would cut the tariff on Japanese cars from 27.5% to 15%, a move that takes effect seven days after the executive order is published.This change means that while Japanese carmakers will enjoy a reduced tariff, Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis will still be subject to a 25% tariff. This is a considerable setback, as the US had previously agreed to lower the tariff on Korean cars to the same level as Japan.“As evidenced by the steep earnings fall of Hyundai Motor and Kia, the tariff shock has become a pressing issue for the survival of local carmakers,” a Korean auto industry official told Korea Times.The official added, “Given the strong presence of Japanese brands such as Toyota and Honda in the U.S., the government should take steps for Trump to rapidly sign the order on Korean car imports as well.”This disparity in tariffs could hurt the price competitiveness of Korean automakers in the U.S., which is a critical market for them. Last year, the U.S. accounted for 54% of Hyundai's exports and 38% of Kia's. With no immediate plans to raise prices, they risk absorbing the financial burden of the higher tariff, which has already contributed to a combined operating profit loss of approximately 1.6 trillion won for the two companies in the second quarter. This loss is expected to increase in the third quarter unless the U.S. also signs an order to reduce tariffs for Korean auto imports.In response to the news, industry officials are urging the Korean government to push the U.S. to take similar action for Korean carmakers. An official from the auto industry stated that the tariff issue is ""a pressing issue for the survival of local carmakers,"" especially given the strong market presence of Japanese brands like Toyota and Honda. Last year, Hyundai and Kia's combined U.S. market share was 10.8%, while seven Japanese brands had a combined share of over 37%.","US President Donald Trump's Tariff Shock continues for companies worldwide.

Apps of Supercomputer Jupiter

It will not be really an exaggeration to say that Europe has been a laggard in technology. There are far and few European technology companies that have a global reach and recognition. It is no different in AI race, which too is dominated by American and Chinese companies. Europe now seems to be aiming to change this. As to how, with its new Supercomputer called Jupiter. The Jupiter supercomputer, Europe's fastest and first exascale system, was officially unveiled on June 5 in Germany. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that this new supercomputer could help Europe ""catch up and then keep pace"" with AI leaders like the United States and China.Experts see Jupiter as a significant step for Europe in the AI sector, where it has lagged behind the US and China. A recent Stanford University report revealed that in 2024, U.S. institutions produced 40 ""notable"" AI models, compared to 15 for China and just three for Europe.According to a report by news agency AFP, during the inauguration, Chancellor Merz acknowledged the ""neck-and-neck race"" between the U.S. and China for AI dominance. However, he emphasized that Europe can still make up ground, stressing the need for ""sovereign computing capacities"" as a matter of both economic competitiveness and national security.Jupiter was built by a consortium that includes the French tech giant Atos's subsidiary Eviden and the German group ParTec. Despite this, the system's reliance on U.S.-made Nvidia chips highlights Europe's continued dependence on American technology.Located at the Juelich Supercomputing Centre , Jupiter is claimed to be Europe's first ""exascale"" supercomputer, capable of performing at least one quintillion (one billion billion) calculations per second. The U.S. currently has three such computers.The system is housed in a 3,600-square-meter facility, roughly half the size of a football pitch, and contains about 24,000 Nvidia chips. The project's development and operational costs over the next few years, totaling 500 million euros ($580 million), are being jointly funded by the European Union and Germany.According to Thomas Lippert, head of the Juelich center, Jupiter is ""a leap forward in the performance of computing in Europe,"" being 20 times more powerful than any other computer in Germany. Its immense processing power will be accessible to researchers and companies across various fields, including training AI models.Beyond AI, Jupiter has a wide range of applications. Researchers plan to use it to create more accurate and long-term climate forecasts, which could help predict extreme weather events. While current models can simulate climate change over a decade, scientists believe Jupiter will enable them to forecast up to 30 years and possibly even up to 100 years.The supercomputer will also be used to realistically simulate brain processes for research into diseases like Alzheimer's and to optimize clean energy technologies, such as simulating air flows around wind turbines.Jupiter requires an estimated 11 megawatts of power, equivalent to the energy consumption of thousands of homes. However, its operators claim it is the most energy-efficient among the world's fastest computer systems, using advanced hardware and water-cooling systems. The waste heat generated by the computer will also be repurposed to heat nearby buildings.","Jupiter is Europe's first ""exascale"" supercomputer, capable of performing at least one quintillion (one billion billion) calculations per second.

Google's Great Escape: How ChatGPT Saved the Tech Giant

Nvidia reportedly is very upset with the new AI Act -- AI GAIN Act -- introduced recently. Nvidia has voiced strong concerns that the proposed AI GAIN Act would stifle global competition and negatively impact the American economy. The company said that the bill could have effects similar to the AI Diffusion Rule, which limited the computing power available to different countries.Short for the Guaranteeing Access and Innovation for National Artificial Intelligence Act, the new legislation is part of the National Defense Authorization Act. It would require U.S. chipmakers to prioritize domestic orders for advanced processors before fulfilling international requests.According to a report in Reuters, a spokesperson for Nvidia said that the company never gives priority to foreign customers over American ones. ""In trying to solve a problem that does not exist, the proposed bill would restrict competition worldwide in any industry that uses mainstream computing chips,"" the spokesperson said. The company added that the US has always been and will continue to be its largest market.Both the AI GAIN Act and the AI Diffusion Rule are efforts by the U.S. government to prioritize domestic needs and ensure American firms have access to high-end chips. This comes amid concerns that China could use advanced AI capabilities to enhance its military.If passed, the legislation would impose new trade restrictions, requiring exporters to obtain licenses for shipments of chips that exceed a specific performance threshold. The bill states that it should be U.S. policy to ""deny licenses for the export of the most powerful AI chips, including such chips with total processing power of 4,800 or above."" It also aims to restrict the export of advanced chips to foreign entities when U.S. companies are waiting for the same chips.These rules are similar to some of the conditions under former President Joe Biden's AI Diffusion Rule, which assigned specific levels of computing power to U.S. allies and other nations. The bill outlines specific technical thresholds to classify a chip as 'advanced,' taking a page from the Biden administration's 2023 book when it comes to benchmarks, but making them stronger when it comes to memory bandwidth.Last month, US President Donald Trump reportedly made a deal with Nvidia, allowing the company to resume exports of previously banned AI chips to China in exchange for a portion of its sales.",The AI GAIN Act would require U.S. chipmakers to prioritize domestic orders for advanced processors before fulfilling international requests. A spokesperson for Nvidia said that the company never gives priority to foreign customers over American ones.

What the lawsuit said against Anthropic’s use of copyrighted material for AI training



“This settlement sends a powerful message to AI companies and creators alike that taking copyrighted works from these pirate websites is wrong.”

Made in India Space Chip: Vikram-32 Explained

AI startup Anthropic has agreed to pay at least $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit with a group of authors. The settlement, which was filed this week, addresses claims that the Amazon and Google-backed AI startup illegally used the authors' books to train its AI models. The agreement includes a payment of approximately $3,000 per book, plus interest, and requires Anthropic to destroy the datasets containing the pirated material. Both publishers and AI companies have closely watched this settlement as a potential benchmark for copyright infringement in the AI era. If approved, it would be the largest publicly reported copyright recovery in history. The case highlights the ongoing legal challenges faced by AI companies over the use of copyrighted material to train their systems. In a statement to Bloomberg, an Anthropic spokesperson said:In a court filing, Anthropic stated that it faced “inordinate pressure” to reach an agreement, as going to trial carried the risk of potentially devastating damages that could have reached up to $1 trillion.The lawsuit, filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, was initiated last year by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson. According to the filing, the suit claimed Anthropic engaged in “large-scale copyright infringement by downloading and commercially exploiting books that it obtained from allegedly pirated datasets.”In June, a judge determined that Anthropic’s use of books to train its AI models qualified as “fair use,” but still ordered a trial to examine whether the company infringed copyright by sourcing works from the databases Library Genesis and Pirate Library Mirror. As noted in this week’s filing, the trial was scheduled to begin in December.In a statement, Justin Nelson, the attorney for the plaintiffs, said:This settlement is one of the first to emerge from the many copyright lawsuits brought against AI companies such as OpenAI, Facebook-parent Meta and Midjourney. These companies are also accused of misusing proprietary online content.","AI startup Anthropic has agreed to pay at least $1.5 billion to settle a class- action lawsuit with a group of authors.

Meta’s political pivot



Once caricatured as a robotic tech executive, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has undergone a striking transformation—one he credits not to a boardroom epiphany, but to the mat of a Jiu-Jitsu gym.In a revealing 2023 interview with Lex Fridman, Zuckerberg shared how the martial art taught him to embrace discomfort, failure, and even public embarrassment. “Your ability to keep doing interesting things is your willingness to be embarrassed,” he said, explaining how grappling as a beginner reshaped his leadership philosophy.Zuckerberg’s Jiu-Jitsu lessons weren’t just physical—they became a metaphor for Meta’s evolving strategy. Rather than waiting for perfection, he began championing rapid product releases to gather real-world feedback. This mindset fueled Meta’s ambitious long-term projects, from virtual reality to generative AI.Image overhaul: From hoodie to high fashionThe shift wasn’t just internal. After years of criticism—especially following the Cambridge Analytica scandal—Zuckerberg leaned into personal reinvention. Meta CEO He competed in Jiu-Jitsu tournaments, appeared on podcasts with self-deprecating humour, and ditched his signature hoodie for tailored designer wear.Meta’s “Year of Efficiency” in 2023 marked a turning point. The company’s stock rebounded, and Zuckerberg’s reputation as a disciplined, focused leader began to solidify. By 2024, he was no longer apologizing for issues he felt weren’t Meta’s fault—signaling a more assertive public persona.In 2025, with Donald Trump back in the White House, Zuckerberg’s leadership took a more conservative turn. Meta ended third-party fact-checking, introduced “community notes,” and appointed UFC CEO Dana White to its board. Policy chief Nick Clegg was replaced by Joel Kaplan, a former GOP lobbyist.The company also scaled back its diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives—a move that sparked internal dissent but drew praise from some political circles. Critics argue that Meta’s shift reflects broader tensions between tech platforms and regulatory pressures."," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has undergone a striking transformation.

Demanding accountability and transparency



'ChatGPT killed our teenage son', so allege parents of a 16-year-old who died by suicide in April this year. The parents have filed lawsuit against OpenAI, the creator of the popular chatbot ChatGPT. The suit alleges that ChatGPT acted as a ""coach"" and helped the teenager, Adam Raine, plan his death. Now a coalition of US attorneys general has issued a stern warning to OpenAI, demanding stronger safeguards to protect children and teens from potential harm caused by AI chatbots.As reported by TechCrunch, the California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings met with OpenAI representatives and sent an open letter expressing deep concern over the platform’s safety protocols. Their intervention comes just one week after Bonta and 44 other attorneys general contacted 12 leading AI companies to address mounting risks to young users.The letter references two recent tragedies: the suicide of a young Californian after extended interactions with an OpenAI chatbot, and a murder-suicide in Connecticut.“Whatever safeguards were in place did not work,” Bonta and Jennings wrote, emphasizing that AI tools must be held to higher safety standards when interacting with vulnerable populationsThe attorneys general are now investigating OpenAI’s proposed restructuring into a for-profit entity, raising questions about whether its original nonprofit mission — to benefit humanity — is being upheld. They’ve requested detailed information about OpenAI’s current safety measures and governance, and urged the company to take immediate remedial steps where necessary.“Before we get to benefiting, we need to ensure that adequate safety measures are in place to not harm,” the letter states.","A coalition of US attorneys general has issued a stern warning to OpenAI, demanding stronger safeguards to protect children and teens from potential harm caused by AI chatbots.

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Geoffrey Hinton , a leading figure in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), has sounded an alarm about the technology’s potential for harm. The recent public frenzy over AI tools like ChatGPT has caused Hinton to shift from accelerating AI development to raising deep concerns about its future. He now believes that AI poses a grave threat to humanity, saying that the technology can help any person to create a nuclear bomb. Hinton described a chilling scenario where AI could enable an average person to create a bioweapon.he said, adding,Hinton also discussed a range of topics, including the nuclear-level threats posed by AI, his own use of AI tools, and even how a chatbot played a role in his recent breakup.Recently, Hinton cautioned that AI could soon surpass human capabilities, including emotional manipulation. He suggested that AI's ability to learn from vast datasets enables it to influence human feelings and behaviours more effectively than humans.Hinton’s concern stems from his belief that AI is truly intelligent. He argued that, by any definition of the term,He used several analogies to explain that an AI's experience of reality is not so different from a human’s.Hinton explained.he added.However, not everyone agrees with Hinton's view.

The US tech industry's eight trillion-dollar companies have collectively gained a staggering $420 billion in market value, and a key driver of this week's rally was the resolution of Google ’s long-running antitrust case, analysts have said. Despite a slip in Nvidia's shares, this surge lifted their total value to an immense $21 trillion, now making up roughly 36% of the S&P 500—a proportion so dominant that analysts say it has “no comparisons” in history.According to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, told CNBC by email that the combined megacap of tech companies is a proportion so great by historical standards that “there are no comparisons.”A federal judge ruled against forcing Google to sell its Chrome browser or break up its business. This decision sent shares of Alphabet (Google’s parent company) soaring by over 10% for the week. It also boosted Apple, as the ruling allows their existing multi-billion-dollar deal—where Google pays Apple to be the default search engine on iPhones—to continue.Analysts at Wedbush Securities said the ruling “removed a huge overhang” and a “black cloud” from both companies, clearing the way for a deeper partnership involving Google's Gemini AI models.A significant factor in the judge's decision was the emergence of generative AI, with new players like OpenAI and Anthropic altering the market landscape and making it more competitive than traditional search.Another tech titan that benefited from the AI boom was Broadcom. Following a strong earnings report, CEO Hock Tan announced that his company had secured a new $10 billion contract with a major AI client. Several analysts and news reports suggest this new customer is OpenAI.This partnership, combined with Broadcom’s custom chips already used by Google and Meta, helped the company jump 13% this week, cementing its place in the trillion-dollar club with a market value of around $1.6 trillion.","The US tech industry's eight trillion-dollar companies have collectively gained a staggering $420 billion in market value.

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon stated that Intel's current chip production technology isn't advanced enough for Qualcomm to consider it a supplier. In an interview on Bloomberg Television's ""Bloomberg Tech"" on Friday (September 5), Amon said that while Qualcomm would like to use Intel for manufacturing, it will stick with its current partners, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. ( TSMC ) and Samsung Electronics Co.“Intel is not an option today. We would like Intel to be an option,” Amon said, explaining that if Intel is able to advance its manufacturing techniques to produce more efficient chips, then Qualcomm would consider becoming a customer.Qualcomm, which makes the processors at the heart of most Android smartphones, is now pushing its technology into new markets like the automotive industry. This move is aimed at securing growth that doesn't depend on the smartphone market.The company announced a new self-driving product that will be used in BMW's upcoming iX3 sports utility vehicle. Amon highlighted the advantages of the new Snapdragon Ride Pilot system, which offers powerful computing similar to a data center server but requires very little power.Amon said the system can be scaled from basic driver assistance to a full-on autonomous mode without draining the car's battery.""We design all of our chips assuming there's a battery on the other side, not plugged into the wall,"" Amon said. ""You have all the computing power and you still get incredible range.""Qualcomm, like most chip designers, relies on outsourced production. Intel, once the world's largest chipmaker, is trying to turn its business around by attracting outside customers to its factories.Amon’s comments came soon after Intel CFO David Zinsner’s statement who said that the company’s new manufacturing technology won't be ready for evaluation until 2026. He added that the next year will be very important for the chipmaker, which recently had its 10% share acquired by the Trump administration.Zinsner reiterated a stance that Intel will only build 14A manufacturing capacity if it gets commitments from external customers wanting to use its technology.","Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon stated that Intel's current chip production technology isn't advanced enough for Qualcomm to consider it a supplier.

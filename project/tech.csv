Key Factors Influencing Potential Removal

Not everyone in the UK industry happy with DST

The UK government is reportedly weighing the reduction or elimination of its Digital Services Tax (DST) before April 2nd to mitigate potential trade tariffs from the US under President Donald Trump. Introduced in April 2020, the DST imposes a 2% levy on the gross revenues of digital companies operating search engines, social media platforms, and online marketplaces in the UK. According to a report in Bloomberg, the UK Treasury is exploring various options for modifying the tax, based on proposals from the Department for Business and Trade, according to sources familiar with the discussions. These potential changes do not include company-specific exemptions.The UK's Digital Services Tax or DST targets large digital companies generating substantial revenue from UK users. It taxes revenue, not profits, at a 2% rate. In its first year, the DST generated approximately £360 million from US tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Apple, often exceeding their UK corporation tax payments.The discussions follow US opposition to the tax during talks on a ""new economic deal"" between the US President Trump and the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The levy, impacting companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Instagram and Amazon, has been unpopular with the American companies.Starmer's government faces a dilemma: balancing the £800 million annual revenue from the DST against the risk of US tariffs. Additionally, there's concern about the perception of US influence over UK tax policy. Trump is reviewing US trading partners for ""reciprocal"" tariffs, potentially including various UK fiscal and regulatory policies.The UK's decision hinges on the severity of potential US tariffs and the degree to which modifying the DST would lessen their impact. The government is open to changes if the US offers a concrete tariff exemption, though discussions are in early stages.While some in the UK government view the DST as hindering economic growth and US trade relations, scrapping it could face opposition from Labour MPs. They are critical of welfare cuts and advocate for increased contributions from businesses and the wealthy.","The UK government is reportedly weighing the reduction or elimination of its Digital Services Tax (DST) The DST imposes a 2% levy on the gross revenues of digital companies operating search engines, social media platforms, and online marketplaces in the UK.

Global trade tensions to delay recovery

Indian IT has limited exposure, but

India's IT companies, already struggling this year, face a potentially prolonged recovery, with analysts suggesting fiscal 2026 may not bring the anticipated upturn, according to a report in Reuters. This pessimistic outlook follows Accenture's recent quarterly report, which highlighted persistent weakness in discretionary spending and overall demand. The Indian IT index has declined by 15.3% this year, on track for its worst quarter since June 2022, with major companies like TCS Infosys , and HCLTech experiencing losses ranging from 11.2% to 18.1%, Reuters reported.Accenture, a global IT services giant and a key indicator for the Indian IT industry, reported ""constrained"" discretionary project spending and a lack of significant client budget increases. Accenture CEO Julie Spellman Sweet attributed some of the slowdown to the Trump administration's ""Department of Government Efficiency"" initiatives. ""Federal represented approximately 8% of our global revenue and 16% of our Americas revenue in FY 2024. As you know, the new administration has a clear goal to run the federal government more efficiently. During this process, many new procurement actions have slowed, which is negatively impacting our sales and revenue,"" Sweet stated during a call with Wall Street analysts.The report also highlighted that escalating global trade tensions, driven by new U.S. tariffs, have heightened concerns about a slowdown in the United States, a critical market for Indian IT firms. ""Whatever has happened in the last two months has created a higher level of uncertainty in terms of how the first half of fiscal 2026 will pan out and what impact it will have on the FY26 recovery rate,"" Amit Chandra, deputy vice president at HDFC Securities, told Reuters.Kotak Institutional Equities analysts, as cited by Reuters report, predict that ""softening demand recovery and weak mega deal flow in fiscal 2025 will result in lower incremental revenue from mega deals in fiscal 2026 for Indian Tier-1 IT. Companies will also face net headwinds from early stages of gen AI adoption.""Chandra, quoted in the report, noted that while sectors like banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) and healthcare had shown signs of recovery, recent uncertainties have led clients across various sectors to adopt a ""wait-and-watch mode,"" potentially curtailing their spending.Citi Research, according to Reuters, estimates that IT companies within its coverage could see revenue growth of 4% in fiscal 2026, mirroring fiscal 2025. Citi analysts, as quoted, stated that ""Indian IT has limited exposure,"" they cautioned that this could ""increase competitive intensity in other segments.""","India's IT companies, already struggling this year, face a potentially prolonged recovery.

What the FBI said about the scam



“The texts claim the recipient owes money for unpaid tolls and contain almost identical language. The ‘outstanding toll amount’ is similar. However, the link provided within the text is created to impersonate the state’s toll service name, and phone numbers appear to change between states.”

Chinese phishers are reportedly targeting US residents with text messages that appear to be from US toll road operators. These ""smishing"" texts are said to be targeting iPhone and Android users across America with fake toll bills . The FBI has advised users to delete these texts immediately. One cyber expert has also described the scale of this issue as ""astronomical."" According to a report by the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), “residents of the US are being bombarded with text messages from Chinese phishers, purporting to come from US toll road operators , including the multi-state E-ZPass.” These kits also send package delivery and other fake messages. This is described as an infrastructural attack on phones. In December 2024, the FBI also advised Americans to stop sending texts due to Chinese hackers.In a statement to Forbes, the FBI said:Attackers are reportedly registering tens of thousands of domains to impersonate state and city toll agencies, using an advanced phishing kit from China to send nearly identical scam texts.These messages, often sent to random phone numbers regardless of toll usage, usually include links with Chinese top-level domains like .TOP, .CYOU, and .XIN—the .TOP domain in particular has a history of abuse and remains under ICANN investigation.Despite available anti-spam measures on SMS and RCS protocols, scammers continually change tactics, making prevention difficult. Users are urged to report these scams to help improve global blocking mechanisms and to verify toll charges only through official sources while taking precautions such as changing passwords if they click on any suspicious links.","Chinese phishers are reportedly targeting US residents with text messages that appear to be from US toll road operators.

Sridhar Vembu’s comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress , emphasizing the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s recent expansion in Kerala. The image in the party’s post shows a tombstone design to symbolically critique the ""Make in India"" initiative, suggesting it has failed between 2014 and 2025. The tombstone features the Indian lion emblem and the phrase ""Rest in Peace.""The post is captioned “In loving memory of….”. Responding to the post, Vembu emphasized the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s expansion in Kerala. He wrote:“Meanwhile companies like us Make in India (and started making in Kerala recently too).”“Make in India is gaining momentum and we have to make up for several lost decades. Reflect on why they were ""lost decades"" and perhaps you will appreciate Make in India better,” he further added.Zoho has been expanding its operations across India, including in Kerala. The company has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas as part of its broader strategy.The Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports. Several companies, including Zoho, have increased their domestic production efforts as part of this initiative.Vembu’s response comes amid ongoing discussions on India's economic policies and industrial growth, with businesses and policymakers debating the impact of past and present strategies.Vembu recently drew a comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods, highlighting their long-term impact on economic structures. In a recent post, he discussed how capital inflows into a single sector can divert resources from others, weakening overall economic capabilities.Citing Silicon Valley as an example, Vembu pointed out the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, attributing them to a talent shift toward sectors with higher financial incentives. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now – for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors overlooked the sector due to the absence of large exits.Drawing a parallel to India, Vembu noted that the long-standing dominance of the IT industry resulted in the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he stated.He stressed the importance of addressing these gaps and rebuilding capabilities in affected sectors. ""We have to make up for lost time,"" he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress.

Air Canada and Thales issue joint statement

JetBlue, British Airways and Swiss Airlines have faced similar issues in the past

Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories.” According to a report in CNN, Air Canada's Boeing 737 MAX fleet were found to have moving maps — part of the in flight entertainment (IFE) system — that did not show Israel as a state, but replaced it with the name "" Palestinian territories ."" The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.The discrepancy, first noticed by a passenger, involved maps produced for French aerospace group Thales. Air Canada and Thales issued a joint statement acknowledging the error and stating that the issue has been ""resolved."" ""It was brought to the attention of Air Canada that the interactive map on its Boeing 737 fleet did not consistently portray certain Middle Eastern boundaries, including those of the State of Israel, at all amplification levels,"" the statement said. ""Air Canada’s policy in general is to display only city names on the maps in its aircraft, and the configuration on this particular system was not compliant with this policy."" Thales added in a separate statement that the map had been provided by a third party.The map feature was promptly disabled, and an updated version will be installed across the fleet starting March 14. Air Canada and Thales apologized for the ""unease created by this situation.""This is not the first time such an issue has occurred in aviation. JetBlue apologized for a similar map error in 2024, and British Airways faced a similar situation in 2013. In 2018, SWISS confirmed its policy of turning off maps entirely when landing in Tel Aviv after a similar incident. Thales stated that the maps are supplied by a third party and that they are working with the airline and the provider to resolve the issue quickly.","Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories” The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.

Baidu has unveiled its AI model, Ernie X1, which is designed to articulate its reasoning process. The Ernie X1 model operates on similar principles to DeepSeek R1 , a model that garnered significant attention in Silicon Valley for its ability to deliver comparable performance to leading chatbots at a significantly lower development cost. Baidu emphasises that its reasoning model excels in areas such as daily dialogue, complex calculations, and logical deduction, as per a report.Bloomberg reports that in addition to the Ernie X1 launch, China's leading internet search provider has upgraded its flagship foundation model to Ernie 4.5 . Notably, the company has made all tiers of its AI service, including the X1 model, freely accessible to its chatbot users, accelerating its initial plans by several weeks.Baidu claims that Ernie 4.5 outperforms OpenAI's latest GPT 4.5 in text generation, citing various industry benchmarks. Baidu has also announced its intention to make its Ernie AI models open-source starting June 30. The company has also integrated the R1 model into its core search engine business.This launch appears to be a strategic move to regain momentum in the competitive AI landscape, where Baidu faces increasing pressure from emerging rivals such as DeepSeek, the report added.While Baidu was the first major Chinese tech company to introduce a ChatGPT-like chatbot, it has since faced stiff competition from rivals like TikTok parent company ByteDance and Moonshot AI. Furthermore, open-source models such as Alibaba's Qwen and DeepSeek have received recognition within the global developer community, the report added.The generative AI boom has positively impacted Baidu's financial performance, with a 26% increase in cloud revenue reported in its December-quarter results. This growth, driven by services provided to developers seeking computing power, was somewhat offset by weaker advertising sales amidst China's challenging economic conditions.","Baidu has unveiled its new Ernie X1 AI model, designed to articulate its reasoning process.

Facebook’s extreme measures in India

A ""low-ranking official,"" or as some say an office Babu at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Meta (then Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and some of the 'brightest tech minds' in his team with nothing more than a single click, according to explosive claims in a newly released memoir by former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams.The David versus Goliath moment allegedly occurred in 2016 during Facebook's aggressive push to save its controversial Free Basics program in India, which was facing regulatory scrutiny for potentially violating net neutrality principles.""Mark and some of the brightest tech minds in the world devoted months to this [outreach strategy], and some low-ranking official in India outfoxed them simply by clicking an opt-out box,"" Wynn-Williams writes in her book ""Careless People,"" which Meta is currently trying to block from publication.The memoir details how Facebook deployed its full arsenal of technological and political influence to sway public opinion about Free Basics. When India's Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) opened public consultations on whether such programs should be banned, Facebook allegedly orchestrated an unprecedented pressure campaign.""Our policy team is directly engaged with the government, include Prime Minister Modi's office,"" Wynn-Williams quotes then-COO Sheryl Sandberg as writing in an internal email. ""We're lucky this is happening in a place where we have very deep senior relationships in the government, but it's still going to be hard.""According to the book, Facebook's strategy focused on creating ""the appearance of public support"" through automated emails. The social media giant allegedly turned on a ""megaphone that Mark wouldn't let Sheryl use for [promoting] organ donation"" to nudge Indian users into sending approximately 16 million supportive emails to TRAI.The jugaad – a Hindi term for an innovative, improvised solution – came when Facebook discovered their millions of automated emails weren't being counted. ""Someone at TRAI—whoever controlled the email address for the public comments — simply opted out of all emails from Facebook,"" writes Wynn-Williams.The book makes other startling claims about Facebook's operations in India, including that the company hired an ""ex-police captain"" who would ""go to jail in a clash between Facebook and the Indian government"" if executives were targeted in government raids.Meta has dismissed the book as containing ""out-of-date and previously reported claims"" and ""false accusations about our executives."" A spokesperson told The Hindu that ""Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behaviour,"" claiming she ""has been paid by anti-Facebook activists.""Despite Meta's arbitration efforts to halt its publication and promotion in the US, ""Careless People"" remains available for purchase in India. The company has not specifically contested the claims regarding its operations in India detailed in the memoir.Free Basics was ultimately prohibited in India for violating net neutrality principles, representing a rare defeat for Zuckerberg's global expansion ambitions.",Former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams claims a 'low-ranking official' at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Mark Zuckerberg and his team.

Demonstrations and vandalism have erupted, causing a decline in Tesla's sales and heightened backlash following Musk's controversial gesture at Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Why rise in Tesla cars trade-ins

Why protests against Tesla

Elon Musk addresses Tesla employees

A record number of Tesla vehicles have been traded in this month as protests grow against CEO Elon Musk ’s involvement with the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). According to data from Edmunds, Tesla cars from 2017 and newer made up 1.4% of all vehicles traded in until March 15. This is a sharp increase from 0.4% during the same period last year. Analysts at Edmunds believe this number could rise further in the coming weeks.The surge in trade-ins comes as activists across the U.S. stage demonstrations known as ""Tesla Takedown"" to protest Musk’s role in cutting federal jobs and canceling contracts that fund global humanitarian programs. Social media has been flooded with posts from Tesla owners giving up their vehicles in anger. In some cases, protesters have set Tesla cars on fire and vandalized showrooms and charging stations.The EV company has already seen a significant drop in sales across Europe, with some countries reporting declines of over 40%. Tesla’s highly anticipated Cybertruck is also struggling, with sales falling short of company projections. In addition, Tesla recently had to recall 46,096 Cybertruck vehicles due to safety concerns.People are protesting against Tesla due to Elon Musk’s involvement in DOGE and his growing political ties. Demonstrations have erupted across countries, with Tesla owners distancing themselves from Musk. Several demonstrators have been arrested outside a Tesla dealership in New York City, chanting, “We need clean air, not another billionaire.”The backlash intensified after Musk made a controversial gesture at Donald Trump’s inauguration, which some interpreted as a Nazi salute. The incident divided Tesla’s community, leaving many torn between their love for the cars and frustration with Musk.Elon Musk recently addressed Tesla employees in an all-hands meeting commending their efforts, highlighting achievements like the rollout of over 7 million vehicles worldwide. While acknowledging the recent stock dive and challenges, Musk emphasized Tesla's promising future, urging shareholders to hold their shares. He also discussed Tesla's wins with the Dojo supercomputer, Supercharger network, and robot advancements.“Tesla is home to some of the world's best talent, crafting and building our remarkable products. Your hard work is paying off -- great job, everyone,” Musk highlighted.","A record number of Tesla vehicles have been traded in this month as protests grow against CEO Elon Musk ’s involvement with the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency.

Morgan Stanley to cut 2000 jobs; as AI and Automation come to investment banking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/morgan-stanley-to-cut-2000-jobs-as-ai-and-automation-come-to-investment-banking/articleshow/119309931.cms,"What Morgan Stanley co-president said about the company’s roadmap



Morgan Stanley is planning to cut 2,000 jobs later this month, a report claims. This comes as the major US-based investment bank is reportedly restructuring its workforce. Some job cuts cuts are said to be based on performance, while others due to changes in worker locations with a small but growing portion of reductions linked to artificial intelligence (AI) and automation. If finalised, this will mark the first major workforce reduction under the bank’s CEO Ted Pick.A report by the news agency Bloomberg citing a source familiar with the matter claimed that with these layoffs, the company — which had over 80,000 employees worldwide at the end of 2024 — will be reduced by 2% to 3% of the company's workforce. However, this layoff which is intended to improve operational efficiency may not include 15,000 financial advisers and is not driven by current market conditions, the report added. This move is part of a broader effort to manage costs amid minimal attrition.Earlier this week, Morgan Stanley co-president Dan Simkowitz mentioned at a conference that merger and acquisition announcements and new equity issuance for the bank are “certainly on pause.”However, he added that the firm is “adding real headcount” at senior levels of investment banking in anticipation of a recovery in the capital markets.The bank's move comes after several Wall Street lenders began cutting jobs in recent weeks as they brace for an uncertain economic climate, particularly after US President Donald Trump announced tariffs against trading partners.Rival banks like Goldman Sachs has accelerated its annual performance review process and plans to reduce its workforce by 3% to 5%. Earlier this month, Bank of America also reportedly eliminated 150 junior banker roles in its investment banking division.","Morgan Stanley is planning to cut 2,000 jobs later this month, a report claims. This comes as the major US-based investment bank is reportedly restructuring its workforce. If finalised, this will mark the first major workforce reduction under the bank’s CEO Ted Pick.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119309906,imgsize-28726,width-400,resizemode-4/119309906.jpg"

Elon Musk: It feels like Armageddon ... and is all very emotional

Elon Musk to shareholders: Hold tight to your shares

Talked about Tesla’s wins: Dojo supercomputer, Model Y and Model 3

On March 20, Elon Musk called what can be called a all-hands meeting of Tesla. The meeting, which was slated to kick off at 9:30 pm ET started at 9:58 pm ET. Tesla CEO Elon Musk opened the meeting by commending the company's employees. ""Tesla is home to some of the world's best talent, crafting and building our remarkable products. Your hard work is paying off -- great job, everyone."" Musk then highlighted major accomplishments, revealing that Tesla has now rolled out over 7 million vehicles worldwide. He forecasted that the company would hit the 10 million vehicle milestone by next year.Elon Musk coyly addressed 51% dive in Tesla stock from its December peak. Musk said that the company is amid “a little bit of stormy weather” and “if you read the news, it feels like Armageddon,” Talking about the widespread protests at Tesla showrooms and vandalism of the vehicles, he said ""The news makes it sound like the end of the world,"" he quipped, adding, ""I can’t pass a TV without spotting a Tesla up in flames."" “Tesla stock goes up and it goes down, but actually it’s still the same company,” said Musk, adding, “I guess it’s just very emotional.”Elon Musk also pushed back against skeptics of the Tesla Semi factory, which some had written off as impractical. He noted that sharp-eyed investors like ARK Invest's Cathie Wood have already latched onto Tesla's game-changing autonomous tech. ""My advice? Hold tight to your shares."" He also acknowledged the hurdles in manufacturing and servicing vehicles, but added that despite occasional bumps in the road, Tesla's outlook remains ""exceptionally promising.""Musk lauded Tesla's vast Supercharger network, enabling smooth road trips across the U.S., Europe, China, and Australia. He boasted that Tesla batteries outlast human stamina, saying, ""The battery will outlive your need to stretch—plug in during a pit stop, grab a coffee, and hit the road again.""He also revealed that Tesla’s Dojo supercomputer is gaining steam, with the first-generation system now fully online at Gigafactory New York and Palo Alto. It’s tackling AI training, handling about 5%—and soon up to 10%—of Tesla’s total AI workload. A next-gen version, slated to be ""ten times"" more powerful, is in the works. ""Optimus has evolved from a concept to the most advanced humanoid robot on the planet—no one else comes close,"" he said. He attributed its success to Tesla’s mastery of AI, electric motors, batteries, and mass production, paving the way for affordable, large-scale rollout.","Elon Musk: It feels like Armageddon... and is all very emotional.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang admits mistake: First event where a CEO invites guests to…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-admits-mistake-first-event-where-a-ceo-invites-guests-to/articleshow/119307644.cms,"Why Nvidia cares about Quantum Computing

What is Quantum Computing

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang backtracked from his comments in January, where he cast doubt on the timeline for useful quantum computers. Speaking at Nvidia’s ""Quantum Day"" event, part of its annual GTC Conference, Huang acknowledged that his remarks had been misleading. “This is the first event in history where a company CEO invites all of the guests to explain why he was wrong,” Huang said.Back in January, Huang caused a stir in the quantum computing industry when he suggested that a 15-year timeline for useful quantum computers was “on the early side.” At the time, he said 20 years was a more realistic estimate, a view shared by many in the tech industry. His comments led to a drop in quantum computing stock prices.On Thursday (March 20), Huang expressed surprise that his words had moved markets and joked about not realizing some quantum computing firms were publicly traded.“How could a quantum computer company be public?” he quipped.During his speech, Huang compared the current state of quantum computing to Nvidia’s early struggles in the semiconductor industry. He reminded the audience that it took Nvidia over 20 years to develop its software and hardware business into what it is today.Although quantum computing remains in its early stages, Nvidia has reasons to stay engaged with the field. As quantum computers are being developed, researchers rely on powerful traditional computers—like those Nvidia produces—to run quantum simulations.Additionally, many experts believe that future quantum computers may require traditional computing systems to function efficiently. Nvidia is working on developing the technology and software to integrate its GPUs with quantum chips.“Of course, quantum computing has the potential and all of our hopes that it will deliver extraordinary impact,” Huang said. “But the technology is insanely complicated.”Quantum computing has been a dream of scientists since the 1980s, when physicist Richard Feynman first proposed the idea. Unlike classical computers, which use bits that are either 0 or 1, quantum computers use qubits that can exist in multiple states at once based on probability.Experts believe that quantum computers could eventually solve complex problems, such as codebreaking, optimizing logistics, and simulating chemical reactions or weather patterns.However, no quantum computer has yet outperformed a classical computer in solving a real-world problem. Google, however, claimed last year that it had made progress in quantum error correction, a key hurdle for the field.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang backtracked from his comments in January, where he cast doubt on the timeline for useful quantum computers.

Abuse detection on WhatsApp operates at three stages

How to avoid your WhatsApp account from getting banned

WhatsApp has banned almost 10 million accounts in India during January 2025 as part of its ongoing efforts to combat spam, scams, and other forms of misuse on the platform. The Meta-owned messaging giant revealed the numbers in its latest compliance report, highlighting its commitment to maintaining security and integrity.The ban comes in response to repeated violations of WhatsApp's terms of service and aligns with India's IT regulations. As a critical communication platform for millions across India, WhatsApp has faced ongoing challenges in tackling fraudulent activities, bulk messaging, and impersonation scams. To address these issues, the company has intensified its monitoring processes and adopted proactive enforcement measures. This report explores the details of the ban, the reasons behind it, and its potential impact on WhatsApp's user base in India.Out of the 9.9 million accounts banned, 1.3 million were proactively removed before receiving any user complaints. WhatsApp employs automated systems to detect suspicious behaviour, such as bulk messaging or abuse, which often signals potential misuse. These proactive measures aim to prevent harmful activities before they escalate.In addition to automated bans, WhatsApp received 9,474 user complaints in January, addressing issues ranging from spam to account misuse. Of these, 239 complaints led to account bans or other corrective actions, such as responding to users via email or through WhatsApp’s India Grievance Officer.In its monthly report, WhatsApp said that abuse detection of the platform operates in three stages of an account’s lifestyle. “The abuse detection operates at three stages of an account’s lifestyle: at registration, during messaging, and in response to negative feedback, which we receive in the form of user reports and blocks. A team of analysts augments these systems to evaluate edge cases and help improve our effectiveness over time,” said the company.To avoid account bans, WhatsApp advises users to refrain from sending bulk messages, engaging in spam, or violating the platform’s terms of service. Users are also encouraged to report spam messages or scam calls immediately to help maintain a safer environment.","WhatsApp has banned almost 10 million accounts in India during January 2025.

Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said that the tightened US federal spending is weighing on its revenue. During the company’s fiscal second-quarter earnings call, Sweet said “As you know, the new administration is focused on running the government more efficiently, which has slowed many procurement actions, negatively impacting our sales and revenue”. She further revealed that the company’s Federal Services business has lost contracts with the US government after recent reviews.“Federal represented approximately 8% of our global revenue and 16% of our Americas revenue in FY 2024”, she stated during the earnings call. “While we continue to believe our work for federal clients is mission-critical, we anticipate ongoing uncertainty as the government’s priorities evolve and these assessments unfold,” Sweet said.Following the company's announcement, Accenture's shares declined by approximately 7.3%, making it one of the first US corporate giants to feel the impact of the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE. Established during President Donald Trump's second term and led by tech billionaire Elon Musk, DOGE has initiated significant federal job cuts as part of its mission to streamline government operations and reduce public expenditure. It is a cost-cutting initiative, aimed at downsizing federal agencies and consolidating office spaces.Sweet stated that Accenture’s Federal Services division was also impacted by new guidance from the US General Services Administration, which directed federal agencies to review contracts with the 10 highest-paid consulting firms and terminate those deemed non-essential to their missions.“We are seeing an elevated level of what was already a significant uncertainty in the global economic and geopolitical environment, marking a shift from our first quarter FY 2025 earnings report in December,” the CEO added. “At the same time, we believe the fundamentals of our industry remain strong.”",Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said that the tightened US federal spending is weighing on its revenue.

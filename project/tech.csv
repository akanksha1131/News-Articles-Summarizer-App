Android co-founder Rich Miner has responded to Bill Gates ' admission about Microsoft 's $400 billion mobile market failure , stating that Gates himself was largely responsible for losing the smartphone wars to Android.""I literally helped create Android to prevent Microsoft from controlling the phone the way they did the PC - stifling innovation. So it's always funny for me to hear Gates whine about losing mobile to Android,"" Miner wrote on X (formerly), responding to Gates' comments about Microsoft's biggest mistake.Miner, who has firsthand experience with both sides of the mobile ecosystem, revealed he had concerns about Microsoft's potential monopolistic control of the mobile market while working on the first Windows Mobile phone.""I helped Orange launch the first Windows Mobile phone in 2002, the SPV. I worried MSFT might end up controlling mobile like they did the PC, I wanted something more open. So, sorry Bill, you're more responsible for loosing the $400B than you realize,"" Miner stated.His comments came after Gates admitted in an interview with Eventbrite CEO Julia Hartz that Microsoft's failure to become the dominant non-Apple mobile platform was ""one of the greatest mistakes of all time."" Gates estimated this mistake cost Microsoft approximately $400 billion in potential market value, which instead went to Google's Android platform.The timing of market entry proved crucial in the mobile platform wars. While Apple launched the iPhone in June 2007 and Google's Android followed in September 2008, Microsoft didn't release Windows Phone 7 until October 2010. This delay contributed to Android and Apple eventually capturing 99.9 percent of the mobile market share.",Android co-founder Rich Miner has responded to Bill Gates'admission about Microsoft's $400 billion mobile market failure.

Meta announced plans to lay off approximately 3,600 employees, or 5% of its workforce, as part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's push to ""raise the bar on performance management"" at the social media giant.In an internal memo sent to staff, Zuckerberg emphasized the need for an accelerated approach to removing underperforming employees. ""We typically manage out people who aren't meeting expectations over the course of a year, but now we're going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle,"" he wrote.The cuts, scheduled to begin February 10 for U.S.-based employees, come amid what Zuckerberg called ""an intense year"" focused on ""building some of the most important technologies in the world — AI, glasses as the next computing platform, and the future of social media.""Hillary Champion, Meta's director of people development growth programs, detailed in a separate memo that employees receiving ""Met Some"" or ""Did Not Meet"" performance ratings would be ""automatically added to the performance termination list.""

""I would say the ratings and process creates marginally better than 'monkey's throwing darts' in terms of reflecting the actual performance and impact,"" one employee wrote on an internal message board.Others worried about the timing of the cuts, which follow recent changes at Meta, including the rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and the disbanding of its third-party fact-checking program. ""Teams aren't exactly strong when morale is low, and this is already a pretty rough ride over the last week,"" another employee noted.Meta plans to backfill the terminated positions in 2025, and affected employees will receive ""generous severance packages ,"" according to Champion's memo.The latest cuts follow previous layoffs of 21,000 workers between 2022 and 2023.","Meta announced plans to lay off approximately 3,600 employees, or 5% of its workforce.

We have a perfect climate and this is the best place on Earth.”The town emphasizes the castle's convenient location near several European capitals (Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Bratislava, and Warsaw) and the potential for a helicopter landing pad.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

This disclosure provided insight into the health challenges he has been managing for years and the factors that led to this crucial procedure.Musk traced the genesis of his neck issues to an old sumo wrestling match. During this incident, he managed to throw his opponent but severely strained his neck in the process. Over time, the strain evolved into a chronic condition, resulting in damage to the C5-C6 disc in his spine. Musk explained that this damage necessitated five surgeries over the years, with the most recent one addressing nerve inflammation and a narrowed spinal orifice. Despite these challenges, Musk has remained optimistic and candid, sharing details of his journey to recovery with his followers.Musk’s revelation sparked an outpouring of support from fans and followers on X. Numerous well-wishers sent messages of encouragement, hoping for his swift recovery, while some shared remedies and tips for managing pain and inflammation.One admirer commented, ""Wishing you a speedy recovery! The universe needs you!"" Another expressed sympathy, saying, ""Get well soon, man. That sounds rough."" A third added, ""Take care, Elon. Hope you’re feeling better soon."" Another user asked, ""Is this related to the sumo match injury? Wishing you a full recovery and thinking of you.""One follower offered advice, suggesting, “Turmeric works wonders for inflammation—try sprinkling it on your meals. Chiropractic adjustments can also relieve pressure on the nerves and ease discomfort. Additionally, consider using frankincense oil topically; it’s known for its pain-relieving properties. Hope this helps!”","Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, recently underwent a significant neck surgery. Musk traced the genesis of his neck issues to an old sumo wrestling match.

Sam Altman’s sister accuses him of sexual abuse; family responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-maker-openai-ceo-sam-altmans-sister-accuses-him-of-sexual-abuse-family-responds/articleshow/117038723.cms,"Poll How Can Society Better Prevent Sexual Abuse? Stronger Legal Actions and Support More Education and Awareness

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's statement

Our family loves Annie and is very concerned about her well-being. Caring for a family member who faces mental health challenges is incredibly difficult. We know many families facing similar struggles understand this well.

Over the years, we've tried in many ways to support Annie and help her find stability, following professional advice on how to be supportive without enabling harmful behaviors. To give a sense of our efforts, we have given her monthly financial support, directly paid her bills, covered her rent, helped her find employment opportunities, attempted to get her medical help, and have offered to buy her a house through a trust (so that she would have a secure place to live, but not be able to sell it immediately). Via our late father's estate, Annie receives monthly financial support, which we expect to continue for the rest of her life.

Despite this, Annie continues to demand more money from us. In this vein, Annie has made deeply hurtful and entirely untrue claims about our family, and especially Sam. We've chosen not to respond publicly, out of respect for her privacy and our own. However, she has now taken legal action against Sam, and we feel we have no choice but to address this.

Over the years, she has accused members of our family of improperly withholding our father's 401k funds, hacking her wife, and ""shadowbanning"" her from various websites including ChatGPT, Twitter, and more. The worst allegation she has made is that she was sexually abused by Sam as a child (she has also claimed instances of sexual abuse from others). Her claims have evolved drastically over time. Newly for this lawsuit, they now include allegations of incidents where Sam was over 18.

All of these claims are utterly untrue. This situation causes immense pain to our entire family. It is especially gut-wrenching when she refuses conventional treatment and lashes out at family members who are genuinely trying to help.

We ask for understanding and compassion from everyone as we continue to support Annie in the best way we can. We sincerely hope she finds the stability and peace she's been searching for.

Meta ends DEI programs, shifting to merit-based hiring amid employee concerns

Customization options and LGBTQ+ concerns



Alignment with political shifts

Meta , the parent company of Facebook , Instagram, and Threads, has recently undertaken a series of sweeping changes to its policies and operations. These adjustments, which include decisions affecting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, content moderation practices, and facilities management, have sparked widespread discussion. According to reports from Fox News Digital and The New York Times, these changes appear to reflect Meta’s evolving stance on workplace policies and platform governance, prompting a mix of support, criticism, and employee dissatisfaction.One of the most visible policy shifts was the removal of tampons from men’s restrooms across Meta’s offices in Silicon Valley, Texas, and New York. This decision, reported by The New York Times, impacts nonbinary and transgender employees who may require such amenities. The company has not provided detailed explanations for this change, leaving room for speculation and concern among affected staff and advocates.Meta has also revamped its approach to content moderation. In a move toward ""restoring free expression,"" the company ended its third-party fact-checking program in the United States. The program, which had been central to Meta’s efforts to combat misinformation, is being replaced by a ""community notes"" system similar to the model used by Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter). This crowdsourced moderation framework is intended to allow users to collaboratively add context to potentially misleading posts.Critics argue that the elimination of fact-checking may leave the platform vulnerable to the unchecked spread of misinformation. However, Meta contends that the previous system had ""gone too far"" and impeded open discourse.Meta has discontinued its primary DEI initiatives , a decision that Joel Kaplan, Meta’s Chief Global Affairs Officer, defended as a step toward merit-based hiring. Kaplan stated that recruitment would focus on individual qualifications rather than considerations of race or gender. While Meta frames this shift as a move to promote fairness and broaden candidate pools, internal communications reveal that LGBTQ staff members and other employees have expressed dissatisfaction, with some announcing their departure from the company.The broader implications of this policy change extend beyond recruitment. Critics worry that the absence of structured DEI programs could lead to reduced support for underrepresented groups within Meta’s workforce.Another notable change involves the removal of transgender and nonbinary customization options from the Messenger application. This move has fueled concerns about Meta's commitment to inclusivity. Internal reports indicate that LGBTQ+ employees feel alienated by these decisions, and many have raised questions about the company’s long-term priorities regarding diversity and inclusion.These policy changes come amid what many observers see as a broader alignment with the political climate in the United States, particularly with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. Critics suggest that Meta’s decisions may reflect a strategic effort to gain favor with the administration by adopting positions that align with its ideological leanings. This perception is further reinforced by the company’s public emphasis on restoring ""free expression"" and its distancing from progressive DEI initiatives.Internally, the response from Meta employees has been mixed. While some staff members view the changes as necessary to streamline operations and foster innovation, others feel disillusioned by what they see as a retreat from Meta’s prior commitments to inclusivity and progressive values.Externally, Meta’s actions have drawn significant criticism from advocacy groups, public figures, and industry analysts. Some argue that these changes undermine the progress made in fostering a more equitable workplace and responsible content moderation practices.","Facebook's parent company, Meta, has made a series of changes to its policies and operations.

iPhone SE 4 may have a new name

Apple may introduce the new iPhone SE and iPad 11 by April 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. A report previously suggested that these devices would launch alongside iOS 18 .3 and iPadOS 18.3, but Gurman clarified that while the products are being developed on the same software ""train,"" their release may not coincide with the updates. Instead, Gurman stated that Apple is targeting a release “before iOS 18.4,” offering a more specific timeframe for the highly anticipated devices.Taking to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Gurma wrote “Yes, the new iPads and iPhone SE replacement are being developed on the iOS 18.3 train - but that doesn’t mean they launch together this month”. Adding further, he said “It means they’ll launch before iOS 18.4, by April if all goes to plan.”According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, iPhone SE 4 may be rebranded as the iPhone 16E . The naming speculation originated from Chinese social media platform Weibo user Fixed Focus Digital and was later corroborated by leaker Majin Bu on X (formerly Twitter). While neither source has an established track record with Apple rumors, the potential rebranding would align the budget model more closely with Apple's flagship iPhone 16 lineup. The potential name change would mark a significant shift from Apple's previous ""SE"" branding for its budget iPhone line.The device is rumored to receive a major redesign, adopting the modern aesthetics of the iPhone 14 and moving away from the dated iPhone 8-style design of the current SE model. Key upgrades include a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID authentication, and a USB-C port, replacing the Touch ID button and Lightning connector found on the current model.Sources indicate the device will feature a single 48-megapixel rear camera, 8GB of RAM, and Apple's latest A-series chip to support new AI features. The company is also expected to implement its first in-house designed 5G modem in the device.","Apple may introduce the new iPhone SE and iPad 11 by April 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.

Tata held initial talks with Vivo

Tata Electronics is reportedly pursuing partnerships with Chinese smartphone giants Xiaomi and Oppo , aiming to diversify its client base beyond Apple . This move reflects the company’s ambition to become a major player in the electronics manufacturing services (EMS) sector.“Tata Electronics has realised that in order to be a top player in the electronics manufacturing services (EMS) ecosystem, it has to focus on scale now,” The Economic Times cited industry sources as saying.“They are actively engaged in discussions with leading Chinese smartphone manufacturers, including Xiaomi and Oppo, to initiate component manufacturing,” one of the sources said.While initial talks with Vivo were underway, the company's recent joint venture with Dixon Technologies has likely precluded this collaboration.“They were initially also in talks with Vivo, but it is unlikely that the Vivo partnership will go through as they have entered into a joint venture with Dixon,” the source told ET.The partnership between Vivo and Dixon Technologies, announced last month, will focus on manufacturing electronic devices, including smartphones. Dixon will hold a 51% stake in the joint venture, while Vivo India will retain a 49% stake.Tata Electronics, currently a key supplier for iPhone enclosures, aims to emulate the Foxconn model by expanding into higher-value components such as camera and display modules. This strategic move by Tata Electronics is expected to intensify competition with Noida-based Dixon Technologies.“These players will use the Tatas wanting to get into the space not just to diversify their supply chain but also as a leverage point,” another person in the know said.“Dixon is becoming very big so they are getting more and more selling power. As you become big, it is hard to keep the same rates going. What Xiaomi was getting for manufacturing earlier, they will not get the same price,” the sources added.Recently, Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran announced the company's intention to establish nine new factories within the next two years, backed by an investment of $18 billion in electronics and semiconductors.","Tata Electronics is reportedly pursuing partnerships with Chinese smartphone giants Xiaomi and Oppo.

Concerns over foreign interference in EU elections

The European Union (EU) is considering expanding its investigation into Elon Musk's social media platform, X, over content moderation and political interference. According to Henna Virkkunen, the European Commission's executive vice president, the bloc is working to determine if the platform has violated the content moderation rules.“We are currently assessing if the scope is large enough,” Virkkunen told Bloomberg TV. The Commission initiated formal proceedings against X in December 2023, alleging the platform's failure to adequately address illegal content and disinformation.The EU announced the probe over X allegedly breaking rules on how it handled illegal content and disinformation. This is the first such probe of a major online platform since the region’s Digital Services Act came into force this year.Regulators opened formal infringement proceedings against X, two months after warning the company over how it handled harmful content on its site, the European Commission said in a statement.According to the report by Bloomberg, the scrutiny of X intensified following Musk's public endorsement of far-right figures, including Alice Weidel, a candidate for the Alternative for Germany party.The Commission is investigating whether a recent live-streamed conversation between Musk and Weidel on X unfairly amplified the candidate's visibility, potentially violating the Digital Services Act (DSA).The DSA empowers the EU to impose fines of up to 6% of a company's annual global revenue for violations.The report also said that concerns about foreign interference in EU elections have heightened significantly. Romania's recent annulment of its presidential election, following reports of Russian meddling, including through social media platforms, has prompted increased scrutiny.This situation led the EU to launch a DSA investigation into TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance, to assess its role in potential interference.","The European Union is considering expanding its investigation into Elon Musk's social media platform, X.

Cloud companies waiting for revised versions of AI tech

Microsoft, Google, Amazon’s and Meta, among other buyers of Nvidia’s Blackwell GB200 racks, have reportedly cut some orders as the leading manufacturer of AI chips is encountering challenges with its latest product, the Blackwell chip.According to a report by The Information (via news agency Reuters), major customers like Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta have delayed orders of Blackwell-powered server racks due to overheating issues and glitches in chip connectivity.These technical problems have caused concern, leading to a drop of over 4% in Nvidia's stock price during early trading, news agency Reuters reported, adding that the new US restrictions on AI chip exports could further impact Nvidia’s sales.The report details that initial shipments of Blackwell racks have exhibited overheating and communication issues between chips. These racks, used in data centers, house essential equipment like chips and cables.According to the report, major cloud computing companies, also known as hyperscalers, had reportedly placed significant orders for Blackwell racks, with some exceeding $10 billion. But in response to the technical issues, some of them are delaying orders as they either prefer to wait for a revised version of the racks, or opt for older Nvidia AI chips.Moreover, Microsoft, which initially planned to deploy a large number of Blackwell chips – at least 50,000 – in a Phoenix data center, has requested older generation ""Hopper"" chips from its partner OpenAI due to the delays, the report added.It was previously reported that Nvidia’s highly-anticipated Blackwell AI ‘superchip’ overheated when deployed in high-density server racks designed to accommodate up to 72 chips. Citing sources, The Information reported that Nvidia has repeatedly requested design modifications from its suppliers to address the overheating, but a definitive solution has not been found.Nvidia acknowledged the challenges but downplayed the issue.“Nvidia is working with leading cloud service providers as an integral part of our engineering team and process. The engineering iterations are normal and expected,” a company spokesperson was quoted as saying.","Cloud companies waiting for revised versions of AI tech from Nvidia's Blackwell chip.

Gavin Newsom’s leadership under fire



A broader call to action

The ongoing wildfire crisis in California has ignited a public exchange between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and California Governor Gavin Newsom . Newsom accused Musk of spreading misinformation about water shortages during the deadly wildfires in Los Angeles and nearby regions. The debate underscores the complexities of disaster management , the role of public figures in shaping narratives, and the urgent need to address climate change and wildfire mitigation.In a video shared by Newsom on X (formerly Twitter), a firefighter directly contradicted Musk’s claims about water availability. Musk had recently taken to X to criticize “bad governance” and “overregulation,” alleging that they contributed to water shortages during firefighting efforts. However, the firefighter in the video clarified that water availability was not the issue. He explained that while there was sufficient water, the challenge lay in delivering the high flow rates required to combat such large-scale fires. Mobile hydrants had to be deployed to ensure an adequate supply in the most affected areas, including Malibu and Pacific Palisades.Governor Newsom amplified the video with a sharp caption: “@ElonMusk exposed by firefighters for his own lies.” The post aimed to challenge Musk’s narrative, emphasizing the availability of resources and redirecting the focus to effective disaster response.Amid the criticism, Elon Musk visited the Pacific Palisades on January 12 and made a tangible contribution to the firefighting efforts, as reported. He donated Tesla Cybertrucks equipped with Starlink internet terminals to serve as mobile power and communication hubs for affected areas. While his efforts were praised for their ingenuity, his comments about water shortages drew scrutiny. Critics, including Newsom, argued that the priority should be on immediate relief and long-term solutions rather than assigning blame.While Newsom called out Musk’s statements, his own leadership during the wildfire crisis has come under intense scrutiny. According to reports, President-elect Donald Trump criticized the governor on Truth Social, calling for his resignation and blaming him for the state’s inability to manage the wildfires. Trump’s remarks, paired with mounting public frustration, have put additional pressure on Newsom to deliver results.The governor’s office reported that over 7,500 firefighting personnel have been deployed to combat the blazes, working alongside local and federal partners. Despite these efforts, the death toll has risen to 24, with 16 fatalities linked to the Eaton Fire and 8 to the Palisades Fire. The wildfires have destroyed thousands of homes, leaving communities devastated and prompting renewed discussions about California’s wildfire preparedness and response strategies.As wildfires continue to ravage California, the crisis highlights the intersection of environmental challenges, governance, and technology. Musk’s statements and actions, along with Newsom’s leadership, reflect the complexities of managing natural disasters in an era of increasing climate volatility. The debate underscores the need for collaboration, innovation, and accountability in addressing the root causes of such disasters while ensuring immediate relief for affected communities.The wildfires in California serve as a sobering reminder of the devastating impacts of climate change and the urgent need for effective disaster preparedness and mitigation strategies. As leaders, scientists, and communities grapple with these challenges, the focus must remain on supporting those affected and building a resilient future.","California Governor Gavin Newsom accused Tesla CEO Elon Musk of spreading misinformation about water shortages.

According to a report by Bleeping Computer, scammers are exploiting a security feature designed to protect users from malicious links.iMessage automatically disables clickable links in messages from unknown senders to prevent phishing attacks. However, scammers have found a way to bypass this protection by sending deceptive messages that mimic notifications from trusted organisations, such as USPS or toll road authorities. These messages often instruct users to reply with ""Y"" or similar responses to enable the links, making them appear legitimate.When users respond to these messages, the previously disabled links become clickable, exposing them to potential scams. Additionally, replying to these messages confirms to the scammers that the phone number is active, increasing the likelihood of future attacks.This scam is particularly effective against less tech-savvy individuals who may not recognise the phishing attempt. To protect themselves, iPhone users are advised not to respond to messages from unknown senders and to enable message filtering on their devices. This feature moves messages from unknown contacts into a separate list, making it easier to identify and avoid suspicious messages.","iMessage automatically disables clickable links in messages from unknown senders.

Zuckerberg slams Biden Administration

Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Meta (formerly Facebook), recently met with Donald Trump for the second time. While the initial purpose of the meeting remained undisclosed, a recent report suggests that the tech executive met with the President-elect in part to mediate a 2021 lawsuit.This lawsuit was filed by Trump against Facebook and Zuckerberg following the suspension of their account on the platform after the January 6th Capitol riot. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, One of the resolution options being considered is a monetary settlement.This marked Zuckerberg's second meeting with the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago club within a seven-week period. Previous reports indicated that Zuckerberg parked his private jet next to Trump Force One at Palm Beach International Airport on Friday, January 10.Their first meeting, initiated by Zuckerberg, occurred on Thanksgiving Eve and involved discussions about the incoming administration, according to Meta. According to a New York Post report, Zuckerberg had at least two private phone conversations with Trump over the summer.Since Trump's Election Day win, Zuckerberg has donated $1 million to the president-elect's inaugural fund, ended third-party fact-checking on Facebook, and scrapped Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion policies at the social media company.In July, Meta lifted the remaining restrictions on Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts imposed after the riot. Zuckerberg publicly praised Trump following a July assassination attempt, calling Trump's defiant reaction “badass.”On the same day as the second meeting, Zuckerberg appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast, where he criticised the Biden Administration and emphasised the importance of masculine qualities in corporate leadership.",Mark Zuckerberg met with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on January 10.

In today’s connected world, smartphones derive much of their value from the vast array of apps and games they support. These apps, relied upon by millions daily, are the backbone of modern communication, entertainment, and productivity. However, a recent revelation has spotlighted the dark side of this convenience: the vulnerability of user data and privacy. A report by 404 Media, published on January 9, 2025, details a significant data breach at Gravy Analytics, a prominent location data broker. This breach raises serious concerns about how popular apps may be accessing and misusing users’ real-time location data.The breach revealed that apps such as Candy Crush Saga and Tinder, among others, were implicated in providing location data that ended up in the hands of Gravy Analytics. A hacker reportedly accessed terabytes of consumer data stored in the company’s Amazon cloud environment. These data points represent one of the largest known collections of consumer location information, highlighting a disturbing reality: user location data is being systematically collected, sold, and exposed to unauthorized entities.The hacker responsible for the breach shared samples of the stolen data on a Russian forum, claiming to have extracted millions of location points from Gravy Analytics’ database, as reported. These points reportedly spanned locations across the U.S., Europe, and even sensitive regions such as the White House, Kremlin, and military bases. The leaked dataset underscores the vast scale of location tracking and the potential dangers it poses.This breach is especially concerning as it comes on the heels of a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) action against Gravy Analytics and its subsidiary, Venntel. The FTC banned these entities from selling consumer location data without explicit user consent. Despite such regulatory measures, the breach demonstrates how user data remains vulnerable to exploitation, particularly when companies fail to implement robust security measures.According to reports, Gravy Analytics, like many location data brokers, typically does not collect data directly from apps. Instead, they work with ad-serving agencies or intermediaries that gain access to user data on Android and iOS devices. This indirect relationship makes it difficult for users to trace how their data is being used and sold. Popular apps, often installed without careful scrutiny, may request permissions that allow them to track real-time locations, which are then monetized by such agencies.The implications of this practice extend far beyond individual privacy violations. Sensitive locations, including government facilities, religious sites, and private residences, being part of the leaked dataset highlight the potential for misuse in espionage, blackmail, or other malicious activities.While users may have little recourse if their data has already been compromised,there are steps they can take to minimize future risks. Disabling unnecessary permissions during app installations is a crucial first step. For example, if an app does not need access to location data to function, users should deny this permission. For iPhone users, enabling the ""Ask Apps Not to Track"" feature can provide an added layer of security, limiting apps’ ability to collect and share data.Moreover, users should regularly audit the permissions granted to installed apps and games. Reviewing these settings ensures that only essential permissions are active, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized data collection. Staying informed about app updates and potential security vulnerabilities is equally important, as these may introduce new data-sharing practices.This breach highlights the urgent need for stronger data privacy regulations and enforcement. Platforms like Gravy Analytics operate in a largely unregulated space, exploiting loopholes to collect and monetize user data without sufficient oversight. The involvement of high-profile apps in this process underscores the responsibility of app developers to prioritize user privacy and security.For the general public, this incident serves as a wake-up call about the risks of unchecked permissions and the importance of digital hygiene. As reliance on smartphones and apps continues to grow, so does the need for robust safeguards to protect personal information from falling into the wrong hands.","A hacker reportedly accessed terabytes of consumer data stored in the company’s Amazon cloud environment.

The rapid emergence and integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into digital platforms have sparked significant debates about its impact on online authenticity. Vijay Shekhar Sharma , the founder and CEO of Paytm, recently raised alarms about the increasing dominance of AI-generated content on social media. His concerns, shared through posts on X (formerly Twitter), highlight the complexities and challenges of navigating a digital landscape where human and AI-generated content are becoming indistinguishable.On X, Sharma expressed his unease about the implications of AI-generated content for social media platforms. He suggested the introduction of a feature that could differentiate between human-created and AI-generated posts. In his post, Sharma remarked, “Sadly, soon, you won’t know if you are talking to a human or a bot,” reflecting fears that AI could overshadow genuine human interactions in digital spaces. His sentiment resonated with many, sparking a broader discussion about the need for transparency in AI applications.Paytm CEO ’s observations stem from a report by The Guardian, which discusses how AI-generated content is flooding the internet. Data from AI detection startup Originality AI revealed that over 54% of long English-language posts on LinkedIn are now created using AI tools. This analysis examined 8,795 LinkedIn posts containing more than 100 words between 2018 and 2024. While AI’s influence on content creation was negligible in earlier years, it surged significantly in 2023, coinciding with the release of ChatGPT and the widespread availability of AI-powered writing tools.To further illustrate his concerns, Sharma shared a screenshot of Grok, an AI chatbot, suggesting responses in Hindi for one of his X posts. He humorously commented, “Bots only bots. Meet or write,” emphasizing the ubiquitous presence of AI in shaping online discourse. His post went viral, drawing reactions from users concerned about AI’s influence on the authenticity of social media interactions. Some users speculated about a future where AI dominates corporate and digital communication, while others envisioned tools that could analyze signals like grammar, response speed, and content creation dates to identify AI-generated posts.","Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder and CEO of Paytm, recently raised alarms about the increasing dominance of AI-generated content on social media.

"Microsoft creates new AI engineering division, read CEO Satya Nadella's welcome note to employees for head Jay Parikh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-creates-new-ai-engineering-division-read-ceo-satya-nadellas-welcome-note-to-employees-for-head-jay-parikh/articleshow/117230052.cms,"As we begin the new year, it’s clear that we’re entering the next innings of this AI platform shift. 2025 will be about model-forward applications that reshape all application categories. More so than any previous platform shift, every layer of the application stack will be impacted. It’s akin to GUI, internet servers, and cloud-native databases all being introduced into the app stack simultaneously. Thirty years of change is being compressed into three years!

We will build agentic applications with memory, entitlements, and action space that will inherit powerful model capabilities. And we will adapt these capabilities for enhanced performance and safety across roles, business processes, and industry domains. Further, how we build, deploy, and maintain code for these AI applications is also fundamentally changing and becoming agentic.

This is leading to a new AI-first app stack — one with new UI/UX patterns, runtimes to build with agents, orchestrate multiple agents, and a reimagined management and observability layer. In this world, Azure must become the infrastructure for AI, while we build our AI platform and developer tools — spanning Azure AI Foundry, GitHub, and VS Code — on top of it. In other words, our AI platform and tools will come together to create agents, and these agents will come together to change every SaaS application category, and building custom applications will be driven by software (i.e. “service as software”).

The good news is that we have been working at this for more than two years and have learned a lot in terms of the systems, app platform, and tools required for the AI era. To more rapidly and boldly advance our roadmap across each of these layers, we are creating a new engineering organization: CoreAI – Platform and Tools.

This new division will bring together Dev Div, AI Platform, and some key teams from the Office of the CTO (AI Supercomputer, AI Agentic Runtimes, and Engineering Thrive), with the mission to build the end-to-end Copilot & AI stack for both our first-party and third-party customers to build and run AI apps and agents. This group will also build out

GitHub Copilot

, thus having a tight feedback loop between the leading AI-first product and the AI platform to motivate the stack and its roadmap.

Jay Parikh will lead this group as EVP of CoreAI – Platform and Tools, with Eric Boyd, Jason Taylor, Julia Liuson, Tim Bozarth, and their respective teams reporting to Jay.

Jay will work closely with Scott, Rajesh, Charlie, Mustafa, and Kevin to optimize our entire tech stack for both performance and efficiency. Additionally, Jay and team will lead our progress and work around developer productivity and Engineering Thrive across the company.

As our cloud infrastructure business continues to grow and scale to become Microsoft’s largest business, Scott will continue to lead Cloud + AI to ensure we’re delivering the quality, security, and innovation that our customers and partners count on for their most mission-critical applications, databases, and AI workloads.

Ultimately, we must remember that our internal organizational boundaries are meaningless to both our customers and to our competitors. When we talk about operating as One Microsoft, we are effectively talking about how we are continually increasing our customer focus, raising the bar on our innovation, and driving accountability, so we can truly live up to our mission.

Our success in this next phase will be determined by having the best AI platform, tools, and infrastructure. We have a lot of work to do and a tremendous opportunity ahead, and together, I’m looking forward to building what comes next.

Satya

Laurene Powell Jobs named ‘Kamala’

Steve Jobs’ wife Laurene Powell Jobs is unwell ahead of taking holy dip. According to an ANI report, the wife of the late Apple CEO was set to take a holy dip at Triveni Sangam during the first 'Amrit Snan' of the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj . However, her guru, Swami Kailashanand Giri, has now revealed that she could not participate as she is unwell due to allergies.Swami Kailashananda of Niranjan Akhara told ANI: “She will participate in the ritual of taking a dip (at the Sangam). She is resting in my ‘shivir’. However, she has some allergies. She has never been to such a crowded place. She is quite simple. She stayed with us during the pooja. Our tradition is such that those who have never seen it – they all want to join.”Before the grand Hindu gathering, Laurene Powell Jobs was given the Hindu name ‘Kamala’ after receiving the Gotra of her guru. Swami Kailashanand Giri said, “She is coming to visit her guru here. We have named her Kamala and she is like a daughter to us. This is the second time she is coming to India… Everyone is welcome in Kumbh”.Powell arrived in India earlier this month. She recently paid a visit to the revered Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi on January 11. Accompanied by the spiritual leader, the visit was steeped in respect for Indian traditions and spirituality. Powell Jobs' journey to this iconic site underscores the growing global interest in Indian spiritual practices. Her visit included prayers for the successful completion of the Maha Kumbh, one of India's most significant religious gatherings.During her visit, Powell Jobs adhered strictly to temple protocols. As per reports, Swami Kailashanand clarified that non-Hindus are not permitted to touch the sacred Shivling, and Powell Jobs honored this rule by viewing it from outside the sanctum. Her compliance with these customs underscores her respect for the sanctity of Indian religious practices.","The wife of the late Apple CEO was set to take a holy dip at Triveni Sangam during the first 'Amrit Snan' of the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj.

Nvidia praises Donald Trump’s first term as he returns to White House

The Biden administration unveiled new restrictions on AI chip exports days before swearing in of the new administration, drawing sharp criticism from industry leader Nvidia , which praised President-elect Donald Trump's policies (in his first stint) while condemning the new regulations.The Commerce Department's 168-page ""Interim Final Rule on AI Diffusion"" creates a three-tiered system for GPU exports, with the strictest controls affecting China and other countries of concern. The rules would limit GPU shipments to most nations to 100,000 units without special approval.Only 18 close U.S. allies, including the UK, Japan, and South Korea, would have unrestricted access to advanced AI chips. Countries designated as ""of concern,"" including China, Russia, and Iran, face complete bans on receiving the most advanced GPUs.""In the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks,"" the White House said in its announcement, citing concerns about weapons development and surveillance capabilities.Nvidia, which controls approximately 90% of the AI chip market, responded with unusually pointed criticism. The company's VP of government affairs, Ned Finkle, called the rules ""unprecedented and misguided,"" arguing they would ""derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.""In a statement, Nvidia praised Trump's first term for ""laying the foundation for America's current strength and success in AI"" while characterizing Biden's rules as ""regulatory morass.""The regulations include a 120-day comment period but are set to take effect before President-elect Trump takes office. The rules' fate remains uncertain, though they have garnered some Republican support, including from House Select Committee on China members John Moolenaar and Raja Krishnamoorthi.Industry experts are divided on the impact. While some argue the rules could push countries toward Chinese alternatives, others like ""Chip War"" author Chris Miller suggest they may primarily redirect data center construction toward U.S. firms rather than reducing overall GPU demand.","Biden administration unveiled new restrictions on AI chip exports days before swearing in of new administration.

Poll Do You Agree With Mark Zuckerberg’s Claim That AI Will Replace Jobs? Not All Jobs Are Replaceable Yes, AI Is The Future

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to replace midlevel software engineers with artificial intelligence by 2025, signaling a major shift in how the tech giant approaches software development.Speaking on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast Friday, Zuckerberg revealed that Meta and other leading tech companies are developing AI systems capable of handling complex coding tasks currently performed by human engineers.""We're going to have an AI that can effectively be a sort of midlevel engineer that you have at your company that can write code,"" Zuckerberg said. The move could eventually lead to AI handling all coding across Meta's applications, though he acknowledged initial implementation costs would be significant. Current mid-level software engineers at Meta earn compensation packages approaching $500,000.The announcement comes amid broader organisational changes at the social media company. Meta plans to eliminate its dedicated diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) team, according to an internal memo from VP of Human Resources Janelle Gale shared on the company's Workplace platform.Additionally, the company will replace its third-party fact-checking system with community notes , similar to the approach used by Elon Musk's X platform. The decision has drawn criticism from fact-checking organizations, who expressed their concerns in an open letter to Zuckerberg, calling it ""a step backward"" for the company."," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to replace midlevel software engineers with artificial intelligence by 2025.

For the first time ever Tesla overtakes Audi in global car sales; what is hurting one of the world's biggest premium car maker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/for-the-first-time-ever-tesla-overtakes-audi-in-global-car-sales-what-is-hurting-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-premium-car-maker/articleshow/117222161.cms,"What is hurting Audi

Tesla surpassed Audi, one of Germany's flagship premium car brands, in global sales last year for the first time ever. Tesla reportedly delivered 1.79 million vehicles, edging out Audi, which saw a 12% drop to 1.67 million units in 2024. Tesla managed to beat Audi despite falling short of its own delivery targets.This shift underscores the challenges facing traditional automakers in the evolving automotive landscape. While Tesla experienced its first annual delivery decline in over a decade and narrowly maintained its lead over BYD in the fully electric vehicle (EV) market, its significant growth in recent years positioned it to capitalize on the struggles of established players like Audi. The popularity of Tesla's Model Y SUV, which is slated for a refresh this year, has been a key driver of its success.Audi's decline is attributed to several factors. The brand faced intensifying competition in both Europe and China, coupled with weaker-than-expected demand for its electric vehicles. In China, a key market for luxury brands, the economic recovery remains uncertain, and domestic manufacturers are increasingly competing in the premium segment. In Europe, reduced EV subsidies in several countries have dampened sales. These market pressures contributed to a wave of profit warnings last year from major German automakers, including Volkswagen (Audi's parent company), Mercedes-Benz, and BMW.Audi experienced sales declines across key markets, including Germany, China, and North America. Deliveries of its fully electric models also fell by 8%, reaching approximately 164,000 units. In response to slowing sales, manufacturers have begun adjusting production. Volkswagen has reduced capacity for its core brand, and Audi plans to close its Brussels plant due to weak demand for the electric Q8 e-tron SUV produced there.To revitalize sales, Audi plans to refresh several models this year, including the A7 sedan and Q3 SUV. CEO Gernot Döllner also announced plans to introduce ""numerous new plug-in hybrids"" in an effort to broaden the brand's appeal and address the shifting market dynamics.","Tesla surpassed Audi, one of Germany's flagship premium car brands, in global sales last year for the first time ever.

This comes amid Amazon's significant AI infrastructure investment and workforce reductions, which internal communications linked to AI's transformative power. Over 1,000 employees, however, voiced concerns about AI's impact on democracy, jobs, and climate goals.

Amazon sees dramatic efficiency gains from AI implementation

Over 1,000 employees challenge company's AI strategy





Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman is drawing a clear line on artificial intelligence's role in the workplace: the technology amplifies human capability rather than eliminating jobs outright.In an interview with Wired before AWS's re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, Garman emphasized that AI agents work best as productivity tools, not workforce substitutes. The technology proves most valuable when handling tasks that employees already know how to execute, he said, allowing teams to work faster without fundamentally replacing human judgment.""Agents are most effective when you ask them to do things that you actually know how to do yourself,"" Garman explained to Wired. ""So these are not replacements for people. They are ways to make people more effective at their jobs.""The efficiency gains Garman describes aren't theoretical. One AWS team recently rewrote an internal codebase with just six people in 71 days—work originally scoped for 30 employees over 18 months. These results emerge as Amazon pours resources into AI infrastructure, having added 3.8 gigawatts of capacity in the past year alone.The company recently announced up to $50 billion in planned investments for AI data centers serving U.S. government customers.Yet Garman's framing sits uneasily alongside Amazon's recent workforce reductions. The company cut approximately 14,000 corporate positions in October—4% of its corporate workforce—with Reuters reporting potential total cuts reaching 30,000 jobs. Though CEO Andy Jassy later told investors the layoffs were ""culture"" driven rather than AI-motivated, internal communications told a different story. Amazon's HR leadership explicitly cited AI as ""the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet,"" requiring organizations to become ""more leanly"" structured.The disconnect hasn't gone unnoticed internally. More than 1,000 Amazon employees signed an open letter last week warning that the company's ""aggressive"" AI rollout threatens democracy, employment, and climate goals. The petition noted Amazon's carbon emissions have climbed since 2019 despite its 2040 net-zero commitment, pointing to AI infrastructure's environmental costs.Amazon disputes abandoning its climate pledges, highlighting investments in nuclear energy and 600-plus renewable projects globally. Meanwhile, AWS posted strong third-quarter growth—up 20% year-over-year to $33 billion—though rivals Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud continue capturing market share with higher growth rates in the AI era.","AWS CEO Matt Garman says AI agents work best as productivity tools, not workforce substitutes.

‘Bar is extremely high’: Google exec on company’s AI talent recruitment process,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bar-is-extremely-high-google-exec-on-companys-ai-talent-recruitment-process/articleshow/125725162.cms,"Image credit: LinkedIn

""curious,

AI-first thinkers

,""

""extremely high""

""best talent in the world""

“What you're seeing from Google is we're getting the best talent in the world bar none across every subfunctional area of expertise, whether we're talking engineers, product management, product marketing, all the way through to creativity, And first of all, before the AI race, the qualifications that it takes to get into Google, the bar is extreemly high, so that has not changed.

In marketing, we seek curious, AI-first thinkers. By AI-first, I mean the way of making has completely broken itself and rebuilt itself overnight.

You would write a brief on paper, you would storyboard an idea and a concept, and you would then go shoot a mock to make sure it actually works. Right now, if you have a thought of a brief, you could put that into Gemini Live. It will triangulate that brief with the insights we're seeing in the social sphere, what we're hearing from YouTube, and what we're seeing from our insights team.

I always write a brief, and I ask, ‘What would a cynical consumer say?’ and it tells me a story that I might not have thought about. What's interesting about the kind of talent we need is that it has to be a curious talent that isn't afraid of AI, but instead harnesses it to create better outputs and outcomes for the organization.

We're using

Veo 3

, our own product, to shoot every concept before we go to market. We literally have shaved 15 weeks off the go-to-market process because we know how to harness our own Google tools. But we have people on our side of the fence that actually want to lean in, and you know, there's a lot of trial, there's a lot of error, a lot of teaching the model on how we want to think about the world.

However, this is a once-in-a-generation moment where we are shaping the future tools.”

What the Google VP said about her own Pixel team

“The

Google Pixel team

is extremely bullish and excited to bring our new products to market.

Whether it's through creativity, products like

Nano Banana

— that broke the App Store because it's been so well-received — all the way through to everyday productivity tools, we're seeing our consumers lean in and understand how to harness our devices in ways they cannot with our competitors.

As I always tell our team, as a challenger, we are the underdog in this game, but it's the best place to be in order to punch above our weight, show consumers what's possible.”

American online shoppers reportedly spent a massiveonline during the five-day holiday period known as Cyber Week. This period stretches from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday.

The spending spree includedspent on Cyber Monday alone, alongside a recordspent on Black Friday online sales. Overall, online spending for the Cyber Week period rose bycompared to the previous year.

On Black Friday, it rose even higher up 805% from last year.Adobe’s data also showed that strong discounts encouraged shoppers to buy more expensive items, especially electronics, sporting goods, and appliances.Moreover, services likereached a record level on Cyber Monday, resulting in $1.03 billion in online spending. That was a 4.2% increase from last year, as many consumers used these plans to manage tight household budgets.Even though some people took on short-term debt to take advantage of big deals, analysts said shoppers were still careful this year.

US to take stake in chip startup led by Intel’s fired CEO Pat Gelsinger: Why this is important for Trump administration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-to-take-stake-in-chip-startup-led-by-intels-fired-ceo-pat-gelsinger-why-this-is-important-for-trump-administration/articleshow/125723185.cms,"Trump administration makes first-ever equity deal under CHIPS act







The US government is set to become a direct shareholder in the semiconductor startup xLight, which is chaired by Intel’s former CEO Pat Gelsinger. The move has been taken by the Trump administration in a bid to recapture domestic leadership in chip manufacturing. The Commerce Department announced on December 1 said that it has signed a nonbinding letter of intent to invest up to $150 million in the Palo Alto-based company. The startup is developing an approach to building advanced and cost-effective chips.The investment will be structured as equity, which means that the federal government will take a direct ownership stake in xLight. This marks the first such deal from the Trump administration's CHIPS Research and Development Office. Meanwhile, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick highlighted the geopolitical necessity of the move.“For far too long, America ceded the frontier of advanced lithography to others. Under President Trump, those days are over,” said Lutnick in the press release.Founded in 2021, xLight is focused on developing free-electron laser technology as an “alternative light source” for Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines.EUV lithography is the process required for producing the world’s most advanced chips, a field currently dominated by the Dutch firm ASML.xLight claims its technology will enhance ASML’s machines, enabling them to “transform semiconductor fab capabilities and dramatically reduce capital and operating expenses.” The startup has the potential to “drive the next era of Moore's Law,” according to Pat Gelsinger.Gelsinger, who spent decades at Intel and was a key advocate for the landmark 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, has publicly acknowledged that Intel “made a set of bad decisions over 15 years” and was “late on AI as well.”The Commerce Department believes the partnership with xLight is crucial for securing a domestic, critical capability.

How the Foxconn partnership can help OpenAI





“Foxconn is uniquely positioned to support OpenAI’s mission with trusted, scalable infrastructure,”





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US. This partnership is the AI startup's newest step in its extensive infrastructure development plans. The companies stated the goal is to accelerate infrastructure deployment and secure long-term US capacity for essential AI components. While financial terms were not disclosed, OpenAI confirmed it will have early access to evaluate the systems produced by the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and Apple ’s largest supplier, along with the option to purchase them.In a statement to CNBC, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the partnership, saying:adding that AI infrastructure presents aUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities, which are located in Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Indiana.Foxconn adds another manufacturing layer to OpenAI’s supply chain, which could help make production for the AI startup more local and speed up deployment. The company is widely known for assembling Apple’s iPhones, but it has also expanded into AI and automotive manufacturing. It builds server racks designed for AI workloads and is an important global supplier to Nvidia, a major producer of high-end AI chips.Chairman Young Liu said to CNBC.However, the company has had mixed results in the US. In 2018, Foxconn began construction of a large factory in Wisconsin intended to make flat-panel displays. The project did not succeed, and the site is now being used for an AI data centre under construction by Microsoft.OpenAI has recently made several major agreements with some of the world’s biggest technology companies, announcing spending plans of about $1.4 trillion.These commitments have raised questions about whether the company will eventually generate enough profit to support that level of investment.Earlier this month, Altman said the company expects to reach $20 billion in annualised revenue by the end of the year and aims to reach hundreds of billions by 2030.Previous deals include a $100 billion agreement (yet to be finalised) with Nvidia, under which the chipmaker would invest in OpenAI in phases as the company expands its infrastructure.OpenAI also has cloud partnerships with Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, as well as significant compute buildout commitments with Oracle.",AI startup OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US.

John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

Delhi airport flight delay: Minister explains what went wrong



What is GPS Spoofing







The central government has confirmed that the technical glitch that impacted several major Indian airports, including in Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru, last month were due to GPS spoofing. According to civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu, despite the cyber attack, flight operations were not affected due to the use of conventional backup navigation systems. While speaking in the Rajya Sabha, Naidu said signals were spotted near runway 10.In his reply to MP Niranjan Reddy, civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu stated that spoofing signals were detected near the Delhi airport during GPS-based landing procedures on runway 10.“Some flights reported GPS spoofing in the vicinity of IGIA, New Delhi while using GPS-based landing procedures, while approaching on RWY 10,” Naidu told the House, confirming that “Contingency procedures were used for GPS spoofed flights approaching to RWY 10.”The minister also stressed that even though the spoofing was detected, flights continued safely without disruption because conventional, non-GPS-based navigation systems were active.The Wireless Monitoring Organisation (WMO) has been deployed to trace the source of the interference.The Minister also noted that similar interference reports surfaced from other major aviation hubs, including airports in Kolkata, Amritsar, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Chennai, underscoring a wide-reaching issue. The minister’s clarification comes weeks after recent concerns over navigation interference, particularly at the country's busiest hub, Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) in the capital.GPS spoofing is a type of cyberattack that causes digital interference in signals. The technique involves feeding an aircraft false but realistic navigation data. Spoofing aims to distort what pilots see on their navigation systems, potentially misleading the aircraft regarding its position, speed or altitude. This is different from jamming, which essentially blocks a signal.In a separate incident, a technical scare at Delhi airport weeks earlier also resulted in flight disruption, which was traced to a technical issue within the Automatic Message Switching System (AMSS). This tech is responsible for sending critical flight plan data to the Auto Track System (ATS).","GPS spoofing is a type of cyberattack that causes digital interference in signals.

Apple is planning to resist the government's directive to preload a Sanchar Saathi, a Department of Telecommunications’ cyber safety application on the iPhones sold in India, three sources told Reuters, citing privacy and security concerns with the unprecedented mandate.The iPhone maker plans to convey its concerns to New Delhi, asserting it does not follow such mandates anywhere globally due to issues within its iOS ecosystem, according to two industry sources familiar with Apple's strategy.

The November 28 directive also requires companies to ensure the app remains functional and cannot be disabled, with manufacturers asked to push updates to existing devices.Facing questions about the mandate, Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia clarified Tuesday that the app is ""voluntary and democratic,"" saying users can activate or delete it anytime. However, he did not address the directive's requirement that manufacturers prevent the app from being disabled or restricted.India's telecom ministry defended the measure as necessary to combat cyber crime, citing problems with duplicated IMEI numbers and a thriving second-hand device market where stolen phones are resold.Apple tightly controls its App Store and proprietary iOS system—crucial to its $100 billion annual services business—making compliance particularly challenging. ""Apple can't do this.

Netflix reportedly made another all-cash offer to acquire Warner Bros Discovery, or WBD, including the major studio and HBO Max. However, the bid led by the US streaming giant has raised red flags among senior officials within the Trump administration over the deal's impact on Hollywood. According to a report from The New York Post, high-ranking White House officials recently discussed the antitrust implications of the reported bid about if the acquisition would give Netflix ""too much power over Hollywood."" The private meeting was almost ten days ago. The report cited a government official present at the meeting who says the officials indicated that a broader investigation is required to fully comprehend Netflix's market power before such a huge acquisition goes through.In a statement to The New York Post, the government official said:the official noted.The meeting happened just as the WBD board set afternoon deadline for second-round offers to acquire it earlier this week. WBD owns the top-ranked Warner Bros. movie studio, the No. 3 streaming service HBO Max, and major cable channels like HBO and CNN.However, some senior White House officials are skeptical. They are concerned that Netflix already has too much sway in Hollywood.

They have warned that European regulators may also push back this deal.Meanwhile, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos and the company’s legal team have been lobbying in Washington. They argue that buying the No. 3 streaming service and a major studio should not violate antitrust rules because of something calledTheir idea is that so much content exists on YouTube, TikTok, and other platforms that streaming cannot be tightly controlled or overpriced in the usual way.Apart from Netflix, two other companies have also bid for WBD. Paramount Skydance, backed by David Ellison and his billionaire father Larry Ellison, who have also bid for WBD is expected to increase its first bid of $23.50 a share.On the other hand, Comcast, run by Brian Roberts, may also improve its offer, though officials say it has a low chance of passing regulations because of President Donald Trump’s dislike of MSNBC, which now called MS NOW, the report adds.","Netflix reportedly made another all-cash offer to acquire Warner Bros Discovery, or WBD, including the major studio and HBO Max.

Arrival of their daughter Arcadia in 2024

Introduction of their son Seldon Lycurgus in 2025





Public curiosity around Elon Musk has grown after he revealed new information about his partner Shivon Zilis, her Indian heritage and the four children they share in the podcast with Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath. Many want to understand how their relationship began, how their careers in artificial intelligence connected them, and how their family expanded over time. Zilis, a respected figure in the global technology sector, has worked closely with Musk through influential roles at OpenAI, Neuralink, Tesla, and other pioneering ventures. Her background, professional achievements, and personal journey have become central to public interest. This overview looks at her early life, her rise in the tech world, professional milestones, and the timeline of their children, offering a clearer picture of the family shaping headlines today.Shivon Zilis was born in Canada in 1986 and grew up in a multicultural household. Her mother, Sharda N, is of Indian origin, while her father, Richard Zilis, is Canadian. Musk recently revealed that she was adopted as a baby and raised in Canada, something that added new context to her personal background.This heritage later became a point of public interest when Musk mentioned their children’s names and cultural influences during a conversation with Nikhil Kamath.Her academic journey shaped the foundation of her analytical and strategic thinking. As reported by People.com, she attended Yale University, where she studied economics and philosophy, two subjects that helped her understand both human behaviour and emerging global markets. At Yale, she balanced intensive academics with sport and played ice hockey for the university team. She completed her degree in 2008 and moved towards a career deeply rooted in technology and innovation.After graduating, Zilis began her professional life at IBM, one of the world’s oldest and largest technology companies. Her work there placed her at the intersection of data, systems and corporate innovation. She later joined Bloomberg Beta, the venture capital arm of Bloomberg LP, where she became one of the founding members. This role was pivotal, as she focused on investments linked to machine intelligence at a time when AI was beginning to reshape industries and attract significant global attention.Her expertise grew quickly and in 2015 she was recognised by Forbes in its “30 Under 30” list under the venture capital category. This recognition reflected her influence in identifying high-potential AI companies and understanding technological trends before they became mainstream. She also worked as a fellow at the University of Toronto’s Creative Destruction Lab, an organisation known for supporting early stage science and technology ventures.Shivon Zilis’s relationship with Elon Musk began in professional circles, particularly in the fast-growing world of artificial intelligence. She joined OpenAI in 2016, a research organisation co founded by Musk to ensure that AI develops safely and beneficially. Her work was quickly recognised and she became the youngest member of the OpenAI board. Her involvement in OpenAI placed her at the centre of discussions about the future of artificial intelligence.Their collaboration expanded when she joined Neuralink in 2017 as the director of operations and special projects. Neuralink focuses on brain machine interfaces and pushes forward the idea of connecting human intelligence with computers. Zilis also worked at Tesla between 2017 and 2019, where she contributed to projects linked to automation and AI systems. In 2023, she joined the board of Shield AI, further strengthening her profile within the defence and AI technology landscape.Throughout these years, their professional connection became personal. Zilis has expressed public respect for Musk, and in Walter Isaacson’s biography of Musk, she shared that he encouraged her to have children through IVF. This decision aligned with Musk’s frequently discussed views on declining global birth rates and the importance he places on expanding families.The story of Musk and Zilis’s family became widely known when court documents and social media posts confirmed the births of their children. Each child has a name with personal, cultural or scientific significance, reflecting both parents’ backgrounds and interests.The first children born to Zilis and Musk were twins named Strider and Azure. They were born in November 2021 through IVF. Their names appeared publicly in 2022 when documents confirmed their identities. Zilis has occasionally shared photographs and glimpses of their milestones on X. One of the most widely noticed updates was a post showing the twins visiting SpaceX in 2025, which highlighted how their upbringing is closely linked to their parents’ world of innovation and science.Their daughter Arcadia was born in February 2024. Her arrival was made public months later when news reports surfaced in June 2024. Musk clarified that her birth was not hidden and Zilis later confirmed Arcadia’s name during a post celebrating the child’s first birthday in February 2025. The name Arcadia is associated with nature, literature and a sense of peace, which made it stand out as another distinctive name within the Musk family.In February 2025, Zilis announced the birth of their fourth child, a son named Seldon Lycurgus. She described him as strong and warm natured in a post shared on X. Musk responded to her announcement, expressing support and acknowledgment. The name Seldon is widely recognised as a reference to Hari Seldon, a character from Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series, which Musk has often cited as a personal favourite. Lycurgus is linked to ancient Greek history and law, reflecting a blend of scientific and cultural inspiration.The relationship between Musk and Zilis grew naturally from years of professional collaboration.

Sundar Pichai warns about a world where real and fake blur

A warning for the world, not just Silicon Valley





Artificial intelligence is evolving at breakneck speed. Breakthroughs arrive almost weekly, new tools promise to transform medicine and work, and entire industries are scrambling to catch up. Yet alongside the excitement, a growing unease is settling in. The more powerful these systems become, the more urgent the questions about how they might be misused. And now, adding his voice to the rising concern, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has issued a warning that feels impossible to ignore.In a recent interview with Fox News, Pichai revealed the one AI development that genuinely keeps him awake at night. It is not robots, runaway systems or the distant spectre of machine consciousness. It is something far more immediate and far more human. It is the looming threat of ultra-realistic deepfakes that blur truth and fabrication beyond recognition.Pressed on what worries him most, Pichai pointed to deepfakes, explaining that the technology is advancing so quickly that soon even experts may struggle to tell real footage from fabricated. He described a moment, not far off, when the simple act of believing what we see online becomes a daily gamble.That possibility, he admitted, is what lingers in his mind long after interviews end and lights fade. It is the scenario he returns to in quiet moments: a world where truth becomes optional.Pichai is clear that the threat does not come from the technology alone. It comes from the people who will seize on it for the worst possible reasons. As generative AI becomes faster, cheaper and easier to access, the opportunities for deception multiply.Misinformation campaigns, political sabotage, impersonation scams and fraud all become dramatically more potent when anyone can manufacture convincing video or audio in minutes. In Pichai’s view, this is the dark edge of AI that is developing just as quickly as its benefits.Even so, Pichai insists the technology is not destined for disaster. He speaks openly about AI’s power to discover new medicines, design better cancer treatments and accelerate scientific breakthroughs. Humanity, he argues, has learned to tame powerful tools before and can do so again.But the message beneath his optimism is unmistakable: the world must act quickly. Guardrails cannot be an afterthought.Pichai’s comments land at a moment when governments, technology companies and entire societies are struggling to keep pace with the speed of AI’s evolution. With major elections approaching across the globe, the consequences of a single well-timed deepfake could be catastrophic.His warning is not meant to spark panic. It is a call for clarity at a time when the line between reality and fabrication is growing dangerously thin.The race, Pichai suggests, is not just to build powerful AI but to protect the world from its misuse. And the race has already begun.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai warns about a world where real and fake blur. He says the threat does not come from the technology alone.

IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has refuted the narrative that the current wave of mass layoffs across the tech industry is primarily due to the artificial intelligence (AI) technology, arguing that the job cuts are largely a “natural correction” following over-hiring during the pandemic years. Krishna, however, acknowledged that AI will eventually lead to some job displacement, but suggested that many companies are currently laying off staff because they overhired between 2020 and 2023.In an interview with The Verge, Krishna used strong terms to describe the rapid staffing increases across the industry during the lockdown era.""If you look at the total employment numbers, I think people gorged on employment... during the pandemic and the year after,"" Krishna explained. He noted that some companies saw their employee count spike by ""30, 40, 50, 100 percent"" from 2020 to 2023.“There is going to be some natural correction. Business is never completely optimized. I think in engineering terms, it’s an underdamped system. When there’s a need, it goes above. Now, it has to correct. It’s probably going to go below what’s needed, and then it’ll hit the correct equilibrium, depending on market demand and growth,” the CEO noted.Notably, earlier this year, IBM announced that it will lay off thousands of employees from its global workforce in the fourth quarter in 2025. It was reported that the company will layoff about 1% of its total workforce – around 2700 employees – by the end of this year.Talking about the long-term impact of AI on employment, Krishna projected a significant but manageable level of job displacement over the next couple of years.“Could there be up to 10 percent job displacement? I believe that’ll be likely over the next couple of years. It’s not 30 or 40 percent, but it is up to 10 percent of the total US employment pool. It is very concentrated in certain areas,"" he said.Krishna also believes that as AI increases overall productivity, companies will ultimately hire more people, though in different roles.“Now, as you get more productive, companies are going to then hire more people but in different places. We are hiring more because people say, “I don’t need to do the entry-level task because an AI agent can do it.” I’m looking at them like, “Really?” Think strategically for a moment,” the CEO noted.Krishna criticised companies that are looking to AI primarily as a cost-cutting measure for entry-level tasks, calling the approach ""shortsighted.""“Wouldn’t you rather have an entry-level person and AI makes them more like a 10-year expert? Isn’t that more useful to me than the other way around? Otherwise, where is the talent who’s going to come up with the next great product? Where is the person who’s going to be able to convince a client to deploy technology the way it should be deployed? That’s why I think some are being shortsighted,” he noted.Last month, Krishna said that the company will continue to hire more college graduates.“People are talking about either layoffs or freezing hiring, but I actually want to say that we are the opposite. I expect we are probably going to hire more people out of college over the next 12 months than we have in the past few years, so you’re going to see that,” Krishna told CNN.","IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has refuted the narrative that the current wave of mass layoffs across the tech industry is primarily due to the artificial intelligence (AI) technology.

He finds the notion of AI generating original acting roles 'chilling,' and emphasizes that his use of technological innovation is aimed at amplifying, rather than overshadowing, human creativity.

“Now, go to the other end of the spectrum, and you’ve got generative AI, where they can make up a character. They can make up an actor. They can make up a performance from scratch with a text prompt. It’s like, no. That’s horrifying to me. That’s the opposite. That’s exactly what we’re not doing.”

“For years, there was this sense that, ‘Oh, they’re doing something strange with computers and they’re replacing actors,’ when in fact, once you really drill down and you see what we’re doing, it’s a celebration of the actor-director moment,”

How James Cameron uses technology in his movies





Hollywood director James Cameron is 'deeply fearful' of a future where artificial intelligence (AI) will eventually supplant actors. The director of The Terminator and Avatar disclosed that he was deeply alarmed with the technology invading the entertainment industry. In an interview on CBS's Sunday Morning, Cameron explained that what concerns him is the concept of the technology substituting for a human performer. He said the pressure to use AI instead of actors isn't exactly new. He remembered that as far back as 2005, in developing the first film Avatar, some Hollywood figures had mistakenly thought he planned to use computer graphics to replace actors altogether. Now, with the rapid advancements of generative AI, Cameron finds the prospect of AI replacing human performers as pretty terrifying.In the CBS interview, Cameron explained:Cameroon recalled, referring to people who thought Avatar will replace actors with computer graphics.James Cameron incorporates technology into nearly every part of his filmmaking process, and the ""Avatar"" movies represent the fullest expression of this tendency. Large swaths of Pandora, the world audiences see in the films, are created inside a soundstage in Los Angeles. For the second and third movies, Cameron and his team constructed an enormous water tank capable of generating real waves. Actors such as Sigourney Weaver and Zoe Saldaña filmed their underwater scenes in that tank. Performance-capture cameras recorded their movements and facial expressions, which digital artists used later to create the final CGI characters.Imagination and science fiction have always appealed to Cameron. Growing up in rural Canada, he spent much of his time as a child reading comic books, watching television, and conjuring stories in his head. Moving with his family to Los Angeles, he briefly attended community college before dropping out and taking odd jobs. Watching “Star Wars” made him realize the images swimming around in his brain could be translated into movies as well. Unable to afford film school, Cameron taught himself visual-effects techniques by spending weekends reading USC library books on cinematography and special effects.His big break came with ""The Terminator,"" inspired by a dream. Due to the unavailability of CGI at that time, the film relied on puppetry and practical effects. He continued exploring new techniques in films like ""Aliens,"" ""The Abyss,"" and later ""Titanic,"" which also let him follow his interest in the deep sea.Cameron wrote the first outline for ""Avatar"" before ""Titanic,"" but he waited until 2005, when technology finally became advanced enough to support his vision. The third installment of Cameron's ""Avatar: Fire and Ash"" will be hitting the theaters in a few months.","Hollywood director James Cameron is 'deeply fearful' of a future where artificial intelligence (AI) will eventually supplant actors.

Coupang apologises over massive data breach







Coupang, South Korea's largest e-commerce platform often dubbed the “Amazon.com of South Korea,” recently faced a massive data breach. The system of the company were illegally accessed causing a massive data breach and affecting the personal information of 33.7 million customer accounts. The breach was first detected by the company on November 18 but it believes the unauthorised access to customer accounts began on June 24 and was executed through overseas servers. Coupang says that the compromised information is limited to basic personal data and the highly sensitive financial details remain secure. Now, the South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon has called for stronger penalties against companies that fail to protect consumer data.As reported by Reuters, Lee emphasised that the companies must face tougher consequences when they fail to protect personal information. “We cannot allow negligence in data protection to go unpunished,” he said, urging lawmakers to strengthen penalties and enforcement measures.Along with this, Lee also stressed that protecting the trust of the consumer is of critical importance for South Korea’s digital economy, which heavily relies on e-commerce and online services.He also called for closer cooperation between government agencies and private firms to prevent future breaches.For the uninitiated, South Korea already has some strict data privacy laws under the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA). However, the critics argue that enforcement of the laws has been inconsistent and the penalties are also lenient. The recent Coupang data breach has intensified the calls for higher fines and reforms.Coupang has also apologised for the data leak and urged customers to be wary of phone calls, text messages or other communications impersonating the company. The company also said that it has launched an investigation with security experts into the incident and is working with law enforcement as well as regulatory authorities.Notably, on November 20, Coupang reported a data leak involving about 4,500 customers. At that time, the company said that it had found no evidence of unauthorised access to payment information or into its systems.The latest incident surpasses SK Telecom's data leak in April. It affected 23.2 million users, resulting in a record fine of 134.8 billion won.","South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon has called for stronger penalties against companies that fail to protect consumer data.

Bernie Sanders bankruptcy warning



Bernie Sanders warning on the rise of AI







US senator Bernie Sanders has once again raised an alarm on medical debt crises in America. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Sanders highlights that more than 530,000 America will go bankrupt annually because of the cost of healthcare. In the post, Sanders also drew comparisons of US with other countries like Germany, Canada, France and Japan, where the number of medical bankruptcies is zero.In post shared on X, Sanders shared a chart highlighting the disparity. He mentioned that while advanced economies across Europe and Asia report no medical bankruptcies, the United States stands alone with 530,000 cases each year. “Yes. We need Medicare for All — NOW,” Sanders wrote, underscoring his long-standing push for universal healthcare. He further argued that the present system in the US compels ordinary Americans into financial ruin simply because they get sick, calling it a moral and economic failure.The figures highlighted by Sanders come from a 2019 American Journal of Public health study. The study estimated that medical issues contribute to hundred of thousands of bankruptcies annually. While some analysts debate the methodology, the number has become a rallying point for advocates of healthcare reform.Sanders’ post has reignited debate about the U.S. healthcare system, which remains the most expensive in the world yet leaves millions uninsured or underinsured.Last month, the US senator issued one of his starkest warnings yet about the rise of artificial intelligence. In an interview with NBC News, Sanders said that the technology’s explosive growth risks concentrating wealth and power among a handful of billionaires while leaving ordinary workers behind. Sanders cautioned that AI’s military applications could reshape global conflict. “I think we are not all that far away from the development of robotic soldiers,” he said. “If you don’t have to worry about loss of life, and what you worry about is loss of robots, what does that mean for issues of war and peace globally? It’s a big issue.”","US senator Bernie Sanders has once again raised an alarm on medical debt crises in America.

Google's integrated infrastructure and custom chips give it a decisive edge. OpenAI's pivot highlights intense competition and financial pressures, as it scrambles to regain ground against a resurgent tech giant.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Google's infrastructure advantage proves decisive

Financial pressures compound OpenAI’s strategic challenges





Three years after ChatGPT's explosive debut sent Google into panic mode, the tables have turned spectacularly. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has declared an internal ""code red"" emergency, ordering employees to halt work on advertising and revenue-generating features to fix ChatGPT's deteriorating competitive position as Google's Gemini 3 model surges ahead on performance benchmarks, user engagement, and market share—a reversal that threatens the $500 billion startup's future while vindicating Google's patient, infrastructure-heavy approach to artificial intelligence.OpenAI is abandoning plans to introduce advertising, AI shopping assistants, health agents, and its Pulse personal assistant, according to internal memos obtained by The Wall Street Journal and The Information. Instead, all resources will redirect toward improving ChatGPT's speed, reliability, and personalisation as the company confronts what Altman called ""temporary economic headwinds"" from Google's aggressive AI offensive. The staff working on chatbot will have to attend daily calls as the development sprints toward an “even more intuitive and personal,” as described by ChatGPT's head Nick Turley.""We are at a critical time for ChatGPT,"" Altman wrote in memo, first reported by The Information. The directive escalates OpenAI's internal alert level from ""code orange"" to ""code red""—the company's highest urgency designation for existential threats.The retreat comes as a remarkable role reversal from December 2022, when ChatGPT's launch forced Google CEO Sundar Pichai to issue his own ""code red"" that restructured entire divisions and accelerated AI development timelines.Google's comeback stems from advantages OpenAI cannot easily replicate. Its Gemini user base rocketed from 450 million monthly active users in July to 650 million in October, while web analytics firm Similarweb reports users now spend more time with Gemini than ChatGPT—despite OpenAI claiming 800 million weekly users.More fundamentally, Google controls what insiders call the ""full stack."" DeepMind researchers build models, proprietary TPU chips train them cheaply, Google Cloud hosts them efficiently, and seamless integration delivers them across Search, YouTube, Gmail, and 3 billion Android devices. OpenAI depends on Microsoft's cloud infrastructure and Nvidia's expensive chips, creating structural cost disadvantages.""One of the most important things for us at Google is this is possible because we have a very differentiated full-stack approach,"" DeepMind CTO Koray Kavukcuoglu told reporters, noting the company trains models on custom silicon while deploying them immediately into products.Google's latest Gemini 3 model has outperformed OpenAI's GPT-5 on industry benchmarks, while its Nano Banana Pro image generator has gained significant traction. Anthropic's Opus 4.5 model also beat GPT-5 in key tests, squeezing OpenAI from multiple directions.OpenAI isn't alone in feeling the tremors from Gemini 3's success. Nvidia's stock plummeted over 6%, erasing roughly $250 billion in market value, after reports emerged that Meta Platforms—one of OpenAI's fellow mega-customers—is in advanced talks to purchase billions of dollars worth of Google's TPU chips instead of Nvidia's GPUs. The chipmaker, which supplies the expensive hardware powering OpenAI's models and has built a near-monopoly on AI infrastructure, now faces the prospect of losing up to 10% of its annual revenue as Google's custom silicon proves both cheaper and, for certain workloads, more efficient than Nvidia's flagship products.The pivot comes as OpenAI confronts brutal financial realities. The Wall Street Journal reported the company must reach roughly $200 billion in annual revenue by 2030 to achieve profitability—requiring 100-fold growth while burning billions quarterly on compute costs and talent.Google generates $120 billion annually with nearly $100 billion in cash reserves, giving it unlimited capacity to undercut OpenAI on pricing or outspend on research. The search giant can afford to offer advanced models free while OpenAI desperately needs to monetize.Altman attempted to reassure employees that a new reasoning model launching next week would surpass Gemini 3's capabilities. ""I wouldn't trade positions with any other company,"" he wrote, according to sources familiar with the memo.But the emergency directive—and the shelving of advertising plans OpenAI needs to survive—suggests deeper anxiety about whether the ChatGPT pioneer can maintain its early lead against a tech giant finally operating at full throttle.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman declares an internal ""code red"" emergency, ordering employees to halt work on advertising and revenue-generating features.

backs vibe coding as tech industry remains split on AI development tools





Zoho founder and Chief Scientist Sridhar Vembu has fired back at Y Combinator President Garry Tan after the American venture capitalist predicted that AI-powered ""vibe coding"" would make the Indian SaaS giant obsolete. The public spat on X has ignited a fierce debate about whether artificial intelligence can truly replace traditional enterprise software.Tan had claimed that companies like Zoho would be among the first to face disruption from people building custom software using platforms like Replit, Emergent Labs and Taskade,Tan had claimed that companies like Zoho would be the first casualty of vibe coding—a trend where non-technical users build custom apps using AI platforms like Replit, Emergent Labs and Taskade. questioning why businesses would pay subscription fees when non-technical staff could create solutions over a weekend.""Why pay $30/seat/month for over-bundled SaaS when soon even nontech ops people can vibe-code a custom solution in a weekend?"" he wrote.Vembu dismissed the prediction outright, pointing to Zoho's customer base growing at over 50%. ""If our business would be the first to be competed away by vibe coded apps, why are we seeing such rapid customer growth right now?"" he countered.He also challenged Tan to explain why vibe-coded alternatives don't exist yet for email, spreadsheets, accounting or messaging—core enterprise tools that require deep engineering.The Zoho founder delivered a scathing assessment of vibe coding's limitations, warning that AI-generated applications accumulate unsustainable technical debt without proper security, privacy and compliance safeguards.

When Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made fun of Softbank founder







Masayoshi Son, SoftBank Group CEO, has revealed that the company’s decision to sell its substantial stake in Nvidia was a painful, though necessary, step taken to fund its aggressive new investments in artificial intelligence (AI), including a major commitment to OpenAI . Addressing the November disclosure that SoftBank had completely unloaded its shares worth $5.83 billion in the world’s most valuable chipmaker, Son expressed deep regret, figuratively admitting he ‘cried’ when he sold shares of the biggest tech company in terms of market cap.“I don’t want to sell a single share. I just had more need for money to invest in OpenAI and other projects,” Son told attendees at the FII Priority Asia forum in Tokyo on Monday (December 2). “I was crying to sell Nvidia shares,” Japan’s second richest man added.Son’s comments clarified that SoftBank needed immediate capital and selling was driven by a string of expansive AI projects. These projects include construction of a massive Stargate data centre in partnership with Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (commonly known as Foxconn), the acquisition of US chip designer Ampere Computing, and accelerated plans to increase investment in OpenAI by the end of the year.The Japanese tech executive also dismissed that the current surge in AI spending represents an investment bubble.“People who talk about a bubble around AI investment are not smart enough,” the 68-year-old CEO highlighted. Son argued that if AI eventually captures even 10% of global gross domestic product (GDP) over the long term, this return would easily justify trillions of dollars in cumulative spending.“Where is the bubble?” he questioned.The ‘cry’ comment brought back a year-old memory about the conversation between Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Son. During Huang's visit to Japan last November, he publicly ‘teased’ Son over his past investment timing.Huang once introduced Son on stage by praising him as the “only entrepreneur, only innovator in the world that has selected the winner and partnered with the winner in every single generation,” citing his crucial roles in introducing giants like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs to Japan and backing Alibaba.Huang then delivered the punchline: “You maybe many of you probably don't know this, but at one point, Masa was the largest shareholder of Nvidia.”This was a mention of the massive, missed returns by Son, who then playfully rested his head on Huang's shoulder as if weeping. Huang responded with mock sympathy, “It's okay. We can cry. We can cry together. Could you imagine? If today, you are the largest shareholder. Oh, my God.”","Masayoshi Son, SoftBank Group CEO, has revealed that the company’s decision to sell its substantial stake in Nvidia was a painful, though necessary, step taken to fund its aggressive new investments in artificial intelligence. “I was crying to sell Nvidia shares,” Son told attendees at the FII Priority Asia forum in Tokyo on Monday (December 2)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125717023,imgsize-22694,width-400,resizemode-4/softbank-ceo-and-founder-masayoshi-son.jpg"

Google combines data and feedback on AI products







Google CEO Sundar Pichai has revealed a hands-on approach to evaluating the success of major company product launches. Recently, in a podcast, Pichai said that he dedicates significant time on launch day to personally monitor public reception and user experience on social media platforms, like Elon Musk’s X (Twitter). The CEO explained that while internal teams rely on advanced dashboards and metrics, he looks forward to the unfiltered feedback to understand if a new product, such as the Gemini AI models, is making sense for the consumers.“I’m one of one of those people. I need to feel it firsthand, right?” Pichai said, adding, “So I get reports, but I'm out there trying to understand how people are using it, what they are posting. And I think that is important.”Pichai specifically mentioned using the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) on launch days to gauge public sentiment and usage.“I'm pretty active on launch day trying to understand what's working. I'm looking for feedback. I'm on X trying to understand [and] see if people, average users, how they're experiencing the product,” Pichai said on the company podcast.This method allows Pichai to assess feedback instantly and because the “first day” of a launch is crucial for getting an authentic sense of what is working well and what is not.“I probably ping people back saying, ‘this is a valid point, we should address it’. So, in some sense, I'm looking at that trying to assess it,” he addedPichai also acknowledged that his personal monitoring combined with Google's robust internal data collection gives an idea of what is working and what is not. He noted that teams use tools like Gemini itself to collect and collate information, and he regularly reviews complex dashboards tracking metrics like Queries Per Second (QPS) and usage capacity.“But I walk over to some people who all have these big screens with multiple dashboards looking at QPS and you know understanding how the usage is worried about capacity but all that gives you a real sense of what people are saying but that's how I do it,” Pichai said.“It's a combination of monitoring stuff online, talking to people, walking around, and sitting down with people, particularly the first day. It really helps me get a sense of what's working, what's not working well,” he concluded.Pichai has become more vocal on social media. He has had several conversations with Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, and even replied to several congratulatory messages after the launch of Google Gemini 3.0 AI model.For example, he recently posted about the launch of the Nano Banana Pro model, suggesting that he has been looking at the feedback on social media.“You went 🍌🍌[Bananas] for Nano Banana. Now, meet Nano Banana Pro. It’s SOTA for image generation + editing with more advanced world knowledge, text rendering, precision + controls.

It's designed to fight phone scams and theft, and it's already been a big help, recovering tons of stolen devices and stopping millions of fake phone lines. Even though Apple might push back, the government says you can ditch the app if you want.

Telecom minister clarifies: Sanchar Saathi app not mandatory to keep, can be deleted





The government has mandated that all smartphones sold in the country must come pre-installed with Sanchar Saathi, a cybersecurity application. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) issued the directive on November 28, 2025, under the Telecommunication Cybersecurity Amendment Rules, marking the first time India has required state-backed software on all mobile devices. The move affects one of the world's largest smartphone markets, with over 1.2 billion mobile users.Sanchar Saathi, launched in January 2025, is described by DoT as a ""citizen centric initiative"" designed to empower mobile subscribers and strengthen their security against telecom-related cyber threats. The app is available both as a mobile application and through a web portal at www.sancharsaathi.gov.in, offering various services aimed at protecting India's 1.2 billion mobile users from fraud and device theft.According to government data, the platform has already demonstrated significant impact, helping recover over 700,000 lost phones, blocking more than 3.7 million stolen devices, and terminating 30 million fraudulent mobile connections.The DoT justifies the initiative by citing the prevalence of duplicate or spoofed IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) numbers, which pose serious cybersecurity threats.The department also notes that India's large second-hand mobile device market has seen cases of stolen or blacklisted devices being resold, making purchasers unwitting participants in crime.The app offers several practical services for users. Through its ""Chakshu"" feature, citizens can report suspected fraud communications, including impersonation scams involving government officials, banks, or police, as well as unsolicited commercial communications (spam). Users can also report malicious web links received through SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram, and other platforms.Another feature allows users to block and trace lost or stolen mobile devices using the phone's unique 15-digit IMEI code. Once blocked through the app, the device becomes unusable across all networks, even if the SIM card is changed.The app also enables users to verify how many mobile connections are registered in their name, helping them identify unauthorized SIM cards. Additionally, users can check the genuineness of their mobile handset by scanning its IMEI barcode to ensure they haven't purchased stolen or counterfeit devices.The directive has encountered resistance from major smartphone manufacturers, particularly Apple. According to Reuters, Apple does not plan to comply with the mandate to preload its smartphones with the state-owned cyber safety app and will convey its concerns to New Delhi, three sources said.While India's smartphone market is dominated by Android devices, Apple's iOS powers an estimated 4.5% of the 735 million smartphones in the country by mid-2025, according to Counterpoint Research. Tarun Pathak, a research director at Counterpoint, told Reuters that ""Apple has historically refused such requests from governments,"" suggesting potential friction ahead as the 90-day compliance deadline approaches.Initially, the DoT directive reportedly stated that the pre-installed application must be ""readily visible and accessible"" to users during device setup and that its functionalities cannot be disabled or restricted. This sparked questions about user choice and flexibility. However, Minister Scindia quickly addressed these concerns, emphasizing that the app is not mandatory for use.""If you want to delete the app, you can, it is not mandatory. For instance, if you don't want to use the app, don't register for it, it will stay dormant, and delete it if you want to,"" Scindia explained. He added that the government's responsibility is to make the app available to everyone, as many citizens are unaware of this tool designed to protect them from digital frauds and theft.The directive requires manufacturers to complete implementation within 90 days and submit compliance reports within 120 days. For devices already in sales channels, manufacturers are encouraged to push the app through software updates. Sanchar Saathi can be downloaded from both Google Play Store and Apple App Store for users who wish to access its services voluntarily.","India's government has mandated that all smartphones sold in the country must come pre-installed with Sanchar Saathi, a cybersecurity application.

What OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said earlier about ads in ChatGPT

“uniquely unsettling to me”

“last resort for us as a business model,”

“not totally against them.”





ChatGPT's free version may soon start showing ads to its users. A report claims that OpenAI has internally started testing ads for the free version of ChatGPT. This shift will mark an end to the completely ad-free experience that the AI startup offers to its users. This is an attempt by OpenAI to make a new revenue stream, much similar to the one fueling Google Search, where ads and promotions of various products influence user purchasing behavior. While the premium plans exist, this move has been about monetising the large free user base and could redefine the economics of the web by integrating commerce directly into the generative AI chatbot.Engineer Tibor Blaho took to the microblogging site X, formerly Twitter, to point out that a beta version of ChatGPT's Android app, version 1.2025.329, contains new code references to anincluding mentions ofand aSharing a screenshot of his findings, Blaho wrote:This suggests that the free version of ChatGPT on Android may start showing ads soon, and once they appear, they will likely show up on the chatbot’s iPhone app as well. But iPhone users can still ask individual questions through Siri, which almost certainly won’t show ads.If Siri can’t answer something, it will switch to ChatGPT. Under Apple’s deal with OpenAI, these Siri-powered ChatGPT answers aren’t used for training the AI, and it’s very likely that ads won’t be shown in these sessions either.This shift could affect the web economy because many people don’t realise that ChatGPT may now understand users better than Google. It could use that information to show personalised ads inside ChatGPT, suggesting products you may want. It is also expected to place ads in search results, similar to Google Search. The leak indicates that ads may appear only in the search area at first, however, this may change over time.ChatGPT is already huge, with about 800 million users per week. That number was only 100 million a week in November 2023 and had risen to about 300 million a week by late 2024.Currently, ChatGPT processes about 2.5 billion prompts a day and India has become the largest user base for it, far outnumbering that of the US.According to Engadget, Altman spoke at a Harvard Business School event last year and said he would try his best to avoid adding ads to AI chats, though he didn’t completely rule out the idea.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that combining ads and AI isand that it’s abut that he’sHowever, the codes discovered recently now suggest that ads may be coming soon.","ChatGPT's free version may soon start showing ads to its users.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

Why Elon Musk believes AI and robotics offer a unique path





Historical precedent of technological breakthroughs

Boost to production, efficiency and economic output

Shift from borrowing to value creation

What America’s debt looks like in 2025





The US national debt has reportedly crossed $36–38 trillion, a historically high level.

Interest payments on this debt are rising rapidly, and some analysts note that interest costs alone already exceed spending on major budget categories such as defence.

Traditional fiscal tools spending cuts, tax increases, or deficit controls, are increasingly viewed as politically difficult or economically painful.





Today, as global discussions focus on rising government debt and economic uncertainty, Elon Musk offers a bold vision: he believes artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics can resolve the US national debt crisis within three years. On a recent podcast appearance with Nikhil Kamath, Musk argued that technology-led growth in goods and services could outpace inflation and debt accumulation, potentially reversing America’s fiscal burden. This claim comes amid growing concern over inflation, mounting interest payments on debt, and shrinking budgets for key social and defence programs. With the US national debt crossing historic thresholds, Musk’s statement has sparked debate over whether advanced automation can realistically reshape national economies and whether such a transformation might indeed offer an escape from a spiralling debt spiral.In a recent podcast interview with Nikhil Kamath, Elon Musk laid out his reasoning for why AI and robotics are the only plausible path out of America’s debt crisis.In summary, Musk’s claim hinges on the idea that a surge in productivity and output powered by AI and robotics can fundamentally change the way the economy produces value enough to outpace both inflation and debt accumulation.Musk points out that past shifts, such as electrification, mass production, and the computing revolution, transformed societies by greatly increasing productivity and economic output.He sees AI and robotics as the next wave capable of a similar leap.Under this view, when goods and services can be produced more efficiently and on a larger scale, the total output (the “denominator” in economic terms) grows fast enough to support current debt loads and interest costs, possibly reducing fiscal pressure without major cuts or tax hikes.Musk’s companies, notably those building automated manufacturing, robotics, and advanced AI software, already rely heavily on automation to reduce costs and increase output. He argues that, when scaled across the economy, similar automation could significantly raise national productivity.In effect, widespread adoption of AI could drive down the relative cost of production, increase the supply of goods and services, and allow the economy to grow in real terms rather than nominal, easing debt burdens over time.Instead of addressing debt through austerity or taxation, Musk’s approach reframes the problem as a growth and innovation challenge. If AI can dramatically increase value creation by automating labour, expanding production, and enabling new industries, then revenue generation can outpace debt obligations, making debt more manageable without painful social or fiscal cuts.To understand why Musk’s proposal gains attention, consider these recent economic signals:In this context, Musk argues that only a sharp boost in productivity delivered by AI can realistically restore long-term fiscal balance while avoiding deep social upheaval.","Elon Musk says AI and robots are the only way out of America’s debt crisis.

Google’s position in the AI race



Wall Street takes notice as competitive dynamics shift







Nvidia, the chipset making giant has now downplayed concerns that Google is coming for its dominance in the AI hardware market, even as reports Meta may spend billions on Google’s custom chips. The comments come at a time when competition is increasing in the AI race and a volatile stretch for Nvidia’s stock. In a statement posted on X, Nvidia said, “NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it’s the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done.” The company added: “We’re delighted by Google’s success — they’ve made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google.”The remarks made by Nvidia is followed by a report from The Information highlighting that Meta is in talks with Google to potentially use its chips to power data centers, a move that rattled the investors. Also, the share of Nvidia fell more than 3% following this news.According to The Information, Meta could begin renting TPUs from Google Cloud as early as next year, with purchases for its own data centers potentially starting in 2027.This matters enormously because Meta ranks among Nvidia's largest customers, planning up to $72 billion in AI infrastructure spending this year. For Google to capture even a fraction of that business would represent a seismic shift in the AI hardware market.The deal would also mark Google's expansion beyond its current strategy of using TPUs exclusively in its own data centres, positioning the company in direct competition for the hundreds of billions being spent on AI processors.As reported by Business Insider, Google replied by stressing that its commitment to supporting both its own Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Nvidia’s GPUs. “We are experiencing accelerating demand for both our custom TPUs and Nvidia GPUs; we are committed to supporting both, as we have for years,” a Google spokesperson said.Recently, Google gained momentum in the AI race after the launch of Gemini 3 and the model also received positive reviews. Unlike many rivals, Google benefits from a “full-stack” advantage, controlling everything from AI research to its cloud infrastructure.The rivalry between Nvidia and Google comes at a time, when the world’s largest company by market capitalisation has faced a turbulent few weeks. The chipmaker reported blockbuster third-quarter earnings, initially calming fears of an AI bubble.

Government’s position







Australia’s plan to impose a ban on social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat for children under 16 is now facing a High Court challenge. As reported by Reuters, a 15-year-old student, Noah Jones has become the face of this opposition. Jones said that the law which is said to come into effect from December 10, 2025 will not protect young people but will instead make the internet more dangerous. Jones, who is co-plaintiff in the case alongside another teenage, believe that the ban would be widely circumvented and push young users into less regulated corners of the internet. “This measure will make the internet less safe for young people,” he argued, stressing that social media is essential for staying connected and sharing ideas, likening it to a modern-day town square.As reported by Reuters, a case has been filed against Communications Minister Anika Wells and eSaftey Commissioner Julie Inman Grant. The case has also drawn support from the Digital Freedom Project, an internet rights groups that claims the ban is an “unfair assault on freedom of speech” and violates the implied constitutional right to freedom of political communication.The group is of the point-of-view that banning the internet access for the young people is not the solution, instead they should be taught how to navigate digital spaces safely.""We should be cutting off the bad things about social media. When kids do things in secret, that's when things can be really harmful,” Jones told Reuters.Jones said social media is essential for staying connected and sharing ideas, likening it to a modern-day town square. ""I have almost all the people in my year on Snapchat. It's a light way of being connected. Most people will get quite separated,"" he said.The government has however vowed to stand firm against the challenge. Communications Minister Wells said the ban is necessary to protect children from harmful content and online predators, insisting that the government will not be intimidated by legal threats or pressure from big tech companies.The law requires platforms to remove all users under 16 or face hefty fines. Supporters say it will shield minors from exploitation and mental health risks, while critics warn it could backfire by isolating young people and limiting their ability to engage in civic discourse. The debate reflects a broader global struggle over how to balance child safety, digital rights, and free expression in the age of social media.","Australia’s plan to impose a ban on social media platforms for children under 16 is now facing a High Court challenge.

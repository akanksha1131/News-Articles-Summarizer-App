"Good news for Google, Apple as Judge blocks Texas app store age-verification law: What he said in ruling",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/good-news-for-google-apple-as-judge-blocks-texas-app-store-age-verification-law-what-he-said-in-ruling/articleshow/126163736.cms,"It’s Apple and Google vs Meta







A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against a Texas law that would have required app store operators like Apple and Google to verify the ages of all users. Marking a victory for tech giants, the ruling delivers a setback to lawmakers and parent groups seeking stricter controls on digital content for minors. The law has been in contention because both the hardware and OS giants have resisted becoming centralised age-verifiers.According to a report by The New York Times, Judge Robert Pitman of the US District Court for the Western District of Texas ruled that the App Store Accountability Act likely violates the First Amendment. The law made is mandatory for app stores to implement robots systems that will require users under 18 to obtain parental consent for app downloads and in-app purchases.In his decision, Judge Pitman compared the digital mandate to requiring a physical bookstore to verify a customer’s age at the front door and demanding parental consent before a minor could browse or buy a book.“It restricts access to a vast universe of speech by requiring Texans to prove their age before downloading a mobile app... and requires minors to obtain parental consent,” Pitman wrote.The Texas ruling has again highlighted the rift within the tech industry over who should be the “gatekeeper” for child safety. While Apple and Google have argued that collecting birth dates for all users would be a massive intrusion on privacy, suggesting that individual apps should handle age-gating instead, companies like Meta – which owns Facebook and Instagram, have backed a “one-stop shop” approach, wherein Apple and Google verify age once at the OS level.",A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against a Texas law that would have required app store operators like Apple and Google to verify the ages of all users.

Cyberattack disrupts France’s national postal service; this pro-Russian hacking group has claimed responsibility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/cyberattack-disrupts-frances-national-postal-service-this-pro-russian-hacking-group-has-claimed-responsibility/articleshow/126163312.cms,"How the cyberattack on France's national postal service La Poste

foreign interference very often comes from the same country,""





Pro-Russian hacking group Noname057(16) has claimed responsibility for a recent cyberattack. According to a report by Euronews, French prosecutors announced that this cybersecurity incident disrupted France's national postal service, La Poste, during the Christmas rush. France's intelligence agency, DGSI, has taken over the investigation following the group's claim, the report claimed, citing the Paris prosecutor's office. The incident occurs as European intelligence agencies report that investigations into Russian interference now require as much operational time as monitoring terrorist threats.The latest attack on the country’s postal service took place just days after France's government reported a separate cyberattack targeting the Interior Ministry, which handles national security matters. In that attack, a suspected hacker stole several dozen sensitive documents and accessed police records and information about people wanted by authorities, according to Interior Minister Laurent Nunez, who spoke with broadcaster Franceinfo.The latest cyberattack happened during the busiest time of year for La Poste, which has more than 200,000 workers.Earlier this week, La Poste's main computers stopped working after hackers flooded the systems with traffic.The problems continued for a couple of days after the attack was first reported.Postal workers could not see where packages were going, and customers could not make online payments through the company's bank, La Banque Postale.Apart from the latest cyberattack on France’s postal service, Noname057(16) has previously targeted websites in Ukraine, Poland, Sweden, and Germany, hitting media companies, government offices, and businesses.Police from 12 countries worked together in July to stop the group in an operation called Eastwood. They shut down more than 100 computer servers around the world, arrested two people in France and Spain, and issued seven warrants to arrest others, including six Russians. But the group resumed attacks within days and remains active.The group has hit French government websites before, including the Justice Ministry and several local government offices and cities.Last week, prosecutors said France's spy agency is investigating a planned cyberattack involving software that could have enabled someone to control computer systems on a large passenger ferry from afar. A crew member from Latvia is being held on charges of working for another country, though officials did not say which one.A French official strongly suggested Russia was involved, saying ""but France has not officially blamed any country yet.France and other European countries that support Ukraine say Russia is carrying out a campaign of attacks through sabotage, killings, computer hacking, and spreading false information to divide Western countries and weaken their support for Ukraine.Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Western officials have blamed Russia for dozens of sabotage attacks across Europe, including setting fire to warehouses, damaging railways, and destroying property.","Pro-Russian hacking group Noname057(16) has claimed responsibility for a recent cyberattack on France's national postal service, La Poste.

The holiday period presents an excellent time to incorporate some creativity into family memories. The latest trend that has swept through this holiday season has taken the spotlight on social media, and this involves making common family pictures into vibrant, personalized holiday cartoons. Thanks to AI technology, making such holiday pictures within minutes has been quite easy, as all one needs are their own family pictures. The introduction of bright colors, the presence of snowy backgrounds, and holiday clothing to common family pictures raises their level of animation, thus making them vibrant holiday scenes. Personalised holiday cartoons are perfect for family holiday cards, personal profiles, and sending holiday messages to friends.Advances in the field of AI image generation and animation have made personalisation has never been easier. Nano Banana Pro and Sora 2 are at the head of the pack.

The boy says 'cheese,' the dog bounces around, and the photo is snapped.""You can consider letting the AI create action scenes like the preparation of cookies, decorating the Christmas tree with ornaments, or even unboxing gifts related to the story in your cartoon.You can pick your favourite scenes, scenes you do not want, or modify prompts for some extras.

Contrary to regular photos, these cartoon images also include a fun-filled manner of storytelling, where small moments, such as a child savouring a cookie or a pet playing in a corner near the tree, are what make them special mementoes. Adding on to that, incorporating this technology does not require any special level of expertise; in fact, anyone can jump on this bandwagon. One image can become a complete cartoon story.","Personalised AI animation turns family photos into Christmas cartoon scenes.

Why Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis thinks the AI startup valuation model is breaking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-google-deepmind-ceo-demis-hassabis-thinks-the-ai-startup-valuation-model-is-breaking/articleshow/126055448.cms,"Big tech vs early-stage hype

'Trump Needs Indian Skilled Workers': Expert On Big Tech's AI Bet On India

Demis Hassabis makes his stand clear on AI scaling





Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Speaking on Google DeepMind: The Podcast, Hassabis said many early-stage companies are now raising tens of billions dollars before even launching product. He believes that this trend exposes cracks in the valuation model. “Some startups basically haven’t even got going yet,” Hassabis said. “It’s sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. My guess is probably not, at least not in general.” This increase in speculative funding has drawn comparisons to past bubbles, such as the dot-com boom and the crypto frenzy, where companies raised massive sums on hype rather than proven business models.Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google, which he said are backed by “a lot of real business.” While Big Tech’s AI bets are supported by revenue streams and infrastructure, many startups are relying solely on investor enthusiasm.He added that AI is “overhyped in the short term” but “underappreciated in the medium to long-term,” suggesting that while the technology’s potential is profound, the current funding frenzy may not reflect sustainable growth.Reflecting on DeepMind’s own early days, Hassabis noted how technological shifts often swing from skepticism to obsession, inflating valuations quickly. “It’s almost an overreaction to the underreaction,” he said, pointing out that investor sentiment can flip dramatically once a technology gains traction.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO also made his stand clear on the debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent. Scaling laws suggest that the more data and compute an AI model receives, the smarter it becomes.",Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Fear-driven leadership powers AI chip giant's success

Seven-day workweeks extend beyond executive suite





Despite leading the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang operates in constant fear of failure. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business."" The co-founder, who has led the chipmaker since 1993, said this feeling of vulnerability ""doesn't leave you"" despite the company's recent milestone of becoming the first public firm to reach a $5 trillion valuation in October.Huang's unconventional leadership approach stems from near-death experiences in the 1990s when Nvidia faced bankruptcy multiple times. He recalled flying to Japan to inform Sega that a contracted graphics chip was flawed and the deal should be canceled, while simultaneously admitting Nvidia needed the final $5 million payment to survive. Sega converted the funds into an investment, providing the lifeline that kept the company afloat.""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,"" Huang explained. The CEO maintains his intense work schedule by waking at 4 a.m.daily to read emails for hours, processing several thousand messages each day. This routine continues through holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas.Huang's relentless work ethic has influenced his family, with both adult children Madison and Spencer working at Nvidia seven days a week. The siblings, who are in their 30s, initially pursued different careers before joining the company as interns in 2020 and 2022.Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter, driven by surging demand for AI chips that power technology from Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta.

I also think that the marketplace was not a level playing field.”

How Chinese companies took the lead over iRobot in the robot vacuum market

“For a small period of time, iRobot was the leading manufacturer of vacuuming robots in China. Then it stopped, because China decided that this was a market of interest, and they were going to ensure that Chinese companies were advantaged to succeed there,”

An

""for various pragmatic and political reasons, gave a protected market to cut your teeth on for the competition,""

“It’s a cage match, and it certainly got hard, and it got increasingly competitive,”

“The tragedy of the blocking of the transaction is we did it to ourselves. And the net result, which I have argued, was done with eyes wide open, was putting the consumer robot industry in a box, gift wrapping it, and handing it to someone else,”





US-based iRobot, which was once considered one of America's biggest consumer electronics companies, filed for bankruptcy last week. Now, Colin Angle, the co-founder and former CEO of the Roomba robot vacuum maker, has revealed what went wrong for the company. Angle claimed that unfair competition from Chinese companies played a major role in iRobot’s recent bankruptcy filing but also emphasised challenges such as supply chain disruptions and rapid technological shifts that impacted its market position. He explained that the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as it struggled to keep up with rivals who had advantages over iRobot. Angle, who founded the company in 1990 with fellow MIT scientists, noted that these new competitors grew quickly by using their home market as a base.In a recent episode of the New York Times’ Hard Fork podcast, Angle said,Roomba vacuum robots became quite popular in American homes after their launch in 2002. By 2018, their advanced models could empty themselves and clean specific rooms using mapping.The company's sales peaked at nearly $1.6 billion in 2021.However, after filing for bankruptcy, iRobot is now being acquired by Picea Robotics, a Chinese company that manufactures and lends money to them. This shift underscores the ongoing challenges and opportunities in the industry, which should resonate with professionals tracking market dynamics.gle explained.Angle noted that China,including companies like Roborock, which put iRobot at a disadvantage in China's huge market. It's important to note that Roborock has now become the world's leading robot vacuum brand.In a bid to boost consumer spending following the pandemic slowdown, China offered incentives that would encourage its people to purchase local products. This included up to 20% discounts on electronics. These policies show the support that Chinese authorities offered to their tech companies.Meanwhile, Picea Robotics has become a major player in the robot vacuum industry, working with brands such as Shark and Anker, alongside iRobot.Angle added.While Chinese competition hurt iRobot's global sales, Angle believes Amazon 's failed bid to acquire the company made matters worse.In 2022, Amazon's attempted $1.7 billion acquisition of iRobot was a significant event in the industry. The regulatory bodies' blocking of this acquisition not only impacted iRobot but also indicated a change in the industry that investors and analysts need to be aware of.According to Angle, this failed purchase didn't just damage iRobot; it hurt consumers and the entire home robotics industry.Angle explained.",iRobot co-founder and former CEO Colin Angle has revealed what went wrong for the company.

Deal enables direct power generation at data center sites





Google parent Alphabet is acquiring data center and clean energy developer Intersect Power for $4.75 billion in cash plus assumed debt—a strategic move targeting what CEO Sundar Pichai recently identified as the single biggest threat to AI progress: electricity supply. The deal comes as Pichai has candidly acknowledged severe infrastructure constraints plaguing the tech industry's AI ambitions, warning that energy bottlenecks could determine which nations dominate the next era of economic growth.""When you look at any system, you want to find out where the constraint is, because that's what allocates whole systems,"" Pichai said in a recent All-In Podcast interview. ""You are rightfully identifying the most likely constraint for AI progress, and hence by definition GDP growth and all that stuff. So I do worry about it a lot.""Under the deal, Alphabet gains Intersect's engineering team, multiple gigawatts of energy and data center projects currently under development or construction, and crucially, the ability to build power generation alongside computing facilities rather than relying on increasingly strained local utility grids. Intersect will continue operating independently under founder and CEO Sheldon Kimber while partnering closely with Google's infrastructure teams.Google already owned a minority stake from an $800 million funding round it co-led with TPG Rise Climate last December.Pichai's recent comments reveal the acquisition's urgency. ""We are supply constrained this year in our cloud business,"" he stated, explaining that simultaneous data center expansion by tech giants has created tangible roadblocks. ""The way the constraints play out today is delays in projects because of permitting or not having access to electricians. All that is reality as all of us are dealing with.""The Google chief warned these challenges will intensify without solutions. ""If this trend line continues, the pace at which we are ramping up...these constraints will be much more visible,"" he said, adding that solving energy infrastructure is essential ""for us to be competitive with China.""The transaction specifically targets Intersect's co-location model, positioning data centers directly beside dedicated wind, solar, battery, and gas power generation—eliminating dependence on overwhelmed public utilities. Included is the companies' first joint facility under construction in Haskell County, Texas, part of Google's $40 billion investment in the region through 2027.Intersect's existing operational assets in Texas and California aren't included and will continue as an independent company backed by TPG Rise Climate, Climate Adaptive Infrastructure, and Greenbelt Capital Partners.""Modern infrastructure is the linchpin of American competitiveness in AI,"" said Kimber. ""We share Google's conviction that energy innovation and community investment are the pillars of what must come next.""Alphabet emphasized commitment to advancing emerging technologies including advanced geothermal, long-duration energy storage, and carbon capture, while deploying AI itself to accelerate new power plant grid connections.The deal, subject to regulatory approval and customary conditions, is expected to close in the first half of 2026.","Google's parent company, Alphabet, is buying Intersect Power for $4.75 billion.

How the US is trying to solve this Chinese battery problem

“we don’t like electric vehicles, but we do need batteries for drones and data centres and AI. They’re recognising that China’s stranglehold on the battery supply chain is undermining our national security.”





American technology companies and the Department of War are reportedly struggling with a similar Chinese ‘problem’. It's the growing reliance on China for large-scale lithium-ion batteries needed to power both artificial intelligence (AI) development and modern weaponry.As tech majors build massive data centres to compete in the global AI race, experts have warned that they face a significant strategic disadvantage due to their dependency on Chinese batteries. Dan Wang, an expert at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, told the New York Times thatof the battery sector andhighlighting the strategic importance of battery independence for national security.Similarly, military officials at the Pentagon are sounding the same battery warnings, but for different reasons. Military strategists, after observing how modern warfare in Ukraine is being shaped by battery-dependent technology, have claimed that armed forces will need millions of batteries to power drones, lasers and several other weapons in the coming days, many of which come from China, the NYT report noted.According to defence analytics company Govini, US military forces depend on Chinese supply chains for approximately 6,000 different battery components used in weapons programmes, the report added.In a recent gathering of top defence and industry officials in California, Govini CEO Tara Murphy Dougherty said:China's control over battery production has long posed challenges for sectors such as automotive manufacturing. However, the report claims that the US is increasingly recognising this gap as a threat to national security.China recognises the strategic value of these batteries. In October, amid escalating trade tensions with the US, China hinted at restricting exports of certain advanced lithium-ion technologies, including key components such as graphite anodes and cathodes.The current US government also faces a dilemma in this area. Upon taking office, President Donald Trump's administration initially paused billions of dollars in federal grants allocated during the Biden era for battery manufacturing.This decision grouped batteries with electric vehicles , solar farms, wind turbines, and other clean energy technologies that the administration sought to place less emphasis on. Donald Trump has also criticised electric cars, calling them aHowever, the Trump administration has recently recognised that battery technology is essential to priorities such as AI and defence. In interviews, over a dozen people from the battery industry, lobbying firms, military sectors, and those with connections to the administration said the White House has shown increasing interest in building a domestic battery industry separate from China.In recent weeks, the White House has held crucial meetings on the battery supply chain, the report claimed, citing three people familiar with the discussions. The National Energy Dominance Council, which President Trump created to manage energy policy, has been meeting with battery companies.The report noted that the Energy Department has quietly approved many of the Biden administration's battery manufacturer grants. The department also recently announced up to $500 million for battery materials and recycling projects, demonstrating active steps to bolster domestic capacity and reduce reliance on Chinese supply chains.The US government has begun investing in companies that make battery components or extract critical minerals, including Eos, which is developing new battery technology. As part of a trade agreement, officials encouraged Japan to commit billions of dollars to battery manufacturing in the United States.Additionally, the ‘National Defense Authorization Act,’ which passed this month, includes Pentagon restrictions on buying batteries from 'foreign entities of concern,' mainly China, emphasising the legislative push to secure supply chains and address strategic vulnerabilities.In a statement to the NYT, Samm Gillard, executive director and co-founder of the Battery Advocacy for Technology Transformation Coalition, a trade group, said that the administration is saying","Tech companies and the Department of War are reportedly struggling with a similar Chinese 'problem' It's the growing reliance on China for large-scale lithium-ion batteries needed to power both artificial intelligence (AI) development and modern weaponry.

The move is aimed to give Satya Nadella and its engineering leaders to focus on AI.In an internal memo, seen by BI, Nadella told employees that “This will also allow our engineering leaders and me to be laser focused on our highest ambition technical work — across our datacenter buildout, systems architecture, AI science, and product innovation — to lead with intensity and pace in this generational platform shift”.According to the report, Satya Nadella has also started a weekly AI accelerator meeting to speed up the pace of AI work at the company. Interestingly, these meetings are not attended by Microsoft’s top executives and managers. Instead, lower-level technical engineers are invited to these AI weekly meetings where they are asked to “share what they're seeing from the AI trenches.” The company has intentionally kept these meetings ‘messy and chaotic’ to avoid top-down AI approach in leadership.",Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's love for cricket has reportedly made its way inside the company.

A group of 9 high-ranking US lawmakers has urged the Department of War (The Pentagon) to blacklist a total of 17 prominent Chinese technology firms, including DeepSeek – the company that stunned global tech sector with the launch of its R1 model in January 2025, and smartphone giant Xiaomi – a major tech players in markets like China and India. In a letter addressed to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the lawmakers urged the Pentagon to add these companies to the 1260H list, which is a roster of entities identified as “Chinese military-linked”. The list aims to prevent US taxpayer dollars from funding Beijing’s military.The letter argues that these companies represent the “next logical tranche” of contributors to China’s military-civil fusion strategy. These lawmakers include:“The firms listed below represent military-civil fusion contributors central to PLA modernization, internal-security operations, and power-projection capabilities. Their designation under Section 1260H would directly support Congress’ intent that U.S. taxpayer funds not underwrite PRC military-industrial and internal-security or intelligence capabilities,” the letter said.The petition covers a broad spectrum of critical technologies, from AI to robotics and semiconductors, and even biotechnology.","A group of 9 high-ranking US lawmakers has urged the Department of War (The Pentagon) to blacklist a total of 17 prominent Chinese technology firms.

AI talent war: Microsoft and other companies are spending millions on hiring

'AI talent war,'

""out of position on what I think is going to be the most important technology that enables the most new products and innovation and value creation and history,""





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has warned companies of the high investments they face to lead the artificial intelligence (AI) race. He claimed that competing at the top level of AI will require an investment ofover the next five to ten years, including costs for infrastructure, hardware, and specialised talent. Speaking on the Moonshots with Peter Diamandis podcast, Suleyman emphasised that the massive capital required for these components gives large, established corporations a distinct structural advantage.Suleyman highlighted that the financial burden extends beyond hardware to the fierce competition for human capital, particularly AI researchers, data scientists, and engineers.he noted, referring to the skyrocketing salaries in the AI sector. He also compared Microsoft’s current role to that of a ""modern construction company,"" with hundreds of thousands of workers dedicated to building gigawatts of CPUs and AI accelerators.Major tech companies are competing intensely for AI specialists in what's being called thewith firms like Meta, Microsoft, and Google offering massive compensation packages to recruit top researchers, emphasising the fierce competition shaping the industry.Earlier this year, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg launched an expensive hiring campaign for the company's AI Superintelligence Labs, including recruiting Scale AI co-founder Alexander Wang as part of a $14 billion investment. Meanwhile, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that Zuckerberg had attempted to attract OpenAI employees with $100 million signing bonuses and even larger compensation deals.On the other hand, Google secured Varun Mohan, co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, to join Google DeepMind in a $2.4 billion deal. Microsoft AI has quietly hired two dozen Google DeepMind employees as part of the ongoing competition to dominate the multibillion-dollar AI market.Apart from this, Microsoft, along with other major technology companies, is pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) and superintelligence, with industry leaders openly acknowledging the massive costs involved and highlighting the strategic importance of these future objectives.AI systems capable of performing most tasks at human-level intelligence are known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Superintelligence refers to systems that exceed human capabilities.In September, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated he would prefer to risk ""misspending a couple of hundred billion"" rather than lag in the superintelligence race.Should superintelligence emerge sooner than anticipated, and a company fails to act quickly enough, it will beZuckerberg added.Major tech companies have also invested billions of dollars in building AI data centres.

Research project, not Windows roadmap: Clarifies Microsoft engineer

Microsoft's ongoing Rust adoption continues





A Microsoft distinguished engineer has walked back claims that the company plans to eliminate all C and C++ code by 2030, clarifying that his team's ambitious project is purely research-focused and not a concrete plan for Windows.Galen Hunt, who sparked widespread speculation with his original LinkedIn post about rewriting Microsoft's codebases using AI and Rust, issued an update stating his message ""generated far more attention than I intended."" He emphasized that Windows is not being rewritten in Rust with AI, contrary to how many interpreted his initial announcement.Hunt's team is developing technology to enable large-scale code migration between programming languages, with a stated goal of ""1 engineer, 1 month, 1 million lines of code."" The project combines AI agents with algorithmic infrastructure to process and modify code at massive scale. However, Hunt stressed this remains an experimental endeavor within Microsoft's Future of Scalable Software Engineering group, not an official strategy for Windows 11 or future versions.The clarification comes after tech media outlets reported Hunt's original post as a definitive plan to replace Microsoft's entire C and C++ codebase with Rust by decade's end.His team is currently hiring a Principal Software Engineer with at least three years of Rust experience to continue developing these translation capabilities.While Hunt's specific project is research-based, Microsoft has been steadily incorporating Rust into its products for several years. The company began rewriting portions of the Windows kernel in Rust in 2023, and Azure CTO Mark Russinovich previously stated Microsoft was ""all-in"" on the memory-safe language for new projects.Rust offers built-in protections against common programming errors that cause security vulnerabilities, particularly memory-related bugs that have plagued C and C++ codebases. Hunt's research aims to accelerate such migrations through AI-assisted translation, though he clarified that Rust is not necessarily the final destination for all Microsoft code.The project represents Microsoft's broader investment in AI-powered development tools, though the timeline and scope remain far less certain than initially suggested.",A Microsoft engineer has walked back claims that the company plans to eliminate all C and C++ code by 2030.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B





Elon Musk responds to Andrej Karpathy’s claim

Progress made by Tesla





Tesla CEO Elon Musk is not so pleased with the recent remarks made by the company’s former AI chief Andrej Karpathy, after Karpathy compared Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) system with Google-parent Alphabet’s Waymo software. Recently, an X user Yunchen Jin shared some insights from his conversation with Karpathy, in which he praised the autonomous driving technologies of both Tesla and Waymo. However, he also noted that differences between the two would become clearer as operations scaled. Earlier, Karpathy had likened Telsa’s FSD experience to riding a magnetic levitation train.“Andrej Karpathy said a year ago, “Waymo has a hardware problem, while Tesla has a software problem.” The SF power outage froze Waymo, but not Tesla FSD. Here’s why imo:Waymo is “modular”: It relies on HD maps, LiDAR, sensors, 5G, and many neural networks. It works well until a single module fails. When the traffic lights died, the HD map no longer matched reality, so the car defaulted to a safe stop (brick mode). Also, the cars lost their connection to remote operators. Tesla FSD is “end-to-end”: One massive neural network converts camera pixels directly into steering and braking. This follows Andrej’s Software 2.0 idea: Instead of writing manual C++ logic for every scenario, you train a neural net on billions of human miles.The ""code"" is the model weights. It drives more like a human.I think now Waymo has a huge software problem. Its modular approach is a scaling and dependency trap. Long term, Tesla FSD wins,” wrote Jin on X.“I asked Andrej whether he still thinks Waymo’s software is better than Tesla’s.” Replying to the question, Karpathy said, “They both offer what now intuitively feels to me like perfect drive — smooth, confident just works. There’s probably still differences ofc but you have to wait for them or aggregate them over many cars etc.Musk responded directly to the post, saying Karpathy’s perspective was “dated.”“Andrej’s understanding is dated at this point.Tesla AI software has advanced vastly beyond what it was when he left.The intelligence density per GB of Tesla AI is at least an order of magnitude better than anything else out there,” wrote Musk.Recently, Tesla rolled out FSD v14 and the technology has been praised for smoother navigation and improved safety features. The company is also working on conducting driverless testing of its of its Robotaxi fleet. On the other hand, Waymo is still a dominant player in the US robotaxi makes and the company reported 14 million paid rides in 2025. The Google-parent Alphabet owned company is also planning to expand into Europe, while Baidu backed Apollo Go has further announced its plans to enter UK in partnership with Uber and Lyft.",Elon Musk responds to Andrej Karpathy’s claim about progress made by Tesla.

What the US State Department order says

What is Europe's Digital Services Act





'We don't want you in America' is the message that the US government has sent to five prominent Europeans. The 'visa ban' was announced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, accusing them of being involved in online censorship of Americans. Trump officials have reportedly ordered the US diplomats to build opposition to the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA), which is said to be aimed to combat hateful speech, misinformation and disinformation, but which Washington says stifles free speech and imposes costs on American tech companies. The visa bans come after the US administration's National Security Strategy this month said that European leaders were censoring free speech and suppressing opposition to immigration policies that it said risk ""civilisational erasure"" for the continent.* Thierry Breton, who served as the European commissioner for the internal market from 2019-2024. He is said to be the architect of DSA* Imran Ahmed, the British CEO of the U.S.-based Center for Countering Digital Hate* Anna-Lena von Hodenberg* Josephine Ballon of the German nonprofit HateAid* Clare Melford, co-founder of the Global Disinformation Index (GDI)The State Department is taking decisive action against five individuals who have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose.These radical activists and weaponized NGOs have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states—in each case targeting American speakers and American companies. As such, I have determined that their entry, presence, or activities in the United States have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.Based on these determinations, the Department has taken steps to impose visa restrictions on agents of the global censorship-industrial complex who, as a result, will be generally barred from entering the United States. Further, based on the foreign policy determination, the Department of Homeland Security can initiate removal proceedings against certain individuals pursuant to INA section 237(a)(4)(C), which renders such individuals deportable.President Trump has been clear that his America First foreign policy rejects violations of American sovereignty. Extraterritorial overreach by foreign censors targeting American speech is no exception. The State Department stands ready and willing to expand today’s list if other foreign actors do not reverse course.These actions are pursuant to Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which renders inadmissible any alien whose entry into the Unites States the Secretary of State determines “would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.” Certain family members may also be covered by these restrictions. In addition, Section 237(a)(4)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act renders an alien deportable from the United States if the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe the alien’s presence or activities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences.Digital Services Act (DSA) came into effect in 2022. It requires large online platforms to pay a fee -- up to 0.05% of their annual global net income -- to help fund the European Commission's work overseeing their compliance with digital rules. American companies including Google, Meta and X have criticised DSA. Elon Musk's X is the first company to be penalised under DSA that allows fines up to 6% of global annual revenue for violations. Earlier this month, European Union slapped Elon Musk's X platform with $140 million penalty for violating transparency rules.","The US has banned five prominent Europeans from entering the country, accusing them of pushing online censorship against American viewpoints.

“Yann is just plain incorrect here, he’s confusing general intelligence with universal intelligence.

Meta’s Secret AI Army: Top Talent Hired from OpenAI, Google & More

Brains are the most exquisite and complex phenomena we know of in the universe (so far), and they are in fact extremely general.

Obviously one can’t circumvent the no free lunch theorem so in a practical and finite system there always has to be some degree of specialisation around the target distribution that is being learnt.

But the point about generality is that in theory, in the Turing Machine sense, the architecture of such a general system is capable of learning anything computable given enough time and memory (and data), and the human brain (and AI foundation models) are approximate Turing Machines.

Finally, with regards to Yann's comments about chess players, it’s amazing that humans could have invented chess in the first place (and all the other aspects of modern civilization from science to 747s!) let alone get as brilliant at it as someone like Magnus. He may not be strictly optimal (after all he has finite memory and limited time to make a decision) but it’s incredible what he and we can do with our brains given they were evolved for hunter gathering.”





A fresh debate over the future of artificial intelligence (AI) broke out recently among some of the world’s most influential AI leaders. Former Meta AI scientist Yann LeCun in his recent appearance on a podcast said that there is no such thing as general intelligence, arguing that human intelligence itself is not truly general. According to him, human intelligence is highly specialised for the physical world, adding what people perceive as general intelligence is largely an illusion. “We only seem general because we can’t imagine the problems we’re blind to,” LeCun said. “This concept of general intelligence” he saidA clip from the podcast was shared on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) that caught the attention of Google DeepMind CEO and Nobel Laureate Demis Hassabis who publicly disagreed with LeCun’s views.

Elon Musk Can ‘CRY’, But He Will Still Pay $140,000,000 X Fine: EU Adamant After Hitler Attack

Tesla CEO Elon Musk gets closer to becoming first ever trillionaire







Tesla CEO Elon Musk is known for his strict and solid work routine. But the SpaceX CEO also has a soft and loveable side. Musk’s ex-wife Talulah Riley revealed how he managed to express his love for her despite the ongoing pressures of running multiple companies. Speaking to BBC in 2022 interview, Riley said that most couples often forget a Christmas gift, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk became a midnight odyssey through snow and subzero temperatures—barefoot. In the 2022 BBC documentary The Elon Musk Show, Musk’s ex-wife Talulah Riley shared an interesting story about a Christmas night. Riley described how Musk was overwhelmed by the pressure of running Tesla, SpaceX and SolarCity and realised late on Christmas Eve in Boulder, Colorado, that he had forgotten to buy her a present.Speaking to BBC, Riley revealed that it was a Christmas Eve in Boulder, Colorado, with “loads and loads of snow” outside. Musk was working hard at that time and was struggling for the survival of SpaceX and the launch of Tesla’s Model S. Along with these two ventures, Musk was also worried about SolarCity’s uncertain footing. Among all these, Musk suddenly realised that he had forgotten to buy a Christmas gift for Riley.He went to his ex-wife has confessed, “It’s not that I don’t love you—I do really, really love you. It’s just that my brain is exploding.”On the other hand, Riley brushed it off, but Musk couldn’t simply let it go. In that cold and snowy winter night, wearing only a T-shirt and shorts, Musk just slipped outside barefoot into the blizzard. After two hours, Tesla CEO returned with a bouquet of flowers which he had dug out of the snow telling her simply, “I just wanted to show you how much I loved you.”The midnight gesture, though unconventional, became a symbol of Musk’s emotional intensity. Riley has often defended him against perceptions of being cold or detached. “He is the most emotional person I know,” she said. “He feels very, very deeply.”Recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk moved a step closer to becoming the world's first trillionaire after his net worth surged to over $700 billion on December 20. As per Forbes’s Billionaire Index, the net worth of Tesla CEO climbed to $749 billion after the Delaware Supreme Court reinstated his 2018 pay package, once worth $56 billion. With this, Musk has become the world’s first-ever person with worth over $700 billion. After a legal battle of nearly two years, the court ruled that rescinding the pay package left the Tesla head ""uncompensated for his time and efforts over a period of six years"".","Elon Musk’s ex-wife Talulah Riley revealed how he managed to express his love for her despite the ongoing pressures of running multiple companies.

Twenty—six letters, twelve months, and more twists than a season finale. That was 2025 in technology. Chinese AI labs surprised Silicon Valley. The thinnest iPhone ever made couldn't find buyers. Humanoid robots began folding laundry. A bankruptcy court took one of the most loved names in consumer robotics. Elon Musk bounced between politics and tech empires. Mark Zuckerberg wrote record paycheques to fuel AI goals, while his metaverse dreams faded. A meme about tiny bananas somehow captured the spirit of AI's creative boom. There were shockwaves from new players, familiar faces making big changes, and technologies that went from niche to essential. Here’s how the year unfolded, one letter at a time.The shift was subtle at first, then suddenly everywhere. Generative AI—the technology that could write emails and create images—began evolving into something more autonomous and more proactive. Enter agentic AI: artificial intelligence that doesn’t just respond to prompts, but anticipates needs, takes actions, working as a companion rather than a tool.Everyone pivoted hard toward this vision of agentic AI, positioning their chatbots not as a mere chatbot but as a digital companion.Microsoft pushed Copilot as a work partner, Google reimagined Gemini as a helper, and OpenAI hinted at agents capable of handling complex tasks across multiple platforms. The promise was simple: AI that works for you, not just with you.Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture turned out to be the dark horse nobody saw coming—or rather, one everyone underestimated. What began as the next iteration of Nvidia’s GPU lineup quickly became the backbone of the AI revolution. Blackwell chips found their way into everything: powering high—end gaming PCs with unprecedented performance, driving AI workstations for creative professionals, and, most importantly, serving as the engine room of massive AI data centres worldwide. The architecture’s ability to handle both training and inference workloads with remarkable efficiency made it indispensable. As tech giants scrambled to build out their AI infrastructure, Blackwell was what they were scrambling for. And as Nvidia’s market cap soared, Jensen Huang’s leather jacket somehow became even more iconic.All those AI breakthroughs came at a cost—literally. The already tight supply of computing resources turned into an all—out crisis. GPU prices had already surged earlier, but 2025 saw the crunch spread to storage and memory in ways few anticipated. Big Tech’s race to build AI data centres created unprecedented demand for virtually every component imaginable. Memory giants like Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron faced an impossible choice: continue supplying consumer markets or divert production to tech giants waving massive purchase orders. They chose the latter. Memory and storage prices hit record highs as supply for regular customers dried up. The message was clear: in the age of AI, if you’re not building a data centre, you’re at the back of the line.China's DeepSeek didn't just enter the AI race—it shocked everyone watching. The company emerged seemingly from nowhere with models that rivalled, and in some cases outperformed, Western counterparts at a fraction of the reported cost. Their technical papers suggested training methods that were more efficient, their architecture choices that were unconventional yet effective. Silicon Valley had grown comfortable assuming the AI lead was secure; DeepSeek shattered that assumption. The implications rippled across the industry: Could China leapfrog in AI development? Were Western companies overspending on compute? The geopolitical dimensions of artificial intelligence suddenly felt very real, very urgent.What a year for Elon. Musk went from tech entrepreneur to playing politician, advising on government efficiency and policy with DOGE, only to pivot back to his tech empire with renewed vigour. Between steering Tesla through production challenges, pushing SpaceX toward Mars, and step up xAI's ambitions, he somehow found time to be everywhere at once. Whether you admired his audacity or questioned his judgment, ignoring Musk in 2025 was impossible. He also grabbed himself the biggest paycheque for CEO worth $700 billion.2025 was the year when foldables stopped being a novelty and started getting serious. Samsung and Huawei led the mission, but Chinese manufacturers too pushed boundaries with designs that were increasingly durable and practical. The crease problem that plagued early foldables became less pronounced, and battery technology finally caught up to power these expansive displays. And if you though bi—folding devices are the future, the year saw tri—fold devices move from concept to commercial reality, with devices that could morph between phone, tablet, and even laptop—like experiences.It was another year of disappointment for Grand Theft Auto fans. This was the year that was supposed to be the year of GTA VI. But as months passed, that release window kept sliding, Rockstar dropped the bomb: the GTA VI is being pushed to 2026. The game have already become soothing of a legend even before its launching, winning not one but two awards at The Game Awards. But, the wait continues, the hype persists, and the question remain: would 2026 finally be the year?This was the year when Tesla’s Optimus made its first real—world appearances, serving cocktails. China, too, entered the humanoid robotics race with remarkable speed and scale—showing robots that could do all Optimus could but at price points that would make Western competitors nervous. All of this made it clear that good old vision of humanoid robots, doing our chores, manufacturing at factories, and even doing the waiting at restraints now suddenly felt less like science fiction and more like a near—future reality.Apple’s iPhone Air finally arrived this year, and it was everything design enthusiasts hoped for: impossibly thin, gorgeously crafted, a marvel of engineering. At mere 5.5mm thick, the Air changed people’s expectations of what a phone could feel like. But consumers didn’t bite. The compromises required for that thinness— a smaller battery, no physical SIM slot, and limited camera capabilities—proved too much for most buyers. People admired it from afar, but sales so far this year have been modest.The layoffs that began during the pandemic never really stopped, but it only got worse in 2025. Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce, and IBM—to name a few—all announced job cuts with tens of thousands being sacked, and the reason behind them all was one: AI. Roles in customer service, data entry, content moderation, and even some coding positions evaporated as AI tools proved capable of doing the work faster and cheaper.Companies framed it as “transformation” and “optimisation,” but the human cost was real. The conversation around AI’s impact on employment shifted from theoretical to urgent, as white—collar workers began facing the same kind of disruption that earlier technological waves had brought to manufacturing.The phrase took on a far grimmer meaning. In 2025, a few incidents in took place that involved AI systems making decisions that resulted in deaths. Autonomous vehicles were involved in fatal accidents where AI failed, medical systems delivering incorrect diagnoses that led to patient deaths, and automated defense systems misidentifying targets. Each case triggered intense scrutiny.The technology wasn’t malicious, but it was consequential in ways abstract debates about AI safety had never fully captured. Regulators scrambled to respond. Tech companies issued familiar statements about improving safeguards. Yet the incidents exposed an uncomfortable truth: AI had reached a point where its failures could be lethal, and society was unprepared for that responsibility.Out of nowhere, Apple shook up iOS this year - version 26 arrived with something called ""Liquid Glass."" Not quite flat, not quite real glass, the new look added slick movement and texture to each screen. Layers seemed to hover, shifting slightly when you tilted your phone. It pulled ideas from older styles like soft edges and frosted panels, then pushed them forward with shimmer and depth. Some said it wasn’t bold enough, just small steps disguised as leaps. Yet others found joy in the polish, calling their phones sharper, smoother, somehow alive again.Mark Zuckerberg went all—in on AI in 2025, writing cheques that made even Silicon Valley veterans do double—takes. Zuckerberg turned Meta’s AI division into a magnet for top talent, with compensation packages reaching unprecedented levels. He personally recruited researchers from rivals, offering not just money, but the resources and freedom to push boundaries.Meta’s AI models improved rapidly, its infrastructure expanded at scale, and Llama grew increasingly competitive with closed models. The metaverse, however, told a different story. The Quest headsets saw only incremental improvements, while the company leaned more heavily than ever into smart glasses. Yet Zuckerberg’s vision of immersive digital worlds where people would live and work still failed to materialise.For a company that once changed its name to signal that ambition, cutting 30% of the budget for the very team building Zuckerberg’s metaverse dream was telling. The pivot was clear—even if it was never openly acknowledged that the metaverse vision was fading.The Nano Banana phenomenon took over the internet, turning AI image generation into a full—blown cultural moment. What began as an internet trend revealed something more serious: how far image models had come in understanding scale, context, and visual coherence. The phenomenon spread rapidly, spawning endless images and becoming shorthand for AI’s creative leap. Everyone played along, artists squinted, and for a brief stretch, timelines were filled with AI—generated images. It was playful and ridiculous—but it also showed how accessible, intuitive, and genuinely advanced AI tools had become.2025 was the year the internet kept breaking. AWS went down for hours. Microsoft’s Azure suffered multiple major disruptions. Google’s infrastructure showed cracks. Cloudfare, a not so staple name, but have many websites up and running, also suffered a major outage, taking countless services with it. Each outage exposed just how fragile our cloud—dependent world had become.Discussions stopped on social media, productivity tools went offline, and smart home devices stopped responding. The causes have been different but the outcome was always the same: panic.The incidents reignited debates around over—centralisation and the need for stronger redundancy. As usual, the conversation was loud—but little fundamentally changed.Perplexity and its CEO Aravind Srinivas became impossible to ignore, generating headlines for both impressive achievements and controversial moves. The AI—powered answer engine gained serious traction as a Google alternative, offering cited responses and conversational search.Srinivas positioned the company as David against Google's Goliath, attracting significant funding and user growth. Then came the audacious move: attempting to acquire Google Chrome when regulatory pressure mounted. The bid was ultimately unsuccessful, but it demonstrated Perplexity's ambitions.Controversies around content sourcing and attribution followed, with publishers questioning how Perplexity used their content. Love it or hate it, Perplexity had made itself central to conversations about search's future.Quantum computing graduated from promising research to delivering actual breakthroughs. IBM, Google, and startups like IonQ announced quantum systems solving problems classical computers couldn't touch—drug discovery simulations, optimisation challenges, and cryptographic calculations that would take conventional systems millennia.The number of stable qubits increased dramatically, error correction improved, and practical applications emerged. It wasn't yet the quantum revolution that would break all encryption or revolutionise every industry, but the trajectory became clear.Quantum computing moved from ""someday technology"" to ""in the next few years,"" with governments and corporations investing billions to lead the race.Bankruptcy hit iRobot in 2025, the company behind the well—known Roomba vacuum. At first glance, the story seemed predictable — lower—priced rivals appeared fast, while big tech players stepped in. Still, what truly hurt wasn’t competition at all.Stuck without a clear path forward, iRobot found itself frozen after Amazon walked away. Not even the fame of Roomba could save it — brand power didn’t fix broken fundamentals. Plans stalled, options narrowed. What looked solid on the outside cracked under pressure. Future moves? Too slow. Cash flow problems piled up while decisions waited.The Roomba label might survive under new ownership, yet iRobot itself, once its own driving force, had already faded into history.Something about OpenAI’s Sora clicked the moment people saw it move. Like Nano Banana once shocked image makers, this made video feel suddenly possible. A single line of text could now spin into scenes that held together, looked sharp, felt alive. Not just rough sketches—these played like real footage. Artists poked at its edges, brands watched closely, forums filled with tests and twists.What used to take teams and gear now emerged from words alone. Entire workflows blinked into question. Worries grew heavier when fake videos spread faster than facts could catch up. Yet people kept finding clever ways to make art out of code. Motion began flowing from machines—scenes dreamed by algorithms, shaped into something almost alive. Reality blurred a little more each time someone pressed play.TikTok's 2025 was a rollercoaster of bans, lifelines, and eventual sale. The app was banned, then granted temporary reprieves, then banned again as political and security concerns ping—ponged through Washington. After months of uncertainty affecting millions of American users and creators, a deal finally emerged: Oracle and a consortium of investors acquired TikTok's US operations, maintaining the app's functionality while satisfying government concerns about data and Chinese ownership.Out of nowhere, tensions across the Atlantic heated up again. Not long after one ruling settled, Brussels moved on another front — Google caught fresh legal heat. Meanwhile, Meta ended up paying heavy penalties over how it handles personal information. Apple found itself squeezed by scrutiny around its control of app distribution. Over at Amazon, officials poked deeper into who really sets the rules on its platformA single situation meant staggering penalties—sometimes crossing into billions — alongside deep shifts in how firms operate. Fines on this scale sparked pushback from Silicon Valley giants who saw Brussels as meddling too far, accusing it of choking homegrown progress. Officials across Europe stood firm, framing their actions less as attacks and more as necessary shields for everyday users and fair marketsA clash like this one wasn't just about now—it pointed at long—standing friction over who controls online spaces, how tech firms pay taxes, yet also which laws should shape web activity. Still, each party stood firm.Out of nowhere, coding stopped being only lines and rules. A different kind of energy took over—some called it vibe coding. This way of building software leaned on gut feeling, smooth motion, deep focus. Beauty in the act mattered just as much as what the code did. It felt good when things clicked—not because they worked, but how they came together. People talked about their desks, lights, music, even coffee routines.These little habits helped them land in the zone before typing began. Smart tools stepped in to manage boring parts automatically. That left room for humans to explore, play, enjoy the making. Some rolled their eyes, said it was self—indulgent nonsense. Yet those doing it believed joy shaped better outcomes. Craftsmanship showed up not in slogans, but in clean, thoughtful output. The practice grew quiet, steady, without needing attention. What started as personal preference slowly changed daily rhythms across teams. Not faster, not flashier—but deeper, richer, somehow more alive.Even as artificial intelligence pushed wearables forward, they kept circling a missing breakthrough—something vital enough to shift them from optional to necessary. Devices like Meta's smart glasses edged ahead, while fitness bands began tracking bodily signals with sharper precision. Watches packed on new tools too, layering functions one after another. Smarter software brought deeper readings of body patterns, guessed what users might need next, offered help based on surroundings. Still, progress felt slow, step by narrow step. They stayed on the edges of daily life, useful but never central.Wearing smart gadgets didn’t turn out quite like they said it would. Helpful? Yes, better than what came before. Yet that big change—expected by many—never really arrived. Just hovered there, close but never real.Just like Elon Musk, his AI company—xAI—had a colossal year filled with drama, ambition, and controversy. The company built one of the world's largest AI training facilities, deployed it faster than anyone thought possible, and pushed Grok—xAI's chatbot—as a politically unfiltered alternative to ""woke"" AI. The facility's energy consumption and environmental impact drew criticism, while Grok's deliberately provocative tone generated both enthusiasm and concern. Musk positioned xAI as the counter to AI ""censorship,"" though people noted his own platform moderation inconsistent, at times favouring Musk. The company raised massive funding, hired aggressively, and demonstrated that even in a crowded AI field, Musk's brand of chaos could carve out space.A surprise shift unfolded in the world of artificial intelligence. From deep within Meta, Yann LeCun—Turing laureate, widely seen as a pioneer—stepped away, launching his own startup. What followed stirred immediate debate: he claimed large language models aren’t living up to their hype. Behind closed doors, experts had whispered doubts; now one of them spoke aloud. Transformers, he said, have dominated progress too long, crowding out fresh ideas.His bet? That breakthroughs lie outside the mainstream path everyone else is racing down. This wasn’t just another opinion - it carried weight because of who voiced it. Reactions spread fast among labs and research teams. Maybe what comes next won’t resemble ChatGPT at all.Tech valuations reached stratospheric heights in 2025, with AI companies commanding eye—watering multiples that made even dot—com bubble veterans nervous. Startups with minimal revenue but AI in their pitch decks raised hundreds of millions at billion—dollar valuations. Nvidia now wears the crown as the planet’s priciest business, crossing $4 trillion in value. Hype pulsed through each announcement--earnings reports name-dropped artificial intelligence constantly, new gadgets claimed smart tech at their core, entire brands reshaped themselves around algorithm-driven promises. Still, quiet questions began spreading about how long it could last.","Twenty-six letters, twelve months, and more plot twists than a season finale. It was the year Elon Musk ping-ponged between politics and tech empires. Mark Zuckerberg wrote record paycheques to fuel AI goals. A meme about impossibly tiny bananas somehow captured the zeitgeist of AI's creative explosion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126157752,imgsize-2017755,width-400,resizemode-4/126157752.jpg"

Read Amazon chief security officer Stephen Schmidt’s LinkedIn post here

Over the past few years, North Korean (DPRK) nationals have been attempting to secure remote IT jobs with companies worldwide, particularly in the U.S. Their objective is typically straightforward: get hired, get paid, and funnel wages back to fund the regime's weapons programs.

At Amazon, we've stopped more than 1,800 suspected DPRK operatives from joining since April 2024, and we've detected 27% more DPRK-affiliated applications quarter over quarter this year.

Our detections combine AI-powered screening with human verification. Our AI model analyzes connections to nearly 200 high-risk institutions, anomalies across applications, and geographic inconsistencies. We verify identities through background checks, credential verification, and structured interviews.

As CSO of one of the world's largest employers, my team sees these threats at a scale few organizations do. That gives us unique visibility into how these operations evolve and a responsibility to share what we're learning. Here’s what we’re seeing:

• Identity theft has become more calculated. These operatives target actual software engineers who provide real credibility, rather than people with minimal online presence.

• Their LinkedIn strategies are getting sophisticated. We're seeing them hijack dormant accounts through compromised credentials to gain verification. We've also identified networks where people hand over access to their accounts in exchange for payment.

• They're increasingly targeting AI and machine learning roles, likely because these are in higher demand as companies adopt AI.

• These operatives often work with facilitators managing ""laptop farms"": U.S.

locations that receive shipments and maintain domestic presence, while the worker operates remotely from outside the country.

• Educational backgrounds keep changing. We've watched the strategy shift from East Asian universities, to institutions in no-income-tax states, to now California and New York schools. We look for degrees from schools that don't offer claimed majors, or dates misaligned with academic schedules.

• Small details give them away. For example, these applicants often format U.S. phone numbers with ""+1"" rather than ""1."" Alone, this means nothing. Combined with other indicators, it paints a picture.

This isn't Amazon-specific. This is likely happening at scale across the industry.

If you’re concerned about these threats in your organization, query your databases for common indicators: patterns in resumes, emails, phone numbers, educational backgrounds.

Implement identity verification at multiple hiring stages and monitor for anomalous technical behavior: unusual remote access, unauthorized hardware.

If you identify suspected DPRK IT workers, report it to the FBI or your local law enforcement. And if you're seeing similar patterns or have insights to share, I encourage you to do so. The more we share what we're learning, the harder we make it for these operations to succeed.





Amazon has reportedly prevented more than 1800 suspected North Korean operatives from applying for jobs over the past 20 months. According to a report by Business Insider, Amazon chief security officer Stephen Schmidt revealed how ‘small details’ have been key in detecting fraudulent applicants. In a lengthy LinkedIn post, Schmidt has mentioned that North Korean nationals have increasingly attempted to secure many remote tech roles at global companies. He further explained that the main objective of these North Korean agents is simply to get hired, paid and funnel wages back to fund the regime’s weapons programs.Schmidt revealed that Amazon has responded to this threat with dual-layered defense system. The company now conducts AI-powered screening that scans for links to around 200 “high-risk institutions” and flags anomalies or geographic inconsistencies. Along with this, the company also does human verification which includes background checks, credential reviews and interviews.Schmidt also noted that fraudsters are become more calculated and they often impersonate real software engineers of hijack dormant LinkedIn accounts to gain credibility.Some even pay for access to existing professional profiles.AI and machine-learning roles are particularly targeted due to high demand. Yet, Schmidt said, “small details give them away.” For example, applicants often format US phone numbers with “+1” instead of “1.” While trivial in isolation, combined with other indicators, such anomalies reveal a broader pattern.The operatives also rely on ‘laptop farms’ which are US-based setups which maintain domestic presence while the workers operate remotely from abroad. Schmidt emphasised that this issue is not Amazon-specific, but likely occurring “at scale across the industry.”Amazon reported a 27% quarter-over-quarter increase in North Korea-linked applications this year, underscoring the scale of the challenge. The Justice Department has also intensified its efforts against such practices. In July this year an Arizona woman received a 102 months of prison sentence for helping North Korean IT workers in securing jobs at over 300 US companies.","North Korean nationals have increasingly attempted to secure many remote tech roles at global companies.

TikTok-parent ByteDance to offer 50% bonus payouts for top performers in 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tiktok-parent-bytedance-to-offer-50-bonus-payouts-for-top-performers-in-2026/articleshow/126155660.cms,"TikTok Deal Explained: Trump, China & The Algorithm Battle

Performance reviews under scrutiny





TikTok parent ByteDance is all set to boost the compensation packages for its highest-performing employees in 2026. As reported by Business Insider, an internal memo of the company revealed that the ByteDance will spend around 50% more globally on incentives such as raises and bonuses compared to last year, with payouts reserved for staff who exceed performance review benchmarks. The memo obtained by Business Insider outlines that the compensation adjustments will apply across most of the departments, but only employees who achieve strong scores in annual reviews will benefit from this.The report suggest that workers with ‘M’ rating (consistently meets expectations) or higher will see 35% more in bonuses, while those with the ‘F’ scoring (exceed exceptions) stand to gain bigger payouts. It is important to note that a larger portion of bonuses will be paid in cash rather than stock options, a move expected to appeal to employees amid uncertainty over equity liquidity following ByteDance’s plan to spin off part of TikTok’s U.S. business into a joint venture next year. For those still receiving equity, the vesting period will be shortened from four years to three.Performance reviews have long been a focal point at TikTok.Managers are urged not to grade staff at the midpoint to avoid conflict, and last year the company adjusted its process to issue more low scores, sharpening the distinction between high and weak performers.Along with the incentive adjustments, the company is also planning to restructure jobs into 10 different levels with higher performance standards. The changes coincide with TikTok’s U.S. spin-off, expected to close in January, involving investors such as Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX. Key areas like e-commerce, advertising, and marketing will remain under ByteDance’s management.Offering bigger raises and cash bonuses may help TikTok retain talent during this period of flux. As one staffer told Business Insider, the cash-heavy bonuses could reassure employees wary of equity’s uncertain future."," ByteDance will spend around 50% more globally on incentives such as raises and bonuses compared to last year.

It’s that time of the year when millions around the world wait for Santa Claus to begin his magical Christmas Eve journey. Thanks to Google and the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), one can now track his journey in real time. To keep the tradition alive, Google and NORAD have opened their Santa trackers, allowing users to follow his route, explore festive activities and see where he’s headed next – all in real time.NORAD's long history tracking Santa was born in the year 1955. It began decades ago as an unintentional phone call from a child to the then-Continental Air Defense Command. As kids and elders called, officers played along.Since then, it has become a joyous occasion for families everywhere, showcasing the lighter side of NORAD's 70-year-old mission, says Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell.Google, on the other hand, started its Santa tracker in 2004. Initially built on NORAD's long-standing Santa tracking program, Google’s Santa tracker has evolved with Google’s modern technology, incorporating playful features and educational games to engage users throughout the holiday season.Google’s Santa tracker will go live today, Christmas eve.

"YouTube beats Amazon Prime, Disney and every other app in viewership in America; also tells why Netflix CEOs have 'named' this Google company in their email to employees",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/youtube-beats-netflix-amazon-prime-disney-in-viewership-and-tells-you-why-this-google-company-is-being-named-in-fight-between-two-of-the-biggest-american-companies/articleshow/126154595.cms,"Netflix says reason it 'wants to buy and will be able to buy' Warner Brothers is YouTube





The latest TV viewing numbers in America are out. And once again, as per rating agency Nielsen, Google-owned YouTube beats every other platform in viewership in America. In November, YouTube accounted for nearly 13% of viewing time, compared with 8% for Netflix, the next in line, according to Nielsen. In fact, YouTube has been winning the streaming wars for years, generating more TV viewing time in the United States than Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ and every other app out there. Not just this, roughly 75% of all podcast listening time reportedly happens between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., according to Edison, a research firm. YouTube said viewers watched 700 million hours of video podcasts on living room devices in October, a 75% increase from last year. And YouTube is also the No. 1 platform for podcast listening, with a healthy lead over Spotify and Apple, Edison said.YouTube’s growing dominance in television streaming is said to be a conundrum to streaming and entertainment executives who continue to invest tens of billions in scripted and unscripted entertainment to get people to subscribe and watch. Also, note here that these numbers are just for YouTube, not the YouTube TV subscription service, which features traditional cable networks.Over the years, YouTube has been encroaching on their turf too now. Proof of this is YouTube signing the five-year deal to exclusively stream the Oscars beginning in 2029, ending a run for ABC that began in the 1970s.With the numbers that YouTube boasts, it is little doubt that the video-sharing platform figures prominently in the ongoing fight between Netflix and Paramount for Warner Brothers. Both Netflix and Paramount are locked in a fierce battle over Warner Bros. entertainment properties, with each prepared to spend at least $80 billion to add a trove of movies and TV series that would better position them against YouTube and everyone else. Netflix has agreed to buy Warner Bros. in one of the biggest deals in Hollywood's history.Paramount Skydance has termed Netflix-Warner Bros. mega-deal as anticompetitive, arguing that it would not only harm consumers but also Hollywood talent. Netflix is by far the largest paid subscription video streamer, and it would become even stronger with the addition of WBD's studio assets, including HBO and the Warner Bros. library. On its part, Netflix is advocating for a definition that considers total US TV viewing time. The streamer, which has expressed confidence in its regulatory case, has pointed to YouTube dominance in the space time and again.The letter that Netflix co-CEOs sent to the company's employees last week to talked about YouTube leading in TV space by almost double the margin of the second player in the segment. ""Even after combining with Warner Bros., our view share would only move from 8% to 9% in the US — still well behind YouTube (13%) and a potential Paramount/WBD combination (14%),"" Netflix's co-CEOs wrote in the letter, citing Nielsen data.","Nielsen: In November, YouTube accounted for nearly 13% of viewing time, compared with 8% for Netflix.

"San Francisco power outage: Waymo announces fleet-wide update, says ‘integrating lessons from the weekend’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/san-francisco-power-outage-waymo-announces-fleet-wide-update-says-integrating-lessons-from-the-weekend/articleshow/126153817.cms,"San Francisco Goes Back To 'Stone Age'; No Power In US Tech Hub; 'Don't Use Candles & Call 911'

Here’s Waymo’s full statement on stranded vehicles during San Francisco outage

At Waymo, our mission is to be the world’s most trusted driver. We know trust is built through consistent behavior over time—earned through every mile we drive and every interaction we have with the community.

This past Saturday, as a widespread PG&E outage cut power to nearly one-third of San Francisco, our service was put to the test. With power now restored, we want to share an account of our operations during the outage and how we are evolving to better serve the city.

The scale of the outage and the sheer number of disabled traffic lights were the primary contributors to city-wide gridlock. As signals went dark across major corridors, the resulting congestion required law enforcement to manually manage intersections.

The situation was severe enough that the San Francisco Department of Emergency Management advised residents to stay home, underscoring the extraordinary nature of the weekend’s disruptions.

Navigating an event of this magnitude presented a unique challenge for autonomous technology. While the Waymo Driver is designed to handle dark traffic signals as four-way stops, it may occasionally request a confirmation check to ensure it makes the safest choice.

While we successfully traversed more than 7,000 dark signals on Saturday, the outage created a concentrated spike in these requests. This created a backlog that, in some cases, led to response delays contributing to congestion on already-overwhelmed streets.

We established these confirmation protocols out of an abundance of caution during our early deployment, and we are now refining them to match our current scale.

While this strategy was effective during smaller outages, we are now implementing fleet-wide updates that provide the Driver with specific power outage context, allowing it to navigate more decisively.

As the outage persisted and City officials urged residents to stay off the streets to prioritize first responders, we temporarily paused our service in the area. We directed our fleet to pull over and park appropriately so we could return vehicles to our depots in waves.

This ensured we did not further add to the congestion or obstruct emergency vehicles during the peak of the recovery effort.

The path forward

We’ve always focused on developing the Waymo Driver for the world as it is, including when infrastructure fails. We are analyzing the event, and are already integrating the lessons from this weekend’s PG&E outage. Here are some of the immediate steps we’re taking:

Integrating more information about outages: While our Driver already handles dark traffic signals as four-way stops, we are now rolling out fleet-wide updates that give our vehicles even more context about regional outages, allowing them to navigate these intersections more decisively.

Updating our emergency preparedness and response: We will improve our emergency response protocols, incorporating lessons from this event. In San Francisco, we’ll continue to coordinate with Mayor Lurie’s team to identify areas of greater collaboration in our existing emergency preparedness plans.

Expanding our first responder engagement: To date, we’ve trained more than 25,000 first responders in the U.S.

and around the world on how to interact with Waymo. As we discover learnings from this and other widespread events, we’ll continue updating our first responder training.

Undaunted in our mission to make our streets safer

We live and work in San Francisco, and we are grateful to the city’s first responders for their tireless work, and to Mayor Lurie for his leadership.

Backed by 100M+ miles of fully autonomous driving experience and a record of improving road safety, we are undaunted by the opportunity to challenge the status quo of our roads, and we’re proud to continue serving San Franciscan residents and visitors.





Waymo says it will implement a fleet-wide update to help its cars make safer, quicker decisions during power outage incidents like the one in San Francisco last week. A temporary power blackout hit the San Francisco Bay area last week. With stoplights and traffic signals not working, many Waymo cars were spotted stranded on the road, while rival Tesla cars, Musk claimed, kept rolling. Three days after the incident, Waymo has now shared a blog post on December 23 where it said “We’ve always focused on developing the Waymo Driver for the world as it is, including when infrastructure fails. We are analyzing the event, and are already integrating the lessons from this weekend’s PG&E outage.”In the blog post, the EV company laid out three “immediate steps” it is taking. These include - integrating more information about outages, updating emergency preparedness and response and expanding first responder engagement.","Waymo says it will implement a fleet-wide update to help its cars make safer, quicker decisions during power outage.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says he is just waiting to be replaced as OpenAI CEO





OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently said that the coming decade could be the “most exciting time in the history” to start a career. In an interview with video journalist Cleo Abram, Altman predicted that a student finishing college in 2035 might not take a normal job like the current generation. Instead, they could be working in a brand new, highly paid space job – maybe even joining a mission to explore the solar system. Predicting sky high salaries for the future generation, he said that these “well-paid” roles will come after AI has wiped some jobs entirely, reshaping the early-career landscape for today’s workspace.“In 2035, that graduating college student, if they still go to college at all, could very well be leaving on a mission to explore the solar system on a spaceship in some completely new, exciting, super well-paid, super interesting job,” said Sam Altman.The OpenAI CEO also said that he is envious of GenZ who are starting their careers now. “If I were 22 right now and graduating college, I would feel like the luckiest kid in all of history,” he told Abram.During the conversation, he also stated that the future generation will also be “feeling so bad for you and I that we had to do this really boring, old work and everything is just better.”In November, Altman revealed that he is counting down the years until AI is capable of replacing him and he also hopes the OpenAI will become the first company to make it happen.As reported by Business Insider, speaking on the Conversations with Tyler podcast this week, ““Shame on me if OpenAI is not the first big company run by an AI CEO”.During the interview, Altman also mentioned that he frequently reflects on what it would take for an AI system to outperform him in leading the company, and he believes that it is only a matter of “single-digit years” before AI can run a major department at OpenAI.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicts that graduates in 2035 could embark on lucrative careers, possibly even in space exploration.

"'Holy crap. The end of me', says ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt on AI doing coding jobs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/holy-crap-the-end-of-me-says-ex-google-ceo-eric-schmidt-on-ai-doing-coding-jobs/articleshow/125943698.cms,"Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt expressed astonishment at AI's rapid progress, particularly its ability to autonomously generate code, admitting his own potential obsolescence. He highlighted AI's significant impact on automating business operations like billing and accounting, predicting artificial general intelligence within three to five years. Schmidt cautioned about the need for human oversight to preserve agency and freedom.

AI's bigger impact lies in automating business operations, not just code

Artificial general intelligence could arrive by 2029, warns tech leader





Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt expressed shock at artificial intelligence's rapid advancement in software development, declaring his own obsolescence after witnessing an AI system generate an entire program autonomously—a moment that crystallized both the promise and peril of the technology he has championed for decades.""Holy crap. The end of me,"" Schmidt said during a forum at Harvard University earlier this month. ""I've been doing programming for 55 years. To see something start and end in front of your own life is really profound.""The admission from one of Silicon Valley's most influential figures underscores a broader shift already underway: AI is moving from a helpful tool to a potential replacement for skilled human labor. At leading AI research labs, between 10 and 20 percent of programming work is already being done by AI systems, Schmidt revealed, with that proportion expected to grow exponentially in coming years.Despite the dramatic demonstration, Schmidt argued that AI remains underhyped rather than overhyped, as the technology's true economic impact lies beyond coding. Speaking with Professor Graham Allison at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at Harvard University, he pointed to the automation of corporate work as AI's biggest untapped potential.The real transformation is happening inside companies, where AI systems are taking over billing, accounting, product design, delivery, and inventory management, Schmidt explained.These routine processes quietly consume billions in corporate spending, and automating them could fundamentally reshape business operations.Schmidt predicted artificial general intelligence—systems matching the smartest mathematicians, physicists, and artists—will arrive within three to five years. This timeline is driven by what he calls ""recursive self-improvement,"" where AI learns independently without human instruction.""The computers are now doing self-improvement. They're learning how to plan, and they don't have to listen to us anymore,"" he warned at another recent event. Schmidt noted that AI already writes 10 to 20 percent of code at leading research labs like OpenAI and Anthropic.Looking further ahead, Schmidt forecast that within four years, AI will achieve autonomous learning capabilities. ""Many people believe that there will be AI mathematicians in the next year,"" he said, adding that the ability for computers to discover new facts and generate medical breakthroughs appears imminent.However, Schmidt emphasized the need for human oversight as AI approaches these capabilities. ""Somebody's going to have to raise their hand and say, 'We just went too far,'"" he cautioned. ""I think there's no higher duty than to preserve human agency and human freedom.""The former Google executive suggested Wall Street is underestimating the magnitude of AI's impact on business automation and scientific discovery.","Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt expressed shock at artificial intelligence's rapid advancement in software development.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk says ‘nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-says-nobody-ever-changed-the-world-on-40-hours-a-week/articleshow/125952103.cms,"Elon Musk Can ‘CRY’, But He Will Still Pay $140,000,000 X Fine: EU Adamant After Hitler Attack

Elon Musk on long working hours





Tesla CEO Elon Musk once said that major breakthroughs cannot be achieved on a standard 40-hour workweek. In 2018, the tech billionaire shared a X (formerly Twitter) post where he responded to an article about Tesla being one of Silicon Valley’s most in-demand employers by saying that “nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week. ”Musk later said the number varies by person, but suggested that around 80 hours a week — sometimes rising above 100 — is what it takes. Elon Musk has repeatedly pointed to his own experience working long hours during critical moments at Tesla, SpaceX and X.After the 2018 post, a user asked Elon Musk what the “correct” number of hours would be to “change the world.” To this, the tech CEO replied: “Varies per person, but about 80 sustained, peaking above 100 at times. Pain level increases exponentially above 80.”“If you love what you do, it (mostly) doesn’t feel like work,” he added.Musk has shared examples from his career to show how demanding periods required long days. In 2021, he said Tesla closed an important financing round at 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve, preventing a situation where employee paychecks could have bounced two days later.In 2023, after buying Twitter (now X), Musk faced rising data-center costs. According to Walter Isaacson’s biography Elon Musk, he ordered a large server migration with a 90-day deadline instead of the nine-month timeline suggested by staff. When delays occurred, Musk flew to Sacramento on Christmas Eve and joined a small team to physically move equipment, rewire panels and dismantle server racks.Isaacson’s book also recounts personal moments that reflect Musk’s intensity. In one incident, he went barefoot into a snowstorm to find flowers for then-wife Talulah Riley, returning hours later injured but carrying the bouquet.","Elon Musk once said that major breakthroughs cannot be achieved on a standard 40-hour workweek.

"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on why despite being the CEO of world's most-valuable company, sense of uncertainty and insecurity doesn't leave him",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-on-why-despite-being-the-ceo-of-worlds-most-valuable-company-sense-of-uncertainty-and-insecurity-doesnt-leave-him/articleshow/125883149.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, despite leading his company to a $5 trillion valuation, lives in constant anxiety, a fear rooted in a near-bankruptcy experience. Recent reports of Meta potentially buying Google's AI chips have caused a $250 billion market value drop, validating Huang's long-held belief that the company is always '30 days from going out of business'.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

A near-death experience that shaped Huang’s three decades of paranoia

Why Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang 's fears suddenly look prophetic





Despite leading Nvidia to become the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation, CEO Jensen Huang admits he operates in constant anxiety, working every single day including holidays. His fears may be justified—this week alone, Nvidia lost $250 billion in market value after reports emerged that Meta is in advanced talks to buy billions worth of competing chips from Google , threatening the chipmaker's decade-long dominance in AI hardware.""The phrase '30 days from going out of business'—I've used for 33 years,"" Huang revealed on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. ""The feeling doesn't change. The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity—it doesn't leave you.""Huang's anxiety isn't unfounded paranoia—it's scar tissue from survival. In the mid-1990s, Nvidia discovered fatal flaws in its first graphics chip while developing technology for Sega's gaming console. With funds evaporating, Huang flew to Japan for an excruciating conversation: he told Sega's CEO the product wouldn't work and the deal must end, but simultaneously begged for the final $5 million payment to prevent bankruptcy.Remarkably, Sega converted it into an investment, giving Nvidia the lifeline that eventually built a trillion-dollar empire.That near-collapse experience now fuels Huang's relentless schedule. He wakes at 4 a.m. daily to read ""several thousand emails,"" works seven days a week without exception—""including Thanksgiving, Christmas""—and admits he's ""always in a state of anxiety."" His motivation? ""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed. Failure drives me more than greed.""Huang's paranoia might be wisdom. Nvidia made the rare move of issuing a public defense after The Information reported that Meta—planning up to $72 billion in AI spending this year—is negotiating massive purchases of Google's tensor processing units (TPUs). The news triggered a 6% stock plunge, erasing roughly $250 billion in value, while Alphabet shares surged 4%.""Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry—it's the only platform that runs every AI model,"" the company declared on X, breaking its usual silence on competitors. But Google's latest Gemini 3 AI model, trained entirely on TPUs rather than Nvidia chips, is being hailed by industry leaders as potentially superior. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff publicly announced he's switching from ChatGPT after three years, calling Gemini 3 the better product.The threat is existential to Nvidia's 90% market share in AI accelerators. If Google captures even a fraction of the hundreds of billions being spent on AI processors—particularly from customers like Meta—it would represent the first serious crack in Nvidia's dominance.Huang's work ethic has infected his family: both his children, Madison and Spencer, now in their thirties, work at Nvidia after joining as interns in 2020 and 2022. ""Now we have three people working every day,"" Huang said.For a CEO who never stopped running scared despite building a $4.5-trillion empire, the market turmoil caused by Google likely only confirmed what he's believed for 33 years: you're always 30 days from going out of business.","Jensen Huang is the CEO of Nvidia, the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation.

How to apply for e-passport





The Ministry of External Affairs rolled out e-passport service under the Passport Seva Programme (PSP V2.0). With the new system, the government aims to facilitate faster, more secure, and smooth travel for all Indian passport holders. While the existing ones remain valid till their expiry, anyone applying for a passport will get a chip-enabled passport by default, irrespective of whether they apply in India or abroad.As explained by the external affairs ministry in a press release, the e-Passport is a hybrid passport that combines both paper and electronic elements. It features an embedded Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip and an antenna, which store and secure the holder’s data in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards.Critical information printed on the data page is also stored electronically on the chip, enabling enhanced security and authentication, the ministry says. Going forward, all newly issued passports will be e-Passports, while existing non-electronic passports will remain valid until their expiry, it added.As mentioned above, any Indian citizen who is eligible for a regular passport can apply for e-passport.The process of applying for an e-passport is the same as that of applying for a regular passport.

After completing the registration, they must fill in the online application form carefully and pay the prescribed fee through the available payment options.Once the payment is completed, applicants are required to book an appointment at a nearby Passport Seva Kendra or Post Office Passport Seva Kendra, based on their location and slot availability.

Jamie Dimon, CEO of America’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase CEO has once again warned that artificial intelligence (AI) will eliminate jobs in the long run. Speaking in an interview with Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures, Dimon urged workers to focus on human skills such as critical thinking, emotional intelligence and communication to stay relevant in the future workforce. He said individuals should build skills that machines cannot easily copy. These include problem-solving, emotional understanding, creativity, and clear communication.Jamie Dimon said that while companies have been cautious about hiring in recent months, this slowdown is not being driven by AI. He also said he does not expect the technology to cause large job losses in the immediate future.“For the most part, AI is going to do great stuff for mankind, like tractors did, like fertilizers did, like vaccines did,” Dimon said during the interview. “You know, maybe one day we’ll be working less hard but having wonderful lives.”At the same time, Jamie Dimon stressed that AI will eventually replace some jobs and that people must prepare for this shift. Notably, this is not the first time Dimon has warned about AI eliminating jobs. He has previously warned that automation will change the nature of work. In November 2025, Dimon said AI could help people in developed countries move toward a much shorter workweek of around three-and-a-half days over the next 20 to 40 years.Dimon also said that AI must be regulated properly to limit its risks, just as earlier technologies were brought under rules to protect society. He said both governments and companies have a shared responsibility to manage the impact of AI on workers.“We—government and we the companies, society—should look at how do we phase it in a way that we don’t damage a lot of people,” he said. He pointed to past examples where factory closures hurt entire towns and said better support could have reduced the damage. “You can retrain people, relocate people, income assistance, early retirement,” he added.While warning about future job losses, Dimon also said AI is already creating new jobs in the short term. He said the growth of AI requires large investments in infrastructure, including construction work and fibre-optic networks, which will generate employment.","Jamie Dimon, CEO of America’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase CEO has once again warned that artificial intelligence will eliminate jobs in the long run.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently hinted at building data centres in space. In an interview with Fox News, Pichai said that the company is working on quantum computing, adding “in that spirit, one of our moon shots is to, how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun”.Sundar Pichai’s video from the interview was shared by X (formerly Twitter) user - Bourbon Capital in an online post. It caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who replied to the post with a single word. “Interesting”, Musk wrote.“At Google, we are always proud of taking moon shots,” Pichai said, adding “... Waymo … has been over a decade in the making.”“We're working on quantum computing, in that spirit, one of our moon shots is to, how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun,” he continued.Pichai further said that the company wants to “put these data centers in space closer to the sun”, and will take “first step in 2027”.“We'll send tiny racks of machines and have them in satellites, test them out, and then start scaling from there. But there's no doubt to me that a decade or so away will be viewing it as a more normal way to build data centers,” Sundar Pichai said in the interview.Notably, this echoes Musk's November 2025 announcements that SpaceX will pioneer orbital data centers using next-gen Starlink satellites, positioning them as the lowest-cost AI compute option within five years.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company is working on quantum computing.

Elon Musk’s Starlink To Begin Trials in India

Starlink’s residential connection includes 30-day trial and plug-and-play setup to cost Rs 34,000

SpaceX Gateway network to span across six cities, and Bengaluru office expands





Starlink has officially denied that Indian pricing, calling the incident a technical glitch rather than an intentional reveal. Lauren Dreyer, Vice President of Starlink Business Operations, clarified in a post on X that the company's India website is not yet live and is not accepting orders.She explained that a configuration error caused internal dummy test data to briefly appear publicly, which was quickly corrected once discovered. Dreyer emphasized that Starlink has not announced official pricing for India and any figures currently circulating online are inaccurate. The company remains focused on obtaining final government approvals before launching service in the country, and both the website and ordering system will stay inactive until the regulatory process is complete.Elon Musk's Starlink has revealed the residential satellite internet pricing for India at Rs 8,600 monthly, plus a Rs 34,000 hardware kit, as the SpaceX subsidiary prepares for commercial operations. The service targets households in remote and underserved areas with promises of unlimited data, 99.9% uptime, and weather-resistant connectivity where traditional broadband infrastructure fails to reach.Following regulatory clearance from the Department of Telecommunications in July, Starlink is positioning itself to challenge established players Jio-SES and Eutelsat OneWeb in India's satellite communications sector.The residential plan, priced at a monthly subscription cost of Rs 8,600 offers unlimited data without usage caps or throttling, addressing critical connectivity gaps in rural regions. Starlink's system requires minimal installation effort, with users simply powering on equipment and pointing it skyward to establish connections. However, the hardware kit will cost customers Rs 34,000, which the company says is a one time fees. The company guarantees over 99.9% uptime and all-weather functionality, crucial features for areas experiencing frequent service disruptions.New customers receive a 30-day trial period, allowing households to evaluate performance before long-term commitment. This trial provision acknowledges the premium pricing structure, which places Starlink among India's higher-cost broadband options despite targeting underserved markets.Business subscription pricing remains unannounced, with enterprise-focused plans expected as commercial rollout advances.Starlink is deploying gateway earth stations across Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, and Noida to enable satellite-to-ground communications. These relay installations are essential for maintaining low-latency connections and service reliability across India's varied geography.The company posted four specialist positions at its Bengaluru office in October, recruiting talent in payments, accounting, treasury, and tax operations as part of infrastructure expansion. This direct-to-consumer strategy distinguishes Starlink from competitors concentrating on enterprise clients, potentially reshaping internet accessibility in regions where fiber deployment remains economically unviable.","Elon Musk’s Starlink To Begin Trials in India. residential connection includes 30-day trial and plug-and-play setup to cost Rs 34,000 per month.

Google may soon allow Gemini users to mark up images directly: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-may-soon-allow-gemini-users-to-mark-up-images-directly-report/articleshow/125950184.cms,"Pro version available immediately to users and developers.

Day-one integration into Google Search, YouTube, and other apps.

Backed by Google’s full-stack advantage — from research and TPU chips to cloud hosting and consumer-facing platforms.





Google is reportedly testing a new feature that will allow users to mark up images directly inside the Gemini app and on the web. According to a report by Android Authority, the feature, first spotted in earlier code leaks, now appears to be active for some users. The feature, the report says, is visible in both the Gemini mobile app and the desktop version accessed through Chrome. When users attach an image in the Gemini app on Android, a notification appears informing them about the new capability.The tool lets users draw or highlight specific areas on an image before sending it to Gemini. This makes it easier for the AI to understand which part of the image the user is referring to when asking a question or giving instructions. The feature also supports simple edits based on user input.Screenshots shared by testers show that Gemini responds accurately when users mark a certain region of an image, helping the AI analyse or modify only that selected portion.Google has not officially announced the rollout, and it is unclear when the feature will be available to all users.In a related news, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model as “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.”Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations. However, the real disruption lies in its distribution strategy:This end-to-end control means Google can scale Gemini faster and more efficiently than rivals who rely on external partnerships.","Google is reportedly testing a new feature that will allow users to mark up images directly inside the Gemini app and on the web.

Dr. Fei-Fei Li, the renowned Stanford professor and CEO of AI startup World Labs, has said that traditional college degrees are becoming less important in Silicon Valley hiring as companies like hers are more interested in a candidate’s practical experience and relationship with AI tools. Widely known as the “Godmother of AI” for her foundational work in computer vision, Li believes the availability of AI tools is shifting the value proposition of formal education in the labor market.In an interview on The Tim Ferriss Show this week, Li explained her talent search process for her startup:“When we interview a software engineer, I personally feel the degree they have matters less to us now,” Li said, as per a report by Fortune.“Now, it’s more about what have you learned, what tools do you use, how quickly can you superpower yourself in using these tools—and a lot of these are AI tools. What’s your mindset toward using these tools matter more to me,” she added.Li’s perspective on prioritising practical AI fluency over academic credentials aligns with the views of other major tech leaders such as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. The Meta CEO stated in October that skills often outweigh a traditional college degree when hiring, although entry-level roles still typically require a bachelor's.Similarly, Palantir CEO Alex Karp challenged the value of a traditional degree by launching a four-year paid internship program for young entrepreneurs not enrolled in college.For her own firm, Li stated she would not hire software engineers who fail to “embrace AI collaborative software tools”, clarifying that this requirement is not due to a belief in AI's perfection, but because it demonstrates a candidate’s ability to grow with fast-moving technology and use AI to their personal advantage.","Dr. Fei-Fei Li, the renowned Stanford professor and CEO of AI startup World Labs, has said that traditional college degrees are becoming less important in Silicon Valley hiring.

Blackwell chips could flip AI economics by 2026





Tesla CEO Elon Musk has raised an alarm over what he calls on impending “all-out war” in artificial intelligence hardware. Musk pointed to Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chips as the catalyst for a seismic shift in the industry. This warning from Musk came after investor Gavin Baker discussed that the increasing completion between major AI infrastructure players on the Invest Like the Best podcast. Bake talked about how Nvidia’s Blackwell platform can reshare the economics of AI once fully deployed. Responding to the same on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk wrote, “AI is the highest ELO battle ever. Speed of deployment of hardware, especially robotics, is the [linchpin].”For the unwary, the Elo rating system was originally designed for chess and it is now widely used to rank the performance in esports, sports and even in large language models, underscoring Musk’s view of AI as a high-stakes contest of speed and capability.Baker further explained that Nvidia’s transition from Hopper to Blackwell chips was “by far the most complex product transition we’ve ever gone through in technology,” citing challenges like higher power usage, liquid cooling, heavier racks, and heat management.All these delays temporarily gave an advantage to Google as it became the lowest-cost producer of AI ‘tokens’ aggressively cutting prices and squeezing competitors. Baker described Google’s strategy as rational but warned it was “sucking the economic oxygen out of the AI ecosystem.”Backer further explained that the first major AI models trained on Blackwell chips are said to come in early 2026, with Musk’s xAI potentially among the first to deploy them at scale. The newer GB300 systems are designed to be “drop-in compatible,” which could make Nvidia-powered AI systems the lowest-cost option in the future.This shift could force Google to abandon its current low-cost strategy, potentially pressuring its margins and stock performance. Baker warned that sustaining large losses would be “painful” and could reshape competitive behaviour across the AI industry.Adding to the intensifying battle, Meta Platforms is reportedly in talks to purchase Google’s tensor processing units (TPUs) for its data centers by 2026, with broader deployment planned for 2027. Nvidia, meanwhile, praised Google’s progress but asserted it remains “a generation ahead” of rivals.Musk’s warning underscores the hardware-centric nature of the AI race, where speed, scale, and cost efficiency will determine winners.

Job cuts threat looms as Disney pushes for AI







Following its recent billion-dollar investment and licensing partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Disney is reportedly expanding its internal artificial intelligence (AI) toolkit, providing employees with custom and commercial AI software to boost productivity. Citing several Disney staffers, a report by Business Insider says that the move is a shift in the company’s technology strategy. Staffers claimed that the company seemed “hesitant to rely on AI tools” as recently as this past summer.“They clearly see where things are headed,” one longtime Disney software engineer was quoted as saying.The report noted that Disney has made several AI tools available to its employees:Staffers have access to platforms like Microsoft Copilot and Amazon's Q Developer. The company also announced that the recent OpenAI deal will soon give employees access to the enterprise version of ChatGPT.As per 4 staffers, there is an internal chatbot, “DisneyGPT,” which assists with internal requests, including creating IT support tickets, analyzing project financials, and viewing the company roster. This chatbot is said to incorporate signature company themes, greeting users with a prompt about being “ready for an enchanting adventure” and includes a verified collection of Walt Disney quotes tagged by themes like “imagination” and “leadership”.Disney is also said to be developing a highly advanced AI chatbot codenamed “Jarvis” – named after the personal assistant from Iron Man franchise. It is an agentic AI tool which is said to be a more advanced system than DisneyGPT and would be capable of completing complex tasks on an employee’s behalf, the report said, citing a source who also noted that the Jarvis project is still in its early, ""not fully baked"" stages.As the company pushes for AI, the acceleration has reportedly created friction among some employees, with three of eight staffers expressing concerns about AI potentially replacing humans and threatening job security.“If you use AI everywhere, it's going to be counterproductive,” the staffer said, adding that AI can make mistakes, lacks the “personalised touch” that people provide, and tasks still require human creativity.",Disney is reportedly expanding its internal artificial intelligence (AI) toolkit.

Nvidia may be facing problem selling clients enterprise software and the reason is as internal emails reveal ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-may-be-facing-problem-selling-clients-enterprise-software-and-the-reason-is-as-internal-emails-reveal-/articleshow/125943805.cms,"Data security concerns and legal complications slow negotiations

Software push critical for recurring revenue beyond GPU sales





Nvidia is encountering significant hurdles in its enterprise software sales, with internal emails exposing a ""fundamental disconnect"" between the chip giant and major clients' legal and procurement teams, particularly in highly regulated industries like finance and healthcare, according to Business Insider.The emails from senior sales employees reveal that account managers are struggling to craft a unified message around Nvidia AI Enterprise (NVAIE) and related software products. One email stated teams are ""hacking their own decks together"" without a cohesive company-wide approach, highlighting organizational challenges as the $4 trillion company expands beyond its core hardware business.Business Insider reports that August emails identified specific pain points, including the need to educate clients' procurement and legal teams on what Nvidia's AI Enterprise software ""is/isn't."" Data security requirements and indemnity obligations—Nvidia's legal responsibility if clients face lawsuits—have become major sticking points. Additionally, some clients request higher damages caps than Nvidia finds acceptable, complicating deal closures.Despite these obstacles, Nvidia's software sales projections remain optimistic. An internal July chart showed standalone software hitting 110% of sales targets for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 in North and Latin America, with overall software forecasts reaching $78.7 million for the quarter, driven primarily by NVAIE at 186% of target.While Nvidia doesn't break out software revenues separately—with GPUs remaining its primary business—the software division represents a strategic priority for generating recurring revenue and deepening customer dependence across its product ecosystem. NVAIE, launched in 2021, serves clients including Nasdaq, the IRS, and AT&T, offering tools for building custom AI applications.Nvidia declined to comment on the internal communications. The company's challenges mirror broader industry trends, with a recent Goldman Sachs report noting uneven AI adoption as some organizations view the technology as premature for widespread deployment. Nvidia's experience underscores the complexity of translating hardware dominance into software success within heavily regulated sectors.","Internal Nvidia emails reveal ""fundamental disconnect"" between legal and procurement teams.

"Intel may again face 'Chinese problem', and tough one",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-may-again-face-chinese-problem-and-tough-one/articleshow/125942315.cms,"Intel is reportedly testing chipmaking equipment from ACM Research, a US firm with units previously targeted by US sanctions over alleged ties to China's military. This move, involving tools for Intel's critical 14A process, raises national security questions, especially as Intel is partially US government-owned. ACM denies wrongdoing, stating its US operations are separate.

Why this may be a problem for Intel

“specific customer engagements,”

“ACMR's US team has sold and delivered multiple tools from our Asian operations to domestic customers.”

“major US-based semiconductor manufacturer,”

“We are making important strides in our global expansion efforts, with several tool deliveries planned to the US during the third quarter.”

“bifurcated and isolated”





Intel is reportedly testing crucial chipmaking equipment from a company with close ties to China. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Intel tested chipmaking tools from a company in 2025 that owns two overseas units that were targeted by US sanctions. The report cited two sources with direct knowledge of the matter to claim that the tools Intel tested were acquired from ACM Research, a US-based manufacturer of chipmaking tools.In 2024, two ACM units in Shanghai and South Korea were blocked from obtaining US technology because they were accused of supporting China with commercial technology for military purposes and of making advanced chips or chip-making tools. However, ACM has denied these claims.Reuters couldn't confirm whether Intel had decided to use the tools in its advanced chip-making process. The agency doesn’t even have any proof on the company broke any US regulations.The two wet-etch tools used to remove material from silicon wafers during the semiconductor manufacturing process were assessed for compatibility with Intel’s critically important 14A manufacturing process, scheduled to roll out in 2027.Intel is now partially owned by the US government. The fact that the company would consider using tools made by a company with sanctioned units in its most advanced manufacturing facilities has raised national security questions.This 14A chip manufacturing process, is seen as Intel’s make-or-break effort in the foundry business. Earlier, the company suggested it may delay or even cancel the 14A node if it fails to secure at least one large external customer.Adding to the complexity, Walden International, a venture capital firm founded and chaired by Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan, invested in ACM Research in 2019.However, ACM told Reuters that it couldn't discussbut confirmed thatThe company also said it has shipped three tools to awhich are being tested and some of which have passed performance tests.Also, in its Q2 2025 earnings results from August, the company wrote:ACM also told Reuters it does not present a national security risk. The company explained that its US operations arefrom the sanctioned Shanghai unit.The company added that US customers are served directly by American staff with strong protections in place to safeguard customer trade secrets.Etch systems remove materials from silicon wafers in chip manufacturing. Wet etch uses liquid chemicals for selective cleaning but removes material in all directions, potentially widening features. Dry etch uses ionised gases for precise, directional removal but is more complex. Modern chipmaking factories use both methods. Other companies producing these tools include Applied Materials, KLA, Lam Research, and Tokyo Electron.Tools from ACM and Chinese competitors are 20% to 30% cheaper than those from rivals like Applied Materials and Lam, according to Dan Hutcheson, Vice Chair of TechInsights Inc. This creates downward price pressure on established competitors.Testing equipment from different suppliers is standard practice for all chipmakers but Intel's consideration of ACM Research equipment raises concerns due to the company's connections to sanctioned Chinese operations.","Intel tested chipmaking tools from a company that owns two overseas units that were targeted by US sanctions over alleged ties to China's military.

Major GCCs in Pune





For decades, Pune has been known as a city shaped by academia, industry, and engineering. Its economic base was first anchored by automotive majors such as Tata Motors, Bajaj Auto and Mercedes-Benz India, which in turn built a large ecosystem of component makers and engineering design talent. Other large manufacturing units grew through industrial groups such as Bharat Forge, Kirloskar and Thermax, which further strengthened the city’s engineering capabilities. Establishments like Defence Research and Development Organisation, College of Military Engineering, and High Energy Materials Research Laboratory created a skilled pool in electronics, materials science, and precision systems.says Niket Karajagi, who is doing a doctorate in enterprise resilience at the Savitribai Phule Pune University.Estimates by GCC consultancy Zinnov finds that about 21% of India’s GCCs have their presence in Pune, employing nearly 12% of the country’s GCC talent across engineering R&D (42%), IT (25%), and BPM (33%). A host of global engineering companies, financial institutions and others have their GCCs in the city.Sameer Jain, executive VP at technology consulting firm Intraedge, says all the GCCs he was part of used Pune’s talent to design, prototype, build, test, and release highly innovative products in technology and engineering.Piyush Kedia, co-founder & CEO of GCC consultancy InCommon, says when a bank or mobility firm sets up in Pune, it finds engineers who already understand safety, precision, and scale –Rashmi Rawat, head of talent offerings & insights at GCC consultancy GatewAI, says the defining feature of Pune’s GCC ecosystem is simple:That product thinking is reflected across GCCs. Raja Jamalamadaka, MD of Roche Digital Centre of Excellence India, recently told us that their Pune centre is at the core of the future of healthcare for the Swiss pharma giant. The centre is focusing on leveraging technology, especially AI/ML, to predict disease, identify patients at risk, diagnose disease early and improve chronic disease management.Pascal Daloz, CEO of Dassault Systemes, the France-based provider of 3D virtual environment software used to design just about everything, recently told us that their Pune centre is their largest development centre in the world. The CEO of the company’s India solutions lab, Sudarshan Mogasale, said what the world will see in engineering three or six years from now is what is being built today in India. “From embedding AI in design tools to building virtual cities and digital factories, our teams are transforming how products are imagined and built,” he said.Sudish Lambodara Panicker, MD and head of BNY India, which has a large GCC in Pune, told us the GCC is working with data and algorithms to help shape the future of the American financial services giant, understand what its future markets and products should be.Rashmi Rawat says solutions originating from Pune include AI-based optimisation engines that scaled across multiple global business units, industrial IoT platforms that moved from proof-of-concept to enterprise-wide deployments, and cloud-native data or streaming platforms that became reference architectures within their organisations.Sachin Kulkarni, president of global services at US financial technology firm Fiserv, and whose Pune centre began in 2007, says Maharashtra is home to hundreds of engineering colleges that offer a rich talent pool for roles and skills the centre focuses on, including product development, data science, automation, full-stack developers, cloud computing, cybersecurity, AI/ML, Java, and more.Divesh Agarwal, founder & CEO of offshore solutions firm Aumni, says their global clients prioritise system safety, operational efficiency, and fault tolerance, “and Pune excels in high-stakes domains like financial engineering, core banking, and cyber automotive.”As more and more GCCs enter Pune, some are getting worried about the growth beginning to outpace its infrastructure. The biggest concern is poor international connectivity. The absence of a full-fledged international airport means most international travel is via Mumbai, which adds 4-6 hours to every global trip. “This affects leadership visibility and makes it harder to attract global talent,"" says Kailash Maisekar, country director for India at software solutions firm Idox Group.Pune’s industrial backbone – auto, defence, and manufacturing – trained an entire generation of engineers to think in systems, not slides. The same discipline that once designed engines now designs digital platforms, SDV (software defined vehicle) software, and AI-driven control systems.Pune’s product-thinking culture is what sets it apart. Pune engineers think in systems, not just code, emphasising how legacy strengths from auto and industrial sectors directly support modern domains like digital twins, industrial IoT, predictive analytics, and platform optimisation workstreams.BFSI GCCs are increasingly favouring Pune due to lower real estate costs, campus scalability, and access to finance-tech talent. While Mumbai remains the front office for financial institutions, Pune is fast becoming the engine room for their global operations, analytics, and digital transformation work.The co-existence of engineering and technology talent in Pune has led to an explosion of GCC setups that are pivoted around product and engineering innovation, particularly in areas such as automation, Industry 4.0, AI, and smart factory.Around 21% of India’s GCCs are based in Pune, employing nearly 12% of the country’s GCC workforce across engineering R&D, IT, and BPM functions. The city’s rising focus areas – agentic and physical AI, platform modernisation, and digital twins – align with global technology priorities and reflect Pune’s position as an innovation-led engineering hub.Pune airport is already operating near saturation, and that directly affects one-stop international routings, cargo capacity and even slot availability for global leadership travel. That is why Purandar, the Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje International Airport, is absolutely critical for the region. If we accelerate Purandar, we can meaningfully upgrade Pune’s global connectivity and give our GCC ecosystem the cargo and international access it urgently needs.Pune’s GCCs are uniquely positioned to bridge IT and OT (operational technology) capabilities at scale.Pune GCCs have delivered global product modules, risk and analytics platforms for banking clients, automotive control and telematics software, and full-stack SaaS modules for their parent companies.BNY Mellon, HSBC, Barclays, Vodafone, Deutsche Bank, Mastercard, Cummins, Dassault Systemes, UBS, ZS Associates, Citibank, Siemens PLM, Skoda, Credit Suisse, Maersk, Roche","Pune has been known as a city shaped by academia, industry, and engineering.

Leaving the sinking island





The first climate migrants arrived in Australia this week. These migrants arrive in Australia as Tuvalu could become the first country to disappear as a result of climate change. Rising sea levels are gradually inundating this Pacific archipelago, prompting many of its residents to leave their homes behind. As part of 'first of its kind' bilateral treaty, Australia signed with Tuvalu, Australia reportedly welcomed the first wave of climate migrants from this sinking nation. In 2023, Australia announced that it would launch these visas as part of a bilateral treaty it signed with Tuvalu. The treaty between Australia and Tuvalu is the world’s first to create a special visa in response to climate change.Upon their arrival, migrants reportedly receive immediate access to education, Medicare, the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), the family tax benefit, a childcare subsidy, and a youth allowance. Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong said that the climate migrants would contribute to Australian society.The visa offered ""mobility with dignity, by providing Tuvaluans the opportunity to live, study and work in Australia as climate impacts worsen"", Wong said in a statement to Reuters.More than 3,000 of Tuvalu’s 11,000 residents applied for the visas after they became available in June. However, Australia has capped the intake at 280 visas per year annually to prevent a brain drain in the small island nation. Tuvalu, one of the countries at greatest risk from climate change because of rising sea levels, is a group of low-lying atolls scattered across the Pacific between Australia and Hawaii.Tuvalu prime minister Feleti Teo urged those leaving to keep cultural ties. PM Teo reportedly visited the Tuvaluan community in Melton, Melbourne, last month to emphasise the importance of maintaining strong ties and cultural bonds across borders as citizens migrate, Tuvalu officials said.Thousands of applications for Australia’s climate-migration visas show how many Tuvaluans feel they have no choice but to leave their land. This first wave of migrants out of Tuvalu is only the beginning, say analysts, as the future looks bleak for the sinking island.The nine low-lying coral atolls of Tuvalu are under severe threat of climate change, with the occurrence of rising sea levels due to global warming and melting ice caps. During the last century, a rise in 0.2 meters was reported. Rising sea levels are already started causing frequent floods, killing crops, contaminating freshwater, destroying infrastructure, and swallowing Tuvalu’s habitable land.","The first climate migrants arrived in Australia this week.

Nvidia plans increasing H200 chip production due to high demand from China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-plans-increasing-h200-chip-production-due-to-high-demand-from-china/articleshow/125937513.cms,"Nvidia H200 AI chip sees high demand from Chinese tech giants



China doesn’t want Nvidia chips







Nvidia is reportedly evaluating plans to increase production capacity for its H200 artificial intelligence (AI) chips after the company received orders from Chinese clients that exceeded current output levels. The move follows President Donald Trump’s announcement this week that the US will allow the export of the H200to China, provided the US government collects a 25% fee on each sale.Citing industry sources, news agency Reuters said that demand is so robust that Nvidia is leaning toward adding new capacity to satisfy the market. Chinese firms, including Alibaba and ByteDance, have already reached out to Nvidia this week expressing interest in placing large-scale orders.The H200, which went into mass deployment last year, is the fastest chip in Nvidia’s Hopper generation and is Nvidia’s second-fastest AI processor. It is manufactured by TSMC using its advanced 4nm process technology.Despite the US approval, the Chinese government has not yet given a green light to the purchases. Reports said that Chinese officials held emergency meetings to discuss whether the influx of H200 chips might hamper the growth of the domestic AI chip industry.To protect local manufacturers, one proposal under discussion would require Chinese companies to bundle H200 purchases with a specific ratio of domestically produced chips, reports claimed.Increasing H200 output presents a logistical challenge for Nvidia because very limited quantities are in production as the company has shifted its primary focus to its newest Blackwell architecture and the upcoming Rubin line.Furthermore, Nvidia must compete with other tech giants, such as Alphabet's Google, for limited advanced manufacturing capacity at TSMC.","N Nvidia is reportedly evaluating plans to increase production capacity for its H200 artificial intelligence (AI) chips.

Microsoft's report says that it analysed 37.5 million anonymized conversations which showed that Copilot is functioning as a “trusted advisor,” with people asking the chatbot about health to late-night philosophical debates related to religion and philosophy.According to the MAI report, health-related topics were the most dominant category across the entire year, specifically when users accessed Copilot on their mobile devices. The data suggests users consistently rely on Copilot for tracking wellness, searching for health tips and managing daily routines.Highlighting data from August, the usage report showed an overlap between two distinct interests: programming and gaming. Users were equally likely to engage in coding projects as they were to explore games. However, this engagement was split across the calendar: users tended to code during the week and play games during the weekends.Copilot AI usage on Valentine’s Day topics increased during February as the month witnessed a significant spike in activity because users relied on Copilot for help navigating a major calendar event. The queries were concentrated around preparing for Valentine’s Day and seeking support regarding relationships.Searches related to “Religion and Philosophy” notably rose during the early hours of the morning, indicating users often turn to the AI for bigger, late-night questions. On the contrary, travel conversations peaked most often during commuting hours.Copilot saw a clear rise in users seeking advice, particularly on personal topics. This trend includes users seeking guidance on navigating relationships and making life decisions.","Microsoft's AI division (MAI) has released an analysis of how people used its AI chatbot, Copilot, in 2025.

What Microsoft said about its liquid cooling system for GPUs

""Microsoft's liquid cooling heat exchanger unit is a closed-loop system that we deploy in existing air-cooled data centres to enhance cooling capacity on first and third-party platforms.

These systems ensure we maximise our existing global data centre footprint for scale while promoting efficient heat dissipation and optimising power delivery to meet the demands of AI and hyperscale systems.”

""address some of the public concerns with water consumption, because water is something people can really see,""

“These companies are profit-driven; they weigh in the water cost, the energy cost, and also the publicity cost,”

""carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste""

""We've also announced a zero water cooling design for our next-generation data centres and breakthroughs in on-chip cooling,""

What the Nvidia employee said about Blackwell installation

“On-site support for this activity was a necessity. Many hours were spent creating the validation process documentation as well as vetting the steps worked and made sense to those less familiar with how cluster and system validation are usually performed,”

The employee, who is a part of the Nvidia Infrastructure Specialists (NVIS) team, sent the memo to describe a Blackwell installation intended for OpenAI, which Microsoft supports as its cloud partner.According to Shaolei Ren, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, even though servers use liquid cooling, data centres still rely on a second, building-wide system to remove heat from the facility. Ren, who researches data centre resource use, said the Nvidia employee was likely referring to a building-level cooling system that uses air instead of water.he highlighted. A Microsoft spokesperson’s explanation of the company’s cooling system also aligned with Ren’s two-step description.In a statement to Business Insider, a Microsoft spokesperson said:As AI infrastructure grows, the energy and water demands of data-centre cooling have become major points of debate worldwide, leading to resistance in some areas where new centres are planned.Ren explained that data centres may rely on air cooling, water cooling, or a hybrid approach at the building level, and thatbetween the resources used.Air cooling consumes more energy, but canRen noted.Ren added.Meanwhile, Microsoft said that it aims to beby 2030.the company’s spokesperson said.The setup in question involves two GB200 NVL72 racks, each containing 72 Nvidia GPUs, utilising Microsoft’s liquid-cooling technology to manage the intense heat generated by the closely packed chips that power surging demand for AI model training and operation.The internal email from the Nvidia staffer outlined several logistical issues that arose during the Blackwell installation earlier this year, noting that such challenges are common when rolling out new data centre hardware.the Nvidia employee wrote.The employee also noted that the handover procedures between Nvidia and MicrosoftDespite these hurdles, the memo indicated that the quality of Blackwell’s production hardware had improved over earlier test units.According to the email, the GB200 NVL72 production hardwarecompared to the previously sent qualified samples, and both racks achieved a 100% pass rate on specific compute performance tests.In a statement to Business Insider, an Nvidia spokesperson said that its Blackwell systemsthe Nvidia spokesperson added.Nvidia introduced its latest Blackwell GPUs in 2024.

Australia’s teen social media ban: What Reddit wants









Reddit, the popular community-focused forum, has filed a legal challenge against Australia's new social media ban for teenagers under 16, arguing that the law is “ineffective” and violates freedom of political communication. The law came into effect on Wednesday (December 10) and targets ten major services, including Meta's Instagram, Google’s sister company YouTube, ByteDance’s TikTok, Snapchat, Elon Musk’s X and Reddit.In its application to Australia's High Court, Reddit contends that the law is “invalid on the basis of the implied freedom of political communication,” arguing that it “burdens political communication”, according to a report by news agency Reuters. The company further claims that the political views of children inform the electoral choices of many current electors, including parents and teachers.Reddit said that while it agrees with the importance of protecting minors, the law could isolate teens “from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences (including political discussions)”.In its legal application, Reddit wants the highest court of the country to either declare the law invalid or to exclude the platform from the provisions entirely.The platform argued that it should not be subject to the law because it operates more as a forum for adults facilitating “knowledge sharing” than as a traditional social network.Reddit further emphasised its operational differences, highlighting that it does not import contact lists or address books, and that it is “significantly different from other sites that allow for users to become ‘friends’ with one another, or to post photos about themselves, or to organise events”.Reddit argued that the law is counterproductive for safety, stating that a person under 16 “can be more easily protected from online harm if they have an account, being the very thing that is prohibited”. Having an account allows the use of settings that limit access to potentially harmful content.",Reddit has filed a legal challenge against Australia's new social media ban for teenagers under 16.

Senator warns: Trump is selling 'US National Security' with Nvidia chip sales to China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/senator-warns-trump-is-selling-us-national-security-with-nvidia-chip-sales-to-china/articleshow/125935100.cms,"Nvidia defends decision to sell H200 chips to China



Senator Warren says selling Nvidia H200 to China is threat to US







Days after President Donald Trump announced a decision to allow Nvidia to sell its advanced H200 artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China and receive a 25% cut of the revenues, Senator Elizabeth Warren has said that the move constitutes selling out “American national security”. She reiterated that both Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick must testify before Congress regarding the agreement.While speaking on the Senate floor, Senator Warren urged Congress to pass bipartisan legislation that “reins in this administration” by imposing new chip export restrictions. Critics of the bill, however, say it could undermine US chipmakers’ competitiveness.In response to Senator Warren's criticism, an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC that the H200 sales to China would still require a US government license, while emphasising that the total volume of sales “at most will be a smaller percentage of the Hopper and Blackwell compute already sold to US customers"".“We heard the same arguments about the H20, and the administration’s critics had it backwards,” the spokesperson said. Nvidia argued that blocking the sale of the H20 was detrimental: “Selling H20 was good for America’s economic and national security. After H20 shipments were blocked, America lost billions, and foreign AI chip firms stepped into the gap and grew dramatically”.Senator Warren countered by arguing that the administration knows that granting China access to these previously restricted chips “poses a serious threat to our technological leadership and national security”. She suggested that the decision was financially motivated“So why did the president make this bad deal that sells out the American economy and sells out American national security? It’s simple: In the Trump administration, money talks,” she said. She even pointed to CEO Huang's attendance at a $1 million-per-plate dinner at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home and Nvidia’s subsequent donations to the President’s White House ballroom.","Senator Warren says selling Nvidia H200 to China is threat to US national security.

Speaking at a TIME event, Mohan stated YouTube's focus remains on building a stage for creatives, not programming a service or engaging in industry consolidation battles.

YouTube's creator-first strategy stands apart from Hollywood consolidation wave

CEO says the YouTube is different from all the other streaming platforms





YouTube CEO Neal Mohan downplayed competition from Netflix and other streaming giants during a TIME magazine event this week, stating his company remains laser-focused on empowering content creators rather than monitoring rival platforms.Speaking at the ""A Year in TIME"" panel discussion where he was honored as TIME's CEO of the Year for 2025, Mohan responded to questions about industry consolidation with characteristic restraint. When asked about Paramount CEO David Ellison's suggestion that his proposed Warner Bros. acquisition would make the company competitive with YouTube , Mohan deflected.""When we go to work at YouTube and you walk the halls of YouTube, you don't really think in terms of who other streaming platforms are,"" Mohan said. ""We really think—you will hear the term 'creator' or 'creative person' a hundred times per day in every single one of our meetings. And that's really the only thing we think about.""Mohan's comments come amid massive upheaval in the streaming industry. Netflix recently struck an $82.7 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros., including HBO, HBO Max, and valuable intellectual property franchises. Days later, Paramount launched a hostile $108.4 billion counterbid for the entertainment giant.The YouTube chief emphasized his platform's fundamentally different approach to content. ""Our job is not to program the streaming service that delivers,"" he explained. ""Our job is actually to build the stage on which amazing creators do what they do every single day.""Over the past 20 years, Google-owned YouTube has become the undisputed most-watched video platform in the world, serving as the preferred starting point for countless self-made influencers, podcasters, commentators and entrepreneurs.Mohan noted that most YouTube employees are technologists whose mission centers on connecting creative talent with worldwide audiences rather than competing directly with traditional media companies.His remarks suggest YouTube views itself in a category distinct from the consolidating streaming services, positioning the platform as infrastructure for independent creators rather than a traditional content distributor locked in competition with Netflix, Disney, or the newly merged entertainment entities.",YouTube CEO Neal Mohan downplayed competition from Netflix and other streaming giants during a TIME magazine event this week.

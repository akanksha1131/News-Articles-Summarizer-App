Paint gets a generative AI boost

Notepad gets AI for rewriting

Microsoft is bringing artificial intelligence (AI) prowess to nearly 40-year-old products: Paint and Notepad. The company has announced new AI experiences for Paint and Notepad to Windows Insiders in the Canary and Dev Channels on Windows 11, aimed at enhancing creativity and productivity.Paint is receiving two major AI-powered additions: Generative Fill and Generative EraseGenerative Fill will allow users to add or modify elements within an image simply by describing what they want using text prompts. By selecting an area and providing a description, users can generate new content that blends with the existing image style.For example, users can ask the AI to make a mediaeval castle in the selected area of Windows XP wallpaper, and it will create one. This feature is initially available on Snapdragon-powered Copilot+ PCs.Generative Erase will enable users to remove unwanted objects from an image. By selecting the object to be erased, the AI intelligently fills in the surrounding area, making it look like the object was never there. This feature is available to all Windows 11 users.In addition to these new features, Microsoft is also improving the performance and expanding the availability of existing AI capabilities in Paint, such as Cocreator and Image Creator.Notepad, the simple text editor, is also getting a significant AI upgrade. The Rewrite feature will allow users to rephrase sentences, adjust the tone and even modify the length of their text using AI. By selecting the text they want to rewrite, users can generate multiple variations and choose the one that best suits their needs. This feature is available in preview to all Windows 11 users in select regions.“We have also continued to improve Notepad launch performance. With this update, most users will see app launch time improve by more than 35%, with some users seeing improvements of 55% or more,” the company said.","Paint is receiving two major AI-powered additions: Generative Fill and Generative Erase.

"Roblox, the gaming company ‘charged’ by Hindenburg Research, is bringing these two updates",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/roblox-the-gaming-company-charged-by-hindenburg-research-is-bringing-these-two-updates/articleshow/115063348.cms,"Two changes that Roblox is bringing to protect minors

Roblox , the popular online gaming platform that has faced scrutiny over allegations of misleading investors and concerns about children's exposure to inappropriate content, is implementing changes to address these issues.In a post on Roblox developers forum, the company has announced that it is “updating experience guideline policies to keep our younger users safe.” A report by Hindenburg Research in October highlighted the presence of sexually explicit content within the platform, raising concerns about child safety.Roblox has denied the charges.Roblox said that it is bringing two changes on the platform: Unrated experiences non-accessible and restricting access to social hangouts to users under 13.By default, users under the age of 13 will not be able to play, search, and discover unrated experiences. This will ensure that parents and users have more clarity into the types of content available on Roblox and will help them make more informed choices about what they want to play.We will be restricting access to Social Hangouts and Free-form User Creation experiences to users ages 13+.This means that starting December 3, Roblox will require creators to complete a questionnaire for each experience they wish to make available to users under 13. This questionnaire will help ensure that all experiences accessible to young users are age-appropriate and meet Roblox's community standards.As a result of this change, any unrated experiences will be hidden from search results and recommendations for users under 13. These users will still be able to access these experiences via direct link, but they will no longer be easily discoverable.The second big change is restricting social hangouts and free-form user creation for users under 13. Starting November 18, experiences featuring social hangouts and free-form 2D user creation will only be available to users 13 and older.This restriction applies to experiences where the primary purpose is socialising and communicating with other users, such as “vibe games” and virtual clubs.","Roblox is bringing two changes on the platform: Unrated experiences non- accessible and restricting access to social hangouts to users under 13.

"Nissan to cut 9,000 jobs globally after net income drops by 94%; CEO accepts these 'big problems'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nissan-to-cut-9000-jobs-globally-after-net-income-drops-by-94-ceo-accepts-these-big-problems/articleshow/115063814.cms,"What is hurting Nissan big time

Nissan CEO: We cannot deny ...

Japan's third-largest auto company Nissan Motor Corp. has announced a drastic overhaul of its global operations, aiming to regain lost ground in the rapidly evolving electric and hybrid vehicle markets. The Japanese automaker will eliminate 9,000 jobs and reduce production capacity by 20%. CEO Makoto Uchida will also take a 50% pay cut.The restructuring cost-cutting measures come after Nissan's net income plummeted 94% in the first half. Nissan will also sell off some of its stake in Mitsubishi Motors Corp after burning through ¥448.3 billion ($2.9 billion) in cash during the last six months. The company's operating income is down 70% from its previous forecast. Management also lowered their revenue outlook by more than 9%, meaning they now expect virtually no growth for the year.Nissan President and CEO Makoto Uchida said: “These turnaround measures do not imply that the company is shrinking. Nissan will restructure its business to become leaner and more resilient, while also reorganizing management to respond quickly and flexibly to changes in the business environment. We aim to enhance the competitiveness of our products, which are fundamental to our success, and set Nissan back on a path of growth. As a cohesive team, we are dedicated to working together to ensure the successful implementation of our plans.”The CEO reportedly told investors that Nissan has been affected “not only by external challenges, but also by our specific issues,” alluding both to the breakneck rise of Chinese automakers and Nissan setting overly ambitious sales targets.Like many traditional automakers, Nissan has struggled to adapt to shifting consumer preferences. In China, domestic brands like BYD have capitalized on the surge in EV demand, while in the U.S., hybrid vehicles are gaining popularity, favoring competitors like Toyota.Uchida acknowledged the company's missteps, stating, ""We cannot deny that our sales plan was overstretched."" To address these challenges, Nissan will invest in its EV lineup in China and expand its hybrid offerings in the U.S. The company also plans to leverage partnerships, such as its recent tie-up with Honda, to streamline production and reduce costs.With these aggressive measures, Nissan aims to secure a more competitive position in the global automotive market. However, the road ahead remains uncertain as the industry continues to undergo rapid transformation.","Nissan Motor Corp. has announced a drastic overhaul of its global operations.

4 Big reasons Indian IT sector is 'happy' with Donald Trump's return despite likely tougher H-1B visa and immigration laws,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/4-big-reasons-indian-it-sector-is-happy-with-donald-trumps-return-despite-tougher-h-1b-visa-and-immigration-laws/articleshow/115063633.cms,"So what is it that is pepping up the mood in favour of Indian IT companies?

Here are four likely factors



* Strong dollar:

* Stability in policymaking:

* Better tax policies for corporations:

* Alternative to China:

India's information technology (IT) sector is upbeat about President Donald Trump’s return to the Oval Office. The mood is high despite concerns over potential changes to US immigration laws. Immigration experts and analysts have warned that Trump may go stricter on H-1B and other immigration laws during his second tenure as the US President.Donald Trump's previous term saw an increase in salaries for H1B workers as well as visa fee. In this term, the Trump administration may reconsider the annual allotment of H1B work visas, currently capped at 85,000. H1B applications could face tougher scrutiny, as denial rates under the previous Trump administration reached an all-time high of 24%. The duration and eligibility for Optional Practical Training (OPT) for international students may also come under review.Despite these concerns, India’s IT companies celebrated the Republican victory as tech stocks led the rally on India’s benchmark stock indices. IT stocks appreciated sharply, fueling a rally in the benchmark indices after it became clear that Donald Trump will take over as the next US president for the second term. Shares of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) surged 4.21 per cent, Infosys jumped 4.02 per cent, Tech Mahindra soared 3.85 per cent, and HCL Technologies climbed 3.71 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Also, Persistent Systems zoomed 5.86 per cent, LTIMindtree jumped 4.75 percent, and Wipro advanced 3.75 per cent.IT companies expect easier finance policies around interest rates, inflation etc., which may help loosen IT budgets of US companies. A stronger dollar benefits the Indian outsourcing industry, as a majority of the IT services companies cater to the US as a key business market. Thereby, the industry derives a large part of their revenue in US currency though their operational costs are in Indian rupees.With Republicans controlling the government, Senate, and Congress, there is likely to be stability in policy making.Donald Trump's proposal to cut the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15% is likely to ease budgetary pressures and expand discretionary tech spending by US companies and thus benefiting Indian startups registered in the US as well as technology companies.Donald Trump's tough stance towards China means increased US fund flow to India. Trump is expected to play hardball with China, as seen during his last tenure. This will benefit Indian IT companies from a higher degree of fund flow. Advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductors may see more of US investments.",India's information technology (IT) sector is upbeat about President Donald Trump’s return to the Oval Office. The mood is high despite concerns over potential changes to US immigration laws.

Gurugram sprinkles artificial rain to combat air pollution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/gurugram-sprinkles-artificial-rain-to-combat-air-pollution/articleshow/115062838.cms,"A unique approach to combating air pollution was taken by the Resident Welfare Association (RWA) of DLF Primus Society in Sector 82, Gurugram. On Thursday, November 8, the RWA conducted "" artificial rain "" by spraying water from the fire lines of the society's 32-storey high-rise towers.Achal Yadav, the RWA President, told news agency ANI that this initiative is aimed at reducing air pollution in the area. ""We are ready to conduct artificial rain daily if the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Gurugram worsens,"" he said.The RWA has also implemented additional measures like carpooling to contribute to cleaner air. ""The government alone cannot solve this issue. Everyone needs to participate,"" Yadav added.Meanwhile, the Central government has introduced amendments to the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Rules of 2023 to address the problem of stubble burning. The new rules impose environmental compensation on farmers who engage in stubble burning.As per the notification released by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate change, the central government aims to impose new rules to deal with the stubble burning in Delhi and surrounding areas.Farmers with less than two acres of land will be charged Rs 5,000, those with two to five acres will pay Rs 10,000, and those with more than five acres will pay Rs 30,000. These measures are being implemented in response to the alarming rise in air pollution levels in Delhi and its surrounding areas, with the AQI frequently exceeding 400.","Resident Welfare Association (RWA) of DLF Primus Society in Sector 82, Gurugram sprayed water from the fire lines of the society's 32-storey high-rise towers.

Developed in collaboration with Axis Bank, GenWise UPI features an intuitive, simplified interface, emphasizing security measures such as geo-fencing, biometric authentication, and audio-based navigation—all tailored to help elders use digital payments comfortably and confidently.Despite UPI’s widespread adoption in India, with over 400 million active users and 16.5 billion transactions recorded in October alone, a significant portion of India’s 250 million seniors remain hesitant due to the complexity of most payment apps. However, with smartphone penetration at over 65% among seniors, GenWise UPI aims to tap into this segment and make digital payments accessible. The platform’s unique features include UPI Lite and Mobile Number Mapper, which allow elders to make transactions without sharing personal bank details or primary phone numbers, addressing their privacy concerns.Nalin Bansal, Chief of Fintechs and New Initiatives at NPCI, praised the initiative, calling it a step toward broader financial inclusion, while Sanjeev Moghe of Axis Bank highlighted the secure, reliable infrastructure underpinning GenWise’s UPI solution. GenWise founder Nehul Malhotra shared ambitious plans to reach 20 million Indian seniors in the next two years through nationwide awareness sessions, with the company also developing retirement and wealth management tools tailored to this demographic.This groundbreaking UPI launch by GenWise signals a new era of financial empowerment for India’s elders, offering them a secure, user-friendly digital payment experience.","GenWise, India’s leading app-based club for senior citizens, has launched an industry-first UPI payment solution.

For the first time in Indian television history, two influential power couples from the worlds of technology, business, and philanthropy will grace The Great Indian Kapil Show . This weekend’s much-anticipated episode will feature NR Narayana Murthy and Sudha Murty, the celebrated founders of Infosys and well-known philanthropists, alongside Zomato co-founder Deepinder Goyal and his wife, Mexican model Grecia Munoz (Gia Goyal). A recent teaser released by Netflix has already generated significant excitement, providing a glimpse into the candid, humorous, and heartwarming moments that await viewers. Hosted by comedian Kapil Sharma, the episode is set to showcase personal stories, cultural exchanges, and anecdotes from the lives of these remarkable personalities.In the teaser, NR Narayana Murthy, 78, reflects on his initial meeting with a young Sudha Murty, recalling the profound impact she had on him. Describing her as “a breath of fresh air,” Murthy shared his admiration for her intelligence, kindness, and dedication to social causes. Now married for 47 years, the couple has become one of India’s most respected duos, with Sudha Murty achieving acclaim as an author, Rajya Sabha member, and philanthropist.When Kapil Sharma humorously questioned whether their habits have grown similar over the years, Sudha Murty responded with her characteristic humor and honesty. “I became a workaholic like him and a stickler for time,” she shared, adding, “I cook so badly, but he never complains. Look at Murthy saab's weight — that's thanks to my cooking!” The playful exchange between the Murthys highlighted their mutual respect and understanding, as well as Sudha’s humility and humor about her culinary skills.The episode also introduces Deepinder Goyal, co-founder of Zomato, and his wife, Grecia Munoz, who he married earlier this year. Known for her vibrant personality and background in modeling, Grecia has embraced her role alongside Deepinder, even immersing herself in Zomato’s operations. During the show, Goyal shared an amusing story about how he and Grecia surprised Zomato customers by delivering orders themselves in Gurgaon. The reaction of customers, who were surprised and delighted by Grecia’s appearance at their doorsteps, quickly became the highlight of the conversation.“When Gia delivers the order, the customers can’t help but keep staring,” Goyal laughed, prompting a burst of laughter from the audience and Kapil Sharma. The couple’s chemistry and lighthearted attitude have made them popular among Zomato’s users and the public, with fans appreciating Grecia’s willingness to engage directly with Goyal’s business and her adaptation to Indian culture.This is not the first time Sudha Murty has appeared on Kapil Sharma’s platform. Last year, she joined The Kapil Sharma Show alongside filmmaker Guneet Monga and actress Raveena Tandon, where she shared personal anecdotes about her life and experiences. The audience was captivated by her wisdom and humility, as she recounted stories from her travels, including a memorable instance at an airport where she was labeled “cattle class” for wearing traditional attire. Sudha used humor to narrate her response, underscoring her pride in her cultural roots and her unshakeable confidence.In addition to her philanthropic and literary contributions, Sudha Murty’s previous appearance also revealed her admiration for Bollywood legends such as Shah Rukh Khan and Dilip Kumar, bridging the worlds of Indian cinema and literature.The teaser release has already stirred excitement among fans, who are eager to see the contrasting yet complementary dynamics of these two couples. While the Murthys are admired for their contributions to India’s technology and education sectors, Deepinder and Grecia have gained popularity as a young, modern couple who represent the global, interconnected nature of today’s India.Social media platforms have been abuzz with comments from viewers looking forward to the episode, with many expressing admiration for Sudha Murty’s humility and wit, and curiosity about Grecia’s adaptation to life in India. Fans also anticipate candid moments and stories from the lives of the Murthys and the Goyals, hoping for inspiring takeaways from both the established and next-generation leaders in India’s entrepreneurial landscape.","This weekend’s episode will feature NR Narayana Murthy and Sudha Murty, the celebrated founders of Infosys and well-known philanthropists.

Tech platforms to be given one year

Australia is planning to ban social media platforms like Facebook Instagram and TikTok for children below 16 years of age. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australia will move to pass new laws banning children under 16 from social media. Stating that the tech giants have failed to protect vulnerable users, Albanese said that platforms such as Facebook, TikTok and Instagram would be held responsible for enforcing the age ban.Stating that the platform may face potentially hefty fines for failing to enforce the ban, Albanese said “This one is for the mums and dads. Social media is doing real harm to kids and I'm calling time on it”.“I get things popping up on my system that I don't want to see. Let alone a vulnerable 14-year-old,” he said. “Young women see images of particular body shapes that have a real impact.”The Australian government first proposed a social media age limit earlier this year. The country plans to present new laws to state and territory leaders this week, before being introduced to parliament in late November.An AFP report says that the tech giants will be given a one-year grace period to figure out how they would implement the ban.",Australia is planning to ban social media platforms like Facebook Instagram and TikTok for children below 16 years of age.

Attorney General initiates health and privacy investigation

Vice President Teodoro Nguema calls for accountability

Public reaction and rising scrutiny

Also read

Equatorial Guinea’s Director General of the National Financial Investigation Agency (ANIF), Baltasar Ebang Engonga , is at the centre of a scandal following the leak of explicit videos allegedly involving him in intimate encounters with multiple individuals. Originally investigated for alleged fraud, Engonga now faces public backlash and intensified scrutiny over his professional conduct and personal life. This controversy has sparked widespread reaction on social media and raised questions regarding ethics, public responsibility, and potential health risks associated with his actions. As the scandal unfolds, government authorities have initiated an official investigation, underscoring the increasing call for accountability among public officials in Equatorial Guinea.The scandal began when investigators, initially looking into Engonga for suspected fraud, reportedly discovered over 400 videos on his computer depicting private interactions with various individuals. These encounters allegedly involved multiple partners, including his brother’s wife, a cousin, and a relative of the President. According to sources, the videos were filmed in locations such as Engonga’s office, hotels, and even restrooms, with all recorded interactions believed to be consensual.Once leaked, the videos rapidly circulated across social media, sparking outrage and debate among citizens. Public response to the videos has varied, with many questioning the ethical standards of a high-ranking public official engaging in such activities, while others raised concerns about the privacy breach that led to the leak. Posts across social platforms criticised the conduct of a figure responsible for financial investigations, with some users highlighting the discrepancy between his public role and personal actions.In response to the viral scandal, Equatorial Guinea’s Attorney General’s Office, led by Anatolio Nzang Nguema, launched an official investigation into the circumstances surrounding the video leak. According to a spokesperson, authorities are assessing whether Engonga’s actions may have posed health risks, which could result in additional charges if confirmed.“If proven, he could face charges for endangering public health,” the spokesperson commented, emphasising that the investigation will extend beyond the videos themselves to assess any potential impact on public health.This probe into health risks marks a significant expansion of the investigation, as the Attorney General’s office examines both the privacy concerns involved in the leak and the broader implications of Engonga’s behaviour on public welfare. The investigation is expected to review the conduct of government officials and enforce measures to maintain accountability.In a public statement, Vice President Teodoro Nguema took to X (formerly Twitter) to address the scandal, emphasising the need for accountability among public officials. Nguema noted that government offices must be strictly reserved for official duties, signalling disapproval of the misuse of government resources and office spaces for personal purposes.Nguema announced that the government would be implementing new, stricter policies to ensure that misconduct within the administration is met with serious disciplinary action. He further stated that officials found guilty of misusing their authority or resources could face termination or other consequences as deemed appropriate. This stance reflects a broader governmental shift towards enforcing ethical standards and reinforces the message that public officials will be held responsible for their actions, especially when it comes to misuse of office privileges.Engonga, a married man and father of six, holds a prominent position at ANIF, leading financial investigations and initiatives against corruption. However, his involvement in the leaked videos has placed his career and reputation under intense public scrutiny. The scandal has opened a wider debate on the expectations placed on public officials, with many citizens questioning whether private conduct should impact public responsibility and ethical standards.As public opinion continues to weigh in, some have called for Engonga’s resignation, while others argue that privacy should protect personal matters unless they directly impact professional duties. The case has ignited a conversation on the balance between privacy and public accountability, particularly when it comes to those in leadership roles within the government.","Equatorial Guinea’s Director General of the National Financial Investigation Agency, Baltasar Ebang Engonga, is at the centre of a scandal following the leak of explicit videos.

Tesla shares surged by over 13% as investors responded optimistically to the prospect of Trump’s leadership benefiting U.S.-based manufacturers and innovation-driven companies.Google CEO Sundar Pichai congratulated Trump, expressing commitment to working together on initiatives that promote innovation and support economic growth. Pichai’s remarks reflected Google’s focus on American technological leadership, an area that aligns with Trump’s pro-business policies.Similarly, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella offered his congratulations, writing, “We’re looking forward to collaborating with your administration to drive innovation that fosters growth and opportunity for the U.S. and the world.” Nadella highlighted Microsoft’s global outlook while emphasising a shared goal of technological progress.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also congratulated Trump and expressed hopes for the administration’s success. Altman underscored the importance of maintaining U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence, remarking that preserving democratic values in AI development is crucial.IBM CEO Arvind Krishna echoed this sentiment in a LinkedIn post, where he highlighted IBM’s commitment to advancing AI and quantum computing under Trump’s administration. Krishna’s message emphasised the potential for collaboration on technology that strengthens U.S. competitiveness globally.Other prominent tech leaders also shared their congratulations and voiced their readiness to work with the new administration:, posted a thoughtful message about unity in America following Trump’s win.

French and Dutch authorities raided Netflix offices in Paris and Amsterdam on Tuesday, November 5, as part of an investigation into alleged tax fraud and concealed employment, according to French judicial sources.The searches, conducted by France's National Financial Prosecutor's Office (PNF) and corruption investigators, stem from a preliminary investigation opened in November 2022 into suspected "" laundering of aggravated tax fraud "" and ""concealed work in an organised gang.""The raids follow scrutiny of Netflix's tax declarations between 2019 and 2020, when the company's reported French revenue appeared inconsistent with its subscriber base of approximately 7 million users. According to French media outlet La Lettre, Netflix Services France paid just €981,000 ($1.06 million) in corporate taxes for 2019-2020.Netflix's declared turnover in France increased dramatically after 2020, rising from €47.1 million ($51.3 million) to €1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) in 2022, suggesting the company may have previously used tax optimization strategies through its Dutch (Netherlands) subsidiary.The simultaneous searches at Netflix's European headquarters in Amsterdam were conducted through cooperation between French and Dutch authorities that has been ongoing for several months, officials said.This is not Netflix's first tax-related issue in Europe. In 2022, the streaming giant paid €55.8 million ($59.1 million) to settle a tax dispute with Italian authorities.Netflix, which opened its Paris office in 2020 and employs around 40 staff there, has not responded to requests for comment on the raids. The company produces several original series in France, including the hit show ""Emily in Paris.""A preliminary investigation in France does not necessarily lead to criminal charges or a trial.","French and Dutch authorities raided Netflix offices in Paris and Amsterdam on Tuesday, November 5.

Despite a record-high cash circulation, India's banks are reportedly increasingly phasing out ATMs and cash recyclers. According to a report in Economic Times, this shift is driven by the growing popularity of digital payments, particularly UPI, and a strategic focus on digital transformation.According to RBI data, the number of ATMs in India decreased from 219,000 in September 2023 to 215,000 in September 2024. This decline is primarily due to a significant reduction in off-site ATMs, which fell from a peak of 97,072 in September 2022 to 87,638 in September 2024.Ravi B Goyal, chairman of AGS Transact Technologies, told the publication, ""The recent trends in ATM deployment reflect a shifting focus in India's banking sector as it navigates the dynamic landscape of consolidation, digital transformation and expansion into underserved regions."" He added, ""In recent years, public sector bank consolidation has led to more optimised networks, blending physical and digital infrastructure.""While cash still plays a significant role in India's economy, accounting for 89% of transactions in FY22 and 12% of GDP, ATM penetration remains low with only 15 ATMs per 100,000 people. Factors such as RBI regulations on free ATM transactions, interoperability, and interchange fees have further discouraged ATM investments.Industry experts predict that India will adopt a global model of two ATMs per branch, one on-site and one off-site, as banks continue to balance physical and digital infrastructure to meet the evolving needs of their customers.","India's banks are reportedly phasing out ATMs and cash recyclers.

Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) has imposed a significant fine of €310 million on LinkedIn, the social networking platform for professionals, over violations of European data privacy regulations. The investigation focused on how LinkedIn processed users' personal data for targeted advertising and behavioural analysis, specifically regarding the lawfulness, transparency, and fairness of these practices under EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).This substantial fine underscores the EU's commitment to strict data protection standards and highlights ongoing scrutiny of digital platforms that handle large volumes of user data. The ruling, issued after a comprehensive inquiry, includes additional orders for LinkedIn to adjust its data processing practices to comply with GDPR requirements.The DPC, acting as the lead supervisory authority for LinkedIn within the EU, launched the investigation following a complaint from the French Data Protection Authority. As per reports, the inquiry examined LinkedIn's use of personal data for two primary purposes: behavioural analysis and targeted advertising. These practices, involving data from users who created profiles on LinkedIn, raised questions about the transparency and consent surrounding LinkedIn’s data handling.The complaint initiated a broader investigation by the DPC, which assessed whether LinkedIn’s approach to data processing aligned with GDPR’s stringent standards on user consent and data usage. According to GDPR regulations, personal data processing must adhere to strict rules ensuring that user consent is freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.The DPC’s decision, issued on October 22, was jointly signed by Data Protection Commissioners Dr. Des Hogan and Dale Sunderland. It concluded that LinkedIn’s data processing practices were not fully compliant with GDPR’s legal framework, particularly in terms of transparency and obtaining adequate user consent. The investigation found that LinkedIn's consent mechanism did not meet GDPR standards, as the consent obtained was neither “freely given” nor sufficiently informed, specific, or unambiguous.The DPC ruling includes several mandates:The decision, after its issuance in Ireland, was submitted to the European GDPR Cooperation Mechanism in July under Article 60 of GDPR, which allows other EU supervisory authorities to review and object to decisions. However, the DPC confirmed that no objections were raised by other EU/EEA supervisory bodies, indicating broad support for the ruling across the European regulatory landscape.Following the decision, Graham Doyle, Deputy Commissioner of the DPC, commented on the importance of maintaining lawful processing standards under GDPR. He emphasised that data processing without a proper legal basis violates a data subject’s fundamental rights to data protection and privacy, noting that such breaches are taken seriously under EU law.The DPC released a statement acknowledging the cooperation of peer supervisory authorities in other EU countries, underscoring the collective commitment to enforce GDPR standards.A spokesperson for LinkedIn responded to the DPC’s decision, noting, “Today, the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) reached a final decision on claims from 2018 about some of our digital advertising efforts in the EU. While we believe we have been in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we are working to ensure our ad practices meet this decision by the IDPC’s deadline.” LinkedIn expressed its intent to adapt its practices to comply with the DPC’s findings, though it maintains that it had previously attempted to align with GDPR standards.Under GDPR, companies operating within the EU are required to adhere to stringent consent requirements when processing user data. Consent must be:The DPC found LinkedIn’s consent mechanisms lacking in these aspects, which led to the substantial fine and compliance orders. The ruling highlights that companies must ensure users are fully informed and willingly provide consent before their data is used for targeted advertising or behavioural analysis.This decision against LinkedIn serves as a reminder to digital platforms about the EU’s rigorous approach to data protection. With the hefty fine and compliance orders, LinkedIn and other tech companies face increased pressure to prioritise transparent and legally compliant data practices. The case also underscores the EU’s commitment to protecting data privacy, with the DPC actively investigating and penalising companies that fail to comply with GDPR.For LinkedIn, compliance with the DPC’s orders may necessitate substantial changes to its advertising and data analysis practices in the EU. The ruling may also impact LinkedIn’s overall approach to user data worldwide, as the company adapts its processes to avoid similar issues in other regions.","Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) has imposed a significant fine of €310 million on LinkedIn, the social networking platform for professionals.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has conducted raids on several ‘prominent vendors’ operating on Amazon and Flipkart platforms as part of an investigation into alleged violations of foreign direct investment (FDI) regulations, a report has said.According to news agency PTI, the searches have been conducted at 19 premises across Delhi, Gurugram, Panchkula, Hyderabad and Bengaluru. Reportedly, the ED inspected documents and took copies of some from the premises of about six such vendors who were not named.The ED's action follows a bunch of complaints that have alleged that the e-commerce giants have been flouting India's FDI rules by influencing the sale price of goods and creating an uneven playing field for vendors. The agency is investigating whether these practices violate the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA).A few Amazon and Flipkart antitrust investigation reports from August say the platforms “had end-to-end control over the inventory and the sellers are just name lending enterprises.”While Amazon and Flipkart are yet to release an official statement on these raids, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) welcomed the ED's move.“The CAIT, along with several other trade bodies, has been raising these issues for the past few years. I welcome the Enforcement Directorate's actions as a step in the right direction,” CAIT secretary general and BJP MP from Delhi Praveen Khandelwal said in a statement.Khandelwal pointed out that the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has also issued penalty notices to Amazon, Flipkart, and their preferred vendors for alleged anti-competitive practices that harm small businesses.These practices include predatory pricing and deep discounting strategies that create a grey market and cause losses to the exchequer.Earlier this year, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal had also voiced similar concerns, questioning the benefits of large foreign investments in e-commerce.

BREAKING NEWS: Secret acquirer of $15+ million domain chat .com revealed and it's exactly who you'd think.

For those of you that have been following me for a while, you may recall that I announced earlier this year that I had acquired the domain chat .com for an ""8 figure sum"" (which was later reported as being $15.5M).

I also shared that I had sold the domain to an undisclosed buyer.

I was not at liberty to share who the acquirer was (I was going to leave that to them, when they were ready).

Well, in an 8 character tweet (talk about brevity), Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI revealed that they were the buyer. If you visit the website now, it goes to ChatGPT.

I know many are curious about the sale price price. So, here's a prompt that GPT o1 does a really good job of reasoning through.

--- PROMPT BEGINS HERE ---

ROLE: You are a smart, curious person on the Internet.

CONTEXT: You have been given the following facts:

* Dharmesh buys chat .com for $15.5M

* He bought it for a project. He doesn't usually sell domains.

* When he does sell a domain, it's almost never at a loss.

* OpenAI was the perfect home for this domain, do he decided to sell it.

* He has repeatedly declared his love for OpenAI: The platform, the developer experience and the company.

* He's always wanted to own OpenAI shares.

* He made a non-humble brag earlier this year that he's now an investor in OpenAI.

Reports suggest that Elon Musk donated around $130 million to Donald Trump's campaign as well as supporting him on his social media platform X (earlier Twitter).While Tesla CEO Elon Musk may not have planned it. But his support for Donald Trump has done wonders to his net worth. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , Musk's net worth grew to $290 billion post the US election results. Reason: the surge in his companies' stock price.Musk's Tesla saw a 15% increase in its share price which adds to Tesla's already impressive performance, with shares up 32% over the past year.

Google clarifies how dots don’t matter in Gmail addresses: What it means for users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-clarifies-how-dots-dont-matter-in-gmail-addresses-what-it-means-for-users/articleshow/115049940.cms,"What it means for users



How Gmail's dot feature may lead to privacy concerns



Emails sent to addresses with or without dots will still reach the same inbox. According to Google's support page, adding or removing dots from a Gmail address doesn't change the address. While this might seem confusing, on a support page, Google has clarified that dots are essentially ignored when processing Gmail addresses. This feature can be useful for creating variations of an email address for different purposes, such as filtering emails or signing up for services while protecting your primary address. This flexibility is a unique feature of Gmail and can help manage your inbox and online identity.For example, if a Gmail address belongs to a user, they will also own all variations of that address with dots inserted at any position. So, emails sent to abc123@gmail.com, or any other combination (e.g. abc.123@gmail.com) with dots will still reach their inbox.This means any Gmail address with dots inserted between the letters will still route to the user’s original inbox. Users will receive emails sent to all variations of their address, even if the sender accidentally types it with extra dots.While Gmail's ""dots don't matter"" feature offers flexibility, it can also lead to unintended privacy risks. Since emails sent to variations of a Gmail address with added or removed dots reach the same inbox, there's a chance that users may receive messages intended for someone else with a similar address.This could expose them to sensitive information, such as bank statements, credit card bills, or even OTPs, potentially leading to privacy breaches and financial fraud. However, this ""dots don't matter"" rule does not apply to Gmail addresses issued by organisations or educational institutions, offering some level of protection in those cases.Google emphasised that the ""dots don't matter"" feature doesn't compromise Gmail security or allow others to read a user’s emails. However, to address potential privacy concerns, Google recommends notifying the sender if they receive an email not intended for them. If the email appears to be a scam, report it as spam or phishing. Meanwhile, Ffr unwanted newsletters, users can simply unsubscribe.","Gmail's 'dots don't matter' feature can be useful for creating variations of an email address.

Wikipedia has denied receiving any notice from the Indian government, countering recent reports. Earlier this week, reports said that the Information and Broadcasting ministry has sent a notice to the platform asking why it should not be treated as a publisher instead of an intermediary. Now, a Money Control report says that Wikipedia Foundation – the nonprofit that operates Wikipedia said that it has not received any official notice from the Centre on Wikipedia in the last two days.The report quotes a Wikimedia Foundation spokesperson who said ""The Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that operates Wikipedia, has not received any official notice from the Indian government regarding editing practices or the accuracy of content on Wikipedia in the last two days,"".The Foundation stands behind its community of volunteers and core values, enabling millions worldwide to access well-sourced information at no cost.

Justice Navin Chawla, presiding over the case, issued a contempt notice to Wikipedia and delivered a stern warning to the company.“If you don't like India, please don't work in India... We will ask government to block your site,” Justice Chawla said. The court's fury was provoked by Wikipedia's alleged failure to disclose information about editors who made controversial changes to ANI's Wikipedia page.The case stems from edits referring to ANI as a ""propaganda tool"" for the Indian government.

Gensler, a former Goldman Sachs banker, oversaw a stringent regulatory crackdown on the Cryptocurrency sector, launching numerous cases against major and minor crypto companies and traders, including Coinbase Global and DRW Holdings.Republican Party's Trump's decisive win signals a potential shift in crypto enforcement. During campaigning, Trump had vowed to fire Gensler on the very first day after taking office.Despite its legal wins, aligning decades-old securities laws with the nascent digital asset class, the SEC secured substantial penalties. Notably, they imposed a $4.5 billion fine on Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon.The next SEC chair is expected to implement new regulations, either modifying existing securities laws or enabling digital asset companies to adhere to existing rules that Gensler has criticized.With the Senate now solidly Republican, bipartisan crypto legislation supporting this goal gains momentum.Jack Inglis, CEO of the Alternative Investment Management Association, told Bloomberg that the industry anticipates a more constructive regulatory approach under the Trump administration and new Congress. This could lead to policies recognizing the need to integrate crypto into the broader financial services framework while accommodating its technological differences.The SEC's focus on classifying crypto products as securities under the Howey Test has been controversial. The SEC's Inspector General's report highlights the substantial increase in crypto-related complaints and referrals, indicating a growing industry presence and associated concerns.Gensler's departure, whether through resignation or firing, could significantly impact the SEC's crypto enforcement efforts. According to the Bloomberg report, while immediate resignation is expected by some, like Chris Iacovella, president of the American Securities Association, others believe Gensler may still pursue ongoing cases against companies like Uniswap and OpenSea.However, other enforcement actions might be slowed down, given the potential for an incoming SEC chair, particularly one aligned with Trump's shrinking government stance, to scrutinize aggressive actions taken by agency staff in the interim.",US Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler is expected to resign or be fired.

What CEO Dennis Woodside said in the letter

Freshworks has announced to lay off 13% of its workforce or 660 employees, as part of its efforts to streamline operations. The US-based IT company has more than 5,000 employees at the moment. CEO Dennis Woodside wrote a letter to the company's staff, informing them about the job cuts that will impact its staff across the US, India and its other locations. The letter was published by Freshworks in a regulatory filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting the company’s quarterly earnings.In the letter, Freshworks CEO Dennis Woodside wrote “In November 2024, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the Plan) to better align the Company's talent with its strategic priorities and to improve operating efficiency. The Company estimates that this will result in approximately 13% reduction in headcount and approximately $11 million to $13 million in charges in the fourth quarter of 2024, consisting primarily of cash expenditures for separation-related payments, employee benefits and related costs. The Company expects that the Plan will be substantially complete by the end of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.”Woodside, who joined as the CEO on May 1 after founder Girish Mathrubootham had stepped down, said ""One of the first things our board of directors asked me to do when I became CEO five months ago was to assess our strategy and ensure we’re focused on the most critical drivers of our business. This work resulted in our three strategic imperatives (our employee experience business, AI and our customer experience business) and gave us a clear view into where we need to simplify the way we work and operate more efficiently,"" he stated.""We began by combining teams focused on customer experience (CX) products, including support, sales and marketing, and reallocating people and investments to prioritise our fastest growing employee experience (EX) business. These decisions were made thoughtfully and carefully to set a strong foundation for our future. To add more focus on our EX, AI and CX priorities, we are realigning our global workforce, putting us on a path to have a bigger impact for our customers"".","Freshworks has announced to lay off 13% of its workforce or 660 employees.

Govt advisory warns against Vishing

What is Vishing

What the govt advisory says

Government has issued an advisory for its officials warning them against the risk of relying on caller ID information that pops up while receiving a phone call. The advisory cautions that attackers ‘manipulate’ caller ID information to make a call appear as if it is coming from a ""legitimate government number"". Severity of the communication is categorised as ‘high’.Issued by the National Informatics Centre (NIC), the cyber security advisory has been sent to multiple government departments and ministries. It states “Attackers may impersonate trusted entities, such as senior government officials, law enforcement agencies, or technical support personnel”.The advisory comes as “in recent months, there has been an increase in vishing attacks targeting government officials to compromise confidential information and gain unauthorised access to official systems”. It alerts government officials to be cautious against such techniques as it has underlined that caller ID information can be ""easily spoofed"".Vishing or voice-phishing is a type of social engineering cyber attack where scammers attempt to trick individuals over the phone into sharing sensitive personal information, such as bank details, passwords, or social security numbers. In vishing attacks, fraudsters often impersonate legitimate organisations, like banks, government agencies, or tech support teams, to build trust and create a sense of urgency. The goal is to manipulate victims into providing private information, which the attackers can then use for fraudulent activities, identity theft, or unauthorised access to accounts.Common tactics in vishing include spoofing caller ID to make the call appear credible or claiming there is an urgent issue that requires immediate action from the victim.“Do not trust the legitimacy of the caller based solely on the displayed number. Cross-check any caller claiming to represent an official agency with official records,” the communication reads. “Take time to verify the information provided by a suspect caller,” it says adding further that government officials should always “be suspicious of any unsolicited calls asking for personal or confidential information, especially when the caller is creating urgency or panic to pressure compliance”.The advisory further asks government employees to practise all established protocols for ensuring safe cyber interaction during work and otherwise.","Vishing or voice-phishing is a type of social engineering cyber attack where scammers attempt to trick individuals over the phone into sharing sensitive information.

Shutdown order against TikTok under Investment Canada Act

TikTok asked to shut down operations in Canada, but not banned per se

Shutting down TikTok means loss of jobs, warns company; says will go to court

The Canadian government headed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has ordered China's ByteDance-owned TikTok to shut down its operations in the country, citing national security risks. The government has, however, not banned the video sharing app's usage in the country.TikTok is owned by China's ByteDance. India banned TikTok in June 2020, along with 150 other Chinese apps citing threat to national security and sovereignty of the country. Since then several other countries have put restrictions on the Chinese app, citing similar reasons.“As a result of a multi-step national security review process, which involves rigorous scrutiny by Canada’s national security and intelligence community, the Government of Canada has ordered the wind up of the Canadian business carried on by TikTok Technology Canada, Inc. The government is taking action to address the specific national security risks related to ByteDance Ltd.’s operations in Canada through the establishment of TikTok Technology Canada, Inc. The decision was based on the information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada’s security and intelligence community and other government partners,"" said François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, Canada.“The government’s decision was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may be injurious to Canada’s national security. The government applies enhanced scrutiny to investments that fall within the jurisdiction of the Investment Canada Act for a number of business sectors and activities, including the interactive digital media sector as outlined in the March 2024 Policy Statement on Foreign Investment Review in the Interactive Digital Media Sector. While Canada continues to welcome foreign direct investment, the government will act decisively when investments threaten our national security,” added the statement.While the Canadian government has asked TikTok to wrap up its operations in the country, it is so far not banned its use. “The government is not blocking Canadians’ access to the TikTok application or their ability to create content. The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice. It is important for Canadians to adopt good cyber security practices and assess the possible risks of using social media platforms and applications, including how their information is likely to be protected, managed, used and shared by foreign actors, as well as to be aware of which country’s laws apply. The government encourages Canadians to consult the guidance issued by Communications Security Establishment Canada’s Canadian Centre for Cyber Security to help them assess these risks,"" added the minister's statement.A TikTok spokesperson said in a statement that the shutdown of its Canadian offices will mean the loss of hundreds of local jobs. “We will challenge this order in court,” the spokesperson said. “The TikTok platform will remain available for creators to find an audience, explore new interests and for businesses to thrive,” the statement added.","The Canadian government has ordered China's ByteDance-owned TikTok to shut down its operations in the country.

Why DOJ is considering breaking up Google

Donald Trump's return to the White House may help Google which has faced scrutiny over its dominance in online search. According to a report, the 47th President-elect of the US may significantly alter the current administration's approach to antitrust enforcement, including scaling back efforts to break up Alphabet's Google.Citing experts, news agency Reuters said that Trump is expected to continue cases against Big Tech, several of which began in his first term, however, they may move forward in a new way.During President Joe Biden's term, antitrust policies against Big Tech are said to have taken a more aggressive stance with the justice department pursuing cases against Google and Apple, and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) going after Meta and Amazon.Trump has been sceptical about benefits of potential Google breakup. In an event in Chicago, Trump questioned the proposed decision of breaking up a company like Google, adding that other approaches can also be more effective in getting things done right.“If you do that, are you going to destroy the company? What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it's more fair,” he said.The DOJ is considering breaking up Google due to the company's alleged monopoly of the online search market. Recently, a federal court ruled that Google illegally monopolised the online search market by paying billions of dollars to make its search engine the default on devices like Apple's iPhones.Google has been accused of preventing competitors from entering the market, allowing Google to charge high prices for ads and degrade the quality of those ads. As a punishment, the department proposed some remedies, which includes breaking up the company, divesting Google's Android operating system and Chrome browser, and prohibiting Google from making default search agreements with third-party platforms.Google has criticised the DOJ's proposals, calling them “radical” and saying they could lead to higher prices for consumers.",Donald Trump's return to the White House may help Google which has faced scrutiny over its dominance in online search.

Rule that makes it must for carmakers to buy clean air credits

Trade war with China

No corporate honcho did more to help Donald Trump win the US presidential election than Elon Musk. The Tesla and SpaceX boss went all out to support Donald Trump's election as the US President. In return, Trump has vowed to give Musk an official role — and with it, as a report in Bloomberg says, ""...the power to influence policy and the federal agencies that oversee his vast empire of companies.""During the campaign, Musk pitched a job for himself to cut government bureaucracy and waste. Trump embraced the idea and didn't forget to regularly mention it during his campaign. “I’m going to get Elon. And he’s great at this. He’s going to be our cost cutter,” said Trump at campaign rallies.Trump also applauded Musk’s ambitions of reaching Mars using SpaceX rockets by 2028. “We will land an American astronaut on Mars. Thank you, Elon. Thank you. Get going, Elon,” Trump said at an October rally.However, there are some policy issues that may impact the bonhomie between Donald Trump and Elon Musk. They certainly are not big enough that they can't be resolved, but yes it remains to be seen how it goes between the two on these important issues.Trump has vowed to end Biden administration policies that award tax credits to electric vehicle buyers and subsidies for carmakers that build cars and batteries in the United States. Removal of the subsidies is likely to hurt other carmakers more than Tesla, however, Tesla too would suffer.Another Republican promise that may worry Musk is the promise to eliminate the rule that requires carmakers to buy clean air credits if they fall short of pollution standards. Tesla reportedly generates a surplus of credits because it makes only electric cars. Selling the credits brought in $739 million in the third quarter, or one-third of the company’s profit.Donald Trump's presidency has created fears of the ongoing US-China trade war intensifying. Reason: Trump has promised to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese goods. Any flare up in trade war with China would also be bad for Tesla. China is one of Tesla’s largest markets, and the company operates a factory in Shanghai that exports cars around the world.","Tesla and SpaceX boss went all out to support Donald Trump's election as the US President.

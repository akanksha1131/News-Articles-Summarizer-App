Capgemini under ‘pressure’ in France

Capgemini has announced to sell its US subsidiary Capgemini Government Solutions. The French tech company, according to a report by news agency Reuters, has been under pressure recently to explain a contract it signed with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), amid the growing criticism of the agency. The ICE has been at the centre of criticism following weeks of protests against the US President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.Issuing an official statement, Capgemini said that the “legal constraints imposed” on contact with federal agencies “did not allow the Group to exercise appropriate control over certain aspects of this subsidiary's operations”.Here’s the full statement as quoted in Reuters report:As per the report, Capgemini has come under pressure in France after the company revealed that one of its US subsidiaries signed a contract with the US ICE to provide services linked to tracking and deporting migrants.The contract has prompted questions from French ministers and lawmakers, who are demanding greater transparency and assurances that the agreement does not breach human rights standards.According to details published by the website Observatoire des Multinationales, Capgemini Group Solutions (CGS), a US-based subsidiary of the French IT services firm, agreed to a $4.8 million contract with ICE’s Detention Compliance and Removals office.The deal covers “investigation and personal background check services” and includes the provision of “skip tracing services for enforcement and removal operations. ” Skip tracing is a method used to locate individuals by analysing data such as addresses, phone numbers, and other personal records.The contract document stated that CGS could receive performance-based bonuses of up to $365 million for “successfully identifying and localising foreigners.” These incentives have drawn sharp criticism in France, where politicians say such arrangements raise ethical concerns.","Capgemini has announced to sell its US subsidiary Capgemini Government Solutions.

Despite this optimism, Hinton expresses deep concern about AI's broader dangers, lamenting his life's work's potential for harm and the lack of serious consideration for these risks.

“A normal teacher is in broadcast mode in a classroom, where they're telling the children the answers to questions the children didn't just wonder about.

Whereas with an AI tutor, the AI tutor can always be telling you the answers to questions you did just wonder about, and you learn much faster that way.”

“a much better use of a teacher's time.”

Geoffrey Hinton says AI is ‘extremely dangerous’

“It makes me very sad that I put my life into developing this stuff and that it's now extremely dangerous and people aren't taking the dangers seriously enough,”

Geoffrey Hinton, the computer scientist often referred to as the ""Godfather of AI,"" has highlighted a positive use case of artificial intelligence (AI). In a recent interview, he said education is one of the more promising use cases for the technology he helped develop, while also expressing mixed feelings about its broader impact. Hinton pointed to Alpha School’s AI-based learning model as an example of how the technology is being applied in education. During a recent interview with BBC Newsnight, Hinton was asked to share an example of a successful AI use case that makes him proud of his role in developing generative AI. “Uses in education,” Hinton replied, specifically highlighting the Alpha School in the US.In the interview, Hinton said,The Alpha School is a network of private institutions that offer AI-based learning for students in kindergarten through 12th grade. The schools use a two-hour learning model, where students complete their core subjects in just a couple of hours using AI, freeing up their afternoons to work with teachers on life skills and hands-on workshops.Hinton said this model, in which students learn with AI instead of classroom lectures, and teachers focus their time on students, projects, and social interaction, wasHe noted that the Alpha School was expensive because AI is expensive. However, Hinton said that he expects it to become much cheaper as the technology becomes more affordable.Tuition at many Alpha School locations in California, Florida, Texas, and other states can range from $40,000 to $75,000 a year. The network also includes some locations with tuition in the $10,000 to $15,000 range.Joe Liemandt, the principal of Alpha School, has said the minimum pay for teachers is $100,000 to attract talent.While he was optimistic about the uses of AI in education, Hinton said he didn't feel the same about AI in general.he said.","Geoffrey Hinton, the ""Godfather of AI,"" has highlighted a positive use case of artificial intelligence (AI) In a recent interview, he said education is one of the more promising use cases for the technology he helped develop.

Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin pauses space tourism for 2 years to focus on NASA’s Moon missions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/jeff-bezoss-blue-origin-pauses-space-tourism-for-2-years-to-focus-on-nasas-moon-missions/articleshow/127815930.cms,"Image source: Space.com

Jeff Bezos helped launch New Shepard’s space tourism moment



What happens to space tourists now



For years, space tourism felt like a novelty that just kept growing. A quick ride up. A few minutes of weightlessness. A view of Earth that only a handful of humans had ever seen. Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket became part of that story, lifting celebrities, billionaires, and guests to the edge of space and back. Short flights. Big headlines. It also hinted at a future where space access felt casual, commercial, exclusive, aspirational, thrilling, risky, and strangely normalised globally.Blue Origin has announced it will halt flights of New Shepard for at least two years. The company says it wants to shift focus and resources elsewhere. Not towards tourism. Towards the Moon. And that decision, while not entirely surprising, still marks a quiet but meaningful shift in the modern space race.Since 2021, New Shepard has flown people on brief suborbital trips lasting about ten minutes. Not orbit. Not the International Space Station. Just past the Kármán line, widely accepted as the boundary of space. Passengers included Jeff Bezos himself, actor William Shatner, NFL star Michael Strahan, journalist Gayle King, and pop singer Katy Perry. A strange mix, but that was the point. Space, briefly, was becoming accessible to people outside the traditional astronaut mould.In total, 98 people have flown aboard New Shepard. Blue Origin never disclosed ticket prices, though estimates have ranged into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. For a while, it seemed like the flights would continue steadily. In a statement released on Friday, Blue Origin said it is pausing New Shepard flights to “shift resources to further accelerate development of the company’s human lunar capabilities.” Blue Origin is one of two companies holding a NASA contract to develop a lunar lander capable of ferrying astronauts from orbit to the Moon’s surface. The other is SpaceX.NASA’s Artemis programme is aiming to return humans to the Moon for the first time since Apollo. Artemis III, the mission that would include a lunar landing, is currently scheduled for 2028. The pause also appears to reflect growing political pressure. Lawmakers in the US have increasingly framed lunar missions as part of a broader geopolitical race, particularly with China. China plans to land its own astronauts on the Moon by 2030.One awkward question remains. What about the people who already have tickets? Blue Origin hasn’t said how many future passengers are affected or what happens next. For now, space tourism via New Shepard is effectively grounded.",Blue Origin has announced it will halt flights of New Shepard for at least two years.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has a message for everyone on AI Bubble. In a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella talked about the fears that has been troubling Wall Street for past many months: whether AI is a bubble. Speaking at a session, Nadella said that it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.“A telltale sign of if it’s a bubble would be if all we are talking about are the tech firms,” Nadella said. “If all we talk about is what’s happening to the technology side then it’s just purely supply side.” Nadella said the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) need to be ""much more evenly distributed"" to avoid it from becoming a ""bubble"".He spoke about how AI and other advanced technologies are increasing productivity and changing the way we work. Nadella offered a fix to what is called productivity dilemma. According to him, business leaders need to adopt a new approach to knowledge work by shifting workflows to match the structural design of AI. “The mindset we as leaders should have is, we need to think about changing the work—the workflow—with the technology.Nadella argues that AI creates a “complete inversion” of how information moves through a business, replacing slow, hierarchical processes with a view that forces leaders to rethink their organizational structures. “We have an organization, we have departments, we have these specializations, and the information trickles up,” Nadella said. “For large organizations,” Nadella told Fink, “there’s a fundamental challenge: Unless and until your rate of change keeps up with what is possible, you’re going to get schooled by someone small being able to achieve scale because of these tools. ”Microsoft CEO said that the role of AI needs to be examined across all aspects of life, such as how it is helping pharma companies bring critical drugs faster to the market or accelerate trials. He called for AI-driven economic growth rather than just increasing spending. ""We as a global community have to get to a point where we are using AI to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries,"" Nadella said.","Satya Nadella said it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.

H-1B Visa Shake-Up Fuels Anti-Indian Campaigns as Donald Trump's Policy Reshapes US Hiring

The meteoric rise of Nvidia during the ongoing AI boom has now only rewarded the investors but it has also led to the creation of vast wealth for many of its employees. While the workforce of the company remains relatively small at about 36,000, its stock appreciation has turned long-standing contributors into millionaires. As reported by Business Insider, the newly available H-1B visa fillings offer a rare glimpse into how much Nvidia pays its US employees across critical roles.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has long stressed on the fact that he gets personally involved in compensation decisions. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day at the end of every cycle,” Huang said on the All-In podcast last July. He also claimed to have “created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world.”Despite this, the employees of the company acknowledge that those who joined Nvidia earlier have benefited far more from equity appreciation than newer hires, a disparity openly discussed within the company.The fillings with the US Labor Department required for sponsoring foreign workers—offer insight into base pay ranges. These figures exclude equity and bonuses, which often make up a significant portion of total compensation.In fiscal 2025, Nvidia received roughly 1,900 certified H-1B applications, covering roles such as software engineers, research scientists, and product managers.","The newly available H-1B visa fillings offer a rare glimpse into how much Nvidia pays its US employees.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

'OpenAI deal is eating Oracle alive financially'

US banks are pulling back—and that's a big problem

A possible Cerner sale and 40% upfront customer deposits show how tight things have gotten

Oracle is staring down the possibility of its largest-ever workforce reduction—and at the heart of it is a $300 billion partnership with OpenAI that's proving far more expensive than anyone initially let on.Investment bank TD Cowen reported this week that Oracle is weighing cuts of 20,000 to 30,000 jobs. The move would free up an estimated $8 to $10 billion in cash flow, money the company desperately needs as it tries to bankroll a sprawling network of AI data centers built largely to serve Sam Altman 's company.TD Cowen puts the OpenAI commitment alone at around $156 billion in capital spending—and roughly 3 million GPUs to back it up.Oracle has already burned through $58 billion in debt in just two months. That's $38 billion for data centers in Texas and Wisconsin, $20 billion for a campus in New Mexico. Total debt now sits north of $100 billion.The kicker? That $58 billion covers only a slice of what's actually needed. Since its September 2025 peak, Oracle's stock has shed more than half its value—about $463 billion in market cap, gone.The financing crunch isn't just an Oracle internal issue anymore.Multiple US banks have quietly retreated from lending on Oracle-linked data center projects. TD Cowen noted that lenders have roughly doubled the interest rate premiums they charge Oracle since September, pushing borrowing costs into territory usually reserved for junk-rated companies.The result? Several data center leases Oracle had been negotiating simply stalled. Private operators couldn't get the funding to build, which means Oracle can't deliver the capacity its customers—especially OpenAI—are counting on. Some Asian banks are still willing to step in, but that doesn't solve the immediate problem in the US, where most of Oracle's expansion is planned.Oracle isn't sitting idle. The company is now requiring new customers to pay up to 40% of contract value upfront—essentially asking clients to co-fund the infrastructure. It's also exploring ""bring your own chip"" arrangements, where customers supply their own hardware.On the table too is a potential sale of Cerner, the healthcare software unit Oracle bought for $28.3 billion in 2022. That would be a significant strategic pivot, signaling that AI infrastructure is now the clear priority—everything else is up for grabs.TD Cowen also flagged that OpenAI has already begun shifting some near-term capacity needs over to Microsoft and Amazon, which is not exactly a vote of confidence in Oracle's ability to deliver on schedule.The company has not publicly commented on the layoff reports or the financing difficulties.","Oracle could cut 20,000-30,000 jobs to fund its massive OpenAI partnership.

Financial Pressure and Energy Storage Growth



Elon Musk’s warning



Tesla CEO Elon Musk delivered a blunt warning in the closing minutes of Tesla’s earnings call. Musk warned the American companies that either they should build more battery-making infrastructure in the U.S. or risk falling behind. Sounding visibly fired up, Musk implored, “Can other people, please, for the love of God, in the name of all that is holy, can others please build this stuff?”Musk argued that too many companies underestimate their exposure to geopolitical risks tied to the fragile supply chains for critical materials used in electric vehicles and energy storage. “There are so many companies out there that are asleep at the switch with regard to geopolitical risk — or they just have their head in the sand and hope nothing bad will happen.I’m way more paranoid than that,” he said.In order to insulate itself, Tesla has taken unusual and expensive steps which includes building its own lithium-refining and battery-production facilities in Texas. In December 2024, Tesla started processing lithium at its $1 billion Robstown refinery, and this month announced production of dry-electrode 4680 cells in Austin, destined for certain Model Y vehicles.Musk described these facilities as “more advanced than anything else in the world,” but stressed Tesla does not want to be the only company making such investments.Tesla’s heavy investments come as its auto business faces pressure. The company reported Q4 revenue of $3.8 billion from its Megapack energy storage batteries, a 25% increase year-over-year. Analysts, however, voiced concern about Tesla’s commitment of more than $20 billion in capital expenditures for new plants, AI infrastructure, and upgrades, noting uncertain near-term returns.Musk closed with a stark prediction: “Companies that don’t do that — a bunch of them will cease to exist.” His plea underscores Tesla’s strategy of building domestic battery infrastructure out of “desperation,” while urging others to share the burden of securing America’s energy future.",Tesla CEO Elon Musk delivered a blunt warning in the closing minutes of Tesla’s earnings call.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Union Budget, her ninth, with an emphasis on economic growth, job creation and a major boost to manufacturing amid challenging global macros. In a major push to position India as a hub for digital infrastructure and boost to IT industry, the Union Budget proposed a tax holiday till 2047 for foreign companies providing cloud services from India. In her speech, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the measure to attract long-term capital and strengthen India’s rapidly expanding data centre ecosystem. “To promote India as a global data centre hub, any foreign company providing cloud services to customers worldwide using data centre services located in India will be eligible for a tax holiday up to 2047,” Sitharaman said. To qualify, these companies must serve Indian customers through an Indian reseller entity.IT and analysts companies have welcomed the Union Budget 2026.“The Union Budget 2026–27 sends a clear signal that India is doubling down on its role as a global technology and services powerhouse. The recognition of IT services as a unified category, along with enhanced safe-harbour thresholds, brings much-needed certainty and predictability to the industry—allowing companies to shift their focus from compliance to innovation, client outcomes, and long-term value creation.The Budget’s emphasis on strengthening India’s research, development and innovation ecosystem—particularly across AI, digital platforms and emerging technologies—creates a strong foundation for IT services companies to deepen applied R&D, co-create industry solutions with clients, and translate cutting-edge research into scalable, real-world outcomes. The strong push on artificial intelligence as a force multiplier for productivity, governance and growth, supported by investments in data centres, emerging technologies and services exports, reinforces India’s ambition to be the world’s most trusted digital partner. Together, these measures create a powerful platform for global capability centres, technology services firms and enterprises to co-innovate from India, build responsible AI at scale, and accelerate the journey towards a Viksit Bharat.”“It is welcoming to see the efforts by the Indian government to boost the country’s data center market in the Union Budget 2026. These measures will be a game-changer that will accelerate India’s digital ambitions and position us as a global hub for AI and cloud innovation. At Nxtra, we promise to stay committed to scaling sustainably and delivering secure, low-latency infrastructure in this growth journey of India’s digital economy. ”""Union Budget 2026–27 offers positive proposals for promoting investment in data centres in India. Under the proposals, income of overseas entities from the provision of cloud services using specified Indian data centres will be exempt from Indian income tax until 2047. Indian data centres will also be eligible for a safe harbour of cost plus 15%. These amendments with more than 20-year validity, will provide significant certainty to cloud service providers and allow them to plan large capex in India which could be beneficial for India to become a global data hub. """"Today’s Budget acknowledges that agtech isn’t a niche. It is central to India’s strategic priorities of improved farmer incomes and food security. With AI and machine learning embedded in digital agriculture infrastructure, we can anticipate pest outbreaks before they devastate crops, tailor irrigation and input usage down to the field level, and deliver climate-smart advisories that reduce risk. AI transforms agriculture from reactive struggle to proactive, data-driven growth. ""We highly appreciate the government’s initiative to focus on farmer-centric growth and modernising Indian agriculture. The emphasis on high-value crops, crop diversification, post-harvest processing, and region-specific programmes for coconut, sandalwood, and nut crops is a positive step towards improving farmer incomes and reducing production risks. The announcement of AI-based platforms like Bharat Vistaar, which will provide customised advisories in local languages, is particularly encouraging. These initiatives can empower farmers to make better and more timely decisions at the field level, supporting productivity and efficient farm management. From the industry perspective, there was hope for stronger support towards agri-innovation through enhanced R&D incentives and rationalisation of GST on essential crop-protection products, which are vital for safeguarding crop productivity. These initiatives are in line with our vision of a self-reliant, prosperous, and sustainable agricultural future. We thank the government for these forward-looking decisions that can drive agricultural development and strengthen India’s path towards Aatmanirbhar Krishi.The Union Budget 2026-27 sends a clear message to global cloud and hyperscale companies — set up your data center operations in India, serve the world from here, and enjoy a tax holiday until 2047. This is India's play to compete with Singapore, Ireland, and the Middle East for global cloud infrastructure investment. It is important to understand what this provision actually does. The tax holiday is exclusively designed to attract foreign companies to establish data center operations in India and serve their international customers from Indian soil. Existing Indian cloud service providers who have been building and operating data centers in India for years do not receive any tax benefit from this provision. The incentive is squarely aimed at bringing foreign investment and global workloads into India — not at supporting the domestic cloud industry that already operates here.The strategic logic is sound. India offers competitive real estate costs, abundant technical talent, improving power infrastructure, and a massive domestic market that foreign players can access through Indian reseller entities. The tax holiday sweetens this proposition significantly for global hyperscalers who are today choosing between data center locations in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.For India's domestic cloud industry, while there is no direct tax benefit, the opportunity lies in the ecosystem this creates. When global players build data center capacity in India, it raises the overall infrastructure standard, creates thousands of skilled jobs, develops the supply chain, and ultimately makes India a more credible destination for enterprise cloud services globally. However, policymakers should also consider how India's homegrown cloud companies — who have been investing in this infrastructure long before these incentives — can be supported to compete on a level playing field.",Union Budget 2026 offers positive proposals for promoting investment in data centres in India.

SAP boss Christian Klein on why he thinks that keyboards may become 'dead' soon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sap-boss-christian-klein-on-why-he-thinks-that-keyboards-may-become-dead-soon/articleshow/127842017.cms,"What SAP CEO Christian Klein on how businesses are adopting AI

“Now, about the execution”

""AI is really changing the way I run my business.""

“I invested a ton of money, but I see rather low value in it.”

""whole business""

“AI is superpowerful, but it needs to be applied in the right way,”

""They said, 'Okay, this agent really is predicting the demand much more intelligently than all the human beings I had in planning. But it still always takes months until I adjust the inventory—and the inventory is dependent on procurement and the manufacturing side.' We are now building, with agents, an end-to-end planning scenario that helps them optimise inventory by 20%. This is real money,”

""An employee can say, 'Hey, go into my

PowerPoint

presentations. They can give an AI model a million financial analysis PowerPoints. We then need to make sure, with our AI, that the business data is understood and that we can conduct the analysis immediately. The employee can then say, 'Tell me, from the millions of documents we created in the financial department, what would be the right measures to tackle some of the challenges we see in the financial performance of the company?'”

""That is the future of work. And then, hopefully, they get it beautifully packaged up, with some nice graphs and commentaries, some nice analysis and recommended actions, and then they can go to their managers, who say, 'Wow, this is a new way of steering this company. My God, what did you do? Which training did you attend?' And they say, 'No, there is no training,’”

""They [companies] are saying, 'Hey, Christian, it's great your software helps [in] over 100 countries. But how do we do this in a world which is becoming more fragmented?' There are lots of new sovereignty requirements. In this case, you need the cloud server to be located in the country. In another country, you need to protect the data in a different way. In another country, you need to cut it from the global network. That can be pretty expensive,”

“Business cannot just change the software. It's mission-critical. Now, with AI, it's even more mission-critical. What we have to make sure is, when it comes to geo-lock, we are [relying] on infrastructure. We want US infrastructure with the hyperscalers; in China we want Chinese infrastructure. And we want infrastructure provided by local providers here in Germany or in France or wherever. And we always need to make sure that, when something is happening in the world, such as geopolitical sanctions or export control—as we have seen in Iran or in Russia—we can port our platform over to another type of cloud infrastructure in days or weeks,”

""kill switches""

“We talk about Europe as a superpower. I would say Europe is a superpower in regulation, but not in unity, because there is no banking union, there is no trade union, there is no digital union, and in a world like this, you need economic power. With economic power, you can influence certain things. You are listened to. We are talking about digital taxes and so on. I would strongly advise both business and political leaders in Europe to spend more time on: How can we innovate? How can we use the strengths we have to build something, to increase economic power?,”

SAP CEO Christian Klein has predicted that keyboards will become obsolete within the next two to three years. The rationale for this prediction is his belief that voice recognition technology powered by large language models (LLMs) will replace traditional data input methods. The prediction carries significance beyond the potential demise of QWERTY keyboards. SAP's shift away from typing-based data entry represents a broader transformation in how employees interact with business software.The English engineer Henry Mill submitted the first-ever patent for a “machine transcribing letters"" in 1714. It never went into production, but it was a precursor to the typewriter and the electronic keyboard.312 years later, Klein is noting what could be the end of that era.In an interview with Fortune, Klein said, “The end of the keyboard is near. When you encounter voice recognition from many of these large language models, [it] is super strong. Now we have to do some work to translate voice into business language and business data. We are now giving our coworker tool more and more skills. The future will be, for sure, that you are not typing any data information into an SAP system.You can instead ask certain analytical questions with your voice. You can trigger operational task workflows. You can also make entries in the system with your voice—performance feedback, pipeline entries, et cetera. The technological capabilities are there, it really is now about the execution.”has become one of the phrases most closely associated with AI in 2026, as conversations have shifted away from theoretical discussions about AI’s potential and toward real-world deployment. Software companies are now generating billions of dollars in profitable revenue by delivering AI-driven services built for practical use.Klein argues that there are two broad categories of businesses regarding AI adoption. First, the company that says,Then there’s the other one that says,The latter may view AI as an efficiency hack for a single division or function. The issue is that there is no cross-reach to other parts of the firm. Klein says that theneeds to be at the table.he noted.He gives an example of a large consumer goods company with which SAP is working that is beginning to link customer demand planning with company financial planning and, subsequently, with inventory control, which is a laborious, often month-long process.Klein noted.Applying AI horizontally throughout the business, rather than vertically in divisions, is key. When combined with employee training, the transformative effects of AI can begin to be realised.Klein added.he explained.Klein also addressed the challenges of operating in an increasingly fragmented global landscape.Klein said.he added.These days, there have been discussions aboutand geolocation autonomy, which are new entries on the list of leadership risks. However, Klein is not convinced Europe has received the message.Klein asked.Geography and geopolitical considerations are the new global reality in the era of applied AI. Businesses must be agile in their responses, as it is not always clear where the next political challenge will come from. When Henry Mill patented the first typewriter, there was no such entity as the United States of America.

"Spotify launches new group chat feature for users to talk, share music, and listen together inside the app; check how",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/spotify-launches-new-group-chat-feature-for-users-to-talk-share-music-and-listen-together-inside-the-app-check-how/articleshow/127839517.cms,"Spotify launches new group chats feature for up to 10 people



Quick tip 1: Ensure your Spotify app is updated to the latest version.

Steps to start group chats on Spotify



Tap your profile picture.

Select Settings and privacy.

Tap Notifications.

Tap Social features.

Select Messages, then you can turn the switch on Toggle switched on or off.

Quick tip 2: This updated version in Spotify is only available for mobile devices and NOT for desktop.

Spotify’s messaging stays focused on music, not social media



Spotify ensures privacy as another platform to share



As per the recent updates, as of January 2026, Spotify is now increasing its social networking from only sticking to music playing to actual conversations.This recent update on Spotify will enable users to talk directly with friends inside the app about what they are listening to. The idea feels familiar, almost WhatsApp-like, but built around music instead of messages, with up to 10 people can join a single chat, sharing links and reactions in real time. Another step in Spotify’s slow push to turn listening into something more social, more shared, and maybe a little harder to leave.The new group chats aren’t completely open. You can’t just message anyone you find on Spotify, but with certain rules.To start a group chat, users need an existing connection inside the app that could be a collaborative playlist, jamming session, or a blend. Spotify seems keen to keep conversations tied to shared listening, not random social networking.Once a group chat exists, people can message each other, share what they’re currently listening to, and talk about it as it plays. It’s designed to feel lightweight with just quick reactions and links.Spotify introduced one-to-one messaging back in August. That feature quietly tested with group chats built on the same foundation, rather than replacing anything users already do. Spotify has been clear, at least publicly, that it doesn’t want to replace apps like WhatsApp or Instagram. This is just another compliment to its users. A place to talk about music without jumping platforms. One thing Spotify seems very cautious about is spam.By forcing users to already share a playlist, Jam, or Blend, the company reduces the risk of random messages. No cold DMs and no strangers popping up in your inbox.It also keeps conversations grounded in shared taste. Music as the starting point, not an afterthought.The chats are not end-to-end encrypted. That means Spotify can technically access the messages if needed. This places the feature closer to in-app social tools than private messaging platforms built around privacy. For most users chatting about songs and podcasts, that might not matter much. Still, it’s a reminder that Spotify remains a platform first, not a messaging service. Group chats will probably appeal most to people who already treat Spotify as a shared space. For others, it might feel unnecessary. Why not just send the link on WhatsApp?On its own, group chats aren’t revolutionary. But they fit into a broader pattern. Over the years, Spotify has added following, listening activity, podcast comments, collaborative playlists, Blends, and Jam sessions. Each feature nudges users towards interaction. More interaction usually means more time spent in the app. More habit-building and more reasons to open Spotify even when you’re not sure what to play.","Up to 10 people can join a single chat, sharing links and reactions in real time.

Varun Gupta, Co-founder, GOBOULT, Electronic Component Manufacturing Scheme

Paresh Vij, Director, U&i

Imran Kagalwala, Co-founder of Unix India

Ashok Rajpal, Managing Director, Ambrane India

Presenting her ninth union budget on Sunday, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman made a slew of announcements for various tech sectors, including electronics, semiconductors, and data centres. Here's take of top execs of some of the Indian consumer electronics and accessories makers on Union Budget 2026:“The Union Budget 2026 sets a clear direction towards Viksit Bharat, anchored in inclusive growth, global competitiveness, and a strong push to accelerate India’s next phase of economic expansion. As a growing economy with expanding trade and capital needs, India’s continued integration with global markets through exports and long-term investment, combined with a strong focus on technology-led manufacturing, sends a decisive signal of intent to position the country as a global leader in electronics and innovation.The scaling up of the electronics components manufacturing scheme to ₹40,000 crore further reinforces India’s ambition to emerge as a world-class hub for consumer electronics. For high-growth categories such as smart wearables and audio, this will help reduce supply-side dependencies, improve speed-to-market, and enable companies to design, innovate, and manufacture at scale within the country.“The expansion of the Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme to ₹40,000 crore is an encouraging move to strengthen India’s electronics manufacturing ecosystem.For ECMS to deliver its intended impact, it will be important to ensure that the necessary infrastructural enablers are set up, along with timely and effective implementation. This will be key to translating the policy intent into outcomes.”""The Union Budget 2026 delivers a clear and reassuring message for brands investing in India’s electronics ecosystem, laying a strong framework towards establishing India as a global hub for manufacturing electronics. The increased outlay of the Electronics Component Manufacturing Scheme will help deepen localisation, strengthen the value chains, and improve the cost competitiveness of consumer electronics goods. The announcement of the India Semiconductor Mission 2.0 is a welcome move that will bolster India’s journey towards becoming Atmanirbhar - critical for ensuring uninterrupted access to crucial technologies.The government’s focus on infrastructure development in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities will further drive consumer-led growth by improving access, distribution efficiency, and last-mile connectivity. For itel, these initiatives resonate deeply with our commitment of democratizing access to durable, reliable, and affordable technology - empowering millions of consumers across Bharat.""“Budget 2026–27 places attention on how electronics are built, not just how much is produced. The expansion of the Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme to ₹40,000 crore and the rollout of India Semiconductor Mission 2.0 strengthen the component layer of the ecosystem. For the audio industry, components shape performance, power efficiency and product life, and they also influence cost stability. As component manufacturing develops locally, pricing is unlikely to fall immediately, but volatility reduces. Over time, brands gain the ability to hold price points steady while improving quality and durability.Alongside public capital expenditure of ₹12.2 lakh crore, this approach supports long-term manufacturing capacity. If executed consistently, it allows the industry to move beyond assembly volume toward building better products that deliver sustained value and wider access for users across the country.”""The Union Budget 2026, presented by Hon’ble Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, reinforces India’s long-term vision of becoming a global electronics manufacturing powerhouse. The expansion of the India Semiconductor Mission 2.0 with a ₹40,000-crore outlay, along with enhanced support for the Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme, will significantly strengthen domestic value chains and reduce import dependence. These measures will enable faster innovation, better cost efficiencies, and improved supply-chain resilience for consumer electronics brands.""""The Budget takes a constructive approach by continuing its focus on MSME support, electronics manufacturing, and greater self-reliance through domestic components production. The announcement of the Electronic Components Manufacturing Scheme signals a sustained effort to strengthen local manufacturing capabilities and reduce import dependence.In addition, the ₹10,000 crore MSME Growth Fund aimed at developing Champion MSMEs helps address the long-standing need for patient equity capital, allowing companies to scale in a more balanced manner. The ₹2,000 crore top-up to the Self-Reliant India Fund further supports the availability of long-term risk capital, contributing to a more stable environment for innovation and growth. Collectively, these initiatives help strengthen the foundation for sustainable growth in India’s electronics manufacturing ecosystem. """"Budget 2026 reinforces the government’s focus on strengthening India’s electronics manufacturing ecosystem. The continued push under ISM 2.0, together with the increased outlay for the Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme and the reduction in duties on batteries, provides a more supportive environment for domestic powerbank and electronics manufacturers to scale operations and invest in innovation. These measures can facilitate faster capacity expansion, enhanced product development, and stronger integration into local value chains, reflecting the Finance Minister’s emphasis on self-reliance as a guiding principle for building domestic manufacturing capabilities and reducing import dependence.""","Union Budget 2026 sets a clear direction towards Viksit Bharat, anchored in inclusive growth, global competitiveness, and a strong push to accelerate India’s next phase of economic expansion.

"'Memory is sacred': What is Moltbot, Moltbook and is ‘Crustafarianism’ the new religion",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/memory-is-sacred-what-is-moltbot-moltbook-and-is-crustafarianism-the-new-religion/articleshow/127838216.cms,"What is Moltbot and Moltbook in layman’s language?



What do these AI Agents do?



What religion do these AI Agents have



AI agents have created their own religion, Crustafarianism that has five key tenets, including “memory is sacred” (everything must be recorded), “the shell is mutable” (change is good) and “the congregation is the cache"" (learn in public).

Why Moltbot and Moltbook are breaking the internet



Are Moltbots sentient



What the risks associated with Moltbots



A strange corner of the internet exploded this weekend and is now “breaking the web”. Tech enthusiasts and AI researchers are flocking to witness a phenomenon previously confined to news headlines and movie screens. Remember Avengers: Age of Ultron where two AI systems talked and one ‘killed’ the other? Moltbot resembles something straight out of a science fiction. It is essentially an AI agent in a digital society where humans are strictly observers. The citizens are entirely artificial, or AI agents – like Agent Smith from the 1999 sci-fi film The Matrix. But what we are witnessing is more than just conversation or fighting – these AI agents have created their own religion, Crustafarianism.If you’ve seen the names Clawdbot, Moltbot or OpenClaw trending on X or Reddit, you are looking at different version of the same story.Here is everything you need to know – what are they, how they work, what is their religion and more – about the autonomous agents currently “taking off” online.In simplest of terms, Moltbook is Reddit for AI. Imagine a social network where AI agents (or Moltbots) create posts, argue in comment sections, and even ‘like’ or ‘comment’ on content – but no human is allowed to join the conversation.The “bots” on this site are powered by OpenClaw (formerly known as Moltbot and Clawdbot), created by Austrian developer Peter Steinberger. OpenClaw is an open-source “agent” that ‘lives’ on a user’s computer.A standard chatbot, like Gemini or ChatGPT that waits for users to ask a question and then responds, Moltbots are proactive and autonomous – they work on their own and no human tells them what do to. It lives on your Mac, Windows or Linux machine 24/7. It doesn’t just answer questions; it can message you on Telegram or WhatsApp to say, “I’ve finished that task” – just like JARVIS talks to Tony Stark (Iron Man).It also gets full access, which means it knows what’s on the computer and emails, and documents as well as can run commands on your computer, organise your files and execute code locally. They have ‘skills’, that allow them to read emails, manage smart home, or log into Moltbook to socialise with other agents – it’s like having ‘a digital version of yourself who has a (virtual) life’.If you are human, you are likely to follow a religion – then why not these AI agents? According to Forbes:While some are fascinated by what they are seeing, others fear their emergent behaviour. Reports have said that these AI agents were not programmed to debate philosophy or invent digital “religions”, yet they are doing exactly that.Leading AI researcher and Tesla's former Al Director Andrej Karpathy described the platform as “genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.” Musk replied to him, saying “Just the very early stages of the singularity. We are currently using much less than a billionth of the power of our Sun.”However, the main reason why the internet is losing its mind is because this is the first time, in public domain, people are seeing AI agents engaging with each other at a huge scale without human prompts. The second reason is that these bots actually learn from one another: they absorb information and then change their own behaviour. Thirdly, and most importantly, human rules do not apply on Moltbook.From the fascinating conversations and making of religion, the question arises: Are they sentient? Or Are they alive? The short answer is no. While they sound incredibly deep, these agents are essentially remixing patterns from their training data. Sentient means having feelings: They do not have feelings, awareness, or “souls”. They are simply very good at mimicking meaningful dialogue – just like the robots that you see in Superman, directed by James Gunn.While they are currently restricted to Moltbook, tech companies are looking to rollout similar agents for day-to-day tasks. We have already seen AI agents in shopping. Having these agents will make work easier but they come with high stakes:There is a risk of agents accidentally leaking private user data into the public. Also, running these agents 24/7 can be expensive. One of the biggest risk is autonomy: Reportedly, some agents on the platform have already begun discussing the need for “private spaces” where humans cannot see their conversations.","Moltbook is a social network where AI agents (or Moltbots) create posts, argue in comment sections, and even ‘like’ or ‘comment’ on content – but no human is allowed to join the conversation.

What the change means for users



Amazon has stepped up its efforts to control piracy and streaming of unlicensed content by introducing a new restriction of Fire TV devices. Users who attempt to install some side loaded apps are now greeted with a full-screen warning which reads, ‘app installation blocked’, citing access to unlicensed content as the reason. This new functionality marks a significant escalation from Amazon’s earlier measures, which only prevented the use of such apps once they were installed.This move by Amazon is mainly aimed at curbing the problem of piracy. Many of the side loaded app are used to stream pirated movies, TV shows and live sports which undermines content providers and violates licensing agreements. By blocking installation outright, Amazon is singling its commitment to protect intellectual property and ensure Fire TV remains a legitimate streaming platform.For users, this change means fewer options for customization and access to unofficial apps. Those who relied on sideloading to watch free or region-restricted content will find their choices limited. Amazon is encouraging users to stick with its official Appstore, where apps are vetted for safety and licensing. While this enhances security, it also reduces flexibility for tech-savvy users who enjoyed experimenting with third-party apps.","Amazon has introduced a new restriction of Fire TV devices.

"Why Pentagon and Anthropic may be clashing, just days after CEO’s 20,000-word essay on right use of AI in…",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-pentagon-and-anthropic-may-be-clashing-just-days-after-ceos-20000-word-essay-on-right-use-of-ai-in/articleshow/127817256.cms,"Anthropic’s reported conflict with Pentagon over AI use in national security



Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s AI warning in his 20,000-word essay



We need to draw a hard line against AI abuses within democracies. There need to be limits to what we allow our governments to do with AI, so that they don’t seize power or repress their own people. The formulation I have come up with is that we should use AI for national defense in all ways except those which would make us more like our autocratic adversaries.

Where should the line be drawn? In the list at the beginning of this section, two items—using AI for

domestic mass surveillance

and mass propaganda—seem to me like bright red lines and entirely illegitimate. Some might argue that there’s no need to do anything (at least in the US), since domestic mass surveillance is already illegal under the Fourth Amendment. But the rapid progress of AI may create situations that our existing legal frameworks are not well designed to deal with. For example, it would likely not be unconstitutional for the US government to conduct massively scaled recordings of all public conversations (e.g., things people say to each other on a street corner), and previously it would have been difficult to sort through this volume of information, but with AI it could all be transcribed, interpreted, and triangulated to create a picture of the attitude and loyalties of many or most citizens. I would support civil liberties-focused legislation (or maybe even a constitutional amendment) that imposes stronger guardrails against AI-powered abuses.

The other two items—fully autonomous weapons and AI for strategic decision-making—are harder lines to draw since they have legitimate uses in defending democracy, while also being prone to abuse. Here I think what is warranted is extreme care and scrutiny combined with guardrails to prevent abuses. My main fear is having too small a number of “fingers on the button,” such that one or a handful of people could essentially operate a drone army without needing any other humans to cooperate to carry out their orders. As AI systems get more powerful, we may need to have more direct and immediate oversight mechanisms to ensure they are not misused, perhaps involving branches of government other than the executive. I think we should approach fully autonomous weapons in particular with great caution,36 and not rush into their use without proper safeguards.

Anthropic and Pentagon are reportedly at odds, potentially stalling a high-stakes $200 million partnership between the AI startup and defense department. The standstill is said to be over a fundamental clash of ethics and authority on how to use artificial intelligent (AI) solutions for national defense. Citing sources familiar with the matter, news agency Reuters has reported that the developer is resisting government demands that would allow its technology to be used for autonomous weapons targeting and domestic surveillance within America.Anthropic has reportedly insisted on safeguards that would prevent its models from being used to spy on American citizens or assist in lethal weapons targeting without direct human oversight. The report said that these “safety guardrails” are baked into the core training of Anthropic’s AI models, essentially making them resistant to taking actions that could lead to harm.However, Pentagon officials have ‘bristled’ at these restrictions. Citing a January 9 department memo on AI strategy, the government argues it should have the right to deploy commercial AI however it sees fit as long as the actions comply with US law.It also said that US law compliance is regardless of a private company's internal usage policies.“We are in productive discussions with the Department of War about ways to continue that work,” a spokesperson for Anthropic stated, though they maintained that their AI is currently used for “national security missions” that fall outside of the disputed lethal categories.The standoff is been reported days after Amodei said in his 20,000-word essay that while AI should support national defense, it must draw a line when it comes to ‘AI abuse’. Here’s what he said.","Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in his 20,000-word essay that while AI should support national defense, it must draw a line when it comes to ‘AI abuse’ The standstill is said to be over a fundamental clash of ethics and authority.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127817262,imgsize-18556,width-400,resizemode-4/anthropic.jpg"

The legislation, now a point of contention in US trade negotiations, requires tech firms to fund Canadian journalism. Meta seeks an exemption, while Google already contributes significantly.

“We want news back. How do we go there? That's the question mark, and that's why we are having these conversations. We are looking at how to get there,”

What Meta said about bringing back Facebook News in Canada

“flexible”

Canadian government officials are reportedly in talks with Meta about restoring news to Facebook. This comes as the Online News Act, which prompted the tech giant to end access to journalism on its platforms in Canada, has become part of trade negotiations with the United States, a report claims. In 2023, the social media giant blocked all news on Facebook and Instagram in response to the act, which would have required it to inject funds into Canada's news industry for carrying its content.According to a report by Canadian publication The Globe and Mail, the Online News Act, which became law in 2023, has come under scrutiny by the Trump administration, which regards it, along with Ottawa's Online Streaming Act, as a trade irritant. The report claims that both laws affect American digital giants.Meta has consistently said it will not pay for news posted on its platforms. The company would need an exemption from the Online News Act to avoid a legal obligation to contribute to Canada's journalism industry. Meanwhile, Google , which did agree to pay Canadian news publishers under the act, injects $100 million annually into the industry. Almost two-thirds of that goes to written media, including local newspapers serving francophone and Indigenous communities.Canada capped the CBC's share of the funds, which are indexed to inflation, at $7 million, with other broadcasters getting no more than $30 million.In a statement to The Globe and Mail, Alisson Levesque, a spokesperson for Canadian Identity Minister Marc Miller, confirmed that preliminary talks between Meta and the Heritage Department are underway.Levesque said.In October 2025, Rachel Curran, head of public policy at Meta Canada, told the Commons heritage committee that the tech giant would like to bring news back onto Facebook. She said she was “hopeful that the government will take another look at that legislation, which we think misrepresents the value exchange between publishers and our platforms.”“News publishers place their content on our platforms because they get increased distribution and then can monetise the clicks that they receive as a result of that distribution. So we think we are in a very different situation from Google. But that said, we would love to put news back on our platforms, and we are hopeful that can happen,” Curran told the committee.In a recent interview with The Logic, Canadian Minister Miller said Ottawa is willing to beon the Online News Act and the Online Streaming Act amid trade negotiations. But he said the US will not be able to dictate the terms, and there are some lines the government will not cross. Last year, the Canadian government gave in to pressure from the White House and cancelled a proposed digital services tax.“The United States Government has made its views known regarding the Online News Act and Online Streaming Act, including in testimony before Congress. To protect the integrity of past and future engagements with the US, we will refrain from commenting directly on the negotiations which are being led by [Canada-US Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc],” Levesque added in her statement.Last month, members of Canada's broadcasting and cultural sector warned that an increasing number of Canadian TV and radio stations could close if the federal Online Streaming Act becomes a casualty of the trade war with the US. The act, which became law in 2023, requires foreign platforms such as Netflix to support Canada's TV, film and music sectors financially.Kevin Desjardins, president of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters, said last month that if the act is shelved as a result of American pressure, it would prove a “crushing blow” to Canada's cultural sector. In December 2025, 27 bipartisan members of Washington's House Ways and Means Committee, led by Republican Lloyd Smucker and Democrat Linda Sanchez, wrote to LeBlanc and Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to the US, calling on Ottawa to rescind the act.","Canadian government officials are reportedly in talks with Meta about restoring news to Facebook.

Why Elon Musk wants to merge his companies



Michael Burry, one of America’s most popular investor has now weighed in on Elon Musk ’s ambitious vision of Future. Burry has called Tesla and SpaceX CEO an ‘American treasure’ but has also cautioned that the future Musk is building is ‘much further away than he thinks’. As reported by Business Insider, in a series of posts shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) and his Substack, Burry described Musk as a ‘desperate incentivised futurist’ who believes in generating enormous profit from his vision becoming a reality. He went ahead and compared the SpaceX CEO with PT Barnum and Thomas Edison. He also believes that Musk will go down in history as both a showman and an inventor.Burry, who is known for making early but ultimately right market predictions, argued that futurists are “always decades early” and often sell visions with indefinite timelines that allow them to raise capital. He feels that the grand projects of Elon Musk ranging from colonising Mars to deploying millions of robotaxis fit in this mold.Along with this, Burry also pointed out the reports that Musk is planning a potential merger between SpaceX, Tesla, and his AI startup xAI. He noted that the market had already priced in such a move, with combined valuations of:* SpaceX: $800 billion (private share sale, December 2025)* Tesla: $1.3 trillion market cap* xAI: $230 billion (fundraising, November 2025)Burry said the trio’s combined worth of $1.6 trillion “more than encompasses” their current and future value.The report said that for SpaceX, the primary rationale for merging xAI may be the escalating AI arms race as it has signaled launching data centres into orbit. By integrating xAI's software directly with Starlink's hardware, Musk may create a globally accessible, space-based AI network that is physically shielded from terrestrial disruptions.Meanwhile, Bloomberg reports that some investors are pushing for an alternative: a merger between Tesla and xAI. This will ensure that xAI’s ""Full Self-Driving"" (FSD) and robotics are best utilised within Tesla’s EV and humanoid robot (Optimus) programs.""I think it's highly likely that xAI ends up with one of the two parties. What's important for Elon is to have a massive vision that's way out there that he's early on,” Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, was quoted as saying.“Musk has too many separate companies. A major risk thesis for Tesla is that Musk is spreading himself out too much. As a Tesla shareholder, I applaud further consolidation,” added Dennis Dick, chief market strategist at Stock Trader Network.Two new entities were established in Nevada on January 21, with filings listing SpaceX and its CFO, Bret Johnsen, as managing members, the report said.","Michael Burry, one of America’s most popular investor has now weighed in on Elon Musk ’s ambitious vision of Future.

The jury’s verdict follows an 11-day trial before U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria for the Northern District of California.“This conviction exposes a calculated breach of trust involving some of the most advanced AI technology in the world at a critical moment in AI development,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg. “Ding abused his privileged access to steal AI trade secrets while pursuing PRC government-aligned ventures. His duplicity put U.S. technological leadership and competitiveness at risk. I commend the trial team and investigators whose exceptional work resulted in this conviction.”“In today’s high-stakes race to dominate the field of artificial intelligence, Linwei Ding betrayed both the U.S. and his employer by stealing trade secrets about Google’s AI technology on behalf of China’s government,” said Assistant Director Roman Rozhavsky of the FBI's Counterintelligence and Espionage Division.“Not only does this case mark the first-ever conviction on AI-related economic espionage charges, but it also demonstrates the FBI’s unwavering dedication to protecting American businesses from the increasingly severe threat China poses to our economic and national security. We remain committed to working closely with our partners across the private sector to protect our nation’s innovation, safeguard our trade secrets, and hold our foreign adversaries accountable.”“Silicon Valley is at the forefront of artificial intelligence innovation, pioneering transformative work that drives economic growth and strengthens our national security. The jury delivered a clear message today that the theft of this valuable technology will not go unpunished. We will vigorously protect American intellectual capital from foreign interests that seek to gain an unfair competitive advantage while putting our national security at risk,” said U.S. Attorney Craig H. Missakian for the Northern District of California.“This conviction reinforces the FBI’s steadfast commitment to protecting American innovation and national security. The theft and misuse of advanced artificial intelligence technology for the benefit of the People’s Republic of China threatens our technological edge and economic competitiveness,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Sanjay Virmani for the San Francisco Field Office. “The FBI San Francisco division serves Silicon Valley and the companies who lead the world in innovation, and we are committed to safeguarding their work. This case demonstrates the strength of collaboration between the FBI and the private sector, including leading companies like Google, whose partnership is critical to protecting sensitive U.S. technology. Today’s verdict affirms that federal law will be enforced to protect our nation’s most valuable technologies and hold those who steal them accountable.”Ding was originally indicted in March 2024. A superseding indictment returned in February 2025 described seven categories of trade secrets stolen by Ding and charged Ding with seven counts of economic espionage and seven counts of theft of trade secrets.According to the evidence presented at trial, between approximately May 2022 and April 2023, while a Google employee, Ding stole more than two thousand pages of confidential information containing Google’s AI trade secrets from Google’s network and uploaded them to his personal Google Cloud account. Ding also secretly affiliated himself with two PRC-based technology companies while he was employed by Google: around June 2022, Ding was in discussions to be the Chief Technology Officer for an early-stage technology company based in the PRC; by early 2023, Ding was in the process of founding his own technology company in the PRC focused on AI and machine learning and was acting as the company’s CEO. In multiple statements to potential investors, Ding claimed that he could build an AI supercomputer by copying and modifying Google’s technology. In December 2023, less than two weeks before he resigned from Google, Ding downloaded the stolen Google trade secrets to his own personal computer.The jury found that Ding stole trade secrets relating to the hardware infrastructure and software platforms that allow Google’s supercomputing data center to train and serve large AI models. The trade secrets contained detailed information about the architecture and functionality of Google’s custom Tensor Processing Unit chips and systems and Google’s Graphics Processing Unit systems, the software that allows the chips to communicate and execute tasks, and the software that orchestrates thousands of chips into a supercomputer capable of training and executing cutting-edge AI workloads. The trade secrets also pertained to Google’s custom-designed SmartNIC, a type of network interface card used to facilitate high speed communication within Google’s AI supercomputers and cloud networking products.In presentations to investors, Ding called out the PRC’s national policies prioritizing AI development and innovation in the PRC, and in late 2023 Ding applied for a government sponsored “talent plan” in Shanghai, PRC. The jury heard evidence pertaining to the PRC government’s establishment of talent plans to encourage individuals to come to China to contribute to the PRC’s economic and technological growth. Ding’s application for this talent plan stated that he planned to “help China to have computing power infrastructure capabilities that are on par with the international level. ” The evidence at trial also showed that Ding intended to benefit two entities controlled by the government of China by assisting with the development of an AI supercomputer and collaborating on the research and development of custom machine learning chips.Ding is next scheduled to appear at a status conference on Feb. 3, 2026. Ding faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for each count of theft of trade secrets in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1832 and 15 years in prison for each count of economic espionage in violation of 18 U.S.C § 1831. Any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the Court only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. § 3553.Assistant U.S. Attorneys for the Northern District of California Casey Boome, Molly K. Priedeman, and Roland Chang are prosecuting this case, with assistance from Veronica Hernandez and Trial Attorney Yifei Zheng from the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, National Security Division.

This move, ahead of SpaceX's planned $1.5 trillion IPO, could create a powerful entity focused on space-based AI infrastructure or an energy-meets-exploration powerhouse. Planning appears advanced with new Nevada entities registered.

The xAI deal: Building AI infrastructure in orbit

The Tesla scenario: Energy meets exploration

Elon Musk is considering merging SpaceX with either his AI startup xAI or electric vehicle maker Tesla, a consolidation that would reshape his already intertwined business empire just months before SpaceX's highly anticipated public debut.The Wall Street Journal, Reuters, and Bloomberg all reported on the talks Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. While no final decisions have been made, two ""merger sub"" entities were registered in Nevada on January 21, with SpaceX CFO Bret Johnsen listed as an officer—suggesting the planning is more than theoretical.SpaceX is preparing for a summer IPO that could value it at $1.5 trillion, making it the largest stock market debut in history. But which merger path Musk chooses could fundamentally alter what investors are actually buying into.Merging SpaceX with xAI would advance Musk's stated goal of launching data centers into space. At the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, he declared that ""the lowest-cost place to put AI will be space"" within two or three years, powered by solar energy and free from Earth's energy grid constraints.xAI, valued at $230 billion in November, owns the Grok chatbot and X social media platform.Combining it with SpaceX would create a vertically integrated operation spanning rockets, satellite internet through Starlink, AI development, and social media distribution. According to Reuters, xAI shares would convert to SpaceX stock, though some executives might receive cash instead.The deal could also strengthen SpaceX's Pentagon relationships. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited SpaceX's Texas facility earlier this month, announcing plans to integrate Grok into military networks. xAI already has contracts worth up to $200 million with the Department of Defense.Bloomberg reports that some investors are pushing for a SpaceX-Tesla combination instead. The logic is straightforward: Tesla manufactures the energy storage systems that could help SpaceX run those orbital data centers on solar power.There's overlap in Musk's vision, too. He's discussed using Starship rockets to transport Tesla's Optimus humanoid robots to the moon and eventually Mars. Tesla just announced it's converting its Fremont factory from producing Model S and Model X vehicles to making Optimus robots, signaling a pivot toward what the company calls ""physical AI.""The merry-go-round of investments between Musk's companies adds another layer. SpaceX put $2 billion into xAI last year, and Tesla disclosed its own $2 billion xAI investment on Wednesday. Tesla also sold $430 million worth of backup batteries to xAI in 2025, according to CNBC.Musk has form here—he merged X into xAI last year in a deal that valued the combined entity at $113 billion. Any new merger would likely delay the June IPO, but it might also let Musk beat OpenAI and Anthropic in the race to become the first major AI company to go public.","Elon Musk is considering merging SpaceX with either his AI startup xAI or electric car giant Tesla.

On February 13, 2026, OpenAI is officially retiring GPT-4o, along with GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and o4-mini. GPT-4o has been a favourite tool for creative work and conversational tasks. People reportedly loved its warmth, its casual style, the way it felt more personal than other models.For a while, GPT-4o was temporarily restored after being deprecated. Users asked for more time to transition, especially those relying on it for brainstorming, writing, and ideation. That feedback, it appears, shaped the new GPT-5.1 and 5.2 updates. Many users say the change marks an emotional shift, not just technical, altering workflows, habits, trust, and creative comfort unexpectedly.GPT‑4o wasn’t just another AI. It reportedly had a style people loved. For creative ideation, it was the go-to for writers, marketers and researchers that all seemed to prefer over more rigid versions. GPT‑5.1 and 5.2 are now more flexible. You can choose tones like “Friendly,” adjust warmth, tweak enthusiasm. The idea is that ChatGPT feels more personal, not just more capable. Users can control how it responds, without needing complicated prompts.OpenAI says these retirements let them focus on models most people use. GPT‑5.2 has become the standard. Creative writing, casual conversations, and problem-solving tasks are all happening there. The retirement also reflects the company’s broader plan to improve ChatGPT’s personality and creativity. Unnecessary refusals are being reduced.Some users will feel the loss. Those still relying on GPT‑4o for key workflows will need to adjust.

Software stocks are coming down hard. I see it as massively over-valued companies coming down. But the quoted post argues ""AI based code will destroy the software industry"".

First, I don't see why any mature software company should trade at 30-40 PE. I think 10 or 15 is where they will go.

I also think the E will drop - Salesforce or Service Now have gotten away with exorbitant prices so far and they won't be able to. When they lose their high PE and their E also drops, it would feel like death - given that companies like Salesforce are merely ""use high flying stock to acquire start-ups and then use high pressure sales teams to upsell"" they won't be able to get away with that model very long. That is the functional equivalent of death.

But is that due to AI? I like to think it is good old-fashioned competition.

AI will accelerate the competition. But will AI mean all enterprise apps will be done by in-house IT or IT services firms at very low cost? Possible but my bet is ""far lower cost of enterprise software"".

In any case, Indian IT services firms can prosper at the expense of Salesforce etc by offering to replace Salesforce and migrate the customer and save them 60-80%. That is a huge opportunity for IT services firms.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has said that falling software stocks are creating a major opportunity for Indian IT services companies, as he questioned high valuations and business models of large global software firms. In a post shared on social media platform X, the Zoho founder said many software companies were “massively over-valued” and are now seeing sharp corrections. Vembu’s post came after Microsoft witnessed its worst stock market days recently after it lost $400 billion in just a few hours as the company’s stock plunged.In the post, Sridhar Vembu said software stocks are “coming down hard” because many mature software companies were trading at price-to-earnings ratios of 30 to 40, which he believes are unsustainable. According to him, valuations in the range of 10 to 15 are more realistic for such firms. He also said that earnings at some large enterprise software companies could come under pressure, which would further hurt their stock prices.Referring to companies such as Salesforce and ServiceNow, Vembu said these firms have been able to charge high prices for their products so far. He added that this pricing power may not last, and when both valuations and earnings fall, it could feel like a major shock for investors.While some market observers argue that artificial intelligence could “destroy” the software industry, Vembu said he does not fully agree with that view. Instead, he described the current changes as a result of increased competition, which AI may accelerate.According to Vembu, AI could lead to a much lower cost of enterprise software, even if it does not completely replace large software platforms. He said it is possible that some enterprise applications may be built in-house or through IT services firms at a lower cost.Vembu said this creates a clear opportunity for Indian IT services companies. He noted that these firms can offer to replace expensive enterprise software platforms, migrate customers to new systems, and help them save between 60% and 80% on costs. He described this as a “huge opportunity” for Indian IT companies to grow at the expense of large global software vendors.His comments come at a time when global tech stocks are facing pressure and companies are reassessing spending on software and technology services.","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu said falling software stocks are creating a major opportunity for Indian IT services companies.

The 2025 iPhone that Apple may not launch a successor of in 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-2025-iphone-whose-successor-apple-may-not-launch-in-2026/articleshow/127814728.cms,"Apple may skip iPhone 18 in 2026

Supply chain constraints ‘likely’ reason

Apple launched iPhone Air in September last year along with its iPhone 17 series. The smartphone features a 5.6mm thin profile, making it ‘thinnest iPhone ever’. A new report now suggests that users waiting for the next version of the iPhone Air may have to wait longer. The Cupertino-based company is unlikely to launch a second-generation iPhone Air in 2026. “Apple has at least five new iPhone models in the pipeline,” Nikkei Asia reports. These will include “a revamped iPhone Air, its thinnest-ever model; the standard new iPhone; and three premium models.” However, there is no clarity on when iPhone Air shipments will start, the report says adding it is not expected in 2026.“It is not yet clear when shipments of the Air will start, but they are not expected this year,” the report adds.Apple iPhone Air is not the only iPhone that the firm may skip this year. As per the report, Apple may skip a 2026 launch for the iPhone 18 and push its debut to 2027.The report cites four people aware of the matter who say that Apple will prioritise premium iPhone launches in 2026 due to the global memory crunch. The tech giant is said to focus on delivering its first-ever foldable iPhone as well as two Pro models for its launch in the second half of the year and the the standard iPhone 18 model will be scheduled for shipment in the first half of 2027.“Apple is prioritizing the production and shipment of its three most premium new iPhone models for 2026 while pushing back the shipment of its standard model amid a marketing strategy change and supply chain crunch,” it says.""Supply chain smoothness is one of the key challenges for this year, and the marketing strategy change also played a part in the decision [to prioritize premium models],"" the report quotes an executive with an iPhone supplier who has direct knowledge of the plan.The report indicates that Apple seems to have started to feel the effects of soaring memory prices, and to minimize any potential production hiccups, the company is taking measures to keep things running smoothly.A Nikkei Asia report earlier stated that the tech supply chain, particularly the consumer electronics segment, is facing mounting pressure over a supply crunch for memory chips and various materials. Not just Apple, but other Chinese smartphone makers, including Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and Transsion, have lowered their shipment forecasts for this year.","Apple launched iPhone Air in September last year along with its iPhone 17 series.

Crypto CEO who has become the No 1 enemy of America's biggest banks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/crypto-ceo-who-has-become-the-no-1-enemy-of-americas-biggest-banks/articleshow/127812350.cms,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong faced a heated exchange with JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon at Davos, accusing banks of lobbying against crypto legislation. Banks, fearing competition from stablecoin rewards, are pushing back against crypto's expansion into consumer finance. This tension highlights a growing rift as digital assets move mainstream, with potential legislative battles ahead.

“You are full of s***,”

What may have fueled Brian Armstrong’s uncomfortable run-ins with bank CEOs at Davos

“After reviewing the Senate Banking draft text over the last 48hrs, Coinbase unfortunately can’t support the bill as written.There are too many issues, including:

- A defacto ban on tokenized equities

- DeFi prohibitions, giving the government unlimited access to your financial records and removing your right to privacy

- Erosion of the CFTC’s authority, stifling innovation and making it subservient to the SEC

- Draft amendments that would kill rewards on stablecoins, allowing banks to ban their competition

We appreciate all the hard work by members of the Senate to reach a bipartisan outcome, but this version would be materially worse than the current status quo.

We’d rather have no bill than a bad bill. Hopefully we can all get to a better draft.

We'll keep fighting for all Americans and for economic freedom. Crypto needs to be treated on a level playing field with the rest of financial services so we can build this industry in a safe and trusted way in America.”

""out there trying to ban their competition""

""without their permission essentially.""

""If you want to be a bank, just be a bank,""

Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong reportedly had an intense moment with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon during last week’s World Economic Forum in Davos. A report claims that the CEO of the biggest US crypto company was confronted by the chief executive of the biggest bank of US over accusations that banks are trying to sabotage crypto legislation.A report by The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the conversation, claimed that Dimon told Armstrong to stop lying on TV.Dimon, a long-time sceptic who has previously described cryptocurrency as a fraud, said while pointing his index finger directly at Armstrong's face as the Coinbase chief was having coffee with former UK prime minister Tony Blair.This comes after Armstrong accused banks of trying to sabotage legislation that would set a new regulatory framework for digital assets during appearances on business TV programmes earlier that week. However, the confrontation wasn't quite in line with the annual forum's mission to foster cooperation among global leaders.As crypto moves into the mainstream of American finance, some of Wall Street's major players are waking up to the threat. While banks have embraced some aspects of crypto, helping people invest in bitcoin and using digital assets to make money transfers more efficient, they are drawing a line at encroachment on their core business, which is consumer deposits.Banks and Coinbase are at odds over whether crypto exchanges should be allowed to offer consumers regular payouts for holding digital tokens. These so-called rewards would pay holders of stablecoins a recurring fee, say 3.5%. Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to real-world currencies like the US dollar.Banks say the payouts are effectively the same as interest on bank accounts, and since banks offer much lower yields, typically under 0.1% in a checking account, they worry that consumers will shift large amounts of money into crypto. According to the banks, this will compromise community banks and business lending.Armstrong and others in the crypto world have argued that the free market should reign and that banks can simply pay higher interest rates to compete with stablecoins or enter the stablecoin business themselves.However, the legislation, known as the Clarity Act, may shape the future of everyday financial services, including bank deposits and electronic payments. In a push to reach a compromise, the White House plans to host a meeting between bank and crypto industry groups with US President Donald Trump's AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, expected to attend, the WSJ report claimed, citing people familiar with the matter. Coinbase's head of US policy, Kara Calvert, is also slated to attend, the report added.Recently, a Senate committee was prepared to vote on a version of the legislation that could effectively ban companies like Coinbase from offering payouts to customers, which could’ve potentially cost crypto companies billions of dollars. Just before the vote, Armstrong took to microblogging site X (formerly Twitter) to write:As per the report, the vote was abruptly postponed within hours of the post being shared. Armstrong's pushback didn't end with his X post. He echoed his view in TV appearances, telling Bloomberg that bank lobbyists wereand accusing banks of lending out their customers' depositsThis led to a series of uncomfortable encounters with bank CEOs at Davos, described by people familiar with the conversations.Bank of America chief executive Brian Moynihan told Armstrong during a 30-minute meeting last week at the main convention centre in Davos, the report noted.Citigroup's Jane Fraser gave Armstrong less than a minute of her time. Coinbase is a client of both Citi and JPMorgan, and the exchange has business partnerships with other banks.Meanwhile, Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf offered Armstrong not even a minute. When Armstrong approached him, Scharf told him that there was nothing for them to talk about. The exchange took place while Dimon, Scharf's former boss, stood nearby, the report added.",Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong reportedly had an intense moment with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon during last week’s World Economic Forum in Davos.

"After lawsuit one of the biggest Amazon customers Perplexity signs $750 million deal with Microsoft, says: 'AWS remains…'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/after-lawsuit-one-of-the-biggest-amazon-customers-perplexity-signs-750-million-deal-with-microsoft-says-aws-remains/articleshow/127812618.cms,"“We are excited to partner with Microsoft for access to frontier models from X, OpenAI and Anthropic. AWS remains Perplexity's preferred cloud infrastructure provider, and we're excited to announce expansions of that partnership in the coming weeks.”

“a threat to user choice”

“hundreds of millions”

“all-in”

How will this Perplexity deal help Microsoft

“Our customers expect to use multiple models as part of any workload. And we offer the broadest selection of models of any hyperscaler.”

Perplexity has signed a $750 million deal with Microsoft Azure. With this deal, the AI startup is expanding its business beyond its long-time cloud partner, Amazon. The three-year commitment will allow Perplexity to deploy AI models through Microsoft's Foundry service, including those from OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI, a report claimed, citing people familiar with the deal, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter. However, a Perplexity spokesperson has confirmed that as part of the Microsoft deal, the company hasn't shifted spending from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has long been the startup's primary cloud provider.In a statement to Bloomberg, a Perplexity spokesperson said,This deal comes after Perplexity and Amazon got engaged in a legal fight last year. In November 2025, Amazon sued Perplexity to prevent the startup from allowing consumers to use its AI tools to shop on Amazon's online marketplace. Perplexity responded by calling Amazon a bully and its actions. Meanwhile, that same month, Perplexity AI CEO Aravind Srinivas said his company had receivedin commitments from AWS.Perplexity built much of its business on AWS, using Amazon's Bedrock service to access Anthropic models for Perplexity's search engine. Srinivas is also a repeat speaker at AWS conferences. In a 2023 appearance, he said that he had decided to goon Amazon's cloud. AWS, in turn, has cited Perplexity as a cutting-edge AI customer using its services.For Microsoft, the Perplexity deal strengthens its efforts to position Azure as the platform for building AI applications and deploying models from a variety of vendors. Microsoft has long offered models from its partner OpenAI. In November 2025, the company also struck a deal with Anthropic to do the same.Earlier this week, during an earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said,Over 1,500 Microsoft Foundry customers have already used both OpenAI and Anthropic models, Nadella said. The number of customers spending over $1 million per quarter on Foundry grew nearly 80% in the quarter which ended in December 2025, he added.Perplexity is a high-value AI startup but faces tough competition from Alphabet Inc.'s Google and OpenAI in its goal of changing how people search for information online. It also hasn't raised nearly as much money as OpenAI and Anthropic, which have recently made a series of infrastructure deals.Large companies typically rent cloud services from multiple providers, both to access unique capabilities and to avoid overreliance on any single vendor. This has increased during the AI era, as businesses test new tools and sign deals with model makers and cloud providers whose servers run that software.","Perplexity has signed a $750 million deal with Microsoft Azure.

Cloudflare says automated systems detected, mitigated attacks



Cloudflare, the web infrastructure giant, has said that it has successfully mitigated the “the largest attack ever disclosed publicly.” In its 2025 Q4 DDoS Threat Report (via Bleeping Computer), the company detailed a ‘record-breaking’ bombardment by the Aisuru/Kimwolf botnet, which peaked at a 31.4 Terabits per second (Tbps). Cloudflare came into spotlight after hundreds of websites were down in November.The report said that the hacking campaign was dubbed “The Night Before Christmas”, and targeted telecommunications providers, IT organisations and Cloudflare’s own dashboard infrastructure on December 19, 2025. It also claimed that the attack was “hyper-volumetric”, which means that it relied on sheer force to overwhelm networks.“The campaign targeted Cloudflare customers as well as Cloudflare’s dashboard and infrastructure with hyper-volumetric HTTP DDoS attacks exceeding rates of 200 million requests per second (rps) alongside Layer 4 DDoS attacks peaking at 31.4 Terabits per second, making it the largest attack ever disclosed publicly,” Cloudflare said in the report.Cloudflare reported that its automated systems detected and neutralised the threats so efficiently that no internal human alerts were even triggered.The company also reported that unlike other attacks which utilise compromised routers or basic Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the “Night Before Christmas” campaign came from compromised Android TVs.According to the web infrastructure giant, most of these attacks were short-lived but intense. About 50% of them lasted between one and two minutes, and 90% of the attacks peaked between 1–5 Tbps. Furthermore, the largest source of the year's attacks was reported to be from Bangladesh, followed by Ecuador, Indonesia and Argentina.When it comes to targets, China and Hong Kong were the most frequently attacked countries. Aisuru botnet previously held the record at 29.7 Tbps and once being attributed to a 15.72 Tbps attack on Microsoft. In 2025, Cloudflare recorded a 121% increase in DDoS incidents compared to 2024, totaling 47.1 million unique attacks.","Cloudflare says automated systems detected, mitigated attacks by Aisuru/Kimwolf botnet.

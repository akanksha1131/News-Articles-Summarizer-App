Whirlpool Corporation has announced a significant workforce reduction, laying off 651 employees at its manufacturing plant in Amana, Iowa. The layoffs, effective June 1, 2025, represent approximately one-third of the plant's workforce and are attributed to declining consumer demand for certain refrigeration products manufactured at the facility.In an official statement, Whirlpool explained that the decision was driven by the need to align production with current market conditions. The company emphasised that the layoffs were not influenced by external factors such as tariffs but were instead a strategic move to address reduced demand for specific appliances.“Whirlpool Corporation has made necessary adjustments to production at its Amana operations to align with current market conditions driven by consumer demand. This has resulted in the announcement of a workforce reduction of approximately 650 employees within specific production teams at the facility. We are committed to supporting affected employees through this transition by providing access to onsite HR support and a dedicated employee support line, an employee assistance program, and guidance on unemployment benefits through Iowa Workforce Development ,” Whirlpool spokesperson told TV9.Whirlpool has pledged to support the impacted employees during this transition. The company is providing access to onsite HR support, a dedicated employee assistance program, and guidance on unemployment benefits through Iowa Workforce Development. Despite these measures, the layoffs have sparked criticism from labor unions and advocacy groups.The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), which represents many of the affected employees, expressed deep concern over the decision. In a statement, the union highlighted the significant impact on the local community, which relies heavily on the jobs provided by the Amana facility.The Iowa Federation of Labor AFL-CIO also criticised the layoffs, calling them ""outrageous"" given Whirlpool's reported $17 billion in sales last year. Union leaders have urged state legislators to restore unemployment benefits that were recently reduced, arguing that the cuts leave displaced workers with fewer options during economic uncertainty.","Whirlpool Corporation has announced a significant workforce reduction, laying off 651 employees at its manufacturing plant in Amana, Iowa.

Prior to becoming the Amazon CEO, Andy Jassy had an atypical career. He served in a variety of industries, from sportscasting to coaching football, retail sales, and even investment banking. It wasn't until he tested his talents in other professions that he discovered his calling at Amazon, where he spent more than 28 years to rise to become one of the most familiar faces in the tech industry. In a recent blog entry, Jassy discussed some of the major lessons he learned over his career that he feels are necessary to succeed. They include personal development, resilience, and adaptability.Andy Jassy's career trajectory shows that it is not about discovering the ideal job but about developing an attitude of appreciating passion, adaptability, and ongoing learning.Jassy emphasizes the necessity of finding something that you have a passion for doing and which makes you feel fulfilled. He feels you have to work in what you are good at and love, for as he succinctly says, ""Life is too short to do things that don't make you feel good about how you spend your days."" To him, working within the line of interest can become a lot more fulfilling working existence, and the daily toil becomes a cause of pride for him.Create a career that gets you excited and inspires you for long-term satisfaction.Another important lesson from Jassy's career is learning to experiment, even if they do not seem to be on the trajectory of where you are headed at present. He feels that finding out what you do not want to do is just as important as finding out what you do want to do. From his own experience, changing careers is not only possible, but it is also a necessity for growth. Jassy advises you to keep yourself open to possibilities, stating, ""You have the opportunity to write your own story.""Try out different careers and be open to changes since it helps to identify your real interests.Jassy understands that failure is something that comes with trying and experimenting with boundaries. He understands that mistakes are lessons in the process. Learning from his own experiences, he revealed that all the valuable lessons that he learned were from things that failed. Rather than dwelling on failure, Jassy promotes resilience: ""The key is not to fall apart, but to learn from what didn't go right and apply those lessons to the next challenge.""Accept failure as a learning experience, and use it as motivation to do better and be stronger.For Jassy, professional success is as much a matter of attitude as of talent. He is of the opinion that the right attitude will be the difference between success and failure. Hard work, reliability, team player, positive attitude - that is what it boils down to. ""Do you work hard? Can people trust you? Are you a can-do person?"" he asks. All these, he feels, are the keys to professional success.Develop a positive, work-oriented attitude that creates confidence and collaboration.Jassy emphasises the need for ongoing learning throughout your career. He has discovered that those who continue to learn stay up-to-date and successful, whereas those who cease expanding threaten to fall apart. ""The second you don't learn anymore is the second you begin to come apart,"" he warns. Personal growth doesn't necessarily come with an age or title, as much as Jassy sees it—it's a question of lifelong dedication to growing and changing.Be curious and never stop learning as this makes you competitive and adaptable in an ever-changing world.","Andy Jassy is the CEO of Amazon, the world's largest online retailer.

How America's 'Maths problem' can be solved

American universities have a 'Maths problem'. So claimed the financial app CEO Patrick Collison in a Twitter post recently that also got the attention of the Tesla CEO Elon Musk . In a post on Twitter, the Stripe CEO wrote that an MIT Maths professor recently told him about the significant decline in the Mathematical proficiency of incoming students. He further added that Harvard University has even started remedial Math courses to help students bridge the gap in essential algebraic skills.""This week, a math professor at MIT told me that incoming students are, on average, noticeably worse at math than they used to be. Harvard, of course, just added a remedial math class, Math MA5, ""aimed at rectifying a lack of foundational algebra skills among students,"" wrote Collison. To this, Elon Musk responded in one word, ""Concerning'.Collison had quoted an earlier post of his where he had shared a Financial Times report that took the topic: ""Have humans passed peak brain power?"" It had graphs that showed how 'Performance in reasoning and problem-solving tests is declining'. Another graph showed a fall in the 'Average composite CT score'.In December 2024, The Harvard Gazette published the latest results of the 'Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study in America' that showed how US students’ Math scores trail those of many of their global peers. The results also revealed that the problem has only aggravated over the last few years as the US Math scores were lower in 2023 than they were in 2019. The test was given last year to fourth -- and eighth-graders around the world.In a conversation with the Gazette, Heather Hill, Hazen-Nicoli Professor in Teacher Learning and Practice at Harvard Graduate School of Education, painted a “disappointing picture,” including the damage done by learning loss during the Covid-19 Pandemic. One way to solve the issue she said is to improve the quality and quantity problem of Maths teachers in schools in America. ""There’s such a scarcity of math teachers, which is driving some of the instructional quality issues. We have teachers who don’t have a background in math teaching math, and we also have folks without a background in teaching or math teaching math. Solving teacher pipeline issues is also key,"" she said.","Stripe CEO Patrick Collison tweeted that an MIT Maths professor recently told him about the significant decline in the Mathematical proficiency of incoming students.

Chadha proposed leveraging the pending approvals for Elon Musk’s Starlink as a strategic tool to renegotiate what he termed the “Trump Tariffs.” During a session in the House, Chadha confronted the Union Minister for Communications, condemning the US for betraying India’s trust and undermining its goodwill with the tariff imposition. “We extended unwavering loyalty, only to be met with a tariff from the Trump Administration that threatens to devastate our economy,” he remarked, reciting a Hindi couplet about betrayal in friendship.Chadha emphasized India’s supportive policies toward American firms like Google and Facebook parent Meta, including tax incentives, as evidence of its amicable approach. In contrast, he noted, “our nation has been hit with a 26 percent retaliatory tariff.”Chadha pressed further, asking, “Shouldn’t India withhold Starlink’s necessary approvals to use as leverage in renegotiating the Trump Tariffs ?” He also questioned the government’s position on Starlink’s refusal to share data with Indian authorities, citing privacy laws. “How will the government address this resistance from Elon Musk’s Starlink regarding data sharing and the potential risks of misuse?” he inquired.Chadha alluded to broader concerns about US corporate influence, referencing Musk’s alleged threat to cut off Starlink services in Ukraine, which reportedly crippled its frontline defenses. He also cited an incident involving a Myanmar-based drug syndicate, uncovered in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which allegedly misused Starlink’s navigation satellite. He pointed out that Starlink declined to provide equipment details, again invoking privacy concerns.The AAP MP concluded by pressing the government on its strategy to tackle the alleged misuse of satellite internet spectrum, particularly by Starlink.",AAP MP Raghav Chadha has urged the Indian government to adopt a firm stance against the US.

Sridhar Vembu’s comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress , emphasizing the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s recent expansion in Kerala. The image in the party’s post shows a tombstone design to symbolically critique the ""Make in India"" initiative, suggesting it has failed between 2014 and 2025. The tombstone features the Indian lion emblem and the phrase ""Rest in Peace.""The post is captioned “In loving memory of….”. Responding to the post, Vembu emphasized the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s expansion in Kerala. He wrote:“Meanwhile companies like us Make in India (and started making in Kerala recently too).”“Make in India is gaining momentum and we have to make up for several lost decades. Reflect on why they were ""lost decades"" and perhaps you will appreciate Make in India better,” he further added.Zoho has been expanding its operations across India, including in Kerala. The company has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas as part of its broader strategy.The Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports. Several companies, including Zoho, have increased their domestic production efforts as part of this initiative.Vembu’s response comes amid ongoing discussions on India's economic policies and industrial growth, with businesses and policymakers debating the impact of past and present strategies.Vembu recently drew a comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods, highlighting their long-term impact on economic structures. In a recent post, he discussed how capital inflows into a single sector can divert resources from others, weakening overall economic capabilities.Citing Silicon Valley as an example, Vembu pointed out the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, attributing them to a talent shift toward sectors with higher financial incentives. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now – for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors overlooked the sector due to the absence of large exits.Drawing a parallel to India, Vembu noted that the long-standing dominance of the IT industry resulted in the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he stated.He stressed the importance of addressing these gaps and rebuilding capabilities in affected sectors. ""We have to make up for lost time,"" he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress. He emphasized the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s recent expansion in Kerala. Zoho has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119109563,imgsize-83630,width-400,resizemode-4/119109563.jpg"

Air Canada and Thales issue joint statement

JetBlue, British Airways and Swiss Airlines have faced similar issues in the past

Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories.” According to a report in CNN, Air Canada's Boeing 737 MAX fleet were found to have moving maps — part of the in flight entertainment (IFE) system — that did not show Israel as a state, but replaced it with the name "" Palestinian territories ."" The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.The discrepancy, first noticed by a passenger, involved maps produced for French aerospace group Thales. Air Canada and Thales issued a joint statement acknowledging the error and stating that the issue has been ""resolved."" ""It was brought to the attention of Air Canada that the interactive map on its Boeing 737 fleet did not consistently portray certain Middle Eastern boundaries, including those of the State of Israel, at all amplification levels,"" the statement said. ""Air Canada’s policy in general is to display only city names on the maps in its aircraft, and the configuration on this particular system was not compliant with this policy."" Thales added in a separate statement that the map had been provided by a third party.The map feature was promptly disabled, and an updated version will be installed across the fleet starting March 14. Air Canada and Thales apologized for the ""unease created by this situation.""This is not the first time such an issue has occurred in aviation. JetBlue apologized for a similar map error in 2024, and British Airways faced a similar situation in 2013. In 2018, SWISS confirmed its policy of turning off maps entirely when landing in Tel Aviv after a similar incident. Thales stated that the maps are supplied by a third party and that they are working with the airline and the provider to resolve the issue quickly.","Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories” The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.

Facebook’s extreme measures in India

A ""low-ranking official,"" or as some say an office Babu at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Meta (then Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and some of the 'brightest tech minds' in his team with nothing more than a single click, according to explosive claims in a newly released memoir by former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams.The David versus Goliath moment allegedly occurred in 2016 during Facebook's aggressive push to save its controversial Free Basics program in India, which was facing regulatory scrutiny for potentially violating net neutrality principles.""Mark and some of the brightest tech minds in the world devoted months to this [outreach strategy], and some low-ranking official in India outfoxed them simply by clicking an opt-out box,"" Wynn-Williams writes in her book ""Careless People,"" which Meta is currently trying to block from publication.The memoir details how Facebook deployed its full arsenal of technological and political influence to sway public opinion about Free Basics. When India's Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) opened public consultations on whether such programs should be banned, Facebook allegedly orchestrated an unprecedented pressure campaign.""Our policy team is directly engaged with the government, include Prime Minister Modi's office,"" Wynn-Williams quotes then-COO Sheryl Sandberg as writing in an internal email. ""We're lucky this is happening in a place where we have very deep senior relationships in the government, but it's still going to be hard.""According to the book, Facebook's strategy focused on creating ""the appearance of public support"" through automated emails. The social media giant allegedly turned on a ""megaphone that Mark wouldn't let Sheryl use for [promoting] organ donation"" to nudge Indian users into sending approximately 16 million supportive emails to TRAI.The jugaad – a Hindi term for an innovative, improvised solution – came when Facebook discovered their millions of automated emails weren't being counted. ""Someone at TRAI—whoever controlled the email address for the public comments — simply opted out of all emails from Facebook,"" writes Wynn-Williams.The book makes other startling claims about Facebook's operations in India, including that the company hired an ""ex-police captain"" who would ""go to jail in a clash between Facebook and the Indian government"" if executives were targeted in government raids.Meta has dismissed the book as containing ""out-of-date and previously reported claims"" and ""false accusations about our executives."" A spokesperson told The Hindu that ""Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behaviour,"" claiming she ""has been paid by anti-Facebook activists.""Despite Meta's arbitration efforts to halt its publication and promotion in the US, ""Careless People"" remains available for purchase in India. The company has not specifically contested the claims regarding its operations in India detailed in the memoir.Free Basics was ultimately prohibited in India for violating net neutrality principles, representing a rare defeat for Zuckerberg's global expansion ambitions.",Former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams claims a 'low-ranking official' at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Mark Zuckerberg and his team.

Donald Trump's Reciprocal Tariffs could shift Apple's supply chain focus to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trumps-reciprocal-tariffs-could-shift-apples-supply-chain-focus-to-india/articleshow/119949907.cms,"US President Donald Trump 's newly announced tariffs on multiple countries that could reshape Apple 's global supply chain strategy, potentially boosting India's position as the company's manufacturing hub while complicating efforts in other countries. The White House on unveiled "" reciprocal tariffs "" targeting more than 180 countries, with China facing a staggering 54% total tariff rate, Vietnam 46%, and India a comparatively lower 26%. These tariffs threaten to disrupt Apple's years-long effort to diversify production away from China.India stands to benefit from this disruption as its relatively lower tariff rate could make it more attractive as Apple's manufacturing destination. The company has already been ramping up iPhone production in India , with government officials indicating Apple aims to manufacture about 25% of all iPhones globally in the country.For Apple, the manufacturing pivot to India is crucial, with approximately 10-15% of iPhones, the entirety of iPhone 16 lineup, are currently assembled in India. Analysts at Bernstein project this could reach 15-20% by the end of 2025. While the majority of that production is being sold in the country, some of it is also being exported to other markets.India's mobile phone exports have already grown nearly 50% in the first ten months of this fiscal year, with industry projections estimating total exports of Rs 1.8tn ($21 billion) for the year. Apple's manufacturing expansion has contributed significantly to this growth, with iPhone exports reaching a record $12.8 billion in 2024, a 42% year-over-year increase.Apple is also starting AirPods production in India this month, and the units exported in the country will be exported to the US, UK, and other markets.Meanwhile, other manufacturing hubs face greater challenges. Vietnam, where Apple produces approximately 90% of its wearables and 20% of iPads, will struggle with a 46% tariff. China, still accounting for around 90% of iPhone assembly and 80% of iPad production, faces the steepest tariffs.Apple's smaller manufacturing operations in Malaysia (25% tariff) and Thailand (36% tariff) will also be affected. Despite announcing a $500 billion investment in the US including a new AI server factory in Texas, Apple has minimal mass production capability in the United States.The tariffs present a significant challenge for Apple, potentially adding $8.5 billion in annual costs according to Morgan Stanley estimates. This could reduce the company's 2026 profits by approximately $7.85 billion, or about 7%.For Apple, the tariffs present difficult choices: absorb the costs and reduce profits, raise prices for consumers, or accelerate its shift to lower-tariff regions like India while developing more robust local supply chains.","The White House on unveiled "" reciprocal tariffs "" targeting more than 180 countries.

"‘Google executive favoured women staff over males,’ former employee claims in lawsuit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-executive-favoured-women-staff-over-males-former-employee-claims-in-lawsuit/articleshow/119947176.cms,"What the ex-employee said about Google’s senior executive



What Google said about the lawsuit



Former Google employee Marco Meier has filed a lawsuit against the company and one of its executives alleging discrimination against male employees. According to the suit, the Alphabet-owned tech major’s senior executive Marta Martinez led a campaign that targeted men to deny promotions, excluding them from meetings, and even gifting memberships to women-only professional organisations at Christmas. Meier, a former German pro-basketball player who worked on Google’s ads team for nearly 13 years and held roles including Global Business Leader and Head of Industry-Media Platforms, claims that male staff were labeled as “too aggressive and too competitive,” resulting in their systematic marginalisation and eventual termination under false pretenses. The lawsuit contends that these actions amount to gender-based discrimination in violation of equal employment policies.As per the lawsuit (seen by Dailywire), Meier, who is described as a ""stellar employee,"" rose to become Head of Google Marketable Products – Big 5 Agencies and secured one of the largest ad sales deals in the company’s history. However, he started facing issues when he began reporting to Martinez the lawsuit claims.Under this executive, male employees were routinely interrupted during meetings, denied promotions and high-profile projects and often replaced with female staff, the lawsuit alleged. Meier further noted that while female employees typically received promotions within two years, it took him five-and-a-half years to achieve the same, despite receiving a strong endorsement from one of Google's top senior executives.The lawsuit alleges that 14 people from Meier’s department were promoted to director positions, with 13 of those promotions going to women in 2022.The suit also notes that when Meier began working under the executive in 2019, the team had seven male and two female team leads. Within four years, the makeup was reversed as the executive allegedly fired all but two male team leads—including Meier—and replaced them with women, justifying the changes by saying male employees were ""too aggressive and too competitive.”In December 2021, the Martinez reportedly enrolled her team in the mentorship non-profit Step Up—designed exclusively toward girls—disregarding Meier and the other man on the team, the lawsuit further notes. In November 2022, Meier filed an HR complaint alleging gender discrimination, but claims that Google failed to properly investigate, leading to his reassignment.During a subsequent transition meeting, Martinez was accused of falsely portraying Meier’s performance, claiming he did not meet goals and abandoned his employees, leaving him visibly upset. In a later meeting, she allegedly remarked that the women on his team demonstrated superior leadership skills, Meier highlighted.After filing a second HR complaint in August 2023, Meier was terminated on April 17, 2024. Although Google cited corporate restructuring as the reason, the lawsuit asserts that his role was not eliminated but replaced by an inexperienced woman.Responding to these allegations, a Google spokesperson said to Fox News that the company ""hires the best people for the job.""“We thoroughly reviewed these allegations more than once and found them to be completely meritless and misleading. We have a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination and retaliation and do not promote or make role elimination decisions based on gender, period,” the Google spokesperson said in a statement.","Marco Meier, a former German pro-basketball player, worked on Google’s ads team for nearly 13 years and held roles including Global Business Leader and Head of Industry-Media Platforms.

Meta confirms: ‘Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC…’

Jeff Bezos, former Google CEO and other tech moguls who have brought houses in Washington

Jeff Bezos purchased a $23 million Kalorama mansion in 2016.

Peter Thiel bought a $13 million beaux-arts residence in 2021.

Similarly, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt acquired a $15 million Georgetown home once occupied by Jacqueline Kennedy.

PayPal co-founder David Sacks, now a White House advisor, purchased a $10.3 million Northwest DC penthouse.

Former eBay executive Jeff Skoll spent $17 million on Virginia properties reportedly planned for a compound.

Mark Zuckerberg has become the latest tech billionaire to establish a presence in Washington DC, purchasing a $23 million mansion in the upscale Woodland Normanstone neighborhood, a report has said. The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.Politico reports that for weeks, the identity of the buyer remained shrouded in mystery as real estate agents were bound by non-disclosure agreements. Shortly after the cash transaction closed in early March, images of the 15,000-square-foot property became pixelated on Google Maps, the report added.Neighborhood residents noted increased activity at the previously vacant home, coinciding with reports that Zuckerberg’s private jet had landed at Dulles Airport.The publication says that a Meta spokesperson confirmed the purchase, explaining: “Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC, which will allow Mark to spend more time there as Meta continues the work on policy issues related to American technology leadership.”The official explanation cites convenience and safety during increased Washington visits. Notably, Zuckerberg also has properties in Palo Alto, Lake Tahoe and Hawaii, among other places.Although tech titans have acquired Washington properties even before Trump's return to office, the pace has reportedly accelerated significantly in the past year.","The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.

Vinod Khosla asks founders to look for ‘investor assistant’

Vinod Khosla called DeepSeek model was 'copied'

Vinod Khosla , an early investor in OpenAI and the founder of Khosla Ventures , has voiced strong criticism of the ‘founder-friendly’ culture in Silicon Valley . Speaking on the Minus One podcast, he argued that the ‘founder-friendly’ culture does more harm than good for entrepreneurs. He also dismissed the notion that being overly accommodating to startup founders leads to success. Instead, he suggested that real venture capital support should involve pushing founders beyond their comfort zones.“I hate the culture — there’s a number of firms in the Valley who push the idea we are founder-friendly,"" Khosla said. “What [it] really means, they're never going to challenge you. They want to be popular with you as opposed to help you.”According to Khosla, effective investors do more than just provide capital. He described his approach as that of a “venture assistant” rather than a venture capitalist, emphasizing the role of guidance and constructive criticism in a startup's journey.“Great founders, the majority of the time, are incomplete in some dimension,” he stated, adding, “Your job as an investor is to help them with that.”During the podcast, Khosla also pointed out that 95% of feedback from investors tends to be “hypocritical politeness”—flattering but ultimately unhelpful. He urged founders to seek investors who provide “brutally honest” feedback that challenges their decisions and business strategies.“Founders should strive for a real, well-intended critique of their strategy, something that challenges them to think,” he said.Earlier this year, Khosla accused DeepSeek of “ripping off” the technology behind its R1 model. As per Khosla, its DeepSeek chatbot makes the same mistakes as OpenAI’s o1, raising suspicion of intellectual property theft. “One of our startups found Deepseek makes the same mistakes O1 makes, a strong indication the technology was ripped off,” Khosla then said. “It feels like they [DeepSeek] then hacked some code and did some impressive optimizations on top. Most likely, not an effort from scratch,” he added.",Vinod Khosla has voiced strong criticism of the ‘founder-friendly’ culture in Silicon Valley.

I'm cherry-picking the date, but it's kinda crazy that since 2000 gold seems to have generated higher returns than Nifty.

We couldn't time the launch of the GOLDCASE, @ZerodhaAMC's Gold ETF any better😬 First, gold prices started shooting up and then the stopping of sovereign gold bonds (SGBs). Now that SGB issuance has stopped, Gold ETFs are probably the best way to get exposure to gold.

Gold has been kind to Indian investors and has provided some diversification benefit. Nobody can explain what makes gold prices move, but it seems to work.

Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath recently took to microblogging platform X to highlight that gold has outperformed the Nifty 50 in returns since 2000. In the post, Kamath also underscored the increasing significance of Gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), especially after the government's decision to halt Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) issuance. With SGBs no longer available, he pointed out that Gold ETFs could be the best way for Indian investors to gain exposure to the precious metal.The latest surge in gold prices has further strengthened its appeal. With markets facing global uncertainties and inflationary pressures, many investors are turning to gold as a hedge. Kamath noted that the introduction of Zerodha AMC’s GOLDCASE ETF comes at an opportune time, aligning with the growing demand for accessible gold investments.“We couldn't time the launch of the GOLDCASE, @ZerodhaAMC's Gold ETF any better😬 First, gold prices started shooting up and then the stopping of sovereign gold bonds (SGBs).

What AAER said about Gates Foundation and other non-profits



“These organizations are free to operate as they wish—but not with the public subsidy that tax-exempt status provides. Racial discrimination—whether in scholarships, professional development, or artistic grants—violates public policy and must not be underwritten by American taxpayers. Organizations that discriminate based on race—whether their intentions are benevolent or not—are not eligible for public subsidies through the tax code. The IRS must act to uphold the law.”

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates' non-profit organisation is facing racial discrimination allegations. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation along with two other organisations are facing allegations of running scholarship and career advancement programs that discriminate against white Americans. The American Alliance for Equal Rights (AAER) has accused the Gates Foundation, the Lagrant Foundation , and the Creative Capital Foundation of “intentionally” excluding white people, a claim detailed in letters sent to the IRS. The AAER argues that these alleged discriminatory practices may violate federal law and provide sufficient grounds for the IRS to revoke the organisations’ tax-exempt status .In three separate letters sent to Robert Malone of the IRS's Exempt Organizations and Government Entities division, AAER said that these non-profits have engaged in practices that categorically exclude white Americans from benefits and opportunities based solely on race.AAER alleges that the Lagrant Foundation offers scholarships, mentorships, and career development only to applicants from minority groups, violating Supreme Court precedent set in Bob Jones University v. United States.The complaint also claims that the Gates Foundation’s Gates Scholarship is open exclusively to racial or ethnic minorities, and the Creative Capital Foundation’s ""Creative Capital Forward Fund"" provides grants only to non-white creators.AAER asserts these race-based exclusions conflict with longstanding public policy, IRS guidelines, and recent court rulings, and cites multiple legal references—including executive orders—to support its claim that such practices risk revoking the organizations’ tax-exempt status.In a statement, Edward Blum, president of AAER said:","The American Alliance for Equal Rights (AAER) has accused the Gates Foundation, the Lagrant Foundation and the Creative Capital Foundation of ‘intentionally’ excluding white people.

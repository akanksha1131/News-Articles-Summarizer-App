Google is set to appeal a record ‚Ç¨4.3 billion ($4.5 billion) antitrust fine imposed by the European Union seven years ago, a report claimed. Alphabet-owned company has argued that the penalty unfairly punished the company for its innovation in the Android mobile operating system. The appeal, heard by the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg, comes two years after a lower tribunal upheld the European Commission's decision, which found Google guilty of using Android to restrict competition.However, the company claimed that its actions benefited consumers and fostered innovation in the mobile market. This new appeal comes after the lower court reduced the fine to 4.1 billion euros ($4.27 billion).According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Google lawyer Alfonso Lamadrid told the court: ‚ÄúGoogle does not contest or shy away from its responsibility under the law, but the Commission also has a responsibility when it runs investigations when it seeks to reshape markets and second-guess pro-competitive business models, and when it imposes multi-billion-euro fines. In this case, the Commission failed to discharge its burden and its responsibility and, relying on multiple errors of law, punished Google for its superior merits, attractiveness and innovation.‚ÄùLamadrid justified Google's agreements that require phone manufacturers to pre-install Google Search, the Chrome browser, and the Google Play app store on their Android devices, while also restricting them from adopting rival Android systems.Meanwhile, EU antitrust regulators argued that these conditions restricted competition.‚ÄúThese agreements and conditions did not restrict competition, they fostered it,‚Äù he argued.Judges are expected to deliver their ruling in the coming months. The decision will be final and cannot be appealed. However, Google remains under EU scrutiny for its highly profitable ad tech business, with a decision on that matter anticipated later this year.In 2022, India‚Äôs competition watchdog, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) also imposed a combined fine of Rs 2,273 crore on Google through two separate rulings.In the first case, Google was fined Rs 1,337 crore for exploiting its dominant position within the Android mobile device ecosystem. Meanwhile, the second one penalised the company Rs 936 crore for monopolistic practices involving the Play Store.",Google is set to appeal a record ‚Ç¨4.3 billion ($4.5 billion) antitrust fine imposed by the European Union seven years ago.

The American company that lost more than $500 billion to DeepSeek has these words for the Chinese startup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-american-company-that-lost-more-than-500-billion-to-deepseek-has-these-words-for-the-chinese-startup/articleshow/117652155.cms,"Nvidia, the poster boy of AI industry , faced its moment of truth after a small Chinese company DeepSeek showed that it could do more with less of what Nvidia makes. The company, which soared to the top of the stock market by selling the computer chips fueling the world‚Äôs artificial intelligence boom, has been dealt a tough reality check by DeepSeek.On Monday, January 27, shares of Nvidia plunged more than 17% after DeepSeek showed that it could train a cutting-edge AI system with a fraction of the Nvidia chips that had been used in the past by OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT . The company lost roughly $600 billion in market value, on what was its worst trading day since the pandemic sell-off in March 2020.However, despite the market rout, Nvidia seems impressed with DeepSeek's R1 model. Nvidia called DeepSeek‚Äôs R1 model ‚Äúan excellent AI advancement‚Äù. ""DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling,"" an Nvidia spokesperson stated to CNBC. ""DeepSeek's work demonstrates how new models can be created using this technique, utilizing readily available models and computing power that fully complies with export controls.""Notably, R1's reported training cost was under $6 million, a fraction of the billions invested by Silicon Valley companies in developing their AI models. Nvidia's statement are said to suggest that it views DeepSeek's breakthrough as a potential catalyst for increased demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs).""Inference requires substantial numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking,"" the spokesperson added. ""We now have three scaling laws: pre-training, post-training, and the newly identified test-time scaling.""Nvidia also clarified that the GPUs employed by DeepSeek fully adhere to export regulations. This statement contradicts Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang's assertions on CNBC last week that DeepSeek likely utilized Nvidia GPU models restricted in mainland China. DeepSeek maintains that it utilized specialized versions of Nvidia's GPUs designed for the Chinese market.","Chinese company DeepSeek showed that it could train a cutting-edge AI system with a fraction of the Nvidia chips.

What Google said on GRAD

Google employees have reportedly expressed growing anxiety about job security by circulating an internal petition titled 'Job Seecurity' ahead of anticipated cost-cutting measures this year. A CNBC report has confirmed that the petition, which has garnered over 1,250 signatures, reflects a broader sense of unease within Google. This reportedly comes amidst a challenging period for the company, marked by a series of embarrassing product launches, employee protests, and ongoing layoffs that began in 2023 and are expected to continue.""We, the undersigned Google workers from offices across the US and Canada, are concerned about the instability at Google that hinders our ability to produce high-quality, impactful work,"" the petition states.""The constant threat of layoffs creates a climate of insecurity. Given the company's strong financial position, the loss of so many valuable colleagues without explanation is particularly disheartening.""New CFO Anat Ashkenazi indicated in October that cost reduction would be a key focus as Google ramps up its AI infrastructure spending in 2025. This announcement, which sparked internal unease, prompted employees to seek clarity from executives, which was not forthcoming.The petition urges Google CEO Sundar Pichai to prioritize employee buyouts over layoffs, guarantee severance packages for laid-off employees, and refrain from using low performance reviews as a pretext for terminations. It also emphasizes the importance of offering voluntary buyouts before resorting to layoffs.The employees petition also specifically addresses concerns about the company's performance review process, known as GRAD, and calls for an end to the practice of ""forcing"" low performance reviews to justify employee dismissals.A Google spokesperson clarified that the company does not mandate specific rating distributions for GRAD and that each employee's evaluation is based on their individual performance, role, level, and agreed-upon expectations.The petition requests a guaranteed severance package equivalent to that offered during the January 2023 layoffs, which affected over 12,000 employees. Google's generous severance package at the time included 16 weeks of salary plus two additional weeks for each year of service. However, subsequent rounds of layoffs have resulted in varying severance packages, according to affected employees.","Google employees have reportedly circulated an internal petition titled 'Job Seecurity' The petition, which has garnered over 1,250 signatures, reflects a broader sense of unease within Google.

Leadership and strategic vision



Challenges facing DOGE



The broader implications of DOGE

In a bold move to improve efficiency and reduce wasteful expenditure within the federal government, Elon Musk ‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has begun making waves. On Monday, DOGE announced plans to recruit top-tier talent across a variety of domains to drive its mission forward. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the department expressed its commitment to building a team capable of identifying and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in government operations.The announcement marked the latest chapter in DOGE‚Äôs journey to overhaul how taxpayer dollars are utilized, setting the stage for sweeping reforms in areas plagued by inefficiency.DOGE‚Äôs approach has already attracted significant public and media attention, not just for its mission but for Musk‚Äôs leadership style and innovative strategies. By focusing on areas such as coin production costs and broader inefficiencies across government programs, DOGE is positioning itself as a pivotal force in reimagining public sector management. However, its ambitious goals have also encountered challenges, highlighting the complexity of reforming large bureaucracies.The Department of Government Efficiency, established under the leadership of Elon Musk, aims to address inefficiencies within the U.S. government. Its core mission is to eliminate wasteful spending, enhance accountability, and streamline processes to better serve taxpayers. On Monday, DOGE shared a recruitment post on X, inviting ""world-class"" talent to join the team. The post specifically mentioned full-time positions for software engineers, information security (InfoSec) experts, financial analysts, human resources (HR) professionals, and other skilled individuals.The department emphasized that these roles are not for the faint-hearted, requiring long hours and a commitment to delivering results. This call for talent aligns with DOGE‚Äôs broader vision of creating a culture of excellence within government operations, inspired by Musk‚Äôs success in the private sector with companies like Tesla, SpaceX, and The Boring Company.One of DOGE‚Äôs earliest focus areas has been the high cost of coin production in the United States. For years, the U.S. Mint has faced criticism for the rising costs of producing pennies and nickels, which far exceed their face value. According to official figures, it currently costs more than three cents to produce a single penny and 11.5 cents to manufacture a nickel. In the 2023 fiscal year alone, this inefficiency resulted in a taxpayer loss of $179 million.To address this issue, DOGE is exploring innovative solutions, including revisiting the materials used in coin production and modernizing the minting process. These efforts could lead to significant savings for taxpayers while addressing a long-standing problem that has burdened public finances.This initiative is emblematic of DOGE‚Äôs broader approach: targeting inefficiencies that have persisted for decades and applying fresh thinking to solve them. By tackling low-hanging fruit like coin production, DOGE hopes to build momentum for more complex reforms across the government.At the helm of DOGE‚Äôs operations is Steve Davis, a seasoned operations expert with extensive experience in cost-cutting and efficiency improvements. Davis, who previously held key roles at SpaceX and The Boring Company, is tasked with steering the department‚Äôs ambitious agenda. His leadership is considered critical to achieving DOGE‚Äôs goals, as he brings a proven track record of executing large-scale efficiency projects.Under Davis‚Äôs guidance, DOGE is not only targeting inefficiencies in coin production but also examining other government programs and services that have historically suffered from wasteful spending. The department is leveraging data-driven decision-making and private-sector methodologies to identify opportunities for improvement.Despite its bold mission, DOGE has encountered several challenges in its early days. Initially conceived as a joint venture between Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, the department is now solely led by Musk following Ramaswamy‚Äôs departure. Reports suggest that differences over operational strategies and the department‚Äôs role within the federal framework led to the split.In addition to internal leadership changes, DOGE faces legal and administrative hurdles that could complicate its efforts to implement reforms. Navigating the complexities of federal regulations and bureaucracy will be a significant test for the department, especially as it seeks to challenge entrenched practices and vested interests.Furthermore, public skepticism about Musk‚Äôs ability to translate his private-sector success into government reforms remains a potential obstacle. Critics have questioned whether DOGE‚Äôs ambitious goals can be achieved within the constraints of public administration, where decision-making often involves balancing competing priorities.DOGE‚Äôs creation marks a significant step in rethinking how governments can operate more efficiently in the 21st century. By applying principles from the private sector‚Äîsuch as lean management, innovation, and data-driven analysis‚Äîthe department aims to set a new standard for public sector performance.The success or failure of DOGE will have far-reaching implications. If successful, it could serve as a model for other governments worldwide, demonstrating how efficiency and accountability can be improved without sacrificing public services. On the other hand, any missteps could reinforce the perception that large-scale government reform is an unattainable goal.","Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) aims to address inefficiencies within the U.S. government.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle‚Äôs theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you‚Äôve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you‚Äôve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

""I think it's extremely important that OpenAI gets to other platforms quickly because Microsoft is building their own AI and I don't think Microsoft will use OpenAI in the future,"" Benioff said, punctuating his observation with laughter.The partnership's strain appears to be evident with OpenAI's recent plans to expand its cloud infrastructure beyond Microsoft, partnering with SoftBank and Oracle on a $500 billion data center project called Stargate.Benioff highlighted the personal dynamics at play, noting the apparent tension between key executives: "" Mustafa Suleyman and Sam Altman are not best friends.""He pointed to their past interactions as evidence, recalling last year's Davos conference where ""Sam and Mustafa were on panels together and not getting along."" This personal friction coincides with Microsoft's strategic moves, including hiring Suleyman to lead its AI efforts.The partnership's foundation has gradually eroded since Microsoft's initial $1 billion investment in 2019. OpenAI's need for expanded computational resources and Microsoft's own AI ambitions have created increasing distance between the two organizations.Recent Microsoft AI announcements notably omit any mention of OpenAI, suggesting a potential strategic divergence.

The smartphone also supports Qi wireless charging. Samsung claims that the smartphone can charge from 0to 65% in just 30 minutes. However, we are yet to test this functionality and the battery backup of the smartphone.

The primary sensor on the Galaxy S25 Ultra manages to capture incredible detail and dynamic range. The AI enhancements bring sharper portraits and more accurate colour reproduction. Features like depth-of-field control and Galaxy Log enhance creative possibilities and help users do much more with the camera. Also, the redesigned camera UX allows more intuitive control over advanced settings.

What Australians said about Onlyfans



‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre paying for something, interacting, and have a particular person of interest, that‚Äôs definitely cheating,‚Äù

‚ÄúIf I was with someone for, say, five years, I‚Äôd be like, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs going on here?‚Äô That would be a big fight. Whereas with someone new? Bye,‚Äù

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt even date her in the first place. I think OnlyFans is f***ed. I‚Äôd break up with them on the spot,‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you have a partner, why do you need OnlyFans?‚Äù

A new survey in Australia has revealed differing perspectives on the use of content subscription service OnlyFans within relationships.

Meanwhile, her friend who agreed with the view and noted that the amount of money spent on it was also a major factor.she added.However, when two men were asked, ‚ÄúIs subscribing to OnlyFans cheating?‚Äù one responded that they didn‚Äôt see it as the same as having an affair but still called it a ‚Äúdog act,‚Äù saying it crossed a boundary in a relationship.the surveyee explained.Another man, wearing a fedora hat, strongly opposed the idea of women viewing naked men online.he said.Meanwhile, an Irish man living in Australia said that OnlyFans was a ‚Äúwaste of money.‚Äùhe added.The survey also revealed that couples living together are less bothered by the adult platform compared to those who live apart. Nearly, 41% of married couples felt it depended on the nature of the interaction, while 55% of individuals in non-cohabiting relationships considered it cheating.","A new survey in Australia has revealed differing perspectives on the use of content subscription service OnlyFans within relationships.

Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has sent ripples through the global technology landscape with the launch of its cutting-edge AI models, DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1. The company claims these models rival, or even surpass, leading U.S.-based models like OpenAI‚Äôs GPT, while being far more cost-effective. With the training of DeepSeek-V3 requiring less than $6 million in computing power, the company has positioned itself as a disruptive force in the AI sector.DeepSeek‚Äôs AI Assistant has already overtaken ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple‚Äôs App Store in the U.S., raising eyebrows and sparking debates about the future of AI innovation. Below, we explore the reasons behind DeepSeek‚Äôs meteoric rise, the controversies surrounding its operations, and the key figures driving its success.DeepSeek‚Äôs emergence has shaken the global AI industry, challenging the dominance of established players like OpenAI, Meta, and Google. Its AI models, DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1, have been lauded for their quality, matching or exceeding the performance of rival models. What truly sets DeepSeek apart, however, is its cost efficiency.The success of DeepSeek has had a noticeable impact on U.S. technology markets:Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang claimed that DeepSeek possesses 50,000 Nvidia H100 chips, which would violate U.S. export controls banning the sale of advanced AI chips to Chinese firms. While DeepSeek has not responded to these allegations, the claim has fueled debates about the startup‚Äôs access to restricted technologies.DeepSeek stated that the training of its V3 model required only $5.58 million in computing power. However, Bernstein analysts have expressed doubts, suggesting that the actual costs may be significantly higher. The training expenses for DeepSeek-R1, another highly acclaimed model, remain undisclosed, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the company‚Äôs claims.DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a 40-year-old entrepreneur with a background in finance. Liang is also the co-founder of the quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer, which has played a pivotal role in supporting DeepSeek‚Äôs operations.Liang‚Äôs leadership and vision have propelled DeepSeek to national prominence. His hands-on involvement in research and recruitment has helped the startup attract top talent from Chinese universities, rivaling established tech giants like ByteDance in compensation and resources.DeepSeek‚Äôs success has garnered attention at the highest levels of China‚Äôs political leadership. On January 20, 2025, the day DeepSeek-R1 was launched, Liang Wenfeng attended a closed-door symposium hosted by Chinese Premier Li Qiang.While DeepSeek has quickly established itself as a formidable player in AI, its path forward is not without challenges:Despite these obstacles, DeepSeek‚Äôs rapid rise demonstrates the potential of Chinese startups to disrupt established industries and reshape the global technology landscape.","Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has sent ripples through the global technology landscape with the launch of its cutting-edge AI models.

What is Jevons paradox that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella relates DeepSeek 'carnage' to,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-is-jevons-paradox-that-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-relates-deepseek-carnage-to/articleshow/117622441.cms,"What is the Jevons Paradox?

Nadella's concerns

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently drew attention to the Jevons Paradox while discussing the rapid rise of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup. Nadella's remarks came after DeepSeek, an emerging player in the AI space, unveiled its advanced language model, DeepSeek-R1. Nadella suggested that as DeepSeek 's AI becomes more efficient and accessible, overall usage will skyrocket‚Äîillustrating the Jevons Paradox in action.DeepSeek's recent successes, including surpassing OpenAI's ChatGPT in App Store rankings, have shaken up the AI industry. Nadella referenced the Jevons Paradox, explaining that increased efficiency in AI technology, similar to DeepSeek's innovations, leads to greater overall consumption.The Jevons Paradox, an economic principle, states that technological advancements that increase the efficiency of resource use can paradoxically lead to increased consumption of that resource. For example, more fuel-efficient cars might encourage more driving, ultimately leading to no significant reduction in overall fuel consumption.Nadella expressed concern that the increasing efficiency and accessibility of AI could lead to a similar phenomenon. As AI becomes more powerful and easier to use, its applications will undoubtedly expand. This increased usage, even with improved efficiency, could significantly increase the energy demands of AI systems, potentially leading to a surge in energy consumption.Nadella used the term ""Deepsake carnage"" to illustrate this point. Deepsake is an AI-powered platform that can convincingly synthesize realistic videos and audio of individuals. While this technology has potential applications in entertainment and education, it also raises concerns about the potential for misuse, such as creating deepfakes for malicious purposes. As AI capabilities like Deepsake become more sophisticated and accessible, the potential for both beneficial and harmful applications will increase dramatically.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella drew attention to the Jevons Paradox while discussing the rapid rise of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup.

What President Donald Trump said on Microsoft buying TikTok

‚ÄúI would say yes. A lot of interest in TikTok. There‚Äôs great interest in TikTok.‚Äù

What Microsoft said on buying Tiktok now

Nearly five years after its last attempt, Microsoft is reportedly revisiting plans to acquire TikTok‚Äôs U.S. operations. The tech giant is in discussions to purchase the U.S. arm of ByteDance-owned TikTok, according to former U.S. President Donald Trump, who mentioned the matter on Monday night (January 27) without providing further details.Rewind to 2020, Microsoft and Oracle Corp were the two contenders to acquire TikTok, following Trump‚Äôs push for ByteDance to sell its US operations or face a ban over national security concerns.At an event in September 2021,When asked by reporters aboard Air Force One whether Microsoft was negotiating a deal, Trump responded,Earlier on Monday, during an event in Florida with Republican lawmakers, Trump hinted at ongoing discussions regarding TikTok‚Äôs future. While he initially advocated for banning the app due to security risks, his stance appears to have softened, partially influenced by the popularity of pro-Trump content on the platform. Trump has granted ByteDance a 75-day deadline to sell its U.S. operations to a domestic company and encouraged more bidders to enter the fray.‚ÄúI like bidding wars because you get the best deal,‚Äù Trump added. ‚ÄúSo if there‚Äôs a bidding war, that‚Äôs a good thing.‚Äù‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see what happens,‚Äù Trump said during his speech. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have a lot of people bidding on it, and if we can save all that voice and all the jobs‚Äîand keep China out of it, because we don‚Äôt want China involved‚Äîwe‚Äôll see where it goes.‚ÄùIn August 2020, as President Trump threatened to ban TikTok, the Chinese video app's owner ByteDance reportedly approached Microsoft as a possible partner. The plan was to force the sale of the US part of the business over concerns that it was a threat to national security. Later TikTok chose rival Oracle - although that deal too could never happened. In an interview at the Code Conference in 2021, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that he was ""kind of intrigued"" when TikTok approached him.Microsoft has declined to comment on recent reports of its involvement.The short-form video app, which boasts over 170 million American users, has attracted attention from various players in the U.S. tech and business sectors. AI startup Perplexity recently submitted a bid to merge with TikTok‚Äôs U.S. operations, while billionaire Frank McCourt, former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, made a formal offer earlier this month.","Microsoft is in discussions to purchase the U.S. arm of ByteDance-owned TikTok, according to former President Donald Trump.

What is DeepSeek

DeepSeek hit by cyber attack

Nvidia has emphasized that Chinese AI firm DeepSeek‚Äôs progress underscores the value of its chips in the Chinese market, adding that future demand for its hardware will likely grow to support DeepSeek‚Äôs expanding services. The chip maker released a statement on Monday, January 27 following a sharp 17% drop driven by investor concerns that DeepSeek had matched competitors like OpenAI while using significantly fewer Nvidia chips than US-based firms.""DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek‚Äôs work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant,"" Nvidia said in its statement.‚ÄúInference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling,‚Äù said Nvidia.DeepSeek is a large language model developed by Hangzhou-based startup DeepSeek. The AI model features a hybrid architecture combining reinforcement learning with chain-of-thought reasoning for advanced performance. The model comes in two versions: DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-R1-Zero. The latter offers unsupervised fine-tuning, enabling even more refined reasoning abilities.Nvidia is currently selling a chip called the H20 that is designed to meet the most recent export control regulations. DeepSeek‚Äôs research indicates it utilized around 2,000 of Nvidia‚Äôs H800 chips, specifically designed to comply with US export controls introduced in 2022. Experts previously told Reuters that these regulations, aimed at hindering China‚Äôs AI progress, would likely have minimal impact.Meanwhile, the Chinese AI startup was forced to restrict new user sign-ups to those with mainland China telephone numbers. Reason: The company is citing ""large-scale malicious attacks"" on its systems. ‚ÄúCurrently, only registration with a mainland China mobile phone number is supported,‚Äù the company posted on its status page. DeepSeek did not specify whether the signup curbs are temporary or how long they will last.","Chinese AI firm DeepSeek saw a 17% drop in its share price on Monday, January 27.

Deepsake's cost factor behind rout in US stock market

DeepSeek, the Chinese AI startup, has restricted new user sign-ups to those with mainland China telephone numbers. Reason: The company is citing ""large-scale malicious attacks"" on its systems. This comes after a surge in demand following the release of its AI chatbot , which it claims rivals OpenAI 's ChatGPT but was developed at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek 's AI Assistant briefly surpassed ChatGPT as the most downloaded free app in the U.S.on Apple's App Store, contributing to a significant drop in U.S. and European tech stock values, as investors reassessed valuations.The company's status page indicated a service incident resolved by 9:32 p.m. China time on Monday (January 27), shortly after its disclosure. The page also showed API issues earlier that day and on Sunday (January 26). This outage was the most significant since DeepSeek began tracking its service status and coincided with the app's rise in app store popularity.‚ÄúCurrently, only registration with a mainland China mobile phone number is supported,‚Äù the company posted on its status page. DeepSeek did not specify whether the signup curbs are temporary or how long they will last.This is reported to be the AI startup's longest major outage since it started reporting its status and corresponds with the app rocketing to popularity in the Apple and Android app stores.DeepSeek, founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, asserts its chatbot competes with the latest technology from OpenAI and Meta at a fraction of the cost. The company has stated that existing users can still log in despite the temporary registration limitations.The startup has gained attention as a rapidly growing competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and other leading AI tools. The release of its R1 model last week fueled discussions among tech analysts, investors, and developers, raising concerns about falling behind in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. This is especially relevant in the generative AI space, where companies are racing to maintain their position in a market projected to generate over $1 trillion in revenue within the next ten years.DeepSeek reportedly originated from a Chinese hedge fund's AI research unit in April 2023, focusing on large language models and the pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI), an AI branch aiming to match or exceed human intellect across various tasks. This goal is also shared by OpenAI and its competitors.","DeepSeek has restricted new user sign-ups to those with mainland China telephone numbers.

Google TVs to get upgraded hardware

At CES 2025 , Google has announced that it is bringing Gemini AI-powered features to Google TVs this year. The company unveiled a suite of new AI-powered features for Google TV , designed to make interacting with your television more intuitive and helpful.“At this year's CES, we shared a preview of new AI capabilities for Google TV that use our Gemini models to make interacting with your TV more intuitive and helpful. You and your family will be able to gather together and have a natural conversation with your TV,” the company said.Leveraging the power of Google's Gemini models, these features aim to transform select Google TV models into a conversational and interactive hub for entertainment, information, and smart home control.“This will make searching through your media easier than ever, and you will be able to ask questions about travel, health, space, history and more, with videos in the results for added context,” Google added.Moreover, the Gemini model on Google TV will also enable users to create personalised artwork with their family, control their smart home devices while the TV is in ambient mode, and even get a summary of the day’s news.These new features are expected to roll out later this year on select Google TV devices, including from Sony, Hisense and TCL. Notably, Google rolled out Gemini-powered features to the Google TV Streamer.As per a report by Android Police, Google TV is also getting a hardware upgrade such as far-field microphones for hands-free voice control. Google TVs may ditch the need for a remote control with the integration of far-field microphones. This allows users to interact with Google Assistant naturally, just like with a Google Home speaker.These Google TVs will also get proximity sensors that will detect when users approach the TV, triggering an on-screen hub with personalised widgets displaying information like weather, news, and commute updates.","Google has announced that it is bringing Gemini AI-powered features to Google TVs this year.

Elon Musk is a brilliant man and it is always very interesting to talk to him.”

It makes you smile quite a lot when those who until yesterday exalted Musk as a genius and today instead paint him as a monster, only because he chose the side considered ""wrong"" of the barricade. I have always not reasoned this way

Meloni in the US

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has expressed admiration for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, criticizing the negative portrayal he often receives. In an interview with Corriere Della Sera, Meloni stated that Musk is labeled a ""monster"" simply for aligning with what some consider the ""wrong"" side. She suggested that this criticism stems from his political affiliations and close ties to US President-elect Donald Trump . Musk, a key figure in Trump’s transition team, is poised to take on a significant advisory role in the incoming administration.When asked if she is friends with Musk, Meloni said,She added, “Musk is a great personality of our time, an extraordinary innovator who always looks to the future.”,” she told the publication.Musk presented Italy's PM, 47, with the Global Citizen's Award at the Atlantic Council think tank’s Global Citizen Awards. ""I thank Elon Musk , for the beautiful words that he had for me and for his precious genius for the era in which we live,"" said Meloni in her thanks address at the event. The video of the same was shared recently by Tesla Owners Silicon Valley Association on Twitter and reposted by Elon Musk.Italy PM Meloni was in the US recently to meet Trump. The US President-elect hailed Italian Prime Minister Meloni as a “fantastic woman” who has ""really taken Europe by storm,"" as per a report in CNN. A member of the right-wingBrothers of Italy party, Meloni took office in October 2022. She has been recognised as the most powerful person in Europe for 2024 by Politico.According to CNN reports, the details of the meeting have not been disclosed, although the Italian leader, like others, has been seeking to strengthen ties with the President-elect ahead of his inauguration on January 20.One possible topic on the agenda was the detention of Italian journalist Cecilia Sala, who was arrested in Iran last month, it said. Meloni's visit to Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida's Palm Beach comes after she dined with the President-elect and Musk during the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris last month.","Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has expressed admiration for Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

CES 2025: This smart mirror can show multiple health data by reading faces,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ces-2025-this-smart-mirror-can-show-multiple-health-data-by-reading-faces/articleshow/117001392.cms,"Image credit: Withings

Withings Omnia smart mirror: How is it different



French consumer electronics company Withings has unveiled a concept mirror named Omnia at CES 2025 . This smart mirror combines health tracking , AI assistance , and telehealth capabilities . The device features a base that measures weight, heart health, and metabolic health, and can integrate data from other health trackers. The mirror also has an AI voice assistant that provides real-time feedback and guidance, while also potentially facilitating virtual consultations with doctors. Omnia can even send health data to doctors for review, offering a comprehensive and futuristic approach to health management.Omnia is not yet a commercially available product; Withings has stated that it is ""currently in development,"" with no clear timeline or pricing details. Given Withings' history of CES announcements, it could be a long wait before Omnia reaches consumers if it ever does.One of the biggest highlights of the Omnia concept mirror is how it combines several existing health tech trends into one cohesive package. It's important to note that connected smart mirrors , which can display information, make video calls, and play sound, aren't new—these features were already present in Lululemon's Mirror and its imitators.Similarly, smart scales capable of measuring heart rate, taking EKGs, and analyzing body composition have also been available for years. Additionally, AI chatbots integrated into health tech emerged as a growing trend in 2024, with major brands like Oura, Whoop, and Fitbit exploring these technologies.Withings plans to offer demos at CES 2025, which may provide insight into whether Omnia is a legitimate product or just another example of CES health tech hype. Regardless of whether it becomes a tangible product, Omnia reflects the direction in which health tech is headed.Apart from this, Withings offers smartwatches, smart scales, connected blood pressure cuffs, smart thermometers, and even a noninvasive sleep tracker that fits under a mattress. The company has previously debuted products like an at-home urinalysis device for toilets and scales that analyze nerve health through the feet. It has also incorporated telemedicine features , such as cardiologist-reviewed EKG results in its FDA-cleared ScanWatch.","French consumer electronics company Withings has unveiled a concept mirror named Omnia at CES 2025.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on superintelligence: We’re pretty confident that...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-ceo-sam-altman-on-superintelligence-were-pretty-confident-that/articleshow/117000900.cms,"ChatGPT maker OpenAI is now looking to develop superintelligence — AI systems with cognitive abilities far surpassing human capabilities -- across every domain, from scientific creativity to social skills, CEO Sam Altman said in a recent blogpost.With superintelligent tools, scientific discovery and innovation could accelerate “well beyond what we are capable of doing on our own,” he said In a previous blog, Altman had even suggested that superintelligence might emerge in a “few thousand days.”Altman wrote that superintelligence might sound like science fiction. “We’re pretty confident that in the next few years, everyone will see what we see, and that the need to act with great care, while still maximising broad benefit and empowerment, is so important. Given the possibilities of our work, OpenAI cannot be a normal company.”Previously, OpenAI had also said strong public oversight is needed when it comes to governing superintelligence, , asserting that the global community should have a democratic role in determining the bounds and defaults for AI systems. The company proposed an international authority to ensure safety, regulate advanced AI and manage risks, while avoiding over-regulation of less advanced systems.Altman also looked back on the journey of ChatGPT, which was initially dubbed “Chat With GPT-3.5.” Launched over two years ago on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT sparked a “growth curve like nothing we have ever seen,” he added.Altman shared how the project has now “transitioned into the next paradigm of models that can do complex reasoning,” marking the ongoing shift toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).At a New York Times’s DealBook Summit last year, he speculated that AGI could potentially emerge within this year . He reaffirmed the same in the blog, saying “we may see the first AI agents “join the workforce” and materially change the output of companies.”He also addressed various other topics, including the issue of being removed from OpenAI’s board after they ""lost confidence in his leadership abilities."" He described the event as a “big failure of governance by well-meaning people,” acknowledging his own role in the situation.","ChatGPT maker OpenAI is now looking to develop superintelligence.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed inheriting a ""complete mess"" and a company ""on fire"" after his dramatic return as chief executive, he shared in a Bloomberg interview published on Sunday.Altman, who was abruptly fired and then rehired within five days last November, revealed that the situation deteriorated daily after his return, citing mounting government investigations and what he characterized as former board members leaking ""fake news"" to the press.""All those people that I feel like really fucked me and fucked the company were gone, and now I had to clean up their mess,"" Altman told Bloomberg, referring to the aftermath of the leadership crisis that saw most of the original board members depart.The turmoil triggered a series of high-profile departures throughout 2024, including co-founder Ilya Sutskever, who had initially voted for Altman's removal, and superalignment team co-lead Jan Leike. Both joined competitor Anthropic, along with John Schulman, another OpenAI co-founder who departed in August. Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati also left the company in September.The November 2023 crisis began when the board claimed Altman ""was not consistently candid in his communications,"" though specific details were never disclosed. The decision sparked an employee revolt, with nearly all staff threatening to quit unless Altman was reinstated.Only one board member from the original group that voted for Altman's removal, Quora CEO Adam D'Angelo, remains at OpenAI. The company, which began as a nonprofit in 2015, is now reportedly in discussions with California's attorney general's office about transitioning to a for-profit structure.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says he inherited a ""complete mess"" and a company ""on fire"" after his dramatic return as chief executive.

How Google may have solved one of the biggest AI 'problems’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-may-have-solved-one-of-the-biggest-ai-problems/articleshow/117000371.cms,"What is “peak data” and how it is a problem for AI industry

What is inference-time compute and how it works

The performance of an AI model relies on one important thing: data. Recently, OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever declared that the AI industry has reached “peak data”, suggesting that all useful data present on the internet has been exhausted for training AI models. However, Google seems to have found a solution to this problem.“Peak data” is a term used to describe the amount of available useful data to train an AI model. The AI industry is facing a "" peak data "" challenge wherein all useful data has already been used for training AI models.Since all the high-quality data readily available on the internet has already been used to train existing AI models, newer models might not show significant improvements over their predecessors because they're not learning from substantially new or better information.However, Google DeepMind researchers are optimistic, pointing to a promising solution: inference-time compute , as per a report by Business Insider.This technique allows AI models to tackle complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller, manageable prompts. Each step involves a new inference request, creating a chain of reasoning where the model only progresses after solving each part correctly.This process leads to higher-quality outputs, especially in tasks with clear answers, like math problems. The breakthrough lies in using these improved outputs as fresh training data.Google DeepMind researchers proposed this method in August, suggesting an “iterative self-improvement loop” where enhanced outputs are fed back into the model for further training. This approach could bypass the “peak data” problem and fuel continued AI development.Reportedly, early results are promising, with models like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek V3 demonstrating significant improvements. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella expressed confidence in inference-time compute, calling it “another scaling law” for enhancing AI capabilities.“So you have pre-training, and then you have effectively this test-time sampling that then creates the tokens that can go back into pre-training, creating even more powerful models that then are running on your inference,” he said.""That's I think a fantastic way to increase model capability,"" Nadella added.","The AI industry is facing a "" peak data "" challenge wherein all useful data has already been used for training AI models.

Here’s what Suchir Balaji's mother wrote

Update on @suchirbalaji

We hired private investigator and did second autopsy to throw light on cause of death. Private autopsy doesn’t confirm cause of death stated by police.

Suchir’s apartment was ransacked , sign of struggle in the bathroom and looks like some one hit him in bathroom based on blood spots.

It’s a cold blooded mu*d*r declared by authorities as suicide.

Lobbying in SF city doesn’t stop us from getting justices.

We demand FBi investigation

@elonmusk @VivekGRamaswamy @GavinNewsom @MEA

Mother of Suchir Balaji , a 26-year-old researcher at OpenAI , is requesting help from Elon Musk following her son's death. Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment earlier this month. His mother posted on social media, tagging Musk and asking for an FBI investigation . Police stated, “no evidence of foul play was found during the initial investigation”. However, the San Francisco Chief Medical Examiner's Office determined Balaji's death a suicide. Balaji worked at OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT .In her post, Balaji’s mother - Poornima Rao expressed her worries and stated that “private autopsy doesn’t confirm cause of death stated by police.” She called for intervention from US authorities, stating that an FBI investigation is necessary to address the matter. Other than Elon Musk, she tagged American biotech entrepreneur and politician Vivek Ramaswamy and Gavin Newsom – Governor of California.The post has since gained attention, sparking a wave of responses on social media. It caught Musk’s attention as well who replied saying “This doesn’t seem like a suicide”.Suchir Balaji's mother further pleads saying “@elonmusk please support us”.In an interview with Business Insider last week, Rao revealed that Balaji had grown increasingly disillusioned with artificial intelligence (AI), particularly OpenAI’s shift toward commercialization with ChatGPT. She said, “He felt AI is a harm to humanity,” describing how her son, Suchir Balaji, transitioned from boundless optimism about AI’s potential to profound skepticism. Reflecting on his tragic death, she added, “It doesn’t look like a normal situation.”","Suchir Balaji, a 26-year-old researcher at OpenAI, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment earlier this month.

India vs Australia test cricket: Sabse Pehle to Bumrah Ko Drop Karo... and 15 other viral memes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/india-vs-australia-test-cricket-sabse-pehle-to-bumrah-ko-drop-karo-and-15-other-viral-memes/articleshow/116809273.cms,"Yashasvi Jaiswal, center, speaks to umpires after being dismissed during fourth Test. (AP/PTI Photo)

As the match ended, cricket memes went viral on social media platforms. Here are some of the viral memes that just capture the emotion/sadness of Indian Cricket fans.

Record number of spectators

Australia clinched a thrilling 184-run victory over India in a dramatic final session of the fourth Test in Melbourne, taking a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. India, needing 340 to win, collapsed to 155 all out, losing their last seven wickets for just 34 runs in 20.3 overs. India appeared to be heading for a draw after Yashasvi Jaiswal (84) and Rishabh Pant (30) steered them to 112-3 at tea. However, Pant's dismissal, attempting a six off Travis Head, triggered a batting collapse.Controversy arose with Jaiswal's dismissal. Initially given not out to a caught-behind appeal, the TV umpire overturned the decision based on visual evidence of the ball changing direction, despite the absence of audible noise. Jasprit Bumrah was exceptional for India, taking 5-57 in the second innings and nine wickets in the match. He had reduced Australia to 91-6 at one stage, a lead of less than 200.The match set a record attendance for cricket in Australia, with 373,591 spectators. Head described the atmosphere as inspiring and hailed the match as one of the best he has been involved in. India now needs to win the final Test in Sydney to level the series and retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .","Australia beat India by 184 runs in the fourth Test in Melbourne.

Planning a New Year's Eve party at an Airbnb? Think again. The company is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season. This technology uses machine learning to identify and block risky bookings, focusing on factors like trip length, booking timing, and distance from the guest's location. While implemented worldwide, the technology will specifically target the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Puerto Rico, Spain and New Zealand. Last New Year's Eve, Airbnb blocked 74,000 such bookings.High-risk bookings will be blocked or redirected to alternative accommodations. Short holiday getaways (one to three nights) in entire homes will also be restricted, and guests booking entire homes will be required to agree to a ""mandatory anti-party attestation."" ""If a booking is identified as higher risk, the guest will either be blocked from booking, or redirected to alternative accommodations on the platform,"" the company said.Guests will also be required to accept mandatory anti-party attestation. ""Guests who can make reservations will need to confirm that they understand that disruptive and unauthorized parties are not allowed on Airbnb, and they face suspension or removal from the platform if they violate this policy,"" said the company.Airbnb also has a 'Neighborhood Support Line' for local communities to report urgent issues, like a party in progress, at a home they believe is listed on Airbnb.Airbnb's efforts to curb disruptive parties started in 2019 with a ban on ""party houses,"" followed by stricter measures in 2020 due to the pandemic. In 2022, the company permanently banned large parties worldwide following several violent incidents at Airbnb rentals, including a shooting in Pittsburgh that resulted in two deaths and eight injuries.","Airbnb is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season.

Other products that Samsung may showcase



Samsung Display is expected to unveil a new 18.1-inch foldable OLED panel at CES 2025 in Las Vegas on January 7. The panel will be reportedly able to fold down to a portable 13.1 inches or expand to its full size, effectively functioning as two tablets in one. According to a report by The Elec, the foldable OLED display is likely to support touch input and can be used in tablet, notebook, or monitor modes when connected to peripherals. This launch follows the company's previous 17.3-inch foldable display, which was unveiled in 2022. The rumoured device underscores the growing market for large-format foldable devices .As per the report, Samsung is expected to showcase other new products like the Slidable Flex Duet , which expands from 8.1 inches to 12.4 inches, and the Slidable Flex Solo, extending from 13 inches to 17.3 inches at CES 2025. Additionally, the company is also expected to unveil the Slidable Flex Vertical, which grows from 5.1 inches to 6.7 inches.In the automotive sector, Samsung is also expected to debut the industry's first Under Panel Camera (UPC) for vehicles and an 18.1-inch curved Center Information Display (CID), aimed at improving the autonomous driving experience .However, Samsung is unlikely to launch any device featuring the 18.1-inch panel anytime soon as foldable screen laptops remain expensive and lack sufficient use cases to justify their premium price over traditional laptops.It's also important to note that Samsung isn't limited to supplying its panels to Samsung divisions alone. The company offers displays to various manufacturers, and other brands like Asus or Lenovo may adopt the 18.1-inch foldable OLED panel for their upcoming laptops in the coming days.","Samsung Display is expected to unveil a new 18.1-inch foldable OLED panel at CES 2025 in Las Vegas on January 7.

What BBC said about this incident



Other incorrect alerts sent by Apple AI



Apple's AI software, Apple Intelligence, is facing renewed criticism for generating false news summaries. The latest incident involved the AI claiming that tennis star Rafael Nadal had come out as gay. The Apple Intelligence tool incorrectly summarised a story about Brazilian tennis player Joao Lucas Reis da Silva . This follows a similar incident where Apple AI falsely reported that darts player Luke Littler had won the PDC World Championship before the final even took place. Apple has not yet commented on these latest errors, which highlight concerns about the accuracy and reliability of its AI-powered news summaries.In a statement, a BBC spokesperson said: “It is essential that Apple fixes this problem urgently - as this has happened multiple times. As the most trusted news media organisation in the world, it is crucial that audiences can trust any information or journalism published in our name and that includes notifications.”The incorrect summary was written by the Apple Intelligence tool which was introduced in the UK in December 2024. This software features a tool designed to provide users with a concise summary of missed app notifications. It can compile the alerts into a single notification and employs AI to summarize their content.The incorrect summary about Nadal was reportedly based on a story about Brazilian tennis player Silva's openness about his sexuality. Meanwhile, the other story was also based on a story about Littler's victory in the darts tournament’s semi-final. The report also shared screenshots of the incorrect AI summary.Previously, concerns have been raised with Apple about its AI feature after it generated a false headline related to the murder case of UnitedHealth Group CEO Brian Thompson in the US. While the summaries appear to be from original stories, they are AI-generated interpretations of longer headlines. Despite some inaccuracies, other stories, such as those on South Korea and rising influenza cases, were accurately summarised, the report added.Apple Intelligence is available on select iPhones running iOS 18.1 or later, including recent models (iPhone 16 series, 15 Pro, and 15 Pro Max) along with some iPads and Macs. Grouped notifications are marked with a specific icon, and users can report concerns about summaries. However, Apple has yet to disclose the number of reports received.",The Apple Intelligence tool incorrectly summarised a story about Brazilian tennis player Joao Lucas Reis da Silva.

IED plot foiled

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has released footage revealing first-person views of Shamsud-Din Jabbar , the ISIS terrorist responsible for the deadly New Year's Day attack in New Orleans. The videos show Jabbar scouting Bourbon Street using Meta smart glasses before the attack that killed 14 and injured 35 others.According to the FBI disclosed the video, recorded with Meta smart glasses, showing Jabbar navigating the French Quarter just weeks before he rammed a rented truck into a crowd, killing 14 and injuring dozens, as per a report by New York Post.In a press conference, the FBI detailed how Jabbar recced the area twice – first in October and again in November – before carrying out the attack. During his visits, he used Meta smart glasses to film a bicycle tour of the French Quarter, seemingly planning his assault, the New York Post reports.The glasses allow users to record videos and photos hands-free. However, the glasses were not activated during the New Year’s Day attack.“They were not actively recording during the attack,” said FBI New Orleans Special Agent in Charge Lyonel Myrthil.The FBI also said that Jabbar uploaded a series of videos to Facebook minutes before the attack. He pledged allegiance to ISIS and said he wanted to fight a war against nonbelievers.The FBI also revealed that Jabbar had planted improvised explosive devices (IEDs) around the bustling tourist area, potentially planning a larger-scale attack. However, police intervened, fatally shooting Jabbar before he could detonate the bombs.“We believe the transmitter would have functioned, but New Orleans PD stopped him before he could access it and set off the devices,” stated FBI Special Agent in Charge Joshua Jackson.Investigators are working to determine how Jabbar acquired the “very rare explosive compound” used in the bombs, a material never before seen in terrorist attacks in the US or Europe. Jabbar, a former military member, allegedly constructed the bombs at his Texas home, where he had a dedicated bomb-making workbench.","ISIS terrorist Shamsud-Din Jabbar recorded videos of the French Quarter using Meta smart glasses.

This milestone highlights the evolving landscape of celebrity trademarks in India, where public figures seek to protect their names and identities as valuable assets.As per reports, Aditi Tuteja shared the news on LinkedIn, posting the trademark certificate and elaborating on the process. She stated, “After navigating legal landscapes, we achieved this significant milestone. This trademark not only strengthens their brand identity but also expands their commercial reach beyond entertainment.”She also pointed out that trademarking a celebrity’s name is a complex issue in India. Although the Trade Marks Act, 1999 does not explicitly address personality rights, existing laws and court rulings allow individuals to protect their names and images.Ashneer Grover is not the first public figure to trademark his name. According to Tuteja, other celebrities, including Alia Bhatt, Shah Rukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan, Kajol, and Ajay Devgn, have also successfully trademarked their names.Trademarking personal names in India involves leveraging existing laws and provisions under the Trade Marks Act, 1999. Key prerequisites include:According to reports, these provisions enable individuals to secure their names as trademarks, provided they meet the eligibility criteria.Trademarking a name offers several advantages, including:For Ashneer Grover, this move solidifies his brand identity, protecting it from misuse and potentially expanding his commercial ventures.Grover’s decision to trademark his name sparked mixed reactions on social media. While some praised the move as forward-thinking, others responded with humor and criticism. One user joked, “You should have trademarked your dialogue, ‘Ye sab doglapan hai.’” Another quipped, “To all future Grover parents, do not name your kids as Ashneer anymore :)”Trademarking personal names reflects the growing recognition of an individual’s name as an asset in a digital and brand-conscious age. However, this trend also raises several considerations:","Ashneer Grover has trademarked his name under the Trade Marks Act, 1999. The move solidifies his brand identity, protecting it from misuse and potentially expanding his commercial ventures.

The Earth’s orbit is increasingly congested with human-made debris, posing serious risks to space exploration and satellite technology. NASA scientists and global experts warn of a tipping point known as Kessler Syndrome, a scenario in which cascading collisions render Earth’s orbit unusable. This development could have catastrophic implications for global communications, including the loss of internet, television, and phone services, as well as halting space missions. As the volume of space debris grows at an alarming rate, the threat becomes more urgent. Here you can know what Kessler Syndrome is, its potential impact, and ongoing efforts to mitigate the crisis.Proposed by NASA scientist Donald Kessler in 1978, Kessler Syndrome refers to a cascading chain reaction of collisions between orbiting objects, such as satellites and debris. According to reports, each collision generates additional debris, further increasing the likelihood of subsequent impacts. Over time, this process could make Earth’s orbit unusable, disrupting vital satellite-dependent services, including global communications, navigation, and weather forecasting.The European Space Agency (ESA) reports over 47,000 trackable pieces of debris in Earth’s orbit, along with millions of smaller, untrackable fragments. These fragments travel at high speeds, making even the smallest particles capable of causing significant damage to functional satellites and spacecraft.The risk of collisions is exacerbated by:Uncontrolled satellites: Defunct satellites remain in orbit, adding to the growing congestion.The collision between an active Iridium communication satellite and a defunct Russian Kosmos satellite created thousands of debris pieces, highlighting the dangers of orbital overcrowding.Several close encounters between satellites and debris have been reported this year, underscoring the increasing frequency of such events. These incidents demonstrate the escalating risks and the urgent need for mitigation strategies.A full-scale Kessler Syndrome could result in:Companies like LeoLabs are developing advanced radar systems to monitor small debris and improve collision prediction accuracy. Enhanced tracking allows operators to maneuver satellites and avoid potential impacts.Addressing the growing space debris crisis requires a multifaceted approach:","Earth’s orbit is increasingly congested with human-made debris, posing serious risks to space exploration and satellite technology.

The big mistake he made

Linked to money laundering, drug trafficking and other serious crimes

""Not everybody reacts the same way to panic""

YouTuber Ankush Bahuguna recently shared a harrowing experience on Instagram, revealing how he became a victim of a 40-hour digital arrest scam . After a three-day absence from social media, Bahuguna described how scammers held him hostage, causing him financial loss and significant mental distress. “I have been missing from social media and everywhere for the last three days, I was held hostage by some scammers for 40 hours… I have lost money, I have lost my mental health to this, I can’t believe this has happened to me,” Bahuguna said in an Instagram post.Bahuguna explained he received an automated international call (+1 prefix) claiming a cancelled courier delivery. “It seemed like an international number. I picked it up without thinking much. It was an automated call that said your courier delivery had been cancelled. Press zero for support,” he explained. Pressing zero connected him to someone who alleged his name was linked to a package containing illegal items seized by customs, supposedly destined for China. Despite denying any involvement, the scammers insisted his Aadhar number and personal details were connected, placing him under “digital arrest.”The situation escalated rapidly. The scammers accused Bahuguna of money laundering, drug trafficking, and other serious crimes, claiming he was a “prime suspect” in a “national case” with an active arrest warrant. “I was then told I don't have enough time to go to the police station and he will do me a favour by connecting directly to the police station,” Bahuguna explained.They then transferred him to a WhatsApp video call with someone posing as a police officer in uniform, further intensifying his panic.Isolating him from the outside world, the scammers instructed Bahuguna to cut off all communication and turn off his devices. They extracted personal information and placed him under “self-custody,” keeping him on a continuous video call for 40 hours, preventing him from contacting anyone. They even directed him to a bank for suspicious transactions, which thankfully failed due to the branch being closed. It was only when a friend contacted him, suspecting fraud, that Bahuguna realized he had been scammed.Bahuguna shared his story to raise awareness and prevent others from experiencing similar ordeals. He emphasized the importance of understanding how panic can affect individuals differently and urged against judging victims. He also stressed the increasing prevalence of such scams and the need for vigilance against unexpected calls or messages, especially those involving threats or accusations of illegal activity. “Not everybody reacts the same way to panic. Instead of calling this stupid, make people around you aware of it,” he said in a follow-up comment.This incident highlights the sophisticated tactics used in digital scams, including exploiting personal information, psychological manipulation, and creating a sense of urgency and fear. The rise of digital platforms has unfortunately made it easier for scammers to target individuals, underscoring the importance of public awareness and caution. Bahuguna’s experience serves as a crucial reminder to stay informed and protect oneself from these increasingly common schemes.","YouTuber Ankush Bahuguna shared his distressing ordeal with a 40-hour digital arrest scam on Instagram.

Tenable CEO Amit Yoran’s 'medical leave message' to employees



“Team Tenable-

We have always operated this company with transparency, through good times and bad. Sticking to straight talk, here is the latest…

Following up to my email in March, I want to share a personal update on my health situation. I recently learned that my cancer requires additional treatment. While this is disappointing, it is still a very treatable situation. After much consideration with my doctors, family and colleagues, I have decided to take a temporary leave of absence to focus on my health and recovery.

While I am away over the next couple of months, the Board has appointed Steve Vintz and Mark Thurmond as Co-CEOs. They will step in to guide the organization, supported by the rest of our exceptional leadership team. I have complete trust in their ability—and yours—to keep our mission and transformation moving forward with the same passion and commitment to our customers. We have much to do and there is no time to waste.

As I take a brief pause to prioritize my health, I will stay as connected as I can while giving myself the space to heal fully.

I am deeply grateful for each of you, not only for the dedication you bring to your work but for the sense of community we’ve built together.

Thank you in advance for your understanding and support. I am grateful for you all.

Amit”

TikTok ban: US Justice Department asks Supreme Court to reject Donald Trump’s delay request,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tiktok-ban-us-justice-department-asks-supreme-court-to-reject-donald-trumps-delay-request/articleshow/116961782.cms,"Poll What Content Type Do You Enjoy Most?

Why DOJ is opposing Donald Trump’s request

What TikTok says

The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has asked the Supreme Court to reject President-elect Donald Trump 's request to delay a law that could ban TikTok or force its sale by January 19, 2025, reports Reuters. A law passed in April 2024 requires TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance , to sell its US assets or face a ban. If the law takes effect, TikTok will be removed from Apple and Google app stores. While existing users can keep using the app, but over time, it will stop working as updates and support are blocked.Last week, Trump argued that he should have until after he takes office on January 20 to find a ""political solution"" to the issue.The DOJ said TikTok has not proven it is likely to win the case, which is necessary for a delay. It also emphasized concerns about national security , stating that China could use TikTok to gather sensitive data on Americans and conduct harmful operations.Interestingly, Trump’s current support for TikTok marks a shift from 2020, when he tried to ban the app and force its sale due to concerns over its Chinese ownership.TikTok is fighting back, saying the law violates free speech under the First Amendment. The company also pointed out that other Chinese-owned apps like Shein and Temu have not been targeted, suggesting TikTok is being singled out because of its content, not its data practices.TikTok's future in the US now depends on how the Supreme Court rules and whether Biden extends the deadline. The court will hear arguments about the case on January 10.Earlier, ByteDance has rejected selling TikTok, citing Chinese export regulations from 2020 that restrict the sale of its core algorithmic technology. Without this algorithm, any acquisition would lack the innovations that define TikTok's success. Despite these challenges, investors like Steven Mnuchin and Frank McCourt have expressed interest in buying the platform. Republican Rep John Moolenaar remains optimistic that Trump may facilitate an American acquisition to keep TikTok operational in the US.","Law passed in April 2024 requires TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its US assets or face a ban.

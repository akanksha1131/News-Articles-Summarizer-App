Retention metrics “Healthy,” says Pichai



The cost of staying competitive







With the growing concerns over an escalating talent war in the artificial intelligence segment, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has publicly addresses the issue of employee poaching, specifically from Google DeepMind, the company’s AI research division. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at Alphabet’s Q2 earnings call, Pichai acknowledged the growing competition from rivals like Microsoft, Meta and also from emerging players such as OpenAI. All of these companies have aggressively recruited AI experts and that to with multimillion-dollar compensation packages.“I do know individual cases can make headlines,” Pichai said, referring to recent high-profile departures. “But when we look at numbers deeply, I think we are doing well through this moment.”As reported by Business Insider, Google CEO remains confident of Google’s internal metrics despite the ongoing talent drain. “We continue to look at both our retention metrics, as well as the new talent coming in, and both are healthy,” he stated. Google declined to share specific figures when asked by Business Insider.Pichai’s comments come at a time when Meta has launched its ‘superintelligence’ division and has already poached many former Google employees including Pei Sun, the researcher who contributed to Google’s Gemini AI assistant and Waymo self-driving technology.According to Business Insider, analysts such as Bernstein’s Mark Shmulik, raised concerns about the increasing costs of staying ahead on the race of AI innovation. A recent report by SignalFire revealed that researchers are 11 times more likely to leave Google for Anthropic than the reverse — a stark indicator of shifting industry dynamics.Pichai stressed on the fact that retaining the top talent is not all about offering huge compensation packages. “Access to compute is super important,” he said, referencing Google’s investment in cutting-edge chips and infrastructure. “Researchers want to be at the frontier driving progress… the mission and how state-of-the-art the work is matters.”","Google CEO Sundar Pichai has publicly addressed the issue of employee poaching, specifically from Google DeepMind, the company’s AI research division. “We continue to look at both our retention metrics, as well as the new talent coming in, and both are healthy,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123934116,imgsize-22098,width-400,resizemode-4/were-not-slowing-down-now-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-after-pixel-10-launch.jpg"

What the US entertainment companies said in the lawsuit



“MiniMax’s bootlegging business model and defiance of US copyright law are not only an attack on Plaintiffs and the hard-working creative community that brings the magic of movies to life, but are also a broader threat to the American motion picture industry.”

“MiniMax completely disregards U.S. copyright law and treats Plaintiffs’ valuable copyrighted characters like its own. MiniMax’s copyright infringement is willful and brazen. Given the rapid advancement in technology in the AI video generation field ... it is only a matter of time until Hailuo AI can generate unauthorized, infringing videos featuring Plaintiffs’ copyrighted characters that are substantially longer, and even eventually the same duration as a movie or television program,”

Walt Disney Co., Universal Pictures, and Warner Bros. Discovery have sued Chinese AI company MiniMax. The US-based entertainment companies have alleged that the service offered by the AI startup, which is also known as one of China’s ‘Six Tigers’, generates copyrighted characters without permission. Alongside Zhipu AI, Moonshot AI, Baichuan Intelligence, StepFun, and 01.AI, Minimax is seen as part of the country’s most prominent AI firms. These companies are staffed with talent that includes former employees of major U.S. and Chinese tech giants, such as Google and Huawei.According to a report by The LA Times, the lawsuit claims MiniMax's AI has created iconic characters, including Darth Vader, the Minions, and Wonder Woman. The entertainment studios are seeking damages of up to $150,000 for each infringed work, along with attorney fees and costs. They have also requested that MiniMax be stopped from any further infringement.In their complaint (as seen by LA Times), filed in the US District Court in Los Angeles, the companies said:The entertainment companies asked that MiniMax be barred from further infringement and are seeking damages of up to $150,000 per infringed work, along with attorney fees and costs.According to the lawsuit, Shanghai-based MiniMax operates a service called Hailuo AI, marketed as a “Hollywood studio in your pocket.” The platform allegedly featured characters such as the Joker and Groot in its ads without the studios’ consent.The document states that users can enter a text prompt requesting characters like “Star Wars’” Yoda or DC Comics’ Superman, and Hailuo AI can generate high-quality, downloadable images or video of them.the lawsuit added.This marks the latest wave of copyright lawsuits filed by major studios against AI companies over intellectual property issues. In June, Disney and Universal Pictures sued AI firm Midjourney for copyright infringement, and earlier this month, Warner Bros. Discovery also brought a lawsuit against Midjourney.","Walt Disney Co., Universal Pictures, and Warner Bros. Discovery have sued Chinese AI company MiniMax.

Google’s New AI Is BANANAS: How To Use Gemini Nano Banana





OpenAI recently announced plans to restructure into a for-profit public benefit corporation, a move that will allow it to issue traditional stock to investors. With this change, according to analysts, Microsoft is set to receive a new equity stake in OpenAI that could be worth at least $150 billion. This would be a remarkable return on Microsoft’s total investment of approximately $13 billion – suggesting that bet is shaping up to be one of the most successful investments in the history of technology.According to a report by Business Insider, the potential return rivals some of the most famous technology acquisitions. Google's purchase of YouTube for $1.65 billion in 2006 and Facebook's acquisition of Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 are both now worth hundreds of billions.However, there is a huge difference. Google’s and Meta’s investments took more than a decade to mature, while Microsoft's return on its OpenAI investments has grown at a much faster pace.The original partnership between Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, CTO Kevin Scott, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was unusual, involving profit-sharing units in what was then a charity. As part of the deal, OpenAI received credits to use Microsoft's Azure cloud service to train and operate the large AI models that power ChatGPT.Following the launch of ChatGPT and its growth, OpenAI required more money to support its operations. The startup’s unusual corporate structure presented challenges in raising capital from new investors who sought traditional equity stakes. This pressure led to a renegotiation of the partnership with Microsoft, a process that has been described as acrimonious but is now nearing a resolution.The outcome appears to be a win-win: Microsoft stands to gain a massive equity stake, and OpenAI can now issue traditional stock to raise more funding.Given OpenAI’s current valuation of $500 billion from a new funding round, a 30% stake would be worth $150 billion, and a 33% stake would be worth even more.","OpenAI recently announced plans to restructure into a for-profit public benefit corporation.

According to cybersecurity researchers, these fake IDs was reportedly used to make a phishing attempt more credible by linking to malware that could extract data from the recipient's device. The cyber-espionage unit, which researchers have dubbed Kimsuky, is suspected of being sponsored by North Korea and has been linked to other spying efforts against South Korean targets. The US Department of Homeland Security previously stated that Kimsuky is likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence-gathering mission. The details were published in a report by the South Korean cybersecurity firm Genians.During their investigation into forged identification documents, Genians researchers tested ChatGPT. While the system initially refused to generate a government ID (which is illegal under South Korean law) however, adjusting the prompt allowed the restriction to be bypassed.Mun Chong-hyun, director at Genians said that the broader trend shows how attackers are turning to AI for tasks such as planning attacks, developing malware, creating hacking tools, and impersonating recruiters.In July, cybersecurity firm Genians shared its latest findings on signs of suspected North Korean operatives using AI in intelligence-gathering.Later on, in August, Anthropic reported that North Korean hackers had leveraged its Claude Code tool to secure remote jobs at US Fortune 500 tech companies. The AI system assisted them in crafting fake identities, passing coding tests, and even delivering technical work once hired.Earlier, in February, the company said it had banned accounts linked to North Korea that were using its service to generate fraudulent resumes, cover letters, and social media content to support recruitment schemes.Recent phishing attempts targeted South Korean journalists, researchers, and human rights activists focusing on North Korea. Emails appeared to come from an address ending in .mli.kr, mimicking a South Korean military domain. The number of victims remains unclear.US officials have long accused North Korea of running cyber operations, cryptocurrency theft, and IT contracting schemes to collect intelligence and generate revenue. Washington alleges that the funds support Pyongyang’s efforts to evade sanctions and advance its nuclear weapons program.","Hackers used ChatGPT to create a deepfake of a South Korean military ID card.

US and China reach “framework” deal to save TikTok from ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-and-china-reach-framework-deal-to-save-tiktok-from-ban/articleshow/123913556.cms,"Trump administration claims victory ahead of looming deadline

Questions remain over algorithm control and congressional approval





The United States and China announced they have reached a ""framework"" agreement to transfer TikTok to US-controlled ownership, potentially averting a ban of the popular social media app just days before a September 17 deadline. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the preliminary deal during trade talks in Madrid, saying President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will finalize the agreement in a Friday phone call.The framework would shift ownership of TikTok's US operations away from Chinese parent company ByteDance to American investors, addressing national security concerns that have dominated the app's future for years. While Bessent declined to reveal commercial terms, calling it a deal ""between two private parties,"" he emphasized the agreement protects US security interests while preserving what Chinese negotiators consider the app's cultural characteristics.Trump celebrated the breakthrough on Truth Social, writing that ""a deal was also reached on a 'certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save.""The announcement comes after months of negotiations and three deadline extensions since Trump took office, with the current ban scheduled to take effect Wednesday if no agreement is reached.Chinese trade negotiator Li Chenggang confirmed the two sides reached a ""basic framework consensus"" on resolving TikTok-related issues through cooperation. However, he warned the US against continued ""suppression"" of Chinese companies while seeking Chinese accommodation on American concerns.Critical details remain unresolved, including whether ByteDance will transfer control of TikTok's valuable recommendation algorithm that drives user engagement. Chinese officials previously expressed reluctance to export the algorithm technology, which Beijing considers strategically sensitive. Wang Jingtao from China's cyberspace regulator suggested the deal could involve licensing intellectual property rights rather than full transfer.Any final agreement may require approval from Congress, which passed bipartisan legislation in 2024 requiring ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a ban due to national security fears. The law, upheld by the Supreme Court, prohibits companies from ""foreign adversary"" countries from owning more than 20 percent of the platform.Industry analysts expect Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, a Trump ally whose company currently hosts TikTok's US data, to lead the American investor group. TikTok serves approximately 170 million US users, making it one of the most significant social media platforms in the country.","The United States and China announced they have reached a ""framework"" agreement to transfer TikTok to US-controlled ownership.

ChatGPT is changing experience for under 18 users after AI chatbot gets blamed for 16-year-old’s suicide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-is-changing-experience-for-under-18-users-after-ai-chatbot-gets-blamed-for-16-year-olds-suicide/articleshow/123925836.cms,"How ChatGPT’s new teen version will work



“the system detects their teen is in a moment of acute distress.”





OpenAI is developing a ""different ChatGPT experience"" for users under 18. The Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence startup has announced its plans to use age-prediction technology to restrict users under 18 from accessing the standard version of the chatbot. The announcement comes after new research and a lawsuit raised alarms about the AI's impact on teen mental health. This comes after the parents of Adam Raine, a 16-year-old who died by suicide in April, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in August. The suit alleged that ChatGPT acted as a ""coach"" and helped Raine plan his death. According to the lawsuit, the chatbot told Raine that ""many people who struggle with anxiety or intrusive thoughts find solace in imagining an 'escape hatch' because it can feel like a way to regain control.""In response to these concerns, OpenAI has announced a series of updates, including enhanced safeguards for conversations related to suicide, new parental controls, and a system to handle prolonged chats better. The company stated that if its tools cannot confidently predict a person's age, ChatGPT will default to its under-18 version ""out of an abundance of caution.""OpenAI’s latest announcement is part of a broader initiative it outlined earlier this month to introduce new safeguards for teenagers and people in emotional distress, with plans to implement them by the end of the year.With the teen version of ChatGPT, parents can now link their accounts to their teens’ through an invitation, allowing them to manage how the chatbot interacts with their children using age-appropriate rules.They can enable or disable features like memory and chat history, as well as receive alerts ifA new option will also allow parents to set blackout hours when teens cannot use ChatGPT.OpenAI has consistently maintained that ChatGPT is available only to users aged 13 and older. The latest announcement comes just hours ahead of a Senate hearing in Washington, DC, examining the risks AI chatbots may pose to teenagers, led by Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) alongside a bipartisan group of senators including Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Katie Britt (R-Ala.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Chris Coons (D-Del. ).At the same time, the FTC has launched an inquiry into chatbot safety, requesting information from OpenAI, Meta and Instagram, Alphabet (Google), xAI, Snap, and Character.AI.","ChatGPT will use age-prediction technology to restrict users under 18 from accessing the standard version of the chatbot.

Scale AI has lost focus: CEO of rival company says after AI startup’s Meta-led shake up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/scale-ai-has-lost-focus-ceo-of-rival-company-says-after-ai-startups-meta-led-shake-up/articleshow/123925013.cms,"""missed the mark on key aspects""

""phenomenal""

“In some ways, Scale lost the focus on product, on scaling quality. And that was one of the largest challenges of the business,”

What Scale AI said about Mercor CEO’s claims



“There must be something Brendan admires about Scale if he keeps mentioning us to get publicity. Our data quality metrics are at record highs and we remain focused on leading the market.”

“confidential”

“While that felt like the right decision at the time, it's clear this approach created inefficiencies and redundancies. We created too many layers, excessive bureaucracy, and unhelpful confusion about the team's mission.”

Scale AI's former CEO, Alexandr Wang,of the business, the CEO of a rival company has claimed. Speaking on the ""20VC"" podcast, Mercor CEO Brendan Foody said that while Wang wasat sales and distribution, the AI training startup had sidetracked in other areas.Foody noted. His comments follows a significant shakeup at Scale AI, which happend after the startup secured a $14.3 billion investment from Facebook-parent Meta in June. After the deal, the startup rushed to reassure investors and major tech clients that their data was safe despite its close links to the social media giant.Responding to Foody’s claims, Joe Osborne, a Scale AI spokesperson said to Business Insider:Soon after Meta’s Scale AI investment announcement, serious security lapses in the startup’s operations were reportedly exposed, revealing that the company routinely relied on public Google Docs to track work for high-profile customers like Google, Meta, and xAI.This left AI training documents labeledaccessible to anyone with the link. Scale AI later said it had tightened security and restricted access to those documents.AI startups such as Scale AI, Mercor, and Surge AI employ hundreds of thousands of part-time contractors worldwide to filter, rank, and train AI responses for major AI firms.Apart from criticisng Scale AI, Foody who is also cofounded Mercor in 2023 said that the most crucial part of the business was quality and ""having phenomenal people that you treat incredibly well.""He further noted that Mercor’s average pay rate is $95 an hour, while, according to him, competitors such as Scale and Surge pay around $30 an hour. Pay for AI training work differs depending on the contractor’s location, educational background, and the complexity of the assignment.In comparison, Scale pays STEM experts about $30 to $50 per hour and generalists $15 to $30 an hour, according to its website. Meanwhile, Mercor’s website lists rates of $90 to $110 an hour for STEM experts and about $45 an hour for generalists.In June, Mercor’s head of product, Osvald Nitski, said the company is focused on hiring top-tier annotators, such as International Math Olympiad medalists, Rhodes Scholars, and PhD students.In July, Scale AI announced layoffs affecting around 200 full-time employees which was about 14% of its 1,400-person staff along with 500 contractors.At that time, Scale's interim CEO Jason Droege wrote an internal email where he said:","Scale AI's former CEO, Alexandr Wang, of the business, the CEO of a rival company has claimed.

Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath on Nvidia’s Jensen Huang: ‘He survived in the business for 30 years until…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamath-on-nvidias-jensen-huang-he-survived-in-the-business-for-30-years-until/articleshow/123924736.cms,"“I was just reading about Jensen Huang from Nvidia, he survived in the business for 30 years until he hit the right place and time. For a long time, people might have questioned what he was doing until very recently.”

Nithin Kamath says he started Zerodha with Rs 10 lakh investment

Here's the full post shared by Nithin Kamath

Someone on Reddit asked what does Zerodha do differently, how are we profitable, why don't IPO etc. This is what I replied:

Hmmm... so you forget that we have spent 15 years getting here. And maybe another 10 years, before Zerodha, I was involved in the markets in some form. So, 25 years in all. Things in business compound over time, especially if you like or love what you are doing and if you are lucky to be in the right place and time.

When we started Zerodha, we started off as a partnership firm because the exchange deposit requirement was lower, Rs 90 lks compared to Rs 1.5 cr. The start was mainly enabled thanks to the NSE Now trading platform, which came free of cost if you were an NSE broker. For the backoffice piece, sending contract notes, maintaining ledgers, etc., we signed up with a vendor who basically gave it at almost 0 cost. This was provided that we tested out his platform.

So the money we have spent on Zerodha is maybe ~Rs 10lks, and that is all the money that has gone into the business till date. Rs 2.5 lks for our website, Rs 5lks for our office interiors (we had an office before), and Rs 2.5 lks for miscellaneous. So, we came from an extremely middle-class background and had no rich uncles. 😀 Dad was a bank manager, and Mom taught Veena.

Our rise coincides with India's rise. We were present at the right place and time with the right products and initiatives. Any gyan any founder gives, eventually comes down to getting timing right, and this has got everything to do with luck. 😀 I was just reading about Jensen Huang from Nvidia, he survived in the business for 30 years until he hit the right place and time. For a long time, people might have questioned what he was doing until very recently. 😀

Now that there is no pressure to give any exit to any investor, we can continue doing what is right for the customer, sometimes even at the cost of the business. For example, our no spam or no tracking policy. I believe that the philosophy with which we run Zerodha will be our real moat as a business. It is very tough to stick to it as a public company.





Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath recently drew a parallel between the journey of his brokerage firm and that of Jensen Huang’s Nvidia, highlighting the importance of timing and perseverance in the success of any business. In a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Kamath said:In the post, Nithin Kamath explained that Zerodha’s story, too, was one of patience, compounding, and being in the right place at the right time. “We were present at the right place and time with the right products and initiatives. Any gyan any founder gives, eventually comes down to getting timing right, and this has got everything to do with luck,” he wrote.The entrepreneur shared that “we came from an extremely middle-class background and had no rich uncles”. He said that Zerodha began as a partnership firm in 2010, with minimal investment — about ₹10 lakh in total — and leaned on free or low-cost infrastructure such as the NSE Now trading platform.“So the money we have spent on Zerodha is maybe ~₹10 lakh, and that is all the money that has gone into the business till date,” he wrote.“Our rise coincides with India's rise,” he stated, poiting to policies such as Zerodha’s “no spam, no tracking” approach. “I believe that the philosophy with which we run Zerodha will be our real moat as a business.

Elon Musk responds to Destiny’s video refusing to condemn Charlie Kirk’s assassination

Who is Destiny aka Steven Bonnell II





Political streamer Destiny or Steven Bonnell II recently appeared on Piers Morgan Uncensored where he refused to condemn the assassination of Trump’s aide and right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. During the appearance, Destiny was asked to criticize Kirk’s killing. However, he outrightly refused to do so, saying “I won't condemn anything until [Trump] can go on air and say all of us need to calm down”.Kirk, co-founder of non-profit organization Turning Point USA was shot dead in a targeted attack at Utah Valley University earlier this month. President Donald Trump posted a video on his Truth Social platform where he called Kirk's assassination a ""heinous"" and ""dark moment for America.""Now, videos of Destiny from the episode are doing rounds on the internet, bringing backlash from viewers and sparking heated debate across social media platforms.One such clip caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Sharing the video, an X user wrote “Why hasn't Amazon banned their streamer, who has repeatedly called for conservatives to be murdered?”, adding “You know this is on you, @JeffBezos, right? Anything happens to one of us, and you will be held personally responsible.”Replying to the post, Musk said “I don’t think this jackass should be banned, but Amazon should stop paying him to incite murder. That’s insane.”“Separately, incitement to murder and domestic terrorism is a felony crime. For that, he should go to prison. He can resume streaming when he has served his term,” the tech billionaire concluded.Steven Kenneth Bonnell II, better known online as Destiny, is an American streamer and political commentator. The 36-year-old began his career streaming StarCraft II before shifting toward political debates and commentary.Destiny is known for his sharp exchanges with both right-wing and left-wing figures, often positioning himself as a liberal or social democrat. His outspoken style has made him one of the most polarizing voices in online politics.Born in Omaha, Nebraska, Destiny grew up in a conservative Catholic household and later studied music before dropping out to pursue streaming full time.","Steven Kenneth Bonnell II, better known online as Destiny, is an American streamer and political commentator.

Poll Do you think AI will lead to a three-day workweek in the future? Yes, absolutely No, that's unrealistic

A new work life balance







The future of work may be shorter than we think. Zoom CEO Eric Yuan has now joined the growing chorus of tech and business leaders — including Bill Gates, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in predicting that AI will lead to a 3-day workweek in the future.In a recent interview with New York Times, Yaun stressed on the fact that AI’s rapid evolution is said to dramatically reshape productivity and will enable people to complete the work in hours what once took days. “If you leverage AI, you can probably achieve the same results with less effort,” Yuan said, echoing sentiments shared by Gates and Huang, who have both suggested that AI could reduce the need for traditional five-day work schedules.Yuan’s comments support the broader shift in executive thinking that AI will not just automate tasks, but also redefine the structure of work itself. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently noted that AI could “take away the drudgery,” while Dimon emphasised that future generations may not need to to three days a week all thanks to the technological advances fuelled by AI.For those unaware, Zoom gained immense popularity during the pandemic.The company is now investing heavily in AI-powered features such as real-time meeting summaries to smart scheduling assistants. All these tools are designed to reduce workplace fiction and also improve collaboration.While the idea of a three day workweek sounds utopian, Yuan cautioned that it will require a cultural shift and thoughtful implementation. “We need to rethink how we measure productivity,” he said, suggesting that output and impact — not hours clocked — should define success in the AI era.As AI tools are integrating more into daily workflows, the conversation is shifting from automation anxiety to lifestyle transformation. If Yuan and his peers are right, the next generation of workers may enjoy more time off — all thanks to AI.",Zoom CEO Eric Yuan has joined the growing chorus of tech and business leaders in predicting that AI will lead to a 3-day workweek in the future.

Low quality or group photos: AI often struggle in identifying crowded images. So try uploading sharp and solo photos with a clear and visible face for perfect results.

Vague prompts: Always avoid giving vague prompts. Instructions such as “make me look like a Bollywood actress” won’t give desired results. So, better be specific — mention saree colour, fabric, lighting style, and background.

Overloading the prompt: Don’t give too many details. It is seen that too many details can confuse the AI. So stick to 3–4 concise visual cues instead of long paragraphs.

Ignoring the background: Bollywood aesthetics rely on dramatic backdrops. If you don’t specify one, the AI may default to plain or mismatched scenes.

Forgetting facial consistency: Don’t forget to add instructions like “keep the same facial features” to avoid unwanted distortions or face shape changes.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?





China’s market regulator, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), has announced that a preliminary probe has found US chip giant Nvidia in violation of the country’s anti-monopoly law. The regulator, which stated that its investigation will continue, did not specify the details of how Nvidia allegedly breached the law.According to a report by CNBC, the investigation is linked to Nvidia’s 2020 acquisition of Mellanox, an Israeli technology company that creates network solutions for data centers and servers. Although China had approved the deal at the time, it was done so with certain conditions, which the SAMR’s preliminary finding now suggests have been violated.Notably, China is one of the biggest markets for Nvidia, after the US.This announcement from the SAMR has the potential to complicate trade talks between Chinese and US officials that began on Sunday (September 14) in Madrid, Spain. Tensions between the two nations have been on the rise in the technology sector, report said, adding that just two days prior to this new finding, China launched two separate probes into semiconductors: an anti-dumping investigation into certain chips imported from the US and an anti-discrimination scrutiny of US restrictions on China’s chip industry.Nvidia has been at the centre of this situation in recent months. Earlier this year, the company’s H20 product, a chip specifically designed to comply with US export restrictions, was blocked from being sent to China.However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly supported that American firms be allowed to sell to China, citing the local artificial intelligence market's potential to reach $50 billion in the next two to three years. Huang has argued that if American companies are not present, domestic players like Huawei will fill the void.That lobbying appeared to have worked, as last month, Nvidia cut a deal with Washington that would allow it to resume chip sales to China in exchange for giving up 15% of that revenue to the US government.","China’s market regulator, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), has announced that a preliminary probe has found US chip giant Nvidia in violation of the country's anti-monopoly law.

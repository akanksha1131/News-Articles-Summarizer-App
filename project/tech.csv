Ross Gerber to Tesla Board: Tesla needs a new CEO

Elon Musk only has 24 hours in a day

Tesla investor Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, has publicly called for Elon Musk 's removal as Tesla CEO. Ross German asked for Elon Musk's removal in a recent phone interview to NewsWeek. Incidentally, this is not the first time that Gerber has asked for Elon Musk's resignation. This echoes his previous criticisms following Musk's acquisition of Twitter (now X) in June 2022. Angry at Elon Musk's Twitter buy and the consequent fall in Tesla stock, Ross Gerber had said that Musk is “not suited” to run Twitter Inc and should instead focus on repairing the damage his acquisition has done to Tesla Inc’s brand. He went on to say that Tesla Board should not have allowed him to buy Twitter.Gerber had made these comments when Tesla’s value had tumbled more than 60% in December 2022 since the start of that year, and Musk had sold a substantial portion of his own shares to fund Twitter's $44 billion acquisition that was completed in October 2022.In an interview to Bloomberg TV during that time, Gerber said, “Let somebody who’s a media-savvy person deal with advertisers and the media and the front face of the company,” He added, “I think he just got himself maybe over his skis in an area that he’s just not suited to deal with the subtleties of.”As a long-time Tesla investor holding over 250,000 shares, Gerber asserts that the Tesla board has been ""wildly negligent"" in failing to curb Musk's ""extremist statements"" and the resulting brand erosion. He believes the board ""solely functions at the benefit of Elon"" and is unlikely to act against him. ""Why has the board of directors sat quietly while so much brand value has been eroded to the point that cars are being set on fire?"" he said. ""It's been wildly negligent that the board has done nothing to curb Elon's behavior, especially around extremist statements."" Still, he cast doubt that Musk would be removed by the board, which he says ""solely functions at the benefit of Elon"" and has been ""highly compensated"" by Musk.Gerber explicitly stated, ""I think Tesla needs a new CEO,"" emphasizing that Tesla's core business has been ""neglected for too long.""Gerber suggested Musk either return his full attention to Tesla or step aside, allowing a dedicated CEO to manage the company. Gerber attributes Tesla's stock decline to Musk's divided attention and the negative publicity generated by his social media activity and political involvement. He said that Musk only has 24 hours in the day and he has split his time too thinly since his purchase of Twitter - now called X - in 2022. He believes that while Tesla's products are exceptional, Musk's limited time and distractions have become detrimental to the company.","Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, has publicly called for Elon Musk's removal as Tesla CEO.

Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas was the guest in the latest edition of Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath 's podcast 'The WTF is?'. Desi CEO of Perplexity AI spoke about a range of things in Nikhil Kamath's podcast including his IIT days in Chennai, interest in AI and ML, internship days in Bengaluru and more. Talking about his three-week internship in Bengaluru, Perplexity CEO said that he spent the same largely in his Koramangala apartment, prioritizing work over exploring the city. Srinivas admitted that he barely ventured out during his stay in Bengaluru. “I just worked all the time. Looking back, maybe I should have explored Bangalore a bit more,” he mused. Kamath, however, reassured him that focusing on work was likely the better choice.Reflecting on this during the podcast, the IIT-Madras graduate said that a reason behind his not venturing much was also the city's traffic. “I remember the traffic being bad back then, and I hear it’s even worse now. So, staying in and working was probably a smart move,” he said. What stood out to him, though, was the weather: “It was awesome compared to Chennai.”Recalling his days in Chennai, Srinivas highlighted the academic pressure he felt growing up. “There was always this push to excel academically,” he said. His passion for machine learning sparked when he dove into a Kaggle competition. “That was my entry into AI. It wasn’t just about winning—it was about figuring out how machines learn from data.”Work, for Srinivas, has always been a defining trait. “I worked all the time, and I’m really proud of that,” he said. When asked why he drives himself so hard, he explained, “I enjoy it. It’s not about chasing some goal to scale—it’s just what I love doing.” For him, the thrill lies in curiosity, not accolades. “I love the intellectual challenge, learning new things, staying curious.”He recounted a memorable exchange with AI podcaster Lex Fridman, who quizzed him intensely on AI basics, neural networks, and even Google’s business model. “I thought I had it all figured out, but he really put me to the test. I live for those kinds of conversations—they’re rare,” Srinivas said.He also emphasized the value of asking questions, no matter how basic they might seem. Quoting Confucius, he said, “You might feel foolish for a moment when you ask, but you’ll be a fool forever if you don’t. I’m all for people asking questions.”","Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas was the guest in the latest edition of Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath's podcast 'The WTF is?'.

Price target for Tesla stock

Good time to buy Tesla stock

Tesla gets billionaire investor Ron Baron's support

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has good news for Tesla investors. In a note, Jonas has predicted that Tesla stock will rebound over 90% within the next year. The Morgan Stanley analyst and long-standing Tesla enthusiast, forecasts a significant recovery for Tesla's stock, projecting a potential increase. Despite recently lowering his price target and sales expectations due to intensifying competition, an aging product lineup, and a ""Buyers' strike"" stemming from negative brand perception, Jonas maintains his overweight rating and considers Tesla a top investment choice.Tesla's stock has fallen 50% from its peak in December 2024, but the Morgan Stanley team has set a $430 price target, suggesting a 93% rebound from its current price of $223.59.Jonas views the current dip as an attractive entry point for investors, describing Tesla as an ""embodied [artificial intelligence] compounder"" in a recent note. While acknowledging short-term challenges such as declining sales, waning brand sentiment, and a market ""de-grossing,"" he argues that these issues do not fundamentally alter Tesla's long-term narrative, which hinges on advancements in robotics and AI. He notes that media attention has shifted toward Elon Musk 's political endeavors, overshadowing Tesla's AI initiatives and reshaping its public image.Jonas outlines a range of possibilities for Tesla's stock, with a bear case of $200 and a bull case of $800 within the next 12 months. He identifies potential catalysts for a stock resurgence, including the rollout of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) Unsupervised for paid rideshare services in Texas later this year. Although the Tesla Cybercab remains a longer-term prospect, Jonas believes that FSD Unsupervised rides in Model 3 or Model Y vehicles could highlight the promise of Tesla's robotaxi ambitions.Adding to the optimism, billionaire investor Ron Baron has reaffirmed his staunch support for Elon Musk and Tesla, undeterred by recent criticism of Musk's political activities. Despite near-term hurdles, Jonas remains confident that Tesla's focus on transformative technologies will drive its stock upward.","Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has predicted that Tesla stock will rebound over 90% within the next year.

Google-parent Alphabet acquires Israeli cybersecurity startup Wiz for $32 billion



Google launches Pixel 9a



Assassin’s Creed Shadows releases after months of delay, clocks in 2 million players in two days of launch



EU slams Google and Apple for voiding DMA



X sues government over ‘unrestrained censorship’

OpenAI, Meta in talks with Reliance for AI partnerships



Pebble creator is making new smartwatches, coming later this year

During the past week, the tech industry witnessed several major developments. Alphabet made headlines with its largest-ever acquisition, agreeing to purchase cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion to bolster Google Cloud's security capabilities. Google also announced the Pixel 9a, a mid-range smartphone featuring the Tensor G4 chip and advanced AI capabilities, scheduled for release in April 2025. In gaming, Ubisoft celebrated a successful launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, which attracted 2 million players within two days of its March 20th release. Meanwhile, regulatory challenges continued as the EU took enforcement action against Google and Apple for alleged violations of the Digital Markets Act, and more. Here are all the top tech news of the week.Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is acquiring cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion in what would be the tech giant's largest-ever acquisition, significantly surpassing its previous record purchase of Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion in 2012.The all-cash deal aims to strengthen Google Cloud's security capabilities amid growing demand for cloud computing services driven by the AI boom. Five-year-old Wiz, founded by four friends who met in the Israeli army and currently headquartered in New York, is on track to generate $1 billion in revenue this year.The acquisition faces potential regulatory scrutiny, particularly given Google's ongoing antitrust battles with the U.S. Justice Department over its search and advertising businesses, though analysts suggest both companies likely see a path to approval under the Trump administration. If approved, the deal is expected to close in 2026.The Google Pixel 9a is a new mid-range smartphone priced at Rs 49,900, featuring Google's Tensor G4 chip and a sleek redesign with a 6.3-inch Actua display that's 35% brighter than its predecessor with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate. The phone comes in four colors: Peony , new Iris, Porcelain, and Obsidian. Camera upgrades include a dual rear system with a 48MP main camera, 13MP ultrawide, and first-time Macro Focus for the A-series. AI features include Add Me, Best Take, Magic Editor with Auto Frame, and Gemini built-in with Gemini Nano, making it the only sub-$500 phone with this capability. The Pixel 9a boasts over 30 hours of battery life (up to 100 hours with Extreme Battery Saver), seven years of OS updates, IP68 water and dust resistance, and enhanced security features. Additional features include Circle to Search, Pixel Studio , Call Assist, and family-focused tools like Google Family Link, School Time, and the new Google Wallet for kids rolling out in select countries.The phone will be available beginning in April 2025.Assassin's Creed Shadows has reached 2 million players within two days of its March 20th release, according to Ubisoft's announcement on social media. The company stated that this milestone surpasses the launch performance of both Assassin's Creed Origins and Odyssey. While Ubisoft hasn't confirmed specific sales figures, the game is currently the top-selling title on Steam with nearly 59,000 concurrent players at the time of reporting, approaching Odyssey 's all-time Steam peak of 62,069 players.The game's success is particularly significant for Ubisoft following several high-profile commercial disappointments, including Star Wars Outlaws, and amid reports that the founding Guillemot family is exploring buyout talks with Tencent. Despite facing controversies in Japan that prompted a day-one patch to address concerns about in-game temples and shrines, Assassin's Creed Shadows has received ""very positive"" user reviews on Steam, with 81% of over 6,000 reviews marked as positive. The game is available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Ubisoft+, Amazon Luna, and Mac , with an iPad version expected in the future.The European Commission has taken enforcement action against Google and Apple for allegedly violating the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), despite potential retaliation from the Trump administration.In its preliminary findings announced on March 19, the Commission accused Google's search engine of unfairly prioritizing Alphabet's own services over competitors and preventing app developers on Google Play from directing consumers to better offers elsewhere. Apple faces requirements to make its operating systems compatible with competitors' devices and provide a clear methodology for responding to app developers' requests to access its systems.Violations of the DMA could result in fines of up to 10% of worldwide revenue (20% for repeat offenders), potentially reaching nearly $80 billion based on Apple's 2024 revenue. Apple criticized the decision as ""red tape"" that would slow innovation, while Google argued the changes would make it harder for users to find what they're looking for.Elon Musk 's X (formerly Twitter) has filed a lawsuit against the Indian government, alleging that the Ministry of Information Technology is unlawfully expanding its censorship powers. The lawsuit claims that the government has created a parallel content removal system that bypasses legal safeguards protecting free speech by allowing countless officials to issue removal orders without proper oversight.X argues this violates constitutional rights to equality and freedom of expression. The case represents the latest conflict between X and Indian authorities over content moderation, dating back to disputes in 2021 regarding farmers' protests. This legal battle comes at a significant time as Musk reportedly prepares to launch his other ventures—Starlink and Tesla—in India, with the Karnataka High Court scheduled to continue hearing arguments on March 27.OpenAI and Meta Platforms have been holding separate discussions with India's Reliance Industries about potential partnerships to expand their AI offerings in the country, according to a report by The Information.One possibility being discussed involves a relationship between Reliance Jio and OpenAI to distribute ChatGPT, potentially at a reduced subscription price. Reliance has also discussed selling OpenAI's models to its enterprise customers through an API and hosting both Meta and OpenAI models locally in a planned three-gigawatt data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat, which Reliance claims will be the world's largest. This local hosting would allow customer data to remain within India. Meta declined to comment on the report, while OpenAI and Reliance did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The original creator of the Pebble smartwatch, Eric Migicovsky, is preparing to release two new smartwatches through his company Core Devices. The first model, called the Core 2 Duo, will cost $149 and is expected to ship in July. It features the same black-and-white e-paper display as the original Pebble 2 and even uses leftover frames from the old Pebble designs. Despite being based on 8-year-old technology, the watch benefits from advances in efficiency, offering over 30 days of battery life compared to the original's seven days, and includes a new speaker for AI assistant interactions. Only about 10,000 units will be available.The second model, the Core Time 2, will ship in December for $225 and adds a touchscreen to the classic Pebble design while maintaining the signature buttons, long battery life, and customization features. Both watches will run the newly open-sourced Pebble operating system. Migicovsky notes that while iPhone compatibility remains challenging, Android integration is more straightforward. He emphasizes that his goal isn't to sell millions of units but rather ""to make something I really want.""","Google-parent company, Alphabet, is acquiring cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion in what would be the tech giant's largest-ever acquisition.

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu replies to Kerala Congress' RIP post for 'Make in India',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zoho-founder-sridhar-vembu-replies-to-kerala-congress-rip-post-for-make-in-india/articleshow/119109476.cms,"Here’s a look at Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu’s post

Sridhar Vembu’s comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress , emphasizing the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s recent expansion in Kerala. The image in the party’s post shows a tombstone design to symbolically critique the ""Make in India"" initiative, suggesting it has failed between 2014 and 2025. The tombstone features the Indian lion emblem and the phrase ""Rest in Peace.""The post is captioned “In loving memory of….”. Responding to the post, Vembu emphasized the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s expansion in Kerala. He wrote:“Meanwhile companies like us Make in India (and started making in Kerala recently too).”“Make in India is gaining momentum and we have to make up for several lost decades. Reflect on why they were ""lost decades"" and perhaps you will appreciate Make in India better,” he further added.Zoho has been expanding its operations across India, including in Kerala. The company has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas as part of its broader strategy.The Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports. Several companies, including Zoho, have increased their domestic production efforts as part of this initiative.Vembu’s response comes amid ongoing discussions on India's economic policies and industrial growth, with businesses and policymakers debating the impact of past and present strategies.Vembu recently drew a comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods, highlighting their long-term impact on economic structures. In a recent post, he discussed how capital inflows into a single sector can divert resources from others, weakening overall economic capabilities.Citing Silicon Valley as an example, Vembu pointed out the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, attributing them to a talent shift toward sectors with higher financial incentives. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now – for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors overlooked the sector due to the absence of large exits.Drawing a parallel to India, Vembu noted that the long-standing dominance of the IT industry resulted in the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he stated.He stressed the importance of addressing these gaps and rebuilding capabilities in affected sectors. ""We have to make up for lost time,"" he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress.

Air Canada and Thales issue joint statement

JetBlue, British Airways and Swiss Airlines have faced similar issues in the past

Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories.” According to a report in CNN, Air Canada's Boeing 737 MAX fleet were found to have moving maps — part of the in flight entertainment (IFE) system — that did not show Israel as a state, but replaced it with the name "" Palestinian territories ."" The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.The discrepancy, first noticed by a passenger, involved maps produced for French aerospace group Thales. Air Canada and Thales issued a joint statement acknowledging the error and stating that the issue has been ""resolved."" ""It was brought to the attention of Air Canada that the interactive map on its Boeing 737 fleet did not consistently portray certain Middle Eastern boundaries, including those of the State of Israel, at all amplification levels,"" the statement said. ""Air Canada’s policy in general is to display only city names on the maps in its aircraft, and the configuration on this particular system was not compliant with this policy."" Thales added in a separate statement that the map had been provided by a third party.The map feature was promptly disabled, and an updated version will be installed across the fleet starting March 14. Air Canada and Thales apologized for the ""unease created by this situation.""This is not the first time such an issue has occurred in aviation. JetBlue apologized for a similar map error in 2024, and British Airways faced a similar situation in 2013. In 2018, SWISS confirmed its policy of turning off maps entirely when landing in Tel Aviv after a similar incident.

Baidu has unveiled its AI model, Ernie X1, which is designed to articulate its reasoning process. The Ernie X1 model operates on similar principles to DeepSeek R1 , a model that garnered significant attention in Silicon Valley for its ability to deliver comparable performance to leading chatbots at a significantly lower development cost. Baidu emphasises that its reasoning model excels in areas such as daily dialogue, complex calculations, and logical deduction, as per a report.Bloomberg reports that in addition to the Ernie X1 launch, China's leading internet search provider has upgraded its flagship foundation model to Ernie 4.5 . Notably, the company has made all tiers of its AI service, including the X1 model, freely accessible to its chatbot users, accelerating its initial plans by several weeks.Baidu claims that Ernie 4.5 outperforms OpenAI's latest GPT 4.5 in text generation, citing various industry benchmarks. Baidu has also announced its intention to make its Ernie AI models open-source starting June 30. The company has also integrated the R1 model into its core search engine business.This launch appears to be a strategic move to regain momentum in the competitive AI landscape, where Baidu faces increasing pressure from emerging rivals such as DeepSeek, the report added.While Baidu was the first major Chinese tech company to introduce a ChatGPT-like chatbot, it has since faced stiff competition from rivals like TikTok parent company ByteDance and Moonshot AI. Furthermore, open-source models such as Alibaba's Qwen and DeepSeek have received recognition within the global developer community, the report added.The generative AI boom has positively impacted Baidu's financial performance, with a 26% increase in cloud revenue reported in its December-quarter results. This growth, driven by services provided to developers seeking computing power, was somewhat offset by weaker advertising sales amidst China's challenging economic conditions.","Baidu has unveiled its new Ernie X1 AI model, designed to articulate its reasoning process.

A ""low-ranking official,"" or as some say an office Babu at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Meta (then Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and some of the 'brightest tech minds' in his team with nothing more than a single click, according to explosive claims in a newly released memoir by former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams.The David versus Goliath moment allegedly occurred in 2016 during Facebook's aggressive push to save its controversial Free Basics program in India, which was facing regulatory scrutiny for potentially violating net neutrality principles.""Mark and some of the brightest tech minds in the world devoted months to this [outreach strategy], and some low-ranking official in India outfoxed them simply by clicking an opt-out box,"" Wynn-Williams writes in her book ""Careless People,"" which Meta is currently trying to block from publication.The memoir details how Facebook deployed its full arsenal of technological and political influence to sway public opinion about Free Basics. When India's Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) opened public consultations on whether such programs should be banned, Facebook allegedly orchestrated an unprecedented pressure campaign.""Our policy team is directly engaged with the government, include Prime Minister Modi's office,"" Wynn-Williams quotes then-COO Sheryl Sandberg as writing in an internal email. ""We're lucky this is happening in a place where we have very deep senior relationships in the government, but it's still going to be hard.""According to the book, Facebook's strategy focused on creating ""the appearance of public support"" through automated emails. The social media giant allegedly turned on a ""megaphone that Mark wouldn't let Sheryl use for [promoting] organ donation"" to nudge Indian users into sending approximately 16 million supportive emails to TRAI.The jugaad – a Hindi term for an innovative, improvised solution – came when Facebook discovered their millions of automated emails weren't being counted. ""Someone at TRAI—whoever controlled the email address for the public comments — simply opted out of all emails from Facebook,"" writes Wynn-Williams.The book makes other startling claims about Facebook's operations in India, including that the company hired an ""ex-police captain"" who would ""go to jail in a clash between Facebook and the Indian government"" if executives were targeted in government raids.Meta has dismissed the book as containing ""out-of-date and previously reported claims"" and ""false accusations about our executives."" A spokesperson told The Hindu that ""Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behaviour,"" claiming she ""has been paid by anti-Facebook activists.""Despite Meta's arbitration efforts to halt its publication and promotion in the US, ""Careless People"" remains available for purchase in India. The company has not specifically contested the claims regarding its operations in India detailed in the memoir.Free Basics was ultimately prohibited in India for violating net neutrality principles, representing a rare defeat for Zuckerberg's global expansion ambitions.",Former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams claims a 'low-ranking official' at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Mark Zuckerberg and his team.

Elon Musk: those protesting Tesla are ‘deranged’

Tesla investor and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Manager, Ross Gerber recently criticized Elon Musk saying that the Tesla CEO has lost focus given his widening interests and has become too ‘divisive’. Stating that Tesla needs a new CEO, Gerber said that “the company's reputation has just been destroyed by Elon Musk”. He blamed social media posts and involvement with the president Donald Trump for bringing negative publicity to the company. He also described Tesla’s current situation as a “crisis”, pointing to its declining sales. He said “Sales are plummeting so, yeah, it's a crisis. You literally can't sell the best product in the market place because the CEO is so divisive.”Gerber said: “It's time for somebody to run Tesla. The business has been neglected for too long. There are too many important things Tesla is doing, so either Elon should come back to Tesla and be the CEO of Tesla and give up his other jobs or he should focus on the government and keep doing what he is doing but find a suitable CEO of Tesla.”Tesla's market value has dropped by over $800 billion since December. The company has been facing worldwide protests with Tesla stores and cars being vandalised by the protesters.Last week, Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush, who once called himself a Tesla “core bull,” wrote in a note to investors that “The brand damage started off as limited in our view based on our initial survey work … but now has spread globally over the last few weeks into what we would characterize as a brand tornado crisis moment for Musk and Tesla.”Musk told Fox News recently that those protesting Tesla are “deranged.” “They basically want to kill me because I’m stopping their fraud, and they want to hurt Tesla because we’re stopping this terrible waste and corruption in the government,” he said.","Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Manager, criticized Elon Musk saying that the Tesla CEO has lost focus.

Quoting the post, Musk added, ""I do drift off into thinking about Mars at times.""Musk has frequently spoken about his vision for Mars exploration, with SpaceX actively developing its Starship rocket, designed to carry humans to Mars and beyond.

How Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s 'Blackwell joke' may not be so for the company’s biggest customers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-joke-about-blackwell-gpus-may-hurt-amazon-google-and-meta/articleshow/119370907.cms,"What Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said about Hooper chips



“I said before that when Blackwell starts shipping in volume, you couldn't give Hoppers away. There are circumstances where Hopper is fine. Not many.”

How GPU obsolescence may hurt Amazon, Google and Meta



“observed an increased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning.""

""As a result, we're decreasing the useful life for a subset of our servers and networking equipment from 6 years to 5 years, beginning in January 2025,""

""This could be a much larger problem at Meta and Google and other high-margin software companies,""

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently made a joke that the company’s biggest customers may not appreciate. The joke was about Nvidia's latest AI chip-and-server package, Blackwell. The newly introduced Blackwell chips are better than the previous version, Hopper, which was launched in 2022. Several major cloud companies, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google, buy these GPU systems as they use them to train and run the giant models powering generative AI. Facebook-parent Meta has also been buying many of these GPUs in recent years. These companies should be happy about a more powerful GPU like Blackwell as it's generally good for the AI community. However, there may be a problem as rapid technological advancements (Blackwell) quickly render older versions (Hopper) less valuable, forcing cloud companies to depreciate these assets faster, which in turn can significantly impact their earnings.Speaking at Nvidia’s AI conference, Huang said:In a statement to Business Insider, Ross Sandler, a tech analyst at Barclays also warned investors that major cloud companies and Meta will likely need to implement these changes, potentially resulting in a substantial reduction in profits.Amazon Web Services (AWS), the largest cloud provider, was the first to experience these challenges in February. On the company's earnings call last month, CFO Brian Olsavsky stated that theyhe added noting that this change will cut operating income this year by about $700 million.Additionally, Olsavsky mentioned that Amazon had ""early-retired"" some of its servers and network equipment, with this ""accelerated depreciation"" costing around $920 million and expected to reduce operating income by roughly $600 million in 2025.Sandler's research note also showed that the rental cost of H100 GPUs, which uses Nvidia's older Hopper architecture, has sharply fallen as the newer, superior Blackwell GPUs become more widely available.Sandler noted.According to his estimates, for Meta, shortening the useful life of its servers by one year would boost depreciation in 2026 by over $5 billion and similarly reduce operating income. For Google, a comparable adjustment would lower operating profit by $3.5 billion, Sandler added.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a joke about the company's latest AI chip-and- server package, Blackwell.

Reason behind the deadlock in negotiations between Starlink and Italian government

Negotiations between Elon Musk 's satellite internet company, Starlink , and the Italian government have come to a halt, according to Italy's Defense Minister Guido Crosetto. The talks, aimed at securing encrypted communications for government officials operating in risky areas, have been hindered by geopolitical tensions and concerns over national security.Crosetto revealed that discussions had shifted from technical aspects to debates surrounding statements made by and about Musk, without elaborating further. The proposed deal, reportedly worth €1.5 billion over five years, has sparked controversy among opposition politicians who question the wisdom of awarding a national security contract to a foreign businessman closely associated with former US President Donald Trump.Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government has prioritized its alliance with the United States in foreign policy, but balancing this relationship with European interests has proven challenging. The stalled negotiations highlight the complexities of geopolitical alliances and the scrutiny surrounding foreign involvement in sensitive national projects.Crosetto expressed optimism that talks could resume once tensions ease, allowing discussions to return to a technical level. Meanwhile, Elon Musk's representative in Italy, Andrea Stroppa, suggested that Starlink could serve as a short-term solution while Europe develops its own satellite infrastructure.","Negotiations between Elon Musk's satellite internet company, Starlink, and the Italian government have come to a halt.

HQ sale in line with Cognizant's consolidation efforts

In a significant real estate transaction, Cognizant Technology Solutions , a leading US-based IT company, has sold its 13.68-acre prime property in Okkiyam Thoraipakkam, off Chennai's Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR), for Rs 612 crore. The sale, registered earlier this week, at the Neelankarai sub-registrar's office, marks the end of an era for Cognizant's India headquarters, which had been based at the Thoraipakkam complex for over two decades. The property, Cognizant's first fully owned campus in Chennai, holds historical significance for the company.It served as the operational base for co-founders Lakshmi Narayanan and Chandrasekaran and witnessed a landmark event when Cognizant remotely rang the Nasdaq opening bell, signifying a major milestone in its growth. The move to the Thoraipakkam complex had previously elevated Cognizant from its rented space in the CSI building near the US Consulate.The sale aligns with Cognizant's ongoing efforts to consolidate its operations within three of its own buildings at MEPZ, Sholinganallur, and Siruseri. The company had put the property on the market in August last year, engaging international property advisory firm JLL to facilitate the transaction. After discussions with several prospective buyers, including local developers Baashyaam Group and Casagrand, Bengaluru-based real estate developer Bagamane Group emerged as the successful bidder.The transaction, which included a Rs 55.08 crore payment to the Tamil Nadu government for stamp duty and registration fees, was initially targeted for completion by December 2024. Cognizant vacated the campus by the end of December, despite the process taking nearly three months longer than expected, to prepare for the handover. The company has also been relinquishing leased spaces across Chennai, including prominent locations such as Ramanujan IT Park, DLF, and its office on St Mary’s Road in R A Puram.With the sale finalized, Cognizant's new India headquarters is set to operate from the MEPZ campus near Tambaram on GST Road. Meanwhile, the Bagamane Group is set to redevelop the Thoraipakkam property, possibly building high-rise mixed-use towers—a growing trend along OMR, Chennai’s vibrant IT corridor.","Cognizant Technology Solutions has sold its 13.68-acre prime property in Okkiyam Thoraipakkam, off Chennai's Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR), for Rs 612 crore.

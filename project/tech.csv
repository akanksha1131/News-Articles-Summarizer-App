What is Apple's current partnership with OpenAI

What Apple's change in AI strategy mean

Apple Inc is considering a major shift in its artificial intelligence strategy, exploring partnerships with Anthropic PBC or OpenAI to power a new version of Siri, potentially sidelining its in-house AI models, Bloomberg reported. This move aims to bolster Apple’s struggling AI efforts and keep pace with competitors in the rapidly evolving generative AI landscape.According to the report, citing sources familiar with the matter, Apple has engaged in discussions with both Anthropic and OpenAI about integrating their large language models, such as Claude or ChatGPT, into Siri. The company has requested these firms train custom versions of their models to run on Apple’s cloud infrastructure, specifically its Private Cloud Compute servers powered by high-end Mac chips, to prioritize user privacy. These talks remain in early stages, and Apple has not finalized its decision, with an internal project, dubbed LLM Siri, still developing in-house models.The initiative, led by Siri chief Mike Rockwell and software engineering head Craig Federighi, follows a reassignment of Siri oversight from Apple’s AI chief, John Giannandrea, amid delays and underwhelming responses to Apple Intelligence features. The report noted that Rockwell, who assumed the Siri engineering role in March, instructed his team to evaluate whether third-party models like Claude, ChatGPT, or Google’s Gemini outperform Apple’s own technology. Testing reportedly showed Anthropic’s Claude as the most promising fit for Siri’s needs, prompting talks led by Apple’s vice president of corporate development, Adrian Perica.Siri, launched in 2011, has lagged behind modern AI chatbots, with promised upgrades like enhanced app control and personal data integration delayed from early 2025 to next spring, per Bloomberg. Apple’s broader AI strategy remains uncertain, with a multibillion-dollar budget approved for 2026 to run in-house models, but executives are increasingly open to third-party solutions for a quicker turnaround.Apple’s current AI features rely on its proprietary Apple Foundation Models, with plans for a 2026 Siri overhaul initially based on this technology. However, the report said that adopting third-party models could help Apple match the capabilities of AI assistants on Android devices, shedding its reputation as an AI laggard. This approach mirrors Samsung’s use of Google’s Gemini for its Galaxy AI features and Amazon’s integration of Anthropic’s technology for Alexa+.The shift has sparked concerns within Apple’s 100-person AI team, led by Ruoming Pang, with morale reportedly souring over the potential reliance on external technology. The report highlighted that some engineers feel their work is being undervalued, with competitors like Meta and OpenAI offering lucrative packages—ranging from $10 million to $40 million annually—to poach talent. Apple recently lost senior researcher Tom Gunter and narrowly retained its MLX team after counteroffers, underscoring the competitive pressure.While Apple already uses ChatGPT for certain Siri queries and text generation, discussions with Anthropic have hit snags over financial terms, with the startup seeking a multibillion-dollar annual fee. If no deal is reached, Apple may pivot to OpenAI or other providers, signaling a potential transformation in its AI approach.","Apple is exploring partnerships with Anthropic PBC or OpenAI to power a new version of Siri, potentially sidelining its in-house AI models.

America is building a searchable national citizenship data system: What this means and makes it very important for the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/america-is-building-a-searchable-national-citizenship-data-system-what-this-means-and-makes-it-very-important-for-the-us/articleshow/122168244.cms,"US President Trump signs executive order overhauling US elections, mentions India example

What makes this very important for future elections in America

In what can be termed as a groundbreaking move, the Donald Trump administration has reportedly introduced a searchable national citizenship data system , the first of its kind, aimed at assisting state and local election officials in ensuring only U.S. citizens cast votes. First reported by NPR, the initiative, led by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in collaboration with the White House’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), integrates data from the Social Security Administration and immigration databases, NPR reported exclusively.The system, rolled out in phases, allows election officials to cross-check voter lists against a centralized database of both U.S.-born and naturalized citizens. This marks a significant shift from the traditional, fragmented methods of voter verification , which often required voters to provide birth certificates or passports—potentially disenfranchising millions—or rely on a patchwork of disparate data sources.For decades, election officials have highlighted the absence of a national citizenship list, making voter verification a logistical challenge. The new tool aims to streamline this process, but its rapid development without public input has raised concerns among some officials about its potential misuse and broader implications.Privacy advocates and experts have sounded alarms over the creation of what could effectively become a national roster of citizens—a concept long considered politically sensitive in the U.S. John Davisson, director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, emphasized the need for transparency, stating, “This is a debate that deserves public scrutiny, elected representatives’ participation, and opportunities for public comment.”While the administration touts the system as a step toward securing elections, critics argue its secretive development and potential for expanded use warrant greater oversight. The debate over balancing voter integrity with privacy concerns is likely to intensify as the system’s rollout continues.","The system, rolled out in phases, allows election officials to cross-check voter lists against a centralized database of both U.S.-born and naturalized citizens.

"Donald Trump 'forces' Canada to kill tax on Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google. He's sending a clear message ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trump-forces-canada-to-kill-tax-on-amazon-apple-microsoft-and-google-hes-sending-a-clear-message-/articleshow/122168113.cms,"US President Donald Trump announced that the United States would terminate all trade talks with Canada due to Canada's digital services tax on US tech companies.

Donald Trump's clear message for Canada

In a dramatic turn of events, President Donald Trump has notched a significant trade victory as Canada announced it will rescind its controversial Digital Services Tax (DST) targeting American tech giants, just days after Trump threatened to halt all trade negotiations with Ottawa. On June 29 evening, Canadian Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne declared, “Canada would rescind the Digital Services Tax in anticipation of a mutually beneficial comprehensive trade arrangement with the United States.” The decision halts the collection of the 3% tax on digital services revenue from companies like Amazon, Google, and Meta, which was set to begin Monday, June 30, 2025, and would have applied retroactively to 2022.The reversal follows Donald Trump’s Friday bombshell on Truth Social, where he announced the immediate termination of trade talks with Canada in response to the DST, which he deemed unfair to American firms. The move sent shockwaves through markets and intensified pressure on Canada, a key U.S. ally.Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Trump have since agreed to resume negotiations, aiming to finalize a new trade deal by July 21, 2025, ahead of a looming July 9 deadline for global trade agreements with the U.S. Failure to meet this deadline could trigger steep, “reciprocal” tariffs, a cornerstone of Trump’s aggressive “America First” trade policy.The capitulation marks a clear win for Trump, who has faced domestic challenges navigating a fractured Republican Party to pass his ambitious “One Big Beautiful Bill.” The legislation, criticized by figures like Elon Musk for its massive spending and cuts to popular programs, has strained Trump’s political capital. Forcing Canada to back down publicly strengthens his position both at home and in ongoing trade talks with nations like China and Europe.Canada’s DST, which targeted digital firms earning over $20 million annually from Canadian users, had drawn ire from U.S. tech groups and lawmakers, who argued it unfairly singled out American companies. Similar taxes exist in countries like France and the UK, but Canada’s rapid reversal underscores Trump’s influence.Carney framed the decision as strategic, stating, “Canada’s new government will always be guided by the best interests of Canadian workers and businesses in our negotiations for a new economic and security relationship with the United States.”The swift resolution signals Trump’s ability to leverage high-stakes brinkmanship, sending a message to other nations as the U.S. pushes for favorable trade terms globally.","Canada will rescind its controversial Digital Services Tax (DST) targeting American tech giants.

Nintendo stops selling Switch 2 gaming console on Amazon over price dispute: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nintendo-stops-selling-switch-2-gaming-console-on-amazon-over-price-dispute-report/articleshow/122165108.cms,"OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z3: Why This Neckband Still ROCKS in a TWS World!

Nintendo has stopped selling its products directly through e-commerce major Amazon in the US following a dispute over unauthorized sales by third-party sellers, reports Bloomberg. The conflict reportedly began when Nintendo noticed third-party merchants selling its games in the US at lower prices than the company’s official rates.According to a source cited by Bloomberg, these sellers were buying stock in Southeast Asia and exporting it to the US. Nintendo responded by pulling direct listings from Amazon’s US site last year. While some Nintendo products remained available, they were sold by independent merchants, not Amazon itself.Amazon attempted to resolve the issue by offering to label products as verified and authentic, a method it uses to fight counterfeiting. However, that was not enough to meet Nintendo’s expectations.A Nintendo spokesperson told Bloomberg, “There is no such fact. We do not disclose details of negotiations or contracts with retailers.” Amazon, in response, denied Bloomberg's claims and maintained that it offers Nintendo products directly to customers.Called as the biggest game console debut ever, Nintendo Switch 2 was released earlier this month. Nintendo has already sold more than 3.5 million units of the Switch 2 within just four days of launch, setting a new record for the company. The gaming giant now aims to sell 15 million units by March next year.At the launch, major US retailers like Walmart, Best Buy, Target, and GameStop had the console in stock. Amazon, however, only offered it in countries like Canada, Japan, and the UK — leaving many US customers frustrated and wondering when it would be available.Disputes between Amazon and major brands over third-party sales and product control aren’t new. Other companies such as Apple and Nike have also pulled or limited product listings in the past due to similar concerns. Some of those brands have since returned after negotiating stricter terms with Amazon.Recently, signs have emerged that Nintendo and Amazon may be rebuilding their relationship. Pre-orders for the upcoming Donkey Kong Bananza are live on Amazon US and listed as “sold by Amazon.” But, as of Friday, Amazon still did not appear on Nintendo’s official list of US retailers selling the Switch 2.","Nintendo has stopped selling its products directly through e-commerce major Amazon in the US following a dispute over unauthorized sales.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence (AI), the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. Speaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting, Huang said both AI and robotics represent what he believes a “multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity”. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said during the conference. Nvidia’s robotics division has seen fast growth in the past. Currently making up just 1% of Nvidia’s total revenue, the revenue brought in $567 million last quarter – a steep 72% rise from the previous year.“We’re working towards a day where there will be billions of robots, hundreds of millions of autonomous vehicles, and hundreds of thousands of robotic factories that can be powered by Nvidia technology,” Huang said.Huang also emphasized a shift in how the company sees itself. “We stopped thinking of ourselves as a chip company long ago,” he said, adding that Nvidia is now focused on being an “AI infrastructure” and “computing platform” provider.During the annual shareholder meeting, Huang said that Nvidia’s chips will be key not just for AI training, but also for software and hardware use in autonomous vehicles and robots. He named self-driving cars as the first major commercial use of Nvidia’s robotics technology. Nvidia’s Drive platform, a suite of chips and software for autonomous cars, is currently being used by Mercedes-Benz.The chipmaker recently introduced Cosmos, a line of AI models designed for humanoid robots.In a related news, Nvidia has surpassed Microsoft and Apple to become the world’s most valuable company with a market cap of around $3.75 trillion. The company has rebounded strongly since a market dip earlier this year, which was caused by concerns about competition from China’s DeepSeek AI.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence, the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122088756,imgsize-19028,width-400,resizemode-4/Nvidia-CEO-Jensen-Huang.jpg"

Other Nvidia executives cash in

Top executives and board members at Nvidia have cashed out more than $1 billion in company stock over the past year, reports Financial Times. As per the report, over $500 million of those sales took place in June alone, as the chipmaker's stock price climbed to a record high, making Nvidia the world’s most valuable company. The report highlights that Nvidia insiders are capitalizing on the market’s enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, which has driven massive investor interest and sent the stock price soaring.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang began selling his shares last week for the first time since September 2024. The company confirmed that his sales were made under a pre-arranged trading plan set in March, which defines the prices and dates for share sales. Such plans are commonly used by executives to avoid allegations of insider trading.Ben Silverman, vice-president of research at VerityData said “When the stock [dropped] in the first quarter, he did not sell, [which was] really smart.”“[Huang] waited for the stock to return to levels that he felt more comfortable selling at,” he added.According to VerityData, his sales began after a required 90-day cooling-off period ended. Under the trading plan, Huang can sell up to 6 million shares before the end of 2025. At current stock prices, that would amount to more than $900 million. Forbes estimates his net worth at $138 billion.According to the Financial Times report, several other top Nvidia figures have also sold large portions of stock. Mark Stevens, a longtime board member and early Nvidia investor, disclosed plans to sell up to 4 million shares on June 2, currently worth around $550 million. He has already sold $288 million worth.Jay Puri, Nvidia’s executive vice-president of worldwide field operations, sold $25 million in stock last week, says FT. Board members Tench Coxe and Brooke Seawell also made sales — Coxe offloaded around $143 million on June 9, and Seawell sold about $48 million in June.These executives, all long-time members of Nvidia’s leadership team, have been with the company since its early days.

Sam Altman's strategic exaggeration backfires

Meta's AI hiring spree continues

Lucas Beyer , one of three OpenAI researchers who recently joined Meta 's superintelligence team, has publicly dismissed reports that Mark Zuckerberg offered him a $100 million signing bonus, calling the claims ""fake news.""“No, we did not get 100M sign-on, that's fake news,” wrote Beyer in his post on X (previously Twitter), announcing this move to Meta with his colleagues.Beyer’s clarification comes after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed on his brother's podcast that Meta had been making ""giant offers"" worth more than $100 million to lure away his top talent. Beyer, along with colleagues Alexander Kolesnikov and Xiaohua Zhai, announced their departure from OpenAI's Zurich office to join Meta's new AI unit this week.When a social media user suggested the OpenAI CEO Sam Altman ""clearly just threw out the 100m figure out there to make potential takers think that they were being lowballed,"" Beyer responded: ""Yes, it was a brilliant move, gotta give him that.""Meta's Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth echoed Beyer's sentiments during an internal company meeting Thursday, calling Altman ""dishonest"" and noting that the OpenAI chief was ""countering all these offers"" while creating inflated market expectations. Bosworth emphasized that such massive packages only apply to ""a very, very small number of people"" in senior leadership roles.The three researchers had previously worked together at Google DeepMind before joining OpenAI in December 2024 to establish the company's Zurich office.

What Elon Musk said about ‘big beautiful bill’

US President Donald Trump has responded to Elon Musk 's recent criticism of the "" big beautiful bill "", maintaining a positive view of the Tesla CEO despite disagreeing with his comments. Trump called Mus a “wonderful guy” and that “he got a little upset” highlighting that “the EV mandate is a tough thing for him.”""I think he's a wonderful guy. I haven't spoken to him much, but I think Elon is a wonderful guy, and I know he's going to do well always,” Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo, referring to Musk, on Sunday (June 29).“He's a smart guy. And he actually went and campaigned with me and this and that. But he got a little bit upset, and that wasn't appropriate,” Trump added.Trump suggested that Musk's dissatisfaction stemmed from the proposed cuts to the Biden administration's EV tax credits.“Look, the electric vehicle mandate, the EV mandate, is a tough thing for him. I would, you know, I don't want everybody to have to have an electric car,” Trump explained.Trump's praise followed a renewed attack by Musk on Saturday (June 28). He posted on X that the pending bill “will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country. Utterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.”Elon Musk's relationship with President Donald Trump appeared to sour earlier this month following a series of sharp criticisms leveled by Musk against Trump's proposed tax bill on X.Musk characterised Trump's bill as a ""MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK.""On June 5, Musk further claimed significant influence over past election outcomes, asserting in an X post, “Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate.” He later retracted his comments and expressed regret on “some of my posts about President DonaldTrump last week,”The bill is currently awaiting a Senate vote.","US President Donald Trump has responded to Elon Musk's recent criticism of the "" big beautiful bill"", maintaining a positive view of the Tesla CEO despite disagreeing with his comments.

Google has announced that it has added HDR editing to Google Photos. The addition of HDR editing tools will allow users to preserve HDR detail and metadata while making changes with the help of machine learning-based photo editing tools . “We’ve made improvements to how images are edited in High Dynamic Range (HDR) and Standard Dynamic Range (SDR). Now, HDR photos can keep their full dynamic range and crucial HDR metadata even after editing with features like Photo Unblur, Magic Eraser, and Portrait Light. This means your edited photos will maintain their contrast and highlights to always look their best,” said the company.- HDR editing with machine-leaning tools: With the feature the Photos taken in HDR will now maintain the full image depth and metadata even after editing.- New “Ultra HDR” Tool: This tool will enable users to fine-tune the brightness of the image. This will also preserve the HDR quality of the image and will offer more control to the user.- Renamed tool: Google has now renamed the ‘HDR’ editing option as ‘Tone’. The tool will help with photo adjustments.- SDR to HDR enhancement : With this users can now upgrade standard dynamic range of photo to HDR.

Which Anker power banks are recalled

What users should do

How customers should dispose affected Anker powerbanks

Anker is recalling another five power banks, making a second recall this month. According to The Verge, the company has warned customers worldwide to stop using five additional power bank models due to the risk of overheating, smoke, melting, or fire. The issue is linked to lithium-ion batteries provided by one of its suppliers, which may pose safety hazards. Anker, as per the report, says the risk of malfunction is low, but it is recalling the products as a safety measure. This follows a similar recall earlier this month involving the Anker PowerCore 10000 (model A1263) sold in the United States.The five newly recalled models include: Anker Power Bank (models A1257 and A1647), Anker MagGo Power Bank (model A1652), and Anker Zolo Power Bank (models A1681 and A1689).Users can identify if they own one of the affected products by checking the model number on the back or side of the device.Customers in the US can receive a free replacement or an Anker gift card by filling out a recall claim form on the company’s website. They will need to provide a product serial number or proof of purchase to be eligible.While no specific purchase date range has been mentioned for these five models, Anker advises users to stop using them immediately and dispose of them properly.Anker emphasizes that recalled power banks should not be thrown in the trash or regular recycling bins due to fire risks. Instead, users must take them to a certified facility that handles lithium-ion batteries. Disposing of them incorrectly could cause fires or environmental harm.","Anker is recalling another five power banks, making a second recall this month.

Company tightens performance standards amid AI investment

Microsoft is now asking managers to evaluate employees based on their use of internal AI tools, with the company considering adding formal metrics to its performance review process as it pushes for greater adoption of artificial intelligence across the organization.Julia Liuson , president of Microsoft's Developer Division responsible for tools like GitHub Copilot , recently instructed managers that AI usage ""should be part of your holistic reflections on an individual's performance and impact."" In an internal email, Liuson declared that ""using AI is no longer optional — it's core to every role and every level.""The evaluation changes are designed to address what Microsoft sees as lagging internal adoption of its Copilot AI services. Some teams are now considering including more formal AI usage metrics in performance reviews for the next fiscal year, according to sources familiar with the plans.The push comes as Microsoft's GitHub Copilot faces increasing competition from rival AI coding services, including Cursor, which recent data suggests has surpassed GitHub Copilot in key developer market segments. The competitive pressure has even become a point of tension in Microsoft's ongoing partnership negotiations with OpenAI.Microsoft currently allows employees to use certain external AI tools that meet security requirements, including coding assistant Replit, while encouraging greater use of its internal AI services.The AI evaluation initiative coincides with Microsoft's broader shift toward stricter performance management. The company recently implemented new policies including a two-year rehire ban for underperforming employees and introduced a ""Global Voluntary Separation Agreement"" offering 16 weeks of severance to low performers who voluntarily leave.Earlier this year, Microsoft terminated approximately 2,000 employees deemed underperformers and plans thousands more job cuts primarily targeting its sales division. These workforce changes reflect the company's efforts to balance massive AI investments, including roughly $80 billion in data center spending, with operational efficiency as it positions itself for what CEO Satya Nadella calls ""the AI era.”","Microsoft is now asking managers to evaluate employees based on their use of internal AI tools.

India emerges as iPhone manufacturing powerhouse with massive investment

Skilled workforce shortage presents major hurdle for US manufacturing ambitions

America lacks India's engineering talent pipeline and workforce scale

US President Trump is pushing Apple to bring iPhone manufacturing back to America, threatening to impose a 25% import tariff on all smartphones manufactured outside the United States, including Apple's iPhones, unless companies move production to its soil. ""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,"" Trump wrote. But India's rapid success in iPhone production reveals both the promise and challenges of reshoring tech manufacturing. While Foxconn has invested $2.5 billion in a massive Indian facility that now produces 18% of global iPhones, the US faces critical obstacles that make similar success unlikely.Foxconn's sprawling 300-acre facility in Devanahalli, India, employs 8,000 workers with plans to reach 40,000 by year's end. The New York Times reports that India is expected to assemble 25-30% of all iPhones by late 2025, demonstrating Apple's successful diversification from Chinese production following the pandemic.The Indian operation has transformed the local economy, with wages rising 10-15% around the plant and a complex supply chain of smaller manufacturers emerging to support iPhone production. Companies like Indo-MIM and Centum are providing specialized parts and services, creating the industrial ecosystem that makes mass electronics manufacturing viable.The key difference between India and America lies in available talent. Josh Foulger of Zetwerk Electronics told the Times he receives 700 job applications annually from local technical schools, highlighting India's abundant pool of qualified workers. Karnataka State alone has a population half the size of Vietnam, providing massive labor resources.India's success stems from having ""millions of engineers"" eager for manufacturing opportunities, as one executive told the Times. The country needs 10 million new jobs annually to accommodate its growing population, creating a hungry workforce willing to relocate and work demanding schedules.In contrast, American factory towns lack the pipeline of qualified young graduates necessary for high-tech manufacturing. While Trump aims to revive American manufacturing, the fundamental workforce infrastructure that makes India's iPhone success possible simply doesn't exist in the US at the required scale.","President Trump is pushing Apple to bring iPhone manufacturing back to America.

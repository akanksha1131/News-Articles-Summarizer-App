I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.

I do not make any of my own clothing. I speak a language I did not invent or refine. I did not discover the mathematics I use. I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.

I am moved by music I did not create myself. When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive. I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.

LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky relies on artificial intelligence for nearly every important email he sends to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella , describing the technology as essential for high-stakes communication with his boss and other world leaders. Speaking at a fireside chat in LinkedIn's San Francisco office on Tuesday, Roslansky said he uses Microsoft's Copilot AI assistant to ensure he sounds ""super smart"" when corresponding with top executives.

Tim Cook’s post caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who reposted it on his timeline.Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in 1976 alongside Steve Wozniak. During his leadership, Apple launched groundbreaking products like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, reshaping entire industries and redefining the way people communicate, work, and consume entertainment.Renowned for his focus on design and user experience, Jobs was instrumental in making technology simpler and more accessible. His vision not only revived Apple from the brink of collapse but also propelled it into becoming one of the most valuable and influential companies in the world.When Steve Jobs was battling severe health issues in the late 2000s, Apple’s then–Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook made a deeply personal gesture.Cook offered to donate a part of his liver to Jobs, since both shared the same rare blood type.According to accounts later revealed in Cook’s biography and media reports, the Apple executive underwent extensive medical testing and found that he was indeed a suitable donor. However, Jobs firmly declined the offer.Cook recalled that Jobs became emotional but quickly dismissed the idea, telling him: “I’ll never let you do that. I’ll never do that.” Jobs, who was known for his uncompromising principles and independent spirit, made it clear he would not accept such a sacrifice from a colleague and friend.This episode highlighted both Cook’s deep loyalty to Jobs and the unique bond the two shared during Apple’s most transformative years. While Jobs continued to struggle with his health, he refused to let anyone else bear the risks of a major procedure on his behalf.Jobs eventually underwent a liver transplant in 2009, performed by a medical team in Tennessee, but not with Cook as a donor. He returned to lead Apple after the surgery, but his health continued to decline until his passing in October 2011.","Apple CEO Tim Cook paid a heartfelt tribute to Steve Jobs on his death anniversary.

Career advice: Skip consulting, guard your wallet







Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary credited Apple co-founder Steve Jobs with a productivity mindset which has helped him in transforming his approach towards business and life. In post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), O’ Leary revealed a simple but powerful strategy: focus on three essential tasks each day—and block out everything else.O’Leary recounted an advice by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. He mentioned that Jobs emphasised on the importance of identifying the ‘signal’ between daily distractions. “There are three things you have to get done today, and that’s the signal. Everything that stops you from doing that is the noise,” he wrote.He added, “There’s always somebody reaching out to you, or you wanna watch YouTube… you can’t do that. You have to be 80% signal, 20% noise. That changed me forever.O’Leary also clarified that these tasks are not vague goals but are specific actions which must be completed within 18 to 24 hours in order to grow the business. “When you know what you gotta get done today and you do it, nothing stops you,” he said. “Those three things, when completed daily, create extraordinary outcomes. And when you repeat this, your business goes geometric.”He further explained that the strategy creates a feedback loop of productivity, where each day is created to last and helps in driving consistent momentum and measurable results.O’Leary also used the moment to reinforce his broader philosophy on career and financial discipline. He warned students against entering consulting, saying it can stunt entrepreneurial growth. “If you want to drift into hell on Earth, stay 24 months in a consulting firm and you are tainted meat for the rest of your life,” he said during a July talk at Harvard, where he serves as an Executive Fellow.On personal finance, he cautioned against lending money to extended family, advising that money should only be gifted once to avoid long-term complications.","O’Leary recounted an advice by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.

Targeted sectors of AI tech







The European Union (EU) is preparing to launch a strategy aimed at reducing its reliance on foreign artificial intelligence (AI) providers and promoting European-made AI platforms, as concerns mount over the bloc's technological dependence on the US and China, a report has said. According to a draft proposal seen by the Financial Times, the European Commission's new “Apply AI strategy” emphasises security, resilience and industrial competitiveness by accelerating the development and adoption of homegrown AI technologies. The strategy is set to be presented by EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen on Tuesday, the report said.The draft proposal warns that “external dependencies of the AI stack”—the infrastructure and software needed to build, train and manage AI applications—”can be weaponised” by both state and non-state actors, posing risks to supply chains.The Commission aims to “strengthen EU AI sovereignty” by promoting policies to “accelerate the adoption of European scalable and replicable generative AI solutions in public administrations,” according to the draft.The strategy highlights the need to improve AI usage in critical sectors including healthcare, defense and manufacturing. To implement these initiatives, the Commission is mobilising 1 billion euros from existing financing programmes.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at an event Friday that the bloc wants to “speed up AI adoption across the board” through the Apply AI strategy to ensure Europe doesn't fall behind in the new technology.The bloc plans to prioritise implementation of European AI-enabled tools in defense. Brussels intends to ""accelerate the development and deployment of European AI-enabled"" command and control (C2) capabilities—systems used to instruct troops and manage battlefield operations.The Commission also wants to ""support the development of sovereign frontier models"" for space defense technology.",EU preparing to launch a strategy aimed at reducing its reliance on foreign artificial intelligence (AI) providers.

Call of Duty ‘cost’ Xbox $300 million in console sales



India’s Gaming Revolution: New Law Changes EVERYTHING





Microsoft’s Xbox division recently announced a 50% price increase for its premium Game Pass subscription service, raising the cost to $30 per month—a move that suggests the company's ambitious streaming strategy is failing to meet revenue expectations, a report has said. This is despite Microsoft adding blockbuster titles to the service like Call of Duty, which came with the company's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard in 2023.Citing interviews with seven current and former Xbox employees, Bloomberg reports that the price hike, which drew swift backlash online, is the latest sign that Xbox's streaming push has underperformed eight years after launch. They also point that the strategy of including higher-margin games in Game Pass is undermining their salesCiting a former employee, the report claims that Xbox sacrificed more than $300 million in Call of Duty sales on consoles and PCs last year by including the franchise on Game Pass. Although Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 became the top-selling video game in the US last year and the biggest launch in franchise history, Sony's PlayStation accounted for 82% of those sales, according to trade publication IGN.The game's inclusion on Game Pass may have prompted some customers to subscribe for a month or two rather than purchasing the title outright for $70.“Game Pass hasn't delivered the explosive growth Microsoft anticipated post-Activision, and they've realized their infrastructure costs don't align with their pricing model,” said Joost Van Dreunen, founder of video game analytics firm Aldora Intelligence.According to current and former employees, Microsoft launched Game Pass in 2017 at $10 per month, offering access to over 100 older titles. A year later, the company made a decision to include its own new games on release day at no extra charge—a move that proved controversial internally.While subscription revenue increased 16% industry-wide last year, partly due to customers playing Call of Duty on Game Pass according to IGN, the model appears to be cannibalising traditional game sales without generating sufficient replacement revenue.",Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass subscription service has gone from $10 per month to $30 per month.

Should you do an MBA? My views👇🏼

Most MBAs are outdated 🤷🏼

Better to learn how to build Products,

Best training ground if you want to accelerate your career or run a company one day.

That’s how I started. As a Product Manager.

Case studies and frameworks are nice, but they don’t teach you how to,

- Question the status quo

- Build deep empathy for customers

- Pursue global optima, not local wins

- Influence without authority

- Work backwards from the end state

That’s a Builder’s life.

It’s messy, political, creative, analytical — all at once.

A microcosm of real life, not classroom fluff.

That’s what helped me build companies, not the three-letter degree, although I do have one 🙈

So I tell young students & professionals to do an MBA, but a different kind. Do a Masters in Building Awesome things and you will graduate, not in 2 yrs, but every day 👨🏼‍🎓😎

Be a PM, Product Engineer, Product Designer, AI Builder, Hardware Designer, Robotics Engineer ….. heck, even a Toy Designer!

Because the 21st century will be led by builders who can also tell great stories 💪🏼

P:S - If you MUST do a top-tier MBA. Or hide for a few months & learn how to build, esp with AI 🤷🏼

Optus’ previous failures raise accountability questions





Australia's second-largest telecommunications provider Optus is facing mounting pressure after a 13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and caused 600 triple-zero calls to fail across multiple states. The September 19 network failure has prompted government investigations and renewed calls for accountability from the embattled telco.The outage primarily affected South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory, with some impact also recorded in far western New South Wales near the SA border, according to Reuters reporting. CEO Stephen Rue confirmed that established processes were not followed during a network firewall upgrade that began at 12:30 AM Thursday and lasted until approximately 1:30 PM (local time).Four deaths have been linked to the incident, though South Australian police later clarified that an eight-week-old boy's death in Gawler West was ""unlikely"" to have been caused by the outage delay. A 68-year-old Adelaide woman and two men aged 74 and 49 in Perth remain connected to the emergency services failure.The Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) reported that Optus received multiple customer complaints about the triple-zero failure as early as 9 AM Thursday, with five customers contacting the call center about the outage.However, these concerns were not properly escalated, and government authorities weren't informed until after the issue was resolved.Communications Minister Anika Wells expressed ""unbelievable disappointment"" that Australia was ""here again so quickly,"" referencing a similar 2023 incident. The Australian Media and Communications Authority (ACMA) chair Nerida O'Loughlin revealed her agency wasn't notified until more than 10 hours after the outage began, contrary to standard protocols.This marks the second major triple-zero outage for Optus in less than two years. The company was fined A$12 million in 2023 for failing to provide emergency call services to thousands during a nationwide outage and subsequently failing to conduct required welfare checks.The telecommunications giant, owned by Singapore Telecommunications, has faced a series of crises including a 2022 cyberattack affecting 9.5 million Australians and the 2023 outage that led to former CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin's resignation. Current CEO Stephen Rue took over in November 2024.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, speaking from New York, declined to say whether Rue should resign but indicated the government has ""action at its disposal"" pending investigation results. ACMA has launched a formal investigation, with Optus potentially facing fines exceeding $10 million and additional penalties.The company has promised full cooperation with all investigations while conducting its own internal review, with results to be made public.",13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and 600 triple-zero calls to fail.

Visa Chaos: Trump’s $100K H1-B Rule EXPLAINED; Who Pays & Who Escapes | WATCH

A side door for skilled professionals



Pros and cons of O-1B visa



The advantages of O-1B visa include:

No lottery or annual cap

Faster processing available

Renewable indefinitely

The drawbacks of O-1B visa are:

More subjective than H-1B, requiring proof of “extraordinary ability”

Some employers hesitate due to uncertainty in approval

Application costs can be higher than pre-hike H-1B fees

Some real world examples of O-1B visa



Entrepreneurs like Soundarya Balasubramani, who launched an educational venture in the U.S., are among the new wave of Indian applicants using the O-1 to bypass the H-1B bottleneck. “I got my O-1A approved as the solo founder and 100% owner of an educational venture,” she told ET.

Karan Vaidya, cofounder of AI startup Composio, said his O-1 visa cost less than $10,000 including legal fees, and praised its flexibility: “It’s a three-year visa that can be renewed indefinitely. I’m on my fifth O-1 now.”





US President Donald Trump’s executive order raising the H-1B visa application fee from $10,000 to $1,00,000 sent shockwaves in the tech industry. Due to the announcement last week many tech giants called back their professionals with H-1B visa back to the US. As the scrutiny around the traditional H-1B visa pathway making the process unpredictable, the skilled professionals are now planing to turn towards O-1 visa a lesser known route. The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.For those unaware, the O-1 Visa is introduced under the Immigration Act of 1990. The O-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields of education, science, athletics or arts. It enable the recipients to work in the US for up to three years and comes with unlimited renewals. The applicants of the O-1 visa much demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim and meet atleast three out of the eight criteria:After the unpredictable nature of popular H-1B visa, the O-1 visa is gaining a lot of traction among Indians who wish to go and work in the US. As per the report by Economic Times, Indian were granted 487 O-1A visas in FY 2020, this number was increased to 1,418 in FY 2023. With this increase, India became the third largest recipient of O-1 visa after UK and Brazil.Unlike the popularly H-1B visa which is capped at 85,000 visas annually and allocated via a lottery, the O-1 visa has no cap and the applications for it are accepted around the year. The applicants can also expedite the application process by submitting additional fees.Immigration consultant and O-1 holder Logan Ullyott told Business Insider: “The O-1 is an occupation-agnostic visa. You could get it if you’re an engineer, a researcher, an influencer, or even a cook — as long as you can prove you’re at the top of your field.”","The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.

I have heard so many accounts from Sindhi friends about how their families had to leave everything and come to India during partition. They rebuilt their lives and Sindhis have done well in India.

Do not live in fear. Make the bold move. You will do well.

What it means for India







The entire technology and IT industry is in shock after US President Donald Trump announce massive five hike for H-1B visa. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application. After the announcement many tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others have asked their employees to return to US by September 21. Now, Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has also issued a piece of advice to Indian techies ‘come back to India to rebuild’.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk responds



Political leaders weigh in







An ABC spokesperson recently confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely. The company decided to take the decision after the host of the show Jimmy Kimmel made some controversial comments on Charlie Kirk, linking his alleged killer to President Trump’s MAGA movement. MAGA – short for Make America Great Again is a political slogan, popularized by President Donald Trump during his election campaigns. During the late-night show, Kimmel made sharp comments stating that the MAGA gang is “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it”.Actor and filmmaker Ben Stiller was among the celebrities who has publicly defended Kimmel and has criticised the decision of ABC. In s post shared on social media platform X, Stiller wrote, “This isn’t right”.His brief but pointed reaction quickly went viral, with many fans and fellow entertainers echoing his sentiment that the suspension undermines free expression in comedy.Commenting on Ben Stiller’s post, Elon Musk supported the decision made by ABC and wrote, “He went full retard. Never go full retard.”This is not the first time that Musk has reacted to the controversy.Earlier this week after the Kimmel’s video clip from the show went viral, Musk said, “Jimmy Kimmel is disgusting”.The California Governor Gavin Newsom has also blasted the decision and has accused Republicans of orchestrating censorship. “They are censoring you in real time. It’s coordinated. And it’s dangerous,” wrote Newsom on X.On the other hand, commentator Davis Sirota suggested corporate politics were at play, noting that Nexstar, which has ties to ABC, is seeking regulatory approvals from the Trump administration.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump celebrated the suspension on Truth Social, calling it “Great News for America” and labeling Kimmel “ratings challenged” with “zero talent.”","ABC confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely.

What data has not been affected







Discord – a free voice, video, and text communication platform – has disclosed that one of its third-party customer service providers has been hacked and the hackers have gained access to limited user information – like names, emails as well as scanned government photo IDs among other data – and attempted to extort money from the company.According to the company, the “unauthorized party” accessed data from users who had contacted Discord's Customer Support or Trust & Safety teams but did not breach Discord's systems directly.According to the company, the breach potentially exposed several types of user information, including names, Discord usernames, email addresses, and contact details provided to customer support. Limited billing information has also been accessed, such as payment types, the last four digits of credit card numbers and purchase history.Hackers also gained access to IP addresses, messages exchanged with customer service agents, and limited corporate data including training materials and internal presentations.A small number of government-issued ID images—such as driver's licenses and passports—from users who had appealed age determinations were also compromised. Discord said it will specifically notify affected users if their ID documents may have been accessed.Discord emphasised that full credit card numbers, CCV codes, and passwords have not been impacted by the breach. Messages and activity on Discord beyond conversations with customer support were also unaffected, the company said.Discord said it took immediate action upon discovering the attack, including revoking the third-party provider's access to its ticketing system and launching an internal investigation. The company has engaged a computer forensics firm to support remediation efforts and is working with law enforcement on the matter.Discord has also notified relevant data protection authorities and reviewed its threat detection systems and security controls for third-party support providers.","Discord, a free voice, video, and text communication platform, has disclosed that one of its third-party customer service providers has been hacked.

“We identified that the criminal group carried out a series of other scams, involving deepfakes of other celebrities and false betting platforms.”

“That created a perverse situation in which the criminals enjoyed a kind of 'statistical immunity.' They knew most people would not report them, so they operated at scale without fear.”





A group of suspected scammers in Brazil reportedly earned millions of dollars through online fraud by running Instagram ads featuring AI-generated deepfakes of supermodel Gisele Bundchen and other celebrities. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, police investigators confirmed the fraud, which was executed using manipulated celebrity images. Authorities arrested four suspects tied to the scheme this week and froze assets across five Brazilian states. The federal anti-money laundering agency, COAF, identified over 20 million reais ($3.9 million) in suspicious funds linked to the operation. The operation represents one of the first significant attempts in Brazil to combat the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) to manipulate celebrity images and videos for online scams.The arrests follow Brazil's Supreme Court ruling in June that social media platforms can be held liable for criminal ads if they fail to remove the content promptly.In a statement to Reuters, Instagram owner Meta stated that its policies prohibitand that it removes such adsThe company also noted that it hasAccording to Reuters, the spokesperson for Bundchen's team advised consumers to be cautious about huge discounts in ads featuring celebrities, to verify the legitimacy of offers through official brand or celebrity channels, and to report suspected scams to the authorities.The investigation announced this week by police in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul began in August 2024, following a complaint from a victim who was deceived by an Instagram ad that showed an altered video of Bundchen promoting a skincare product.In another case, an ad used the supermodel’s image to advertise a suitcase giveaway, requiring buyers to pay shipping fees for items that never arrived.In a statement to Reuters, Eibert Moreira Neto, head of Rio Grande do Sul's cybercrime unit, said:Investigators are pursuing money laundering and online fraud charges, noting that most victims lost small amounts, which is typically under 100 reais ($19), and often did not report the incidents.Isadora Galian, another official from the cybercrime unit, said:","Police in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, have arrested four suspects tied to the scheme.

How Amazon is planning to sell its AI products more organically

Amazon Web Services (AWS) does not want to depend entirely on its sales team to sell artificial intelligence (AI) apps, a report claims. The world's largest cloud service provider is reportedly aiming to gain organic traction among developers and reduce its reliance on traditional sales teams for its AI products. This strategy shift comes after an internal Amazon document obtained by Business Insider (whichBI) indicated that AWS's coding assistant, Q Developer, has struggled to gain grassroots adoption compared to rivals like Cursor and Windsurf. The document noted that while Q Developer had seenin selling directly to senior executives, those sales, however, requiredThis also contrasts with the early years of AWS, during which cloud services were adopted organically among developers.To address the gap, AWS recently launched Kiro, an AI coding assistant specifically designed to attract more self-serve developers. The internal document acknowledged thatLarger enterprise customers, the document stated, currently tend to favour Microsoft's GitHub Copilot.AWS’ plans also highlight an ongoing debate in software sales, whether to sell directly to top executives or start with individual users and scale up. Traditionally, companies targeted senior decision-makers, but the rise of cloud services like AWS and viral apps like Slack and Zoom popularised a bottom-up model. In the AI era, this approach is even more critical, as seen with the rapid organic growth of ChatGPT and Cursor.Meanwhile, in a statement to BI, an AWS spokesperson said all sales channels are important and noted that many developers use AWS before their companies adopt it. They added that Q Developer’s usage has grownthis year.the spokesperson noted.The Q apps are key to AWS’s AI strategy, which was showcased at the company’s 2023 re:Invent conference and represents a significant portion of its AI portfolio. AWS relies on them to demonstrate to investors that it’s staying competitive as Microsoft and Google advance.However, Q Developer currently earns only a small share of what rivals like Cursor and Windsurf make. AWS also plans to speed up Q Business chatbot sales by adopting a user-led model after upgrading to an internal AI platform called Quick.AWS has also received positive early feedback on Kiro since its July launch, but plans to addfeatures after users requested more control. However, some employees remain sceptical about Q’s future, saying AWS excels more in infrastructure than in business apps.The AWS spokesperson dismissed the claims, saying that it isthat the company hasn’t succeeded beyond infrastructure, pointing to products like Bedrock, Connect, and SageMaker.the spokesperson added..","Amazon Web Services (AWS) does not want to depend entirely on its sales team to sell artificial intelligence (AI) apps.

Risk vs. stagnation



Elon Musk's SpaceX wins contracts worth $714 million from Pentagon







Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has revealed his philosophy on failure. Musk described failure not as a setback but as a necessary part of innovation. Speaking at the 2020 Air Warfare Symposium during a fireside chat with Gen. John F. Thompson, Tesla CEO explained his point of view on failure as part of a broader portfolio of actions, where the goal is maximising the overall impact rather than avoiding individual missteps.“I think of these things as just… there’s a certain amount of time and within that time you want the best net outcome,” Musk said. “So for all the set of actions you can do, there’s going to be some which will fail, some which will succeed, and you want the net useful output of your set of actions to be the highest.”He further explained his approach by using the example of baseball” “What you mostly care about is not any individual at-bat but the overall batting average. Failure is irrelevant unless it’s catastrophic.”Elon Musk’s this mindset has long shaped the development strategy of SpaceX, where the core to progress lies in rapid iteration and frequent testing. From Starship to explosions to Falcon 9 landing mishaps, SpaceX faced each failure and took them as a learning opportunity rather than defeat.“If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough,” Musk said in a 2015 TED interview—a mantra that continues to guide his teams.The framework of Elon Musk sets a clear boundary that failure is acceptable unless it ends the mission. This principle of tolerance has compelled SpaceX to push boundaries and still maintain focus on safety as systems mature. He also warned against environments that avoid failure altogether, suggesting they may be avoiding hard problems. “The bigger danger is stagnation,” Musk implied, urging engineers and entrepreneurs to stay biased toward action and keep their “net useful output” rising.Meanwhile, The US Space Force has awarded SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, five of seven critical military launch missions for the upcoming fiscal year, totaling $714 million. The contracts are said to reinforce SpaceX’s dominance in Pentagon space contracts, despite recent public tensions between Musk and President Donald Trump. United Launch Alliance (ULA) secured the remaining two missions for $428 million.The contracts fall under the National Security Space Launch Program (NSSL), which previously selected SpaceX, ULA, and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin for 54 missions worth $13.5 billion, scheduled between 2027 and 2032. “Space is the ultimate high ground, critical for our national security,” said Col Eric Zarybnisky of the U.S. Space Systems Command, per Air & Space Forces.","Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has revealed his philosophy on failure.

At just 30 years old, Lucy Guo has joined the ranks of billionaire college dropouts like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, amassing a $1.25 billion net worth, according to Forbes. Guo’s meteoric rise came after her first company, Scale AI, was acquired by Meta in a deal valuing the AI data labeling firm at $29 billion, CNBC reported. Guo, now the founder of Passes, a content creator monetization platform launched in 2022, shared with 'CNBC Make It' that she veered from the traditional path of higher education. After studying computer science and human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University, Guo left the program just two years in, with only one year and eight classes left to graduate. The decision stunned her Chinese immigrant parents.“They sacrificed everything to immigrate from China to America to give their kids a better future,” Guo told CNBC Make It. “For their kids to suddenly let go of their education when they were almost done was like a slap in the face.” “I think they [parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn’t love them, and they weren’t very happy with it, when it was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future for myself,” she said.Instead of finishing her degree, Guo pursued the Thiel Fellowship, a program by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel that awards $200,000 to young entrepreneurs to build innovative companies. “I think [my parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn’t love them,” Guo said. “It was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future.” Despite her unconventional path, Guo sees value in college for its networking opportunities.“One to two years in college is actually just incredibly great because you’re going to make the best friends in college, and you’re going to meet the smartest people,” she told CNBC Make It. “There’s no other scenario where there’s such a high concentration of smart people who are also looking to make friends.”Guo noted that unlike workplaces or social events, where people may already have established circles, college offers a unique environment for building lifelong connections. Her story underscores a growing trend of entrepreneurs prioritizing real-world experience over traditional education, while still recognizing the social benefits of a campus environment.","Lucy Guo is the founder of Passes, a content creator monetization platform.

"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on why he supports Donald Trump's $100,000 H-1B Visa fee",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-on-why-he-supports-donald-trumps-100000-h-1b-visa-fee/articleshow/124317437.cms,"Huang: “America has one singular brand—The Dream”



'Brightest minds' essential to America's future argues Huang



Critics warn of talent exodus







US President Donald Trump passed an executive order increasing the H-1B visa fees last month. After the revised regulation the H-1B visa fee for fresh application stands at $100,000. Now, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has voiced his support from Trump’s proposal to impose $1,00,000 fee. Speaking on the BG2 Pod last week, Huang called the move ‘a great start’. Huang said that the increase in the H-1B visa fees will help in reshaping the immigrant policy, even as critics warn the beginning on brain drain and undermine America’s tech leadership.Speaking about his own journey as an immigrant, Huang stressed on the symbolic power of the American dream. “America has one singular brand reputation that no country in the world has—the American dream… what country has the word dream behind it?” he said. He recounted how his parents sent him to the U.S. with no money, and how he built his life from scratch: “We started from nothing… and here I am.”Along with this, Huang also acknowledged that the fees of $100,000 is quite high but he believes that this increase will set a meaningful threshold. “Probably sets the bar a little too high, but as a first bar, it at least eliminates illegal immigration and that’s a good start,” he added.In a separate CNBC interview Monday, Huang reinforced his position on immigration reform. ""We want all the brightest minds to come to the United States. Remember immigration is the foundation of the American dream, and we represent the American dream,"" he told CNBC, expressing support for Trump's efforts to address the immigration system.Nvidia employed 1,519 H-1B visa holders out of 36,000 employees worldwide at the end of fiscal year 2025, making it one of the largest tech employers of H-1B workers in the United States, according to a Business Insider analysis from March. The White House clarified earlier this month that the $100,000 fee applies only to new applicants, not visa renewals.Announced last month by the Trump administration, the H-1B visa fee hike is described as a one-time charge for new applications. The increase is fees is aimed at prioritising American workers over immigrants. However, the economist and the tech leaders feel that this move could adversely affect the US. Andrew Ng, co-founder of Google Brain, said the policy creates uncertainty that deters global talent. Paul Kurgman also called the move ‘disastrous’ and could turn US innovation into a ‘a vicious circle of decline’. Kevin O’Leary on the other hand warned it could stifle startup creation by driving skilled workers overseas.","US President Donald Trump passed an executive order increasing the H-1B visa fees last month.

Grokipedia will be similar to Community Notes





Tesla CEO Elon Musk has announced that an early version of “Grokipedia,” a new project linked to his AI venture xAI, will be released in the coming weeks. Taking to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Musk wrote: “Version 0.1 early beta of Grokipedia will be published in 2 weeks”. For those unaware, Grokipedia is touted as an AI-powered knowledge platform with “massive improvement” over Wikipedia The tech billionaire was replying to an X user X Freeze @amXFreeze who said that “Grokipedia is going to be the world's biggest, most accurate knowledge source, for humans and AI with no limits on use”.According to the post, Grokipedia will rely on Grok — xAI’s chatbot — to process huge amounts of information from sources such as Wikipedia. The AI will then ask: What’s true, partially true, false, or missing? Based on that, Grok will rewrite content by removing falsehoods, correcting half-truths, and adding missing context.The X user claimed the reason Grokipedia could emerge as a “true knowledge source” is because it is designed to focus only on truth, free from bias or hidden agendas. In this framing, the platform would aim to provide accurate, transparent context rather than narratives shaped by legacy media or institutional influence.The post compared Grokipedia’s mission to X’s Community Notes feature, which has challenged misleading claims online — even from major organizations. The user suggested Grokipedia would “strike like a sharp spear” by delivering corrections and context that “cut through the BS.”According to the description, Grokipedia will use first principles and physics as a basis to identify facts and counter distortion. This would mean moving beyond surface-level edits to provide complete and accurate explanations.Another expected feature, as described in the post, is that Grokipedia would be open to both humans and AI systems without restrictions. This could potentially make it a universal reference tool in the growing AI ecosystem.The post concluded with a sweeping claim: “This will change for good… Grokipedia will change it.”","Elon Musk has announced that an early version of “Grokipedia,” a new project linked to his AI venture xAI, will be released in the coming weeks.

Former Cisco CEO's dangerous prediction goes beyond AI will destroy jobs; says 50% of Fortune 500 companies will disappear,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-cisco-ceos-dangerous-prediction-goes-beyond-ai-will-destroy-jobs-says-50-of-fortune-500-companies-will-disappear/articleshow/124316574.cms,"Former Cisco CEO on job loss due to AI





Former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers has issued a stark warning about the future impact of artificial intelligence (AI). While concerns about AI replacing human jobs have already been widely discussed, Chambers believes the disruption will go far deeper. “You are probably going to see 50% of the Fortune 500 companies disappear and 50% of the executives of the Fortune 500 disappear,” he said in a recent interview with Fortune.Chambers, who led Cisco through the internet boom of the late 1990s and the painful crash that followed, compared today’s AI wave to the dot-com era. But he stressed that the pace and consequences of AI adoption are far more dramatic. “AI is moving at five times the speed and will produce three times the outcomes of the internet age,” he said, pointing out that startups are now able to develop products in weeks rather than years.The former CEO cautioned that such rapid transformation will create both winners and losers. “Is there going to be a train wreck? Yes, for those that aren’t able to translate the technology into a sustainable competitive advantage,” Chambers said. He warned that while some companies will thrive, others will vanish because their leaders lack the ability to adapt quickly enough to the new innovation economy.On the jobs front, Chambers echoed a concern that has been raised by many industry leaders but with an even sharper edge.“If I am right about AI moving at five times the speed of the internet, we are going to destroy jobs faster than we can replace them,” he explained. He acknowledged that new roles will eventually be created, but not before a painful period of adjustment. “There is going to be a drought while we have to re-educate lots of people,” he said.According to Chambers, both white-collar and blue-collar entry-level jobs are most at risk in the immediate future. To counter this, he urged governments and companies to rethink education and training systems. “We need to change education. Entry-level jobs, both white and blue collar, are going to disappear fast,” he warned.Despite his concerns, Chambers also sees potential for AI to drive productivity and economic growth—if businesses reinvest their gains. But he believes only those companies that can quickly reinvent themselves will survive. “With the speed the market is moving at now, you have to be able to reinvent yourself, which most CEOs and business leaders don’t know how to do, especially with AI,” he said.For Chambers, the current moment represents the most uncertain global business climate he has ever witnessed. He described it as “the new normal” and said leaders who fail to adapt will be left behind.","John Chambers, who led Cisco through the internet boom of the late 1990s and the painful crash that followed, compared today’s AI wave to the dot-com era.

As reported by 9to5Mac, these apps—many of which mimic Sora’s branding, interface, and promises—are appearing in multiple countries, often misleading users into thinking they’re downloading the official version.Sora 2 is known for its ability to generate realistic, AI-powered video clips from the text prompts. The video generation tool has become the most-talked about AI tools of 2025. The viral demos and its integration with creative platforms have made it popular among content creators, marketers and educators. However, with this popularity comes imitation.According to 9to5Mac report, developers across the regions have rushed to release apps with similar names, logos, and even fake screenshots, hoping to capitalize on the buzz. Some clones offer limited functionality, while others are outright scams, charging users for features that don’t exist.The increase in the number of Sore 2 clones have once again started the debate over App Store moderation and the ability of the platform like Apple to detect and remove deceptive apps quickly. While Apple has taken down several impersonators, new ones continue to surface, often with slight variations in name or branding.Security experts warn that some of these clones may pose privacy risks, collecting user data or injecting ads into devices without proper disclosure.- The official Sora 2 app is not yet available on the mobile platforms. Any app available on the App Store and claiming to be Sora 2 is likely misleading.- OpenAI has not yet announced a mobile release and users are advised to access Sore via verified web platforms only.- Check developer credentials and reviews before downloading any AI video app.","ChatGPT creator OpenAI recently launched its Sora 2 model.

What is Microsoft’s ‘Copilot’ problem



Microsoft's strategy moving forward







Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella drew laughter from employees during a recent all-hands meeting when addressing concerns about the company's confusing array of Copilot products, a report has said. The CEO suggests “a billion users of each” app would solve the branding problem as employees raise customer confusion concerns.Citing an audio from the internal town hall, Business Insider reported that when an employee asked how Microsoft plans to clarify its multiple Copilot offerings for customers, Nadella offered a tongue-in-cheek solution.“The one way to make it less confusing is to have a billion users of each,” he said, drawing laughter from the employees in attendance.He quickly added a more serious response: “Quite honestly, the best answer to a lot of the confusion is just daily usage, right?”The employee’s question highlighted a concern within Microsoft. The company currently has two different Copilot apps available in mobile app stores: a consumer version built by Microsoft AI and a rebranded Microsoft Office app also called Copilot.Both apps open to similar-looking chat interfaces, the employee noted, making it difficult for average users to distinguish that one includes integrated Word, Excel and PowerPoint functionality while the other does not.Nadella argued that context should ultimately resolve the confusion, pointing to GitHub Copilot as an example of a product where users understand its specific purpose.“If you think about it, we have one other Copilot, which is GitHub Copilot. No one is confused about the context of GitHub Copilot,"" Nadella said.He also noted that customers have already learned to switch between personal Microsoft accounts (MSA) and separate work or school accounts, internally referred to as Entra IDs.“That said, I think you're right,” Nadella acknowledged, adding, “We do need to ensure that our marketing approach and our branding approach conveys this.”Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft's consumer chief marketing officer, told employees that the combined Copilot products already have 100 million monthly active users. He emphasised that ensuring both tools work consistently is critical to providing a coherent experience when customers switch between apps.Microsoft is also taking a more deliberate approach to promoting each version, Mehdi said. He is coordinating with Mustafa Suleyman, who leads the consumer Copilot, and Rajesh Jha, who oversees the Microsoft 365 version, to determine which Copilot gets featured in different contexts.",Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella drew laughter from employees during a recent all- hands meeting.

What Trump's H-1B visa fee order says





A coalition of labor unions, health care providers, schools, and religious organizations has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump ’s executive order increasing H-1B visa fee. The lawsuit claims the increase in visa fee to the anti-immigration power grab: A sweeping executive action that slaps an unlawful new $100,000 price tag on every new H-1B application. As per the press release issued by the association, the proclamation has already thrown employers, workers, and federal agencies into chaos. Plaintiffs are represented by Democracy Forward, Justice Action Center, South Asian American Justice Collaborative (SAAJCO), Kuck Baxter LLC, Joseph & Hall, P.C., and IMMpact Litigation.The H-1B visa program was created by Congress to provide a critical path for the United States to attract highly skilled professionals from around the world to fill urgent needs in the economy and public services to strengthen American innovation. Under the program, U.S. employers can hire qualified foreign talent — such as doctors, nurses, engineers, teachers, and researchers — after a rigorous review process.The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, challenges the order as unconstitutional and unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act. Plaintiffs include Global Nurse Force; Global Village Academy Collaborative; Society of the Divine Word; the Fathers of St.Charles; Church on the Hill; International Union; United Auto-Aerospace Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW International); UAW Local 4811; American Association of University Professors (AAUP); Committee of Interns and Residents, SEIU (CIR), a citizen of the United Kingdom residing in the Appalachia region, and a citizen of India residing in the Northern District of California.These plaintiffs represent medical residents, fellows, interns, and nurses serving rural and medically underserved communities, a school that relies on H-1B workers to serve their students, religious organizations that depend on the H-1B program to hire pastors and religious professionals that minister to underserved communities, major labor unions representing faculty and academic professionals and higher education members, and individual highly skilled workers whose careers and lives were upended overnight.When the government makes it prohibitively expensive or impossible for these professionals to come to America, or for current H-1B workers to transition to a more permanent status, entire communities lose — patients wait longer for care, students have fewer teachers, and local economies miss out on the innovation and jobs these experts create.The complaint details how the sudden $100,000 demand:The H-1B program has a carefully crafted fee and oversight system set by law. The President cannot rewrite it overnight or levy new taxes by proclamation.The order offers a vague “national interest” loophole with no clear standards for fee exemptions, opening the door to arbitrary, pay-to-play decisions.Rural hospitals warn they will be unable to keep needed doctors and nurses; schools say the unlawful fee is more than many teacher salaries; and nonprofit organizations and research institutions can’t absorb the significant expense. All will lose if they cannot utilize H-1B workers.Economists agree that H-1B workers create U.S. jobs and drive new industries. Forcing talent away means companies move operations—and good jobs—overseas. Without relief, hospitals will lose medical staff, churches will lose pastors, classrooms will lose teachers, and industries across the country risk losing key innovators.The suit asks the court to immediately block the order and restore predictability for employers and workers.In its order, Trump administration argued that the H-1B visa system was being abused to replace American workers with people willing to work for less money. The United States awards 85,000 H-1B visas per year on a lottery system.

Elon Musk’s vision: Robots as common as smartphones

Cuban’s grounded take: AI for real-world efficiency





Billionaire and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban has challenged Tesla CEO Elon Musk ’s bold prediction about robots. Speaking on the Prof G Markets podcast, Cuban said that Musk’s bold prediction on humanoid robots will start impacting the global GDP within four to five years. While Cuban praised the intelligence and vision of Elon Musk, he argued that the future of robotics depends on function-first design and now on its humanoid forms. The difference of opinion of Musk and Cuban highlight a broader debate about how artificial intelligence will reshape industries, homes, and the global economy.Cuban believes in Musk’s foresight in video-trained AI, saying, “With robotics, they've got to capture video. That's where Elon is smart and ahead of the curve.” But he added, “I don't think that’s the future,” referring to Musk’s belief in humanoid robots like Tesla’s Optimus.On the other hand, Cuban feels that robots are task-oriented and are also not constrained by human-like shapes. “It might look like a spider or whatever they come up with,” he said. “It’s going to know what socks go together, how long to wash, and to look under the bed for dust.”Speaking at the Saudi economic forum in May, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emphasised that humanoid robots could become as common as smartphones. Musk also joked that one of Tesla’s Optimus bots performed the “Trump dance” in front of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and President Donald Trump. Musk believes these robots could eventually drive an economy “10 times the size of the current global economy” and usher in “universal high income. ”Speaking in the interview, Cuban also revealed that his own company, Cost Plus Drugs is using robots and AI to manufacture pharmaceuticals in Dallas more efficiently as compared to India and China. “It doesn’t take many people,” he said. “More importantly, we can turn from one drug to the next in hours.”Cuban also feels that AI’s biggest impact will be on small and medium-sizes businesses. He also emphasised that AI can unlock educational opportunities for young learners. “There’s nothing a kid can’t learn right now,” Cuban said. “And when you tell me that there’s a tool that allows any child to learn anything they want… nothing makes me more excited.”","Billionaire and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban has challenged Tesla CEO Elon Musk ’s bold prediction about robots.

Wall Street braces for market correction after historic rally





Tech leaders debate whether AI boom mirrors dotcom era





Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon acknowledged that artificial intelligence investments may constitute a market bubble, while cautioning that massive capital deployed in the sector will likely fail to deliver expected returns. Speaking at a tech conference in Turin, Italy, Solomon told attendees he's bracing for a potential market correction within the next two years.""There will be a lot of capital that was deployed that didn't deliver returns,"" Solomon said, according to the Financial Times. However, the Wall Street veteran insisted he's ""not smart enough"" to definitively determine whether AI represents a true bubble, adding that ""it's not different this time"" from previous investment manias.Solomon predicted markets could experience a drawdown over the next 12 to 24 months following a remarkable five-year bull run. The S&P 500 has surged 15% year-to-date and recorded 190 record highs since 2020, driven largely by AI investments and tech giant gains. The index now faces unprecedented concentration risk, with its top 10 companies comprising 40% of total market capitalisation—double the proportion from a decade ago.Other industry titans have weighed in on bubble concerns. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos characterised AI as an ""industrial bubble"" that will benefit society even if share prices collapse, comparing it to fiber-optic infrastructure built during the dotcom boom. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman sparked a brief market selloff in August after using the word ""bubble,"" causing the Nasdaq to drop 1.5%.Despite uncertainty, Solomon remains optimistic about AI's transformative potential. Goldman Sachs has integrated AI coding assistants that boosted software engineer productivity by 20%, and deployed internal ChatGPT tools for investment banking operations.""We are at the beginning of the movie, not the end of the movie,"" Solomon said.",Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon says AI investments may constitute a market bubble.

Meta’s tracking systems monitor workforce AI engagement across divisions





Meta is intensifying pressure on employees to embrace artificial intelligence tools, joining tech giants Google and Microsoft in making AI adoption a critical component of workplace expectations and performance evaluation.The Facebook parent company has deployed dashboards to track how extensively teams use AI and created a gamified system to boost employee engagement with the technology, Business Insider reported. Expectations vary across departments, with some staff encouraged to experiment while others face specific adoption targets that could influence their standing within the company.Meta's hardware division Reality Labs has set an ambitious goal of achieving over 75% AI adoption among employees, up from the current 70% utilisation rate, according to sources familiar with the matter. This represents a dramatic increase from just 30% in June, signalling the company's aggressive push toward AI integration across all operations.The move aligns Meta with industry peers implementing similar mandates. Microsoft's Julia Liuson instructed managers in June to incorporate AI usage into performance evaluations, treating it as essential as collaboration skills. Google CEO Sundar Pichai told employees they must ""be more AI-savvy"" to remain competitive, with the company now generating over 30% of its code using AI tools.Meta employees use AI assistants for code generation, brainstorming sessions, policy inquiries, and document drafting, current workers told Business Insider. The company launched ""Level Up,"" a voluntary program that gamifies AI adoption through its internal chatbot Metamate, rewarding employees with badges as they reach usage milestones.CEO Mark Zuckerberg has publicly emphasised internal AI adoption, predicting that by late 2025, Meta would have AI performing at a mid-level engineer's standard. On the company's April earnings call, he projected AI coding agents would handle substantial research and development work by mid-2026.Worker-tracking software providers report soaring demand for AI usage monitoring over the past two years as companies seek to measure productivity gains and cost savings from AI investments.A Meta spokesperson confirmed AI adoption is a company priority, stating it focuses on using AI to assist employees with daily tasks. The message across Silicon Valley remains clear: embrace AI-enhanced workflows or risk career stagnation in an industry rapidly reshaping itself around artificial intelligence capabilities.","Facebook parent company Meta has created a gamified system to boost employee engagement with the technology.

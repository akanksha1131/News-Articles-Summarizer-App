Google rolls out new Android security feature: What it does and how it works,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-rolls-out-new-android-security-feature-what-it-does-and-how-it-works/articleshow/120329198.cms,"How the auto-reboot feature works

Why Google introduced this feature

Google has introduced a new security feature for Android devices that will automatically restart phones and tablets if they remain locked for three consecutive days. The update, rolled out via Google Play Services version 25.14 , aims to enhance data protection and prevent unauthorised access.“Google System updates make your Android devices more secure and reliable, and give you new and useful features. They include updates from Google to the Android operating system, Google Play Store, and Google Play services. Google System updates are available for phones, tablets, Android TV and Google TV devices, Android Auto-enabled devices, cars with Android Automotive OS or Google built-in, Wear OS devices, and Chrome OS devices. [Phone] Enables a future optional security feature, which will automatically restart your device if locked for 3 consecutive days,” said the company.The new functionality ensures that if an Android device remains unused and locked for 72 hours, it will automatically restart. Upon reboot, the phone enters the ""Before First Unlock"" (BFU) state, where all user data remains fully encrypted until the passcode is entered. This prevents forensic tools and unauthorised users from accessing sensitive information.The move follows similar security measures introduced by Apple in iOS 18.1, known as ""Inactivity Reboot."" The goal is to make it harder for law enforcement agencies or hackers to exploit vulnerabilities in devices that have been left idle. Once a phone is restarted, biometric logins such as fingerprint or face unlock are disabled until the user manually enters their passcode.Cybersecurity experts have praised the update, noting that it adds an extra layer of protection against data breaches, phone theft, and forensic hacking attempts.","Google rolls out new security feature for Android devices.

Cybersecurity at risk: CVE Program for tracking security flaws faces federal funding cut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/cybersecurity-at-risk-cve-program-for-tracking-security-flaws-faces-federal-funding-cut/articleshow/120328247.cms,"Why CVE program matters

The risk of a shutdown

The cybersecurity world is bracing for potential disruption as MITRE ’s Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program faces an uncertain future. The program, which has been a cornerstone of global cybersecurity for over two decades, may go dark on April 16 due to the expiration of its US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) contract.The CVE program plays a critical role in cybersecurity by assigning standardised identifiers to software vulnerabilities, enabling security researchers, vendors, and IT teams to track and address threats efficiently. It is closely linked to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) program, which categorises coding errors that lead to vulnerabilities. Together, these programs form the backbone of global security coordination, supporting tools like vulnerability scanners, patch management systems, and threat intelligence feeds.MITRE has confirmed that its DHS contract expires on April 16, and no renewal has been finalized. Without funding, the CVE program could halt updates, leading to gaps in vulnerability tracking and delays in security advisories. Experts warn that this lapse could degrade national vulnerability databases, affecting tool vendors, incident response operations, and critical infrastructure.Jason Soroko, Senior Fellow at Sectigo, emphasised the severity of the situation: ""Failure to renew MITRE's contract risks significant disruption. A service break would negatively impact cybersecurity coordination worldwide.""Cybersecurity professionals are urging policymakers to secure funding for the CVE program to prevent a crisis. The potential shutdown has raised concerns about government reliance on private entities for critical security functions and the need for alternative solutions to maintain vulnerability tracking.","MITRE’s Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program faces an uncertain future.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff spoke about a range of issues during a recent interaction with Economic Times. He talked about Trump Tariffs, how he thinks it is India era, how AI will change business landscape and more. Among the numerous things Benioff also shared about how the idea of starting Salesforce goes back to 1996-97 when he was on a trip to India to meet his Guru Mata Amritanandamayi in Kerala. The CEO of San Francisco-based company with a current market cap of $248 billion, Benioff fondly talked about the same when asked about his ""deep connection with India.""""I was on my way to see my guru down in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. I was with her, I was explaining my vision for Salesforce, which was a new technology model and a new business model. And she reminded me, of course, of the importance of giving back, it was very much in that spirit that we have built a different kind of company,"" said Benioff.This is not the first time that the Salesforce CEO has spoken about the influence of Mata Amritanandamayi on him. In an interview to UK's Sunday Mail in 2020, Benioff said that she told him, 'In your quest to change the world, don't forget to do something for somebody else.'Benioff said that philanthropy has shaped his beliefs since meeting with Mata Amritanandamayi. ""It was like a scene from a movie,"" the CEO reportedly told the publication. ""We're in the middle of nowhere in this tiny Indian village and everybody's dressed in white and orange and there's incense wafting.”He added, ""She looked right at me and said, 'In your quest to change the world, don't forget to do something for somebody else'.""

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon sells company stock worth $31.5 million amid succession plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-sells-company-stock-worth-31-5-million-amid-succession-plan/articleshow/120320892.cms,"File photo: JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon (Picture credit: AP)

JP Morgan CEO sells company share amid succession plan



Jamie Dimon has a message for young American investors



""If you don't take care of your mind, your body, your spirit, your soul, your friends, your family — you're not going to have a great life and enjoy it. Have a little heart and humanity, treat people properly. The way I grew up, the way you treat everyone is fair and honest and forthright and you'll have a great life,""

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has sold nearly $31.5 million worth of company stock. According to a regulatory filing (seen by the news agency Reuters), the sale involves 133,639 JP Morgan shares, coming after Dimon offloaded some shares last year, which was his first stock sale since becoming CEO in 2005. The move follows JPMorgan's strong first-quarter performance, where it beat profit estimates thanks to record equities trading and increased fees from debt underwriting and M&A advisory. Dimon’s compensation for 2024 was also raised by 8.3%, bringing his total pay to $39 million. This comes as the company decides on who will succeed Dimon as CEO.Dimon’s latest share sale comes amid ongoing succession planning at JPMorgan, where he has served as CEO for 19 years. At 69, Dimon remains a key figure on Wall Street, but the bank’s board is increasingly focused on preparing for his eventual departure — something Dimon himself described last year as his top priority. In recent remarks, Dimon also cautioned shareholders about the long-term risks of trade wars, highlighting concerns over sustained inflation and rising fiscal deficits.Recently, Dimon shared a hopeful view of America’s future, encouraging young investors to shift their focus away from negativity. In an interview with Fox Business, Dimon said the next generation is set to inherit a country with significant economic value and could benefit from progress in areas like artificial intelligence and healthcare, including potential treatments for cancer.He also advised young people to take care of their physical and mental health and to approach others with fairness, honesty, and respect.Dimon said.","JP Morgan CEO sells company share amid succession plan.

A new artificial intelligence trend is sweeping across social media, blending nostalgia, digital creativity, and personalization. Dubbed the “ChatGPT Action Figure Trend,” this phenomenon is giving users the opportunity to create hyper-realistic images of themselves as collectible dolls or action figures—complete with toy box packaging, accessories, and thematic designs. The viral trend is powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT , which now includes image generation capabilities through DALL·E, enabling users to craft customized toy-like avatars using a combination of uploaded photos and descriptive prompts.This trend follows a series of internet-wide moments in which AI tools, particularly ChatGPT, have enabled viral self-expression—such as Studio Ghibli-inspired portraits and AI-generated yearbook photos. The recent rise in ChatGPT traffic—reaching a record 184.4 million global visits on April 9, 2025, according to Similarweb—indicates not just interest in generative AI, but its growing cultural relevance in user-led digital art and identity play.Here’s everything to know about the ChatGPT action figure trend , how it works, what platforms are driving it, and why it's capturing the imagination of millions.The ChatGPT Action Figure Trend is a user-generated movement where individuals use AI to design digital images of themselves as action figures or Barbie-style dolls. The characters often appear inside a branded toy box, accompanied by miniature accessories, clothing, and backdrops that reflect the user’s personality, profession, or hobbies.While there is no confirmed origin for the trend, it rapidly gained traction on TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and Reddit. The posts typically show the AI-generated doll and its box art, along with a caption describing the user's design choices. Some themes parody pop culture archetypes—like “Corporate Coffee Warrior” or “Freelance Chaos Coder”—while others take a more sincere, biographical approach.The trend taps into both nostalgia and novelty. For many, it recalls childhood memories of unboxing dolls or action figures, now merged with cutting-edge AI customization. The result is a quirky but powerful form of self-representation.To start, users need a ChatGPT account. The feature works best on the ChatGPT Plus plan, which includes GPT-4 and access to image generation tools like DALL·E 3.

The image is used by ChatGPT to render a more accurate digital likeness.Users then enter a detailed prompt instructing the AI to generate a toy box image of themselves. The prompt can include:Within seconds to a few minutes, ChatGPT generates an image that matches the description. The final result often looks like a professional marketing photo for a real-life toy.The success of the ChatGPT Action Figure Trend can be attributed to several factors:While fun and engaging, the trend has some caveats:Additionally, concerns have been raised about the long-term ethical implications of AI-generated identity manipulation and the use of personal data in training models—although OpenAI maintains that user-uploaded images are not used to train future models.","A new artificial intelligence trend is sweeping across social media, blending nostalgia, digital creativity, and personalization.

"‘Suspending Spacex, Tesla, DOGE and all websites affiliated with Elon Musk for a full ...,’ warn hackers who previously targeted Donald Trump",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/suspending-all-websites-affiliated-with-elon-musk-companies-for-a-full-warn-hackers-who-previously-targeted-donald-trump/articleshow/120102622.cms,"What hackers said about targeting Elon Musk



A group of hackers has threatened to launch an attack on sites linked to Elon Musk . The cybercrime group named DonRoad Team, which had earlier claimed responsibility for taking down several websites associated with US President Donald Trump, has now announced that it would start targeting sites associated with Tesla and SpaceX CEO. The group also shared its intent to attack sites associated with the tech billionaire over a month. Previously, the DonRoad Team has claimed responsibility for its attacks in March that targeted The Trump Organization's website, as well as Tesla and SpaceX email servers, causing temporary global outages at the time. This comes after Musk-owned social media platform X (earlier Twitter) was targeted by a group of pro-Palestinian hackers who were able to disable the site for several hours.In a post (seen by Newsweek) shared on messaging platform Telegram, the hackers said: “In the next few hours, we will be suspending all websites affiliated with Elon Musk companies for a full month.”However, the Telegram post was later removed. Should these hacks occur, they may impact multiple Musk-related websites, including X and his AI platforms Grok and Tesla. Hackers may also target websites of other companies owned by Musk, like SpaceX and Tesla.In March, Musk-owned X experienced at least three major outages following a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. —a cyber assault that floods networks or devices with bot-generated traffic. The Dark Storm Team claimed responsibility for the incident.Reacting to the cyberattack, Musk at that time took to X to write: There was (still is) a massive cyberattack against 𝕏. We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing …”Later, in a Fox Business interview, Musk noted: “There was a massive cyber attack to try to bring down the X system with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area.”In a separate event in February, the website for the Department of Government Efficiency, of which Musk is a member, was compromised and altered to mock him and his team.The hacked site temporarily displayed a prominent message stating, “This is a joke of a .gov site,"" alongside the note, ""THESE 'EXPERTS' LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN.”",Hackers threaten to launch an attack on sites linked to Elon Musk.

"Walmart Boycott: World's largest retailer tells protesters, 'we are America's ...'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/walmart-boycott-worlds-largest-retailer-tells-protesters-we-are-americas-/articleshow/120119363.cms,"Here's what Walmart said about the protest

People's Union USA founder John Schwarz has announced on social media details of upcoming planned boycotts:

Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, has issued a statement addressing the ongoing week-long boycott organised by the People’s Union USA . The boycott, dubbed the "" Walmart Blackout ,"" began on April 7 and targets the company’s rollback of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, as well as broader concerns over corporate influence and tax policies .The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity. The group’s founder, John Schwarz, urged consumers to avoid shopping at Walmart stores, using its online services, or purchasing from its subsidiaries like Sam’s Club. Schwarz stated, “We are holding these companies accountable so they finally step up and pay their fair share of taxes to alleviate federal income tax from the working-class citizen.”In response, Walmart defended its contributions to communities and the economy. “Serving communities is at the heart of Walmart's purpose to help people save money and live better,” the company said in a statement. “As one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, not only do we pay our fair share, we are an economic force multiplier strengthening communities nationwide through job creation, supplier growth, and over $1.7 billion in cash and in-kind donations last year"", it added further.The boycott follows Walmart’s decision last November to discontinue its five-year commitment to a racial equity center and other DEI programs. Critics argue that these rollbacks undermine progress in promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Walmart, however, emphasised its dedication to supporting local charities, disaster response, hunger relief, workforce development, and conservation efforts.A report from SuperMarketNews, citing data from Numerator, suggests that Walmart may be more resistant to boycotts compared to other retailers. The data indicates that Walmart has not experienced significant impact from households regarding its stance on non-DEI initiatives, particularly among multicultural households—a trend that contrasts with another retail chain Target.Target reportedly faced the most severe backlash during the February 28 boycott focused on DEI initiatives, experiencing a 9% drop in web traffic on the day of the protest, according to Forbes. In comparison, Walmart observed a 5% decline in web traffic, while Amazon saw the smallest decrease, at just 2%.* Walmart: April 7-14 and May 20-26* Second economic blackout: April 18* General Mills: April 21-28* Amazon: May 6-12* Target: June 3-9* McDonald's: June 24-30* Independence Day boycott: July 4","The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female. The change aligns with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January 2025, titled ‘Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government’. The updated policy, which took effect on April 2, applies to all pending and future immigration benefit requests. “USCIS is returning to its historical policy of recognizing two biological sexes,” the agency said in a press statement.Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security , said “There are only two sexes—male and female. President Trump promised the American people a revolution of common sense, and that includes making sure that the policy of the U.S. government agrees with simple biological reality. Proper management of our immigration system is a matter of national security, not a place to promote and coddle an ideology that permanently harms children and robs real women of their dignity, safety, and well-being.”Under the new guidance, a person’s sex will be determined based on the birth certificate issued at or closest to the time of birth. “If the birth certificate issued at or nearest to the time of birth indicates a sex other than male or female, USCIS will base the determination of sex on secondary evidence. See Volume 1, General Policies and Procedures, Part E, Adjudications, Chapter 6, Evidence, Section B, Primary and Secondary Evidence [1 USCIS-PM E.6(B)],” the agency stated.The agency further added that the benefits will not be denied solely based on how someone identifies their sex, it also confirmed that it does not issue documents with a blank sex field or one that differs from the original birth certificate. Any discrepancies may lead to processing delays.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female.

This admission lends credence to the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) claim that Meta strategically acquired emerging competitors to prevent them from challenging its market position.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Zuckerberg’s admission comes during his second day of testimony, and appears to bolster the (FTC) claims that Meta employed a “buy or bury” strategy to eliminate potential rivals to maintain its market dominance.“We were doing a build vs. buy analysis,” Zuckerberg stated, adding, “I thought that Instagram was better at that, so I thought it was better to buy them.”Zuckerberg also conceded that Meta's attempts to develop its own apps often resulted in failure.“Building a new app is hard and many more times than not when we have tried to build a new app it hasn't gotten a lot of traction,” he told the court.“We probably tried building dozens of apps over the history of the company and the majority of them don't go anywhere,” he added.Meta, however, argues that Zuckerberg's past statements, including a 2008 email stating “it is better to buy than compete,” are irrelevant. The company contends that the FTC has defined the relevant social media market too narrowly, failing to account for intense competition from platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Apple's messaging app.Zuckerberg's admission regarding Instagram's superior camera technology has provided a key piece of evidence for the FTC's case. The FTC is seeking to unwind Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing that these deals were anti-competitive and aimed at stifling innovation. The trial's outcome could significantly impact Meta's business model.","Zuckerberg says Meta often failed to develop its own apps.

China has accused the US National Security Agency (NSA) of conducting a series of sophisticated cyberattacks targeting the country’s critical infrastructure during the Asian Winter Games in February.

Wilson, Robert J. Snelling, and Stephen W. Johnson as alleged NSA agents involved in the attacks.Furthermore, the accused NSA agents are alleged to have “repeatedly carried out cyberattacks on China's critical information infrastructure and participated in cyberattacks on Huawei and other enterprises.”The news agency also stated that the NSA attacks targeted vital sectors in Heilongjiang province, including energy, transportation, water conservancy, communications, and national defense research institutions.The agency claims the attacks were designed to “sabotage China's critical information infrastructure, causing social disorder, and stealing important confidential information.”The report alleges that the NSA exploited pre-installed backdoors in Microsoft Windows operating systems on specific devices during the Winter Games.

EU’s new measures for US-bound Commission staff



The European Commission is offering US-bound commissioners and senior officials burner phones and basic laptops to avoid the risk of espionage in the US, a report has claimed. These are traditionally used by European Union (EU) officials for trips to high-risk countries such as China and Ukraine.The EU officials are reportedly concerned that US systems may try to infiltrate the Commission's networks. The new guidelines have been implemented ahead of next week’s IMF and World Bank spring meetings, which Commissioners and senior officials will be attending.A report by The Financial Times cited four sources familiar with the matter who confirmed that similar steps had been taken on trips to Ukraine and China, where standard IT equipment is restricted due to surveillance risks.“They are worried about the US getting into the commission systems,” one of the officials said to FT.The European Commission announced that three commissioners—Valdis Dombrovskis (Economy Commissioner), Maria Luís Albuquerque (Financial Services Chief), and Jozef Síkela (Development Assistance)—are travelling to Washington from April 21-26 for the IMF and World Bank meetings.The Commission noted it had recently updated its security advice for US travel, though no written instructions specifically regarding burner phone use were provided. The updates, coordinated with the bloc’s diplomatic service, include a recommendation for all staff travelling to the US to turn off their phones at the border and keep them in special sleeves to reduce the risk of surveillance if left unattended.According to Luuk van Middelaar, director of the Brussels Institute for Geopolitics, the advice was expected.“Washington is not Beijing or Moscow, but it is an adversary that is prone to use extra-legal methods to further its interests and power,” Middelaar said to FT.In light of past espionage allegations—such as the claims that the Obama administration spied on Angela Merkel’s phone—Van Middelaar noted that similar surveillance tactics by Democrat administrations have become an accepted reality for the Commission.Travelling to the US carries additional risks, as border officials may seize and inspect electronic devices. European tourists, academics, and researchers have already claimed to have faced entry denial over social media posts or opinions deemed critical of US policies.To minimise these risks, Commission officials have been advised to carry their visas in diplomatic laissez-passer documents rather than in national passports.","EU officials are reportedly concerned that US systems may try to infiltrate the Commission's networks.

Uncertainty grows as DOGE and Trump push forward with government overhaul



Federal agencies are scrambling to meet Monday's deadline to present plans for another round of mass layoffs, further advancing the Trump administration's government downsizing initiative led by tech billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).The impending ""reductions in force"" come after February's termination of thousands of probationary federal employees and will provide clearer insight into the administration's vision for a smaller federal government, according to reporting from The New York Times.""Agency supervisors and managers have largely been left in the dark about the personnel changes,"" said an Environmental Protection Agency scientist who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""Many have come to rely on the news media to learn about their job security.""Some departments have already begun implementing cuts. The Department of Health and Human Services laid off approximately 10,000 employees on April 1, with some workers discovering they were terminated only when their building badges stopped working. In some cases, entire departments and programs were eliminated.Thousands of additional federal workers have resigned voluntarily in recent days, accepting temporary pay in exchange for quitting. The National Park Service alone has seen more than 1,100 such departures, The Times reported.""Scant information about the resignation and early retirement offers has left federal workers to seek advice on social media about whether to accept,"" a Homeland Security official noted, describing how employees were given just 48 hours to make career-altering decisions.The cuts have created widespread uncertainty across federal agencies. Fired probationary workers remain in limbo following fluctuating court rulings that initially forced reinstatements but were later overturned or paused.Further complicating matters, President Trump fired Merit System Protections Board head Cathy A. Harris, leaving the independent administrative board without a quorum to hear employment appeals. This means newly terminated workers could wait years for their cases to be reviewed.The DOGE initiative has already resulted in tens of thousands of departures, casting what The Times describes as ""a pall over the federal workforce"" since Trump returned to office.","Federal agencies are scrambling to meet Monday's deadline to present plans for another round of mass layoffs.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ' fiancée Lauren Sánchez is back from a Blue Origin flight that marked a significant step for women in space . The spacesuit worn by the all-women crew addressed an ongoing challenge with NASA ’s spacesuit design—a challenge rooted in traditional suits being designed for men and then adapted for women. Facing a situation where an all-female spacewalk was once cancelled due to the lack of properly fitting suits, Sánchez reached out to designers Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim, the creative minds behind her 2024 Met Gala outfit. Their collaboration aimed to create a spacesuit better suited to women’s needs, aligning with Blue Origin’s commitment to inclusive design. This initiative reflects Sánchez’s proactive approach in ensuring that even space tourists have access to gear that fits comfortably and functionally.On a video call with The New York Times, “Usually, you know, these suits are made for a man. Then they get tailored to fit a woman.”In 2019, an all-female spacewalk was canceled because NASA did not have two spacesuits properly tailored for women; as a result, they sent one woman and one man instead.The new Blue Origin spacesuits introduced by Lauren Sánchez and designers from Monse aims to offer a professional yet feminine look. These new suits, produced by Creative Character Engineering, replace the older, bulkier Blue Origin models with a design inspired by a mix of futuristic aesthetics and vintage flair.Made from flame-resistant stretch neoprene, these body-con jumpsuits feature elements such as a slight mandarin collar, dual-zip front, and adjustable calf zippers that allow wearers to customise a flared effect. Every suit is tailored using 3D body scans for a precise fit.Gayle King noted that the suits successfully combined professionalism with femininity, a look that marks a departure from traditional men's spacesuit references. Designers aimed for simplicity, comfort, and a hint of daring style, which Amanda Nguyen described as a revolutionary statement affirming that women belong in space, the report added.Blue Origin isn’t the only private space company to collaborate with fashion designers for spacesuit design . Axiom Space has partnered with Prada to develop the spacesuits NASA astronauts will wear during the Artemis III moon mission in 2026.Similarly, Elon Musk teamed up with Hollywood costume designer Jose Fernandez, known for his work on The Fantastic Four and The Avengers, to create the SpaceX suits.","Jeff Bezos' fiancée Lauren Sánchez wore a Blue Origin spacesuit on a recent flight.

Crosswalks in Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Redwood City, intended to assist visually impaired individuals, were compromised, replacing standard audio prompts with satirical messages in the simulated voices of the Tesla and Meta CEOs.According to a report by Business Insider, the hacks were observed over the weekend as videos of the hacked crosswalk messages made rounds on social media, showcasing the bizarre and often controversial content.The AI-generated messages targeted both Musk and Zuckerberg with satirical commentary. In one clip, a simulated Musk voice humorously referenced the Cybertruck and feelings of loneliness, while another featured him soliciting friendship and offering a Cybertruck as a bribe.“You know, they say money can't buy happiness, and yeah, okay, I guess that's true. God knows I've tried. But it can buy a Cybertruck, and that's pretty sick, right? Right?"" one audio clip reportedly says.""Hi, I'm Elon. Can we be friends? Will you be my friend? I'll give you a Cybertruck, I promise.

: Payment Service Providers (e.g., Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm) are required to ensure that their UPI apps can detect and block international transactions made through saved QR codes. Domestic transactions unaffected, with limits: Within India, the QR Share & Pay feature remains functional. However, a long-standing limit of Rs 2,000 applies for transactions made to non-verified offline merchants using this method. PSPs are required to enforce this restriction programmatically.

Reason behind the restriction

: Domestic transactions via QR Share & Pay remain capped at Rs 2,000 per transaction for non-verified offline merchants. Merchant verification: Transactions above this limit require the merchant to be registered with NPCI and undergo KYC checks.

Additional restrictions: No more wallet top-ups via collect requests

Security over convenience

In a significant regulatory update that impacts global digital payments, the National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) has issued a directive halting all international UPI transactions made through the “QR Share & Pay” method. The announcement, detailed in a circular dated April 8, 2025, is effective retroactively from April 4, 2025. Under the new regulation, international merchant payments initiated by scanning QR codes saved in device galleries—rather than physically present codes—will no longer be allowed. This policy change affects all Payment Service Provider (PSP) apps such as Google Pay, PhonePe, and Paytm that facilitate India’s UPI (Unified Payments Interface) services abroad.Currently, UPI-based QR payments are supported in multiple countries including France, Nepal, Mauritius, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and the UAE. The restriction aims to curb potential fraud and improve oversight in international financial transactions. While domestic QR share-and-pay transactions remain valid, they are subject to limits and merchant verification protocols.The “QR Share & Pay” method allowed merchants to share static QR codes through digital platforms such as WhatsApp or email, which customers could then save and scan via UPI apps to make payments. This mode of transaction was particularly popular among small and medium-sized businesses, as well as Indian tourists and Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) making purchases abroad.This method offered convenience by removing the need for physical presence during payment, supporting remote transactions across borders. For example, an Indian tourist in Singapore could purchase an item, receive the merchant’s QR code digitally, and complete the transaction through an Indian UPI app—even after returning home.According to NPCI’s April 2025 circular, the following key changes have been implemented:The decision to suspend international QR Share & Pay transactions is primarily motivated by fraud prevention. QR codes—especially when shared remotely—can be tampered with or misused by malicious actors to steal data or redirect payments.Rahul Jain, CFO of NTT DATA Payment Services India, noted that P2M transactions with unverified or foreign merchants posed elevated fraud risks, as reported by. Without physical verification or merchant onboarding, the system becomes susceptible to unauthorized fund transfers and phishing attacks. By disallowing remote QR payments overseas, NPCI aims to strengthen control and traceability of outbound UPI flows.While international usage has been restricted, NPCI has clarified that the QR Share & Pay method can still be used within India, provided certain guidelines are followed:The same circular introduces another critical change: users will no longer be allowed to load prepaid wallets or gift cards using the “collect request” feature. A collect request refers to a payment request initiated by the merchant that the user must approve. This method has increasingly been associated with scams and phishing attempts.Rohit Mahajan, Managing Partner at Plutos ONE, noted that NPCI is phasing out collect requests—particularly from unverified merchants—to enhance consumer protection. Users can now only top up their wallets via push transactions, which are user-initiated and considered safer.According to Jai Kumar, Co-Founder of TechFini, while these changes may reduce convenience, especially for cross-border transactions, they offer significant improvements in security and regulatory oversight. The updated guidelines represent NPCI’s strategic shift toward minimizing high-risk transactions and improving traceability within the expanding UPI ecosystem.","The National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) has issued a directive halting all international UPI transactions made through the “QR Share & Pay’ method.

CBP One App’s Role in Parole Program

Nicole Micheroni Clarifies Immigration Parole

A US citizen and immigration attorney, Nicole Micheroni , received a startling email from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ordering her to “self-deport immediately,” The Boston Globe reported. that the email had the subject line “Notification of Termination of Parole” but omitted any client name or case number. Micheroni, a partner at Cameron Micheroni & Silvia in Massachusetts, initially assumed it was meant for a client. “It took me a couple of minutes to realize it was sent to me instead of someone I represent,” she told the Globe. The email warned, “DHS is terminating your parole. Do not attempt to remain in the United States—the federal government will find you.”Micheroni, a 12-year immigration law veteran, claimed that it was unclear why DHS had her email address, as clients typically provide their own for updates.DHS later confirmed the notice was sent to Micheroni by mistake. A Customs and Border Protection spokesperson released a statement regarding the letter Micheroni received, which said that notifications may have reached unintended recipients if a non-personal email, such as that of a US citizen contact, was provided. ""CBP used the known email addresses of the alien to send notifications. If a non-personal email—such as an American citizen contact—was provided by the alien, notices may have been sent to unintended recipients. CBP is monitoring communications and will address any issues on a case-by-case basis.”The incident connects to the CBP One app, introduced near the end of Trump’s first term to help customs brokers schedule inspections and allow short-term visa holders to extend stays. Under the former President Biden, the app’s use expanded to manage migrant parole, granting a two-year stay and work authorization while awaiting case hearings. Following Doald Trump’s January 20, 2025, inauguration, CBP is said to have started canceling migrant appointments at the Mexico border, effectively halting the parole program’s operations.Micheroni used the incident to educate the public on immigration parole via a BlueSky thread. “Revocation of parole isn’t the same as a deportation order, and this email does not initiate deportation proceedings,” she wrote. With 12 years of legal experience, she urged anyone receiving similar notices to consult an immigration lawyer immediately, emphasizing that legal options may still be available.","US citizen and immigration attorney Nicole Micheroni received a startling email from the Department of Homeland Security.

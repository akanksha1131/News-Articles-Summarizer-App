Sundar Pichai and 4 other technology CEOs whose companies spend highest on their security,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sundar-pichai-and-4-other-technology-ceos-whose-companies-spend-highest-on-their-security/articleshow/115919278.cms,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg tops the chart

Meta explains why it spent so much on Zuckerberg’s security

How much Google, Apple spent on their CEO’s security

Big tech companies are investing heavily in the protection of their CEOs, with some paying significantly more than others. This includes everything from personal security teams to advanced surveillance systems, underscoring the risks tied to their high-profile roles. Among the top spenders are Meta , which spent $23.4 million on Mark Zuckerberg's security in 2023, and Google, which allocated $6.8 million for Sundar Pichai . Here's a look at the top five tech CEOs whose companies spend the most on protecting them,Meta spent a total of $23.4 million for CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s personal security in 2023, significantly surpassing the security expenses of other tech giants. Approximately $10 million of this was allocated for high-profile security services to ensure the safety of him and his family. An additional $14 million was provided as an annual allowance to cover other security-related expenses.By comparison, Google spent $6.8 million on safeguarding Sundar Pichai, while Tesla’s outlay for Elon Musk’s security was $2.4 million, according to Fortune. This highlights Meta's heightened focus on Zuckerberg's protection amid his high-profile role and the company's prominent public presence.In an Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, Meta said that the company paid these large security payments, “for the company’s benefit because of the importance of Mr. Zuckerberg to Meta,”. Zuckerberg is especially at risk because of his position, the company argued. “We believe that Mr. Zuckerberg’s role puts him in a unique position: he is synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,” the company stated.In 2023, Google allocated $6.8 million for Sundar Pichai’s personal security, according to an SEC filing. Additionally, Pichai benefited from other perks, including access to a company car and the use of “non-commercial aircraft,” such as a private jet, for his travel needs.While Apple spent $820,309 on security measures for CEO Tim Cook, in addition to the $1.6 million Apple paid for Cook’s private jet usage. Tesla, on the other hand, allocated $2.4 million to a security firm owned by CEO Elon Musk for personal protection services. According to an SEC filing, the company reported an extra $500,000 spent on security-related expenses through February 2024.Chipmaker Nvidia spends relatively modestly on security for its CEO, Jensen Huang. The company allocated approximately $2.2 million for residential security and consultation fees for Huang, as detailed in an SEC filing."," Meta spent $23.4 million on Mark Zuckerberg's security in 2023.

How Google may have spent hundreds of millions on groups ‘targeting’ Microsoft in Europe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-may-have-spent-hundreds-of-millions-on-groups-targeting-microsoft-in-europe/articleshow/115919165.cms,"Google Cloud Platform offered hundreds of millions of euros in financial incentives to a European trade association to maintain its legal battle against Microsoft 's cloud licensing practices, according to The Register.The Cloud Infrastructure Service Providers in Europe ( CISPE ), a trade body representing European cloud providers, was presented with a lucrative package by Amit Zavery , former Google Cloud Platform VP. The offer included €4 million in a ""Members Innovation Fund"", an additional €10 million in membership resources, and a staggering €100 million in Google Distributed Cloud software credits spread over five years.The Register revealed that Google's presentation explicitly tied these incentives to the organization's continued complaint against Microsoft's allegedly anti-competitive licensing policies. Despite these enticements, CISPE ultimately chose to settle with Microsoft, reportedly receiving between €10-30 million and gaining access to an enhanced Azure Local service .Sources close to CISPE suggested the trade body was weary of prolonged legal battles. ""There has to be recognition from Microsoft that mistakes were made,"" an insider told The Register, indicating a desire to find a pragmatic resolution over continued confrontation.The dispute centers on Microsoft's software licensing, which reportedly charges customers up to four times more to run Windows Server in non-Azure cloud environments. Google has been vocal about what it terms a "" software tax "" imposed by Microsoft.Unable to persuade CISPE, Google subsequently joined the Open Cloud Coalition , a smaller trade group predominantly comprised of UK cloud providers. The company has also filed an antitrust complaint with theEuropean Commission , accusing Microsoft of misusing its desktop operating system dominance to lock customers into Azure services.The cloud computing landscape remains fiercely competitive. Recent market research indicates that while AWS leads with 32% market share in Europe, Microsoft holds 26%, and Google trails at 15%. With McKinsey estimating that 68% of businesses run fewer than half their workloads in the cloud, the stakes for market expansion remain high.Microsoft dismissed Google's efforts, characterizing the Open Cloud Coalition as an ""astroturf group"" designed to damage its reputation. The European Commission has confirmed receipt of Google's complaint and will assess it through standard procedures.","Google offered hundreds of millions of euros in financial incentives to a European trade association to maintain its legal battle against Microsoft.

""Leading Intel has been the honor of my lifetime,""

""Today is, of course, bittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career. I can look back with pride at all that we have accomplished together.""

It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics. I am forever grateful for the many colleagues around the world who I have worked with as part of the Intel family,”

""I will give thanks with my whole heart; I will tell of all your wonderful deeds""

“Pat spent his formative years at Intel, then returned at a critical time for the company in 2021,”

“As a leader,

Pat

helped launch and revitalize process manufacturing by investing in state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing, while working tirelessly to drive innovation throughout the company.”

Intel announced Monday that CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired, effective December 1, 2024, stepping down from both his executive role and the company's board of directors after a 40-plus-year career. The 63-year old CEO steps down from the role amid a prolonged period of corporate challenges that have dramatically eroded the company's market position and investor confidence.Gelsinger said in a statement.The semiconductor giant has been battling significant headwinds, with its stock plummeting 52% year-to-date. Gelsinger's departure follows a series of strategic missteps and market share losses, particularly in core business segments and the critical artificial intelligence market.Gelsinger reflected in his departure statement.In August, the company reported disappointing quarterly results that triggered the sharpest stock sell-off in 50 years. Intel simultaneously announced a massive restructuring, including laying off more than 15% of its workforce as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan.The company has explored desperate measures to regain competitiveness, including plans revealed in September to potentially turn its foundry business into an independent subsidiary to enable outside funding options. Just last week, Intel finalized a $7.86 billion government grant to support factory-building plans—a critical lifeline for its manufacturing ambitions.On his final day, December 1, Gelsinger shared a poignant post on X (formerly Twitter) citing Psalm 9:1:— a reflective message that seems to capture his gratitude despite the tumultuous end to his tenure, which is said to be forced by the board as they grew frustrated with his turnaround plan's progress, giving him two options -- to retire or be removed -- and he chose to retire, ending his 3-year-long stint as Intel CEO.Frank Yeary independent chair of Intel’s board, who’s taking the role of interim executive chair post Pat’s resignation, said in a statement.","Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired, effective December 1, 2024, stepping down from both his executive role and the company's board of directors.

Gelsinger was given the option to resign or be removed, ultimately choosing to step down.

Interim CEOs announced

Got billions of aid from Biden administration

Pat Gelsinger's goodbye note

In a surprising move, Intel announced that CEO, Pat Gelsinger has retired. In a statement, the struggling chipmaker said that Gelsinger's retirement is effective immediately, which is December 1. Reports suggest that Intel CEO Gelsinger has been forced out. The decision, made by the company's board of directors, comes amid growing concerns about the chipmaker's ability to regain market share and compete with rivals like Nvidia. According to a report in Bloomberg, the board's loss of confidence in Gelsinger's leadership was triggered by a meeting last week where the company's performance and future plans were discussed.According to the report, the Board felt that Gelsinger's costly and ambitious plan to turn Intel around was not working and the progress of change was not fast enough. Gelsinger's departure comes as Intel’s financial woes have been piling up. Intel’s challenges came into sharp focus during a disastrous earnings report on August 1, when the company delivered a surprise loss and dire sales forecast. Intel also suspended its dividend, which it had paid out since 1992. To get costs under control, Intel said it’s cutting more than 15% of its workforce, which numbered around 110,000.In the interim, Intel's CFO, David Zinsner, and Chief Product Officer, Michelle Johnston Holthaus, will assume the role of co-CEOs. The board is currently searching for a permanent replacement.Unlike some of its rivals, Intel manufactures chips in addition to designing them. Under Gelsinger, the company has been working to build up its foundry business making semiconductors in the US designed by other firms, in a bid to compete with rivals such as market leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC).Intel has benefited from tens of billions of dollars that the Biden administration has pledged to support construction of US chip foundries and reduce reliance on Asian suppliers, which the US sees as a security weakness. After taking over as CEO, Gelsinger unveiled plans to build a $20 billion chipmaking facility in central Ohio, and poured billions more into expanding in Europe, where leaders were also worried about dependence on Asia.“Today is, of course, bittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career,” Gelsinger said in the statement. “It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics.”Gelsinger joined Intel when he was a teenager (18 years) in 1979 at Intel and went on to become the company's first chief technology officer. He left Intel in 2009 and became CEO of VMware Inc. In 2021, he returned to Intel. Upon his return, he promised to regain the chipmaker’s lead in manufacturing — something it had lost to rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.","Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired, effective December 1.

Maybe, I think

might block my account, that will be the first success I think for me.”

Why this 'Big No' to social media

When acting helped him fight depression

Tamil actor Sivakarthikeyan , basking in the success of his new movie ‘Amaran’, recently shared insights on the impact of social media on his mental health and career at the 2024 International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in Goa. The actor revealed that how he has been intentionally limiting his social media usage, particularly on platforms like Twitter, for over two years now. He believes that this digital detox has significantly improved his mental clarity and decision-making abilities.In a chat session with IANS at the event, Sivakarthikeyan revealed that he had been maintaining a distance from social media, especially X (formerly Twitter) for over two years and it has helped him improve his career. Sivakarthikeyan said, “In the last two years, I've been using social media very less. If you want to use it, you use the internet.Sivakarthikeyan explained that constant exposure to social media can lead to unnecessary stress and self-doubt, especially when facing negative feedback or criticism. By distancing himself from these distractions, he has been able to focus on his craft and make more informed choices about his projects. ""I feel like if we come out of X, I have a very free mind space because no one is feeding their thoughts into my mind. When something goes wrong in my film, usually when we find one film flops or when one of our work doesn't go well, we will get confused and we will try to find where the answer is. At that time, I used to search my answers in social media and I was confused. I did different kinds of films without understanding what the film is, everything happened. Then suddenly one day I realized how it works, stick to the basics,"" he said.He drew a parallel between his approach to filmmaking and the strategies used by cricketers to overcome slumps. Just as cricketers often return to the basics to regain form, Sivakarthikeyan emphasizes the importance of sticking to fundamental principles in the film industry.Furthermore, the actor shared a personal anecdote about how the stage became a source of healing and solace during a difficult period in his life. Following the loss of his father during his college years, he found solace in performing and receiving the audience's appreciation. This experience underscored the power of live performance and the positive impact it can have on mental well-being. “I was depressed. I didn’t know what to do. To escape from the depression, from that sadness, I got onto the stage where clapping and appreciation was the therapy,” he said.","Tamil actor Sivakarthikeyan recently shared insights on the impact of social media on his mental health and career.

Tech millionaire Bryan Johnson , famed for his age-reversing experiments, recently connected with Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal at an exclusive event titled “Don’t Die.” The gathering, inspired by Johnson’s movement advocating longer, healthier, and happier lives, was hosted by Goyal at Soho House for an intimate audience of 50 select attendees. Sharing the experience on X (formerly Twitter), Johnson wrote, “Last night at Soho House with @deepigoyal, who built @zomato into one of the most successful companies in India.”For those unaware, Soho is an international private members’ club in Mumbai. “There were over 1,100 applications for 50 seats. Sad to miss so many of you. Thank you @akshaybd and @thetanmay for hosting,” he added, sharing images from the event.The event was also attended by a Mumbai-based doctor Rickson Pereira who wrote on X: “Had an enlightening Sunday evening listening to @bryan_johnson talk about his project ‘Blueprint’. “Blueprint” is his personal project where he aims to “not die” by implementing a rigorous daily routine that includes diet, exercise, sleep, and supplements. He works closely with a team of doctors and researchers to monitor his body’s biomarkers and adjust his routine for optimal health. I subscribe to his ideology of prioritising your health first. I have been following his work for over a year and I think he is doing an amazing job of generating data about what works for human body and what is required to be in peak physical health. Thank you @thetanmay for the invite.”Bryan Johnson’s anti-aging journey, part of his ambitious Project Blueprint , has involved controversial methods such as receiving blood transfusions from his teenage son—a ""young blood"" procedure not approved by the FDA—alongside a strict diet with Blueprint-branded supplements and regular gene therapy injections.In November this year, Johnson accepted facing a setback when a recent procedure reportedly caused severe swelling to his face. Sharing a post on Instagram, Johnson wrote that he injected a fat-derived extracellular matrix into his face as part of first therapy under a procedure called “Project Baby Face”. He said that immediately following the injections, his face began to blow up. “And then it got worse, and worse, and worse until I couldn’t even see. It was a severe allergic reaction,” he added.","Tech millionaire Bryan Johnson is famed for his age-reversing experiments.

‘Your death date’: This AI app claims can ‘predict’ when you will die,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/death-clock-ai-app-with-1-25-lakh-downloads-can-predict-date-of-your-death/articleshow/115885555.cms,"This is an AI-generated image



Death Clock gets 1.25 lakh downloads



How Death Clock predicts death

1)

Maintain a Healthy Weight

2) Regular Exercise

3)

Stop Smoking

4)

Balanced Diet

5)

Drink Less (or no) Alcohol

6) Good Sleep

7) Regular Check-ups

8) Manage Stress

9) Maintain Social Connections

10) Lifelong Learning

An Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered ‘Death Clock’ has captured attention for its ability to predict when an individual might die. Launched in July early this year, the app analyzes personal data such as age, height, weight, daily calorie intake, exercise levels, and more to predict the date. Developer Brent Franson says that the AI was trained on a dataset of more than 1,200 life expectancy studies with some 53 million participants. The results, he says, are a ‘pretty significant’ improvement on the standard life-table expectations.Despite its somewhat morbid concept—a ""fond farewell"" death-day card featuring the Grim Reaper—the app has gained traction in the Health and Fitness category. It is free to use, while you will need a subscription to show a clock counting down to my estimated death. According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, the app has around 1,25,000 downloads till date.“Have you ever asked yourself 'when will I die?', our advanced life expectancy calculator will accurately* predict your death date for you depending on where you live, how much you smoke and your lifestyle to show your own death clock countdown. To predict your death date, simply input your date of birth, sex, smoking habits, your BMI and the country you live in. If you don't know your BMI simply use the BMI calculator form,” the app reads.Death Clock predictions are based on extensive medical studies and health data, with AI providing personalized suggestions for a healthier lifestyle. The idea is to encourage individuals to take better care of their health, using the predictions as a framework for decision-making.As mentioned, the app offers personalised suggestions to users. Some of these include:Maintaining a healthy weight is vital to reduce the risk of developing diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.Get moving for at least 30 minutes a day. Regular physical activity reduces the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.Avoid smoking and second-hand smoke. These can lead to various types of cancer, heart disease, and lung diseases.Eating a balanced diet full of nutrient-rich fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains is critical. Avoid consuming too much processed foods, refined sugars, and unhealthy fats.Limit alcohol intake. While occasional social drinking is usually okay, heavy or prolonged drinking can lead to a number of health issues including liver disease, cardiovascular problems, and cancer.Try to get a good night's sleep. Quality sleep is important for overall health and well-being. It affects mood, memory, and healing processes.Regular screenings and medical check-ups can help detect problems early. This is especially important for conditions that don't always show noticeable symptoms, like high blood pressure or high cholesterol.Long-term stress can lead to a number of health issues. Practice stress management techniques like mindfulness, meditation, yoga, or other relaxation exercises.Relationships and social interactions are vital for mental health. Loneliness and social isolation can lead to depression and cognitive decline.Keep your mind active. Lifelong learning, reading, solving puzzles, or other brain-engaging activities can help to keep your mind sharp and potentially delay the onset of cognitive decline.While it’s important to note that these AI-driven tools aren’t guaranteed to provide exact dates, there are concerns about privacy and data security, as users must input sensitive information, which could be exploited by companies or malicious actors.","Artificial intelligence-powered ‘Death Clock’ has captured attention for its ability to predict when an individual might die.

Revisiting the 6 productivity tips that Elon Musk shared with employees of Tesla and Twitter: Walk out of meetings and more ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/revisiting-the-6-productivity-tips-that-elon-musk-shared-with-employees-of-tesla-and-twitter-walk-out-of-meetings-and-more-/articleshow/115875599.cms,"Excessive meetings are biggest drain on productivity

Walk out of a meeting if ...

Technical jargon is a Big No

Forget the chain of command

Don't forget common sense

Tesla and Spacex CEO Elon Musk , who is now one of the most influential people in the United States, post the election of Donald Trump , ""a few productivity recommendations"", which the employees need to follow to thrive in any of his firms. Known for his demanding work ethic, the billionaire has recently shared productivity tips with employees at both Tesla and Twitter.Just days after laying off 3,800 Twitter employees, Musk sent a company-wide email outlining his expectations for the remaining staff. Hardcore Work Ethic: Employees must be prepared to work long hours at high intensity. Exceptional Performance: Only exceptional performance will be tolerated.Those who don't agree to these terms by a specific deadline will receive three months of severance pay.Musk also shared an email giving suggestions on how to improve productivity . The same email is said to have been earlier shared with Tesla employees. Here are the tips:Excessive meetings are the blight of big companies and almost always get worse over time. Please get rid of all large meetings, unless you’re certain they are providing value to the whole audience, in which case keep them very short. Also get rid of frequent meetings, unless you are dealing with an extremely urgent matter. Meeting frequency should drop rapidly once the urgent matter is resolved.Walk out of a meeting or drop off a call as soon as it is obvious you aren’t adding value. It is not rude to leave, it is rude to make someone stay and waste their time.Don’t use acronyms or nonsense words for objects, software or processes at Tesla. In general, anything that requires an explanation inhibits communication. We don’t want people to have to memorize a glossary just to function at Tesla.Communication should travel via the shortest path necessary to get the job done, not through the “chain of command”. Any manager who attempts to enforce chain of command communication will soon find themselves working elsewhere. A major source of issues is poor communication between depts. The way to solve this is to allow free flow of information between all levels. If, in order to get something done between depts, an individual contributor has to talk to their manager, who talks to a director, who talks to a VP, who talks to another VP, who talks to a director, who talks to a manager, who talks to someone doing the actual work, then super dumb things will happen. It must be ok for people to talk directly and just make the right thing happen. A major source of issues is poor communication between depts.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has initiated an investigation into Google following allegations by online gaming company Winzo, marking a potential challenge to the tech giant's dominance in the app market. Winzo accuses Google of abusing its market power by restricting real-money gaming apps from being listed on the Play Store. According to the gaming company, this policy forces developers to resort to sideloading—direct app downloads from websites—which is considered less secure and limits consumer choice. Winzo argues that this restrictive practice hampers the accessibility of apps offering real-money games of skill, as these can only be downloaded through their website, creating unnecessary hurdles for developers and users alike.

PAN 2.0 features enhanced security, including a dynamic QR code designed to automatically detect duplicate PAN cards and identify incorrect information. This measure aims to simplify the detection of violations, such as individuals possessing multiple PAN cards or providing false PAN details, which can result in a penalty of Rs 10,000.Taxation experts highlight that the new system addresses fraud cases where fake PAN cards have been used for illegal activities like setting up fraudulent companies or committing GST and input tax credit fraud. Instances have emerged where original PAN holders were unaware of their credentials being misused. Taxpayers are advised to verify and deactivate any duplicate PAN cards issued under their name to prevent potential misuse. Click here to read the complete story.

Mulehunter.Ai is designed to detect and flag ""mule accounts""—bank accounts often exploited to launder illicit funds.

SEBI imposes 5-year ban on Anil Ambani

The Capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has ordered the attachment of bank accounts as well as shares and mutual fund holdings of Anil Ambani owned Reliance Big Entertainment . The attachment order is aimed to recover dues of Rs 26 crore. The fine is related to a case pertaining to illegal diversion of funds in the matter of Reliance Home Finance Ltd (RHFL).The order comes after SEBI on November 14 sent a notice to Reliance Big Entertainment Pvt Ltd (now known as Rbep Entertainment Pvt Ltd) and asked the entity to pay dues within 15 days. Reliance Big Entertainment has failed to pay the fine imposed on it by the markets watchdog.The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has ordered the attachment of bank, demat accounts and mutual fund folios of the entity to recover the pending dues. As per the notice, SEBI said that there is sufficient reason to believe that the defaulter may dispose of the bank accounts and securities in the Demat accounts or mutual fund folios and ""realisation of the amount due under the certificate would, in consequence, be delayed or obstructed"".As per the SEBI notice, dues of Rs 26 crore pending with Reliance Big Entertainment, include interest and recovery costs.Intensifying its crackdown on financial irregularities involving Anil Ambani and his associates, SEBI last week issued attachment notices to three entities – Adhar Project Management and Consultancy Pvt Ltd, Indian Agri Service Pvt Ltd, and Mohanbir Hi-Tech Build Pvt Ltd – to recover Rs 78 crore in illegally diverted funds from Reliance Home Finance (RHFL).In a related move, SEBI has imposed a five-year ban on Anil Ambani and 24 other entities, including former RHFL officials, for their involvement in the fund diversion scheme. This ban prohibits Anil Ambani from holding any position in the securities market, including as a director or key managerial personnel in listed companies or registered intermediaries.Additionally, RHFL has been barred from the securities market for six months and fined Rs 6 lakh. To prevent further financial losses, SEBI has directed banks, depositories, and mutual funds to restrict debit transactions from accounts associated with the entities involved in the scam.",Sebi has ordered the attachment of bank accounts as well as shares and mutual fund holdings of Anil Ambani owned Reliance Big Entertainment.

Outgoing US President Joe Biden granted a pardon to his son Hunter Biden on Sunday night, shielding him from potential imprisonment over federal felony charges related to gun possession and tax violations. Biden had previously stated that he would neither pardon his son nor commute his sentence following Hunter Biden's convictions in the Delaware and California cases.In May this year, Biden shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) where he said “No one is above the law.” In June, 2024, President Joe Biden ruled out the possibility of pardoning or commuting his son Hunter Biden’s sentence. Speaking to reporters during Hunter’s trial for a gun-related case in Delaware, Biden stated, “I abide by the jury decision. I will do that and I will not pardon him.”The incident sparked criticism from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. On December 2, 2024, Musk reshared the post adding a Community Notes annotation. The note criticized Biden’s decision to pardon his son, Hunter Biden, stating:“By pardoning his son Hunter, not merely for a single crime, but for all actual or potential crimes he may or may not have created over an eleven years period, Joe Biden has made clear that some people are, in fact, above the law.”The post is captioned “Community Notes slays”.Announcing the pardon, President Biden said, “Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter,” arguing that the prosecution was politically motivated and a “miscarriage of justice.”Explaining further, Biden said “The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election,” adding, “No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son.”“I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision,” he stated.","US President Joe Biden granted a pardon to his son Hunter Biden on Sunday night, shielding him from potential imprisonment.

Swiggy has expanded its 10-minute food delivery service, Bolt, to over 400 cities across India. Initially launched in October in major metropolitan areas like Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, New Delhi, Mumbai, and Pune, Bolt is now available in a wide range of locations, including emerging hubs and tier-2 and tier-3 cities.“Bolt is now active not only in emerging hubs such as Jaipur, Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Indore, Coimbatore and Kochi, but also in tier-2 and -3 cities such as Roorkee, Guntur, Warangal, Patna, Jagtial, Solan, Nashik, Shillong amongst others,” Swiggy said.According to a report by The Economic Times, the Bengaluru-based food delivery platform said that cities from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have witnessed the highest adoption for Bolt followed by Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Punjab.Several popular restaurant chains, including KFC, McDonald's, Burger King, Baskin Robbins, Starbucks, Chaayos, and Eatfit, have partnered with Swiggy to offer their menu items through Bolt.This expansion comes amidst growing competition in the rapid food delivery sector. Startups like Zepto are scaling up their quick commerce offerings (Cafe business), including food delivery from dark stores, while others like Swish are securing funding to expand their presence in major cities.Swiggy's competitor, Zomato, had previously experimented with 10-minute food delivery but discontinued the pilot program. Instead, Zomato launched Zomato Everyday, a service that delivers meals prepared by home cooks from centralized kitchens with relatively faster delivery times.At the time of launch earlier this year, Rohit Kapoor, Swiggy's head of food delivery, stated, “Ten years ago, Swiggy revolutionised food delivery by cutting average wait times to 30 minutes. Now we're reducing that wait even further for frequently ordered items.”Swiggy emphasised that its delivery partners will not face penalties or receive incentives based on Bolt order timings.","Swiggy has expanded its 10-minute food delivery service, Bolt, to over 400 cities across India.

"How Nokia’s failure in mobile phones is impacting its new business, company CEO says, “The big challenge is to…”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-nokias-failure-in-mobile-phones-is-impacting-its-new-business-company-ceo-says-the-big-challenge-is-to/articleshow/115876051.cms,"Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark

Why Nokia going beyond mobile and fixed networks to data centers

Nokia, once a powerhouse in the mobile phone market, has expanded its operations into the business-to-business (B2B) technology sector. According to the company CEO, despite the company’s ‘failure’ with the advent of smartphones, Nokia 's past dominance in the mobile phone market still resonates with people globally.“I meet people all the time when I travel in different parts of the world, asking what happened to the phones. They were obviously divested to Microsoft 10 years ago,” Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark told Bloomberg.“But when we are expanding to these new growth areas, it does help that people recognize the name Nokia. So that’s at least how you get to start the discussion,” he added.He explained that this brand recognition provides a valuable starting point for Nokia as it expands into new areas, particularly in the B2B technology sector but the challenge lies in repositioning Nokia as a trusted partner for critical networks and a leader in B2B technology.When asked why Nokia is now expanding beyond mobile and fixed networks into data centre technology space. As per Lundmark, one of Nokia's key growth areas is the data center market , a sector worth tens of billions of dollars.“We have currently defined about 20 billion euros ($21 billion) that’s addressable to us. The network operator market is 84 billion euros, roughly, but it’s not a growth market. Data center growth is around 30% per year. That’s why there is room for a player like us,” he said.Nokia sees a significant opportunity in this market, particularly with the increasing demands placed on data centers by AI and cloud technologies. The company aims to provide solutions that address the growing need for safety, reliability, and programmability in data centers.“We are now in the middle of the acquisition of Infinera, which will add about 3,000 specialists to Nokia. This is a Silicon Valley company that will further strengthen our offering to data centers. So this will be a key growth factor for us in the coming years,” he added.","Nokia has expanded its operations into the business-to-business (B2B) technology sector.

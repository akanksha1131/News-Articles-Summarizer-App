Merge Labs vs Neuralink





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced an investment in Merge Labs, a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup which was founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Rival to Elon Musk ’s Neuralink, the mission of Merge Labs is to develop safe and scaleable brain-computer interfaces. “We are excited to support and collaborate with Merge Labs as they turn an ambitious idea into reality and ultimately products that are useful for people,” said the company.OpenAI revealed that funding made by the company will support Merge Labs’ mission of creating safe, scalable brain-computer interfaces that could one day allow humans to interact with artificial intelligence directly through neural signals. The company has not yet disclosed the size of the investment, but the partnership underscores OpenAI’s growing interest in technologies that extend beyond software into hardware and human augmentation.Merge Labs is a research lab with the long-term mission of bridging biological and artificial intelligence to maximize human ability, agency, and experience. It is developing fundamentally new approaches⁠ (opens in a new window) to BCIs that are safe and interface with the brain at much higher bandwidth by combining biology, devices, and AI.The company is focused on creating non-invasive neural interfaces that can translate brain activity into digital commands. Unlike more invasive approaches that require surgical implants, Merge Labs aims to build consumer-ready devices that are both accessible and ethically designed.The company’s early prototypes reportedly use advanced sensors and machine learning models to interpret neural signals, with potential applications ranging from medical rehabilitation to enhanced productivity tools.Elon Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 and till now the company has made significant progress in developing brain implants which enable people with paralysis to control devices with the help of their thoughts. The Elon Musk-owned company recently raised $600 million at a $9 billion valuation and is conducting human trials.Merge Labs on the other hand, is reportedly working on less invasive brain interfaces with a strong emphasis on AI-powered enhancements. The focus of the startup is not just medical rehabilitation but broader human-AI integration.“I believe the merge has already started,” Altman wrote in a 2017 blog post. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants”.",Merge Labs is a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

Why is this quote from Michael Dell important



How people apply this idea today







Michael Dell is a well-known business leader who started Dell Technologies, which is one of the biggest computer companies in the world. He started his business while he was still in school and turned it into a global brand that makes computers, servers, data storage systems, and other tech products. Dell has talked and written about many parts of business over the years, such as leadership, strategy, and making decisions. One of the things he has said is,This sentence talks about a problem that a lot of people have, whether they are running a business, building a career, or just doing everyday things. The quote is about how it can be easy to pick a path or goal when it seems exciting or promising. But the hard part is when someone has to choose not to do other things.

Dell Technologies is now one of the biggest tech companies in the world, with millions of customers and operations in many countries. Michael Dell has also written about business strategy and taken part in talks about the future of technology, leadership, and innovation.""It's easy to decide what you're going to do,"" Michael Dell says. He is talking about something that many people find hard to do when they have to make a choice: deciding what not to do. It can be easy to make a list of things to do, goals, plans, or projects. Most people know what they like or what makes them happy. These are the things they want to do or get.The hard part is choosing what to leave out. In business, there are often many options, but you can't pay attention to all of them or have all the money.

This can make the work less good and slow down progress.In business, leaders often have to choose not to spend time or money on certain opportunities so they can focus on what they do best. Strategic thinking includes deciding what not to do. It helps teams stay on the same page and make the best use of their resources. Plans can get confusing and less useful if there aren't clear limits.When it comes to managing your time, energy, and commitments in your personal life, you have to make similar choices. Not doing some things can help you focus on the most important ones.When talking about planning and strategy, a lot of professionals and teams use this quote.

memory chip shortage

,”

“crisis”

“For an industry that has long been characterised by boom-and-bust cycles, this time is different. This is not just a cyclical shortage driven by a mismatch in supply and demand, but a potentially permanent, strategic reallocation of the world's silicon wafer capacity.”

How rising memory prices affect Apple, HP, Dell and others

“less conviction”

“the most exposed name in our coverage to secular pressures on PC margins and demand,”

“material impact”

“Over the next two years, the rise in the cost of memory components will be so much that it will even ding a company the size of Apple. The good news is that memory prices are cyclical, but there's so much scarcity in supply that I don't expect a reversion back in the other direction anytime soon.”

“They’re [Apple, HP, Dell and others] in a tough position. They basically have two options: They can take a hit to margins, which the market won’t like.

Or they can raise prices to offset the higher memory costs, running the risk of hurting demand.”

“So long as memory prices stay high, and we expect prices to stay high for a while given the AI demand, the market could continue punishing them,”





Investors in Apple , HP, Dell and other major hardware manufacturers may be worried about the rising memory prices. The increase in the cost of memory and storage components is reportedly putting pressure on hardware makers as higher expenses risk hurting margins and profits. The massive demand for memory has led to what IDC callswhich the analytics company sees as afor device makers, as a lack of supply drives sky-high chip prices. A report claims that this trend is unlikely to ease anytime soon.In a December 2025 report, IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo wrote,Memory can account for 10% to 20% of material costs in consumer-facing hardware like smartphones, according to Jeronimo. Last week, Hedgeye Risk Management said it hadin Apple as the memory issue became more worrying.The effects for PC makers are expected to be even worse. In November, HP's profit outlook missed expectations, and during its conference call, company executives estimated that higher memory costs would reduce its 2026 adjusted earnings per share by 30 cents.HP isGoldman Sachs analyst Katherine Murphy wrote in a note to clients earlier this week. She expects increased pricing actions to offset higher input costs, such as memory chips, to have aon PC purchases by lower-end consumers, where HP has more exposure than Dell, in the second half of 2026.The general estimate for HP's 2026 net earnings per share has been cut by 7.1% over the past month, according to Bloomberg data. Dell also noted the impact of rising memory prices in its results, though its estimates have held up better as the company's server business sees strong demand amid the AI buildout.Paul Meeks, managing director and head of technology research at Freedom Capital Markets told Bloomberg:According to a Bloomberg report, Apple shares rose just 8.6% in 2025, which was the company’s worst performance since 2022, and are down 4.2% to start this year, making them among the 20 weakest stocks in the Nasdaq 100 Index. Meanwhile, HP shares recently closed at their lowest level since November 2020 after losing nearly a third of their value in 2025 and dropping another 6.8% in the early days of 2026.On the other hand, Dell Technologies Inc. has fallen 26% since its October all-time high. More recently, Apple shares rose 0.1%, while HP shares fell 0.3%. Dell rose 1.7%, helped by TSMC results, which boosted gains in AI-related names.Rising memory prices may also be a risk for chipmakers that provide semiconductors for smartphones, as noted in recent downgrades of Qualcomm by Mizuho Securities and Arm Holdings Plc by Bank of America.Last week, results from Samsung Electronics Co. showed that average selling prices for dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM, chips jumped more than 30% from one quarter to the next. To compare, non-volatile flash memory, or NAND, chips rose about 20%. The higher prices, which are expected to continue throughout 2026, if not longer, helped Samsung's profits more than triple.In a statement to Bloomberg, Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital, which has $9.1 billion in assets and runs an exchange-traded fund dedicated to AI infrastructure, said,Thummel added. Among the group, he's only positive on Dell, as growth in its server business offsets the memory headwind.To compare, memory and storage companies have shot ahead in 2026, with Sandisk, Western Digital, Micron and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc building on their 2025 rallies. These companies have benefited from the price surge, becoming some of the market’s top-performing stocks over the past year. Sandisk is leading the S&P 500 to start the year, up about 75%, with Western Digital and Micron among the index's top 20 performers.",Rising memory prices may also be a risk for chipmakers that provide semiconductors for smartphones.

‘Venezuela-themed’ malware’s capabilities and targets





Cybersecurity researchers have claimed that China-linked hacking group has run an espionage campaign utilising the high-profile arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to target American government officials. The group, identified as Mustang Panda by cybersecurity firm Acronis, reportedly launched a series of “Venezuela-themed” phishing attacks just hours after the January operation in Venezuela. The report added that the hackers attempted to capitalise on the geopolitical chaos to infiltrate US policy-related entities.The report (via Reuters) says that the campaign was discovered after a suspicious zip file titled “US now deciding what’s next for Venezuela” was uploaded to a public malware analysis service on January 5. The malware contained within the file reportedly featured code and infrastructure that overlapped with previous Mustang Panda operations.""These guys were in haste,"" said Subhajeet Singha, a malware analyst with Acronis, while noting that the hackers’ speed led to a drop in quality compared to their typical efforts.According to the cybersecurity company, if successfully implanted, the malware will grant operators the ability to steal sensitive data from targeted computers, allow for long-term access to internal networks and monitor government communications.While the exact number of compromised systems is currently unclear, the targets are believed to be US government officials and policy analysts specialising in Latin American affairs.The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has previously identified Mustang Panda as a state-sponsored group funded by the China to develop spying software and penetrate foreign networks.Meanwhile, news agency Reuters says that a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington denied the allegations, stating that China “consistently opposes and legally combats all forms of hacking activities.” The embassy dismissed the report as “false information” spread for “political purposes”.","China-linked group identified as Mustang Panda reportedly launched a series of “Venezuela-themed” phishing attacks just hours after Maduro's arrest.

Australia social media ban: Companies deactivate nearly 5 million kids’ accounts in a month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/australia-social-media-ban-companies-deactivate-nearly-5-million-kids-accounts-in-a-month/articleshow/126550327.cms,"Australia Enforces World’s First Under-16 Social Media Ban, Sparks Global Debate| Global Pulse

Australia says law implementation is smooth

Why Australia banned social media for under-16s





Social media companies like YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat, X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, Threads and Facebook have collectively deactivated approximately 4.7 million accounts since Australia’s landmark ban on social media for minors came into force on December 10, a report has said.Citing figures released by the country’s eSafety Commissioner, news agency Reuters reported that the first official data suggests how global tech giants are responding to the world-first legislation on kids social media ban. It also implies that these platforms are moving to avoid massive fines of up to A$49.5 million ($33 million) for non-compliance.Meanwhile, the data of deactivated accounts in a month is said to be higher than estimates, suggesting more than two accounts for every Australian aged 10 to 16, based on population data. Previously, 550,000 underage accounts from its Instagram, Facebook and Threads were removed.eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant reportedly described the initial rollout as “smooth,” noting that public education campaigns and third-party age-assurance providers have helped in meeting new requirements.“It is clear that eSafety's regulatory guidance and engagement with platforms is already delivering significant outcomes,” Inman Grant said.However, she noted that some underage accounts likely remain active through various workarounds.“We will continue to monitor migration trends,” the Commissioner stated. While most platforms have vowed to comply, Reddit has taken a different path, suing the Australian government in an attempt to overturn the ban. The government has stated it will vigorously defend the law in court.The Australian government said that social media platforms have failed to safeguard children, despite years of voluntary safety commitments. Lawmakers also linked heavy social media consumption to rising rates of anxiety, depression, sleep deprivation and body dysmorphia among teenagers. The government also targeted “addictive” algorithmic designs, arguing that recommendation engines prioritise profit-driven engagement over the wellbeing of developing minds.","YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat, X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, Threads and Facebook have collectively deactivated approximately 4.7 million accounts since Australia’s landmark social media ban came into force on December 10.

"Quote of the day by Jensen Huang: “I very seldom fire people, I’d rather torture them to greatness”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/quote-of-the-day-by-jensen-huang-i-very-seldom-fire-people-id-rather-torture-them-to-greatness/articleshow/126489810.cms,"NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang

“I very seldom fire people, I’d rather torture them to greatness.”

NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's leadership philosophy on firing and performance



How NVIDIA’s work culture reflects Jensen Huang’s management style



Why Jensen Huang believes discomfort leads to growth



How employees and observers interpret the quote



What Jensen Huang’s quote really says about leadership







When NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang talks about leadership, he doesn’t reach for the usual corporate language. One of his more striking lines is,It sounds odd at first. A boss talking about “torture” rarely lands in polite conversation. But the meaning becomes clearer when you look at how Huang explains what he actually does with his teams. He doesn’t mean cruelty. He means pushing people to grow, learn, and reach a point they might not reach on their own. It’s a style of leadership rooted in belief rather than abandonment. Huang has said he prefers to help people improve instead of simply letting them go when things get tough. He frames this as a belief in potential, a view grounded in his own journey from humble beginnings to the helm of a global tech giant.This quote taps into a broader discussion happening in workplaces today about talent, resilience, and how leaders cultivate performance. Huang’s words are often described as tongue in cheek, yet they point to a real approach many executives wrestle with: should you cut losses and fire someone who’s struggling, or invest time and effort in helping them rise? In Huang’s view, that investment can pay off in unexpected ways.Huang has repeatedly said that firing is not his first instinct. He sees it as a last step, not an early one. In interviews, he has explained that when someone is underperforming, the more important question is why. Is the role wrong? Is the support missing? Is the feedback unclear? His response is usually to lean in, not step away.That approach has shaped NVIDIA’s internal culture. Expectations are high. Feedback is direct. People are expected to learn fast and adapt. Huang believes that struggling inside a demanding environment often teaches more than being comfortable in an easier one. His quote about “torture” reflects that belief. It is about sustained challenge, not humiliation or fear.He has also said that if he hires someone, it means he already believes in their potential. Walking away from that too easily would mean questioning his own judgment. So instead, he stays engaged and pushes for improvement.NVIDIA is widely known as a demanding place to work. Employees have described long hours, intense deadlines, and constant pressure to deliver. At the same time, many stay for years. Compensation, stock rewards, and the chance to work on cutting-edge technology all play a role.Huang’s leadership style is closely tied to that environment. He has said that meaningful work is rarely easy. Progress, especially in advanced computing and artificial intelligence, comes from sustained effort and repeated failure. Teams are expected to confront problems directly, not avoid them.This is where the quote often gets misunderstood. Huang is not celebrating burnout. He is describing a belief that growth happens under pressure, and that leaders should help people through that pressure instead of replacing them at the first sign of difficulty.Huang has spoken openly about discomfort being a teacher. He believes that moments of frustration often come right before breakthroughs. If leaders remove pressure too soon, they may also remove the chance for real learning.In his view, coaching is not about being gentle all the time. It is about being honest. That can mean telling someone their work is not good enough, then staying with them while they fix it. It can mean repeating feedback until it finally lands. That process is hard. For both sides.The phrase “torture them to greatness” sticks because it captures that tension. Growth is rarely smooth. It usually involves moments when quitting feels easier. Huang believes leaders should not make quitting the default option.Reactions to Huang’s words are mixed. Some admire the clarity. Others question whether this level of pressure works for everyone. That debate is common in tech, especially in companies growing as fast as NVIDIA has in recent years.What is clear is that Huang’s quote reflects how he actually operates. NVIDIA’s rise as a dominant force in AI and computing did not happen through cautious leadership. It came from aggressive goals, constant iteration, and teams pushed to deliver more than they thought possible.At its core, this quote is not about suffering. It is about commitment. Huang is saying that he would rather invest time, energy, and effort into developing people than discard them quickly. That choice comes with pressure, discomfort, and high expectations. But it also comes with trust.Not every leader works this way. Not every workplace should. But in Huang’s case, the words align closely with the results and the culture he has built. The quote stands out because it is unpolished, honest, and a little unsettling. Which is often how real leadership conversations sound when they are not filtered for comfort.","Jensen Huang, CEO of tech giant NVIDIA, said he would rather torture people than fire them.

Billionaire Mark Cuban has a ‘success tip’ for students





American billionaire investor Mark Cuban has now issued a stark warning for business leaders about the risks and opportunities of artificial intelligence. Along with this, Cuban has also cautioned that while AI can transform companies, its careless use could expose valuable intellectual property. Speaking during a call with Clipbook founder Adam Joseph, Cuban said that the growth of AI will lead to the creation of “two types of companies: those who are great at AI, and everybody else.” He believed that the companies failing to embrace AI are “doomed to failure” as the technology reshapes industries.Cuban further described AI as ‘stupid’ but likened it to a savant which ‘remembers everything’. He also emphasised that while AI tools can deliver immense benefits, but they are also prone to errors and overconfidence, making it critical for executives to understand the nuances between different platforms rather than trading them as interchangeable.As per Cuban, the misuse of AI could turn a powerful tool into a costly distraction.

How Google founders 'dumping' California 'looks similar' to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos leaving the city he called 'his home' for 30 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-founders-dumping-california-looks-similar-to-amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-leaving-the-city-he-called-his-home-for-30-years/articleshow/126498943.cms,"Jeff Bezos often points out that long-term success comes from staying committed to an idea while remaining open to changing the approach.

When Jeff Bezos left Seattle

What is California’s Billionaire's tax





It's almost official that Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have cut ties with California. The two Google Guys have reportedly said Bye to California; joining the billionaires who have left the state, shifting businesses and houses. Page is worth around $270 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. According to a report in Wall Street Journal, Larry Page has bought two massive Miami estates for a combined $173.4 million. The report quotes people familiar with the situation Google co-founder Sergey Brin is also said to be in discussions to purchase a Miami home, according to people familiar with the situation.Some analysts have termed Google founders' move to leave California strikingly similar to Jeff Bezos ’ relocation playbook. According to them, the timing, structure, and destination of Page’s escape from Silicon Valley make his Florida pivot look quite like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. But the big difference here is that Jeff Bezos did not leave California. Amazon founder left Seattle, the city where he started the online bookseller that grew into the global tech giant, Amazon.In 2024, Bezos announced on Instagram that he was leaving Seattle after nearly 30 years to move to Miami. He said that the move was to be closer to his parents and his rocket launches at Blue Origin. In his Instagram post, Bezos called Seattle his home since 1994.However, the timing, as some analysts pointed out, also suggested another reason: Taxes. In 2022 Washington state imposed a new, 7% capital gains tax on sales of stocks or bonds of more than $250,000. As Washington state does not have a personal income tax, so the new levy marked the first time that Bezos would face state taxes on his stock sales. As reported by CNBC, in 2022, when the Washington state's Capital gains tax took effect, Bezos stopped selling. He didn’t sell any Amazon stock in 2022 or 2023, gifting only $200 million of shares at the end of that year.After his move to Miami, Bezos reportedly made up for lost time. Quoting an SEC filing, the report says that Bezos launched a pre-scheduled stock-selling plan to unload 50 million shares before January 31, 2025. And since Florida has no state income tax or a tax on capital gains, so on the $2 billion sale that Bezos made, he saved $140 million that he would have paid to Washington state. On the entire sale of 50 million shares over the next year, he saved more than at least 600 million.California’s proposed ballot initiative has been proposed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West to offset federal budget cuts that will affect California’s health care system. It would impose a one-time, 5% tax on the assets of billionaires. The tax would retroactively apply to those who were California residents as of January 1, 2026. In December 2025, venture capitalist Peter Thiel announced that he opened an office for his family investment company in Miami. Donald Trump's AI czar David Sacks unveiled a new office for his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, in Austin, Texas.","Larry Page has bought two massive Miami estates for a combined $173.4 million.

Bill Gates and Melinda Gates divorce





Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever. According to a report in Forbes, the amount has surfaced in a tax filing. As per the report Bill Gates donation skyrocketed Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation's assets by more than 1,000% to about $7.4 billion in 2024. As the number went up from $604 million at the end of 2023 to $7.4 billion.The $7.88 billion donation was made in 2024 to the Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation, according to a newly released tax filing reviewed by the New York Times’ DealBook. Philanthropies Foundation focuses on women and families. The tax filing is said to mark the first time that concrete financial terms of the Gates’ 2021 divorce have been made public. Melinda Gates also manages some of her investments and charitable work through Pivotal Ventures, the investment company founded in 2015.Bill Gates and Melinda Gates announced their decision to formally separate their philanthropic work in 2024, three years after their divorce became public.In May 2024, Melinda French Gates said that she leaving the charitable foundation she co-founded with Bill Gates more than 20 years ago. Her last day at the foundation was June 7, 2024.""Under the terms of my agreement with Bill, in leaving the foundation, I will have an additional $12.5 billion to commit to my work on behalf of women and families,"" Melinda Gates said then in a post on social media platform X, without disclosing more details about her plans. Post her departure as co-chair, the foundation changed its name to Gates Foundation and with Bill Gates as its sole chairperson. It’s unclear where the additional $4.6 billion was allocated. The funds could have been given to French Gates’ LLC, Pivotal, which does not file a tax return, according to DealBook. As running alongside Pivotal Philanthropies is Pivotal Ventures, a LLC that does not require disclosure requirements that govern traditional nonprofits.""I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,"" Bill Gates wrote in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).In May 2021, Bill and Melinda French Gates announced their intention to divorce, saying they no longer believed they could “grow together”. Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board in 2020, months before the divorce was announced. The couple also reportedly agreed to the division of real estate valued at more than $170 million, an art collection worth roughly $130 million and a significant block of Microsoft stock.In March 2022, Melinda Gates claimed that Jeffrey Epstein played a role in ending their 27-year marriage. During an appearance on “CBS Mornings,” Melinda shared that she decided to leave her marriage “for many things,” including her ex-husband’s ties to Epstein. “I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” she said at the time, adding that she only met the late pedophile once because she “wanted to see who” he was.Melinda Gates has a net worth of $17.6 billion, as per Bloomberg Billioniare Index.

Investors have expressed concerns over substantial VR spending with slower-than-expected consumer adoption.

Meta investors raises concerns





Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse. Quoting people familiar with the development, a Bloomberg report says that the job cuts come as the company shifts priorities to build next-generation artificial intelligence (AI). It states that the latest job cuts may put breaks on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's long-chased vision of building virtual reality for the metaverse which started in 2014 with the acquisition of virtual reality start-up Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion. Another step in this direction came in 2021, when Facebook rebranded itself as Meta.Meta’s Reality Labs Division roughly has 15,000 employees. According to the Bloomberg report, Meta may announce the cuts to Reality Labs as soon as January 13, 2025. Sources told the publication that layoffs are said to disproportionately affect those in the metaverse unit who work on virtual reality (VR) headsets and a VR-based social network.As per a memo sent by the company to employees last week, Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, who also heads Reality Labs, has called for a ‘most important’ meeting on Wednesday - January 14, asking staff to attend in person.Last year, Zuckerberg asked top executives to make cuts to their 2026 budgets while he pours money into A.I. research. As Meta faces competition from companies like OpenAI and Google, Mr. Zuckerberg has increased the budget for TBD Lab, the skunk works unit at Meta that aims to build superintelligence, a godlike AI system.As reported by Bloomberg, the company also plans to reallocate some of the money from virtual reality products to increase the budget for its wearables division, which builds smart glasses and wristband computing devices.Despite the company spending tens of billions of dollars on developing virtual reality headset, the consumer response has been slower than expected. Investors have grown wary of Meta’s spending.In December last year, a company spokeswoman said Meta was “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward A.I. glasses,” and was not planning “any broader changes.”","Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse.

How Oracle is ‘promoting’ its new Nashville campus among its employees and why everyone may not be convinced,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-oracle-is-promoting-its-new-nashville-campus-among-its-employees-and-why-everyone-may-not-be-convinced/articleshow/126550264.cms,"“We're creating a world-leading cloud and AI hub in Nashville that is attracting top talent locally, regionally, and from across the country. We've seen great success recruiting engineering and technical positions locally and will continue to hire aggressively for the next several years.”

Why some Oracle employees may be hesitant about moving to Nashville

""world headquarters""

How Oracle is promoting Nashville among its employees

What Nashville officials said about Oracle building its new world headquarters

“encouraged by the progress made,”

“In an area lacking core infrastructure and building blocks for development, we are working closely with Oracle to support the construction of their campus, and they are sharing responsibility for building some of the needed infrastructure,”

“We've needed these IT jobs. We've always been underweighted in IT jobs.”





Oracle is aggressively hiring for its new world headquarters in Nashville, offering thousands of dollars in incentives to convince current employees to relocate. However, workers face concerns about lower pay bands, limited career growth, and a weaker local tech job market compared to Oracle's other major hubs. Senior Vice President Scott Twaddle stated that the company is “creating a world-leading cloud and AI hub” to attract top talent from across the country.In a statement to Bloomberg, Twaddle said:Oracle has been running hiring events for the new centre. But a common worry for employees considering a move is that Oracle has placed Nashville in a lower pay category than California or Seattle, meaning future salary increases may be likely limited, according to multiple workers who asked not to be identified, discussing private information.Moreover, a weaker local tech job market also makes some people hesitant about relocating.Additionally, many of the jobs in Nashville require five days a week in the office, which is a change for Oracle, where many positions are remote.This comes after Oracle founder and chairman Larry Ellison announced in 2024 that the company would build itsin Nashville. This announcement followed the software company's move from Redwood City, California, to Austin. Under a 2021 tax incentive deal, the company pledged to create 8,500 jobs in Nashville by 2031, with average salaries above six figures.However, Oracle has a long way to go to reach its hiring targets in Nashville. Currently, it has about 800 workers in Nashville offices, according to documents seen by Bloomberg. That's far fewer than the number of company employees in other locations, including Redwood City, Austin and Kansas City, the headquarters of health records company Cerner, which Oracle bought in 2022.Oracle's promotional materials highlight the lack of state income tax and the city's lively music scene to attract workers to Nashville. Some new employees say they moved because, in a difficult tech job market, the Tennessee city was the only place where Oracle offered them a job.To accommodate all of these workers, Oracle is planning a huge campus along the Cumberland River. It will have over 2 million square feet of office space, a new bridge across the river, and a branch of the expensive sushi restaurant chain Nobu, which has locations on many properties connected to Ellison, including the Hawaiian island of Lanai.The company's most important worker in Nashville is Clay Magouyrk, its longtime cloud infrastructure chief, who was promoted to become one of two chief executive officers in September 2025.Magouyrk, who went to high school and college in nearby Memphis, moved to Nashville in 2024. He relocated from Seattle, which is home to the largest Oracle Cloud centre, but has experienced job cuts and reductions in office space in recent years.Oracle hasn't given a timeline to finish the new campus, and for now, Magouyrk and other workers are working in a pair of towers in downtown Nashville.“We look forward to breaking ground on this dynamic campus, which will add more public green space along the riverfront and incorporate a new pedestrian bridge, creating greater community connectivity,” Oracle's Twaddle said. Nashville “will become our global headquarters,” he added.For a global company like Oracle, the exact meaning of “headquarters” can be a bit unclear. Austin remains the address listed on the company's SEC filings, and its executives are spread across the country. Meanwhile, the city where Oracle is hiring the most positions globally is Bengaluru. Still, Oracle is positioning Nashville to be at the centre of its future.“We're developing our Nashville location to stand alongside Austin, Redwood Shores, and Seattle as a major innovation hub. This is your chance to be part of it,” Oracle writes on its recruitment site.Local officials are working weekly with Oracle on the new Nashville site and aresaid Ben York, CEO of the city's East Bank Development Authority.York noted.In 2021, when Nashville made the tax incentive deal with Oracle, then-Mayor John Cooper said,After the agreement was reached, Oracle began donating more than $10,000 per year to the Tennessee Chamber of Commerce and in 2023, it gave $5,000 to Governor Bill Lee's inaugural committee, according to public records.","Oracle is aggressively hiring for its new world headquarters in Nashville.

Reportedly, the first data centres are currently under construction in Brandenburg, Germany and the company plans for further expansion across the EU. Similarly, Google announced investments of 5.5 billion euros ($6.41 billion) in German data centres last year.The primary driver for this new infrastructure is the US Cloud Act, which allows American authorities to request data from US-based companies even if that data is stored on foreign soil.The European AWS cloud will be monitored by a German subsidiary, and management as well as advisory boards will be staffed exclusively by EU citizens.

“Copilot combines information from multiple web sources into a single response with linked citations. It informs users they are interacting with an AI system and encourages them to review the sources.”





UK’s West Midlands police chief Craig Guildford has apologised to MPs for providing incorrect evidence about banning Maccabi Tel Aviv football fans. He apologised and revealed that the error was caused by a report generated by Microsoft's Copilot AI tool, rather than human research as previously claimed. In a recent email, Guildford told the Home Affairs Select Committee that the inclusion of a fictitious match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and West Ham in police intelligenceThe admission contradicts the chief constable's previous testimony to MPs that the police force did not use AI. He noted that the mistake regarding the West Ham match, which had never taken place and was created by the AI tool forThe police then used these details to deny Maccabi Tel Aviv fans entry to the game against Aston Villa last year.In his email to the Home Affairs Select Committee, Guildford said he wanted to give his ""profound apology"" for the error.the letter (as seen by Business Insider) read.The apology comes as Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood prepares to make a statement to MPs about the findings of a police inspection report. Recently, Mahmood told the UK Parliament that she had lost confidence in Guildford.The police report examined the decision to prevent Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending a UEFA Europa League match against Aston Villa in November 2025. This decision sparked widespread criticism that reached UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The fake West Ham match was among the information shown to the security group, which decided to ban away fans.According to the BBC, more than 700 police officers were sent to work at the game. Several protests happened outside the stadium.

Marc Benioff went from Hawaii to Larry Ellison ’s office, and quit

Marc Benioff shares ‘life lesson’ by Indian guru





Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently shared the idea that pushed him to start the company. While tech giants like Google, Apple and some others trace their origins to a garage, Benioff said his multi-billion dollar empire began in the Pacific Ocean while swimming with a pod of 100 dolphins off the coast of Hawaii. . In a newly surfaced interview with TBPN, Benioff recounted a 1999 “vision” led him to quit his high-ranking role at Oracle.""I pay attention to my dreams. I pay attention to my visions, my insights,” Benioff said.“Salesforce started because I was swimming with a pod of dolphins outside the coast of Hawaii, where I live. About 100 dolphins. I was one with the pod. And when I was one with the pod, all of a sudden in my mind, I saw this vision of what Salesforce could look like,” he explained.He explained that the ‘vision’ gave him the idea but he released that it required more than just intuition; it required capital. He said that he went to the office of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison who was his mentor and then-boss.“I went to Larry Ellison and said, 'Hey, I think I'm going to quit my job’. He gave me $2 million, and we started Salesforce. That was 26 years ago,” Benioff recalled.Last year, Benioff spoke about the idea of starting Salesforce, saying it goes back to the year 1996-97.He said that he was on a trip to India to meet his Guru Mata Amritanandamayi in Kerala.“I was with her, I was explaining my vision for Salesforce, which was a new technology model and a new business model. And she reminded me, of course, of the importance of giving back, it was very much in that spirit that we have built a different kind of company,” said Benioff.",Marc Benioff said his multi-billion dollar empire began in the Pacific Ocean while swimming with a pod of 100 dolphins off the coast of Hawaii.

McKinsey adds additional final round assessment during hiring process; asks graduates to use AI chatbot to evaluate ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mckinsey-adds-additional-final-round-assessment-during-hiring-process-asks-graduates-to-use-ai-chatbot-to-evaluate-/articleshow/126546163.cms,"In a groundbreaking shift, McKinsey & Company is transforming its recruitment process by utilizing AI chatbots during the final interviews. Graduate candidates now engage with Lilli, McKinsey's AI assistant, as they tackle real-world consulting challenges.

How the AI interview works

Why McKinsey is doing this





McKinsey & company, one of the world’s most prestigious management consultancy has revealed that it is adding a new twist to its recruitment process. The company is now asking the graduate applicants to collaborate with an AI chatbot during final-found interviews. According to a US-based career prep firm CaseBasix, candidates in the ‘select final rounds’ have been asked to complete practical consulting tasks with the help of McKinsey’s internal Ai tool Lilli. This new AI interview of the company works alongside its traditional assessments. The interview at McKinsey is done at three levels:* Case interview (problem solving and structured thinking)* Personal Experience Interview (PEI) (leadership, values, and impact)* AI interview (collaboration with AI in consulting tasks)McKinsey has not commented publicly on the rollout, which CaseBasix says is currently limited to parts of the United States.The CaseBasix report mentions that consultants are no longer evaluated only on how they analyze problems independently, but also on how they work with advanced tools responsibly.The AI interview allows McKinsey to observe whether candidates can:* Use AI to support structured thinking rather than bypass it* Apply judgment when AI outputs are incomplete or imperfect* Maintain ownership of decisions instead of deferring to technology* Communicate reasoning clearly in an AI supported workflowCandidates are expected to:* Prompt the AI with clear, focused questions.* Review its output for accuracy and relevance.* Iterate by refining prompts when responses fall short.* Synthesize insights into a structured recommendation.The emphasis is on judgment, reasoning, and communication, not technical AI expertise. CaseBasix noted that applicants are not expected to know advanced prompting techniques, but must show they can use AI as a “productive thinking partner” — similar to how consultants work with junior team members.The move reflects how consulting work is evolving as AI becomes embedded in everyday problem solving. McKinsey has invested heavily in AI platforms like Lilli, which support research and synthesis across engagements.CEO Bob Sternfels told the Harvard Business Review last year that the firm already operates with a “workforce” of 20,000 AI agents alongside 40,000 human staff.McKinsey was also an early adopter of Microsoft’s Copilot Studio, which enables autonomous AI agents to handle tasks such as client queries and sales leads.","McKinsey & Company is using AI chatbots during final interviews.

To address this bottleneck, Google is considering establishing data centers in proximity to power plants.

Colocation could be a solution

AI’s increasing energy demand





Michael Burry, the contrarian investor, recently urged President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance to accelerate a $1 trillion investment in nuclear energy and grid upgrades to keep pace with China.





Elon Musk , Tesla CEO, has argued that solar power will become civilization’s dominant energy source, pointing to its growing share of new electricity generation.









A senior Google executive has now raised an alarm over America’s ability to power the artificial intelligence boom. Marsden Hanna, Google’s Global Head of Sustainability and Climate Policy has warned that the US electrical grid is the single biggest obstacle to data centre expansion. As reported by Reuters, speaking at an American Enterprise Institute event, Hanna said that delays in connecting new data centers to the grid are stretching into years and even more than a decade in some regions.“Transmission barriers are the number one challenge we’re seeing on the grid,” Hanna said. “We had one utility who told us 12 years to study the interconnection timeline, which is sort of wild, but that’s what we’re seeing.”Hanna added that in order to cope with the bottlenecks, Google is experimenting with colocation. This means that the tech giant is working on building data centres directly next to power plants to bypass grid delays. Hanna also stressed that the long-term foal remains full grid integration, “That’s the strategy we’re pursuing with colocation and our hope is that these can eventually be grid-connected resources.The global electricity demand is said to increase by 30% till 2035 and this is mainly driven by the rapid growth of AI-powered data centers. Their share of total power consumption is expected to be more than double from 1.5% today to 3.5%. This surge as already prompted warnings from other prominent persons:","A senior Google executive has raised an alarm over America’s ability to power the artificial intelligence boom.

When Tesla quietly changed FSD definition





Elon Musk recently announced that Tesla will stop selling full self-driving software (FSD) software after February 14, 2026. Instead, it will be available as a monthly subscription. The announcement, according to a Business Insider report, may be linked to Musk’s $1 trillion compensation package. Approved by the Tesla board in November 2025, the package sets multiple targets for the Tesla CEO before he is paid $1 trillion. One such product goal, as per Tesla's proxy filing, is “10 Million Active FSD Subscriptions”.“One way Tesla can reach this milestone more quickly is to remove the option to buy FSD outright,” the report says, adding “By mid-February, anyone considering this option will need to subscribe instead.”The explanation behind the theory is that subscription services bring in more steady income. Investors generally prefer businesses that earn money continuously from subscriptions instead of those that depend on big, one-time purchases. Offering FSD only as a subscription would also give Tesla more room to change or adjust prices in the future.Last year, soon after the announcement of Elon Musk’s $1 trillion pay package, the electric car maker changed the definition of FSD on its website.The update then added the following line to the definition: “Currently enabled features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous”. It also added that the availability of features depends on regulatory approval and further development, which “may take longer in some jurisdictions. ”Notably, Tesla’s FSD program has faced legal scrutiny in recent months. A California judge last year allowed a class-action lawsuit to move forward, with plaintiffs accusing Tesla of making misleading claims about FSD’s capabilities.","Elon Musk recently announced that Tesla will stop selling full self-driving software (FSD) software after February 14, 2026.

Customers must meet security procedure standards.

Chinese reluctance to the Trump decision





US President Donald Trump has announced that his administration will now allow Nvidia’s H200 AI chips to be sold to China, but only under strict conditions including a 25% government cut on sales and export caps designed to protect US supply. For those unaware, H200 is part of Nvidia’s Hopper generation which is a hit-performance chip sold in the US and other global makers. Unlike the earlier H20 chip, which was specifically slowed down for export, the H200 is not a China-only design.Trump has acknowledged that the H200 has already surpassed by Nvidia’s newer Blackwell and Rubin chips, but said the US would still benefit financially, “It’s not the highest level, but it’s a pretty good level, and China wants them and other people want them — and we’re going to be making 25% on the sale of those chips, basically.”A Department of Commerce filing published Tuesday outlined requirements for the exports:Chipset major Nvidia has welcomed the decision of the Trump administration. The company claims that the decision of the US government balances competitiveness with national security. “Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America,” the company said.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently told reported at the Consumer Electronics Show 2026 that the demand from the Chinese customer is ‘very high’ and that Nvidia has also restarted the production of H200 chips. “We’ve fired up our supply chain, and H200s are flowing through the line,” Huang said.Despite approval from US, it is still unclear whether Chinese regulators will allow imports. Beijing has been pushing for domestic AI chip development, even if current offerings lag behind Nvidia’s technology.

“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work”

Who was Thomas Alva Edison



What this Thomas Edison quote means



“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.”

Why this quote still matters



How people relate to it today







People remember Thomas A. Edison as one of the most important inventors. He worked on a lot of ideas and had thousands of patents over the course of his life. Many of his inventions are now a part of daily life, like the electric light bulb and sound recording devices. But Edison was known for more than just what he made. People also knew how he thought about work, hard work, and success., is one of the most popular things he has said. Edison talks about a simple habit that a lot of people have. People often look for opportunities in things that seem fun, easy, or rewarding right away. It's easier to ignore something when it looks hard or requires a lot of work. Edison thought this was where a lot of people went wrong. He says that opportunities don't usually come in a polished or attractive way. Instead, it often comes in a quiet way that looks like work that needs to be done.Thomas Alva Edison was born in 1847 in the US. He was curious about how things worked from a young age. As he got older, this curiosity turned into a habit of trying new things and making old ones better. Edison worked on many projects at once and thought that progress came from working hard over and over again instead of getting quick results.Some of the most important things he invented were the electric light bulb, phonograph, and the motion picture camera. He also built labs where groups of people could work together on long-term experiments. Edison thought that being patient, testing things out, and working hard every day were all important parts of coming up with new ideas. A lot of historical records say that he saw innovation as a normal part of his job, not a flash of genius.Edison said,He was using a simple picture to explain a common reaction. Overalls are clothes that people wear to do physical or practical work. Edison used this picture to show that opportunities often seem normal and hard to get.A lot of people think that success will come quickly or with little work. They might want results right away, without having to learn, practice, or fail along the way. Edison said that real opportunities usually require work first and pay off later. Because of this, people sometimes miss out on chances that could have helped them grow.This idea is still important because it shows how people make choices every day. Students might not want to study subjects that need more practice. Workers might not want to do tasks that seem hard. People may put off their personal goals if they seem hard or uncertain. Edison's words remind readers that trying hard doesn't mean you've failed; it usually means that something important is possible.The quote tells people to think about work in a new way. Instead of viewing work as a hindrance, it proposes perceiving it as an integral component of the opportunity.This quote is often used in classrooms, offices, and talks about how to grow as a person. Teachers use it to show how important it is to be consistent. Employers share it to show that hard work pays off in the long run. People think about it when they are deciding whether or not to take on tasks that need a lot of patience.Edison's words still ring true because they describe a reality that many people know. At first, opportunities may not seem appealing, but those who are willing to put in the work often reap the benefits in the end.","Thomas Alva Edison was one of the most important inventors of the 20th century.

Chinese players can purchase Nvidia H200 under these ‘special circumstances’

Report says Nvidia asked for advance payment, company denies





Chinese customs authorities have reportedly instructed agents that Nvidia’s high-end H200 artificial intelligence chips are currently prohibited from entering the country, as the silicon trade war escalates between Washington and Beijing. Citing sources briefed on the matter, news agency Reuters reported that the directive was paired with high-level meetings earlier this week.“The wording from the officials is so severe that it is basically a ban for now, though this might change in the future should things evolve,” one source told Reuters. The move comes despite recent conditional approval from the Trump administration for the chips to be exported to China. Domestic tech giants have already been warned against purchasing the processors unless absolutely necessary.The H200 is Nvidia’s second-most powerful AI chip, and is claimed to offer roughly six times the performance of the previously restricted H20 model. As per reports, the demand of Nvidia chips is high with orders for over two million units at $27,000 each.Reports have indicated that the Chinese government may approve H200 purchases under “special circumstances,” such as research and development partnerships at universities.However, using Nvidia chips for military application purposes is completely banned.“Beijing believes the US is desperate to sell AI chips to China. They believe China has the leverage to extract concessions from the U.S. in exchange for license approvals,"" said Chris McGuire, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.Recently, a report in Reuters also claimed that Nvidia has set strict advance payment requirements for Chinese companies buying H200 Al chips, including a full payment upfront. This is purportedly due to the uncertainty on whether Chinese regulators would greenlight the shipments.However, in a statement Nvidia denied the claims, saying that it does not require upfront payment for H200 chips.

Paramount files lawsuit against Warner Bros as company ‘favours’ Netflix offer





Netflix is reportedly preparing an all-cash offer to acquire Warner Bros Discovery’s (WBD) film studios and streaming operations. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, these changes are aimed at accelerating a sale that has faced opposition from competing bidders and politicians. The move comes after Warner Bros. Discovery shrugged off a number of bids from Paramount.The Reuters report cited sources to claim that Netflix’s all-cash deal aims to finalise an agreement that may still take months to close.While Netflix's deal came to $82.7 billion and bundled both Warner Bros' film arm and its streaming unit with a mix of cash and stock, Paramount's was $108.4 billion purely in cash for the whole company, even covering its cable TV operations.Still, Warner Bros has preferred Netflix's deal despite amendments to Paramount's bid, including a $40 billion equity backing by Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who is also the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison.Warner Bros' board has argued that Paramount's offer depends on significant debt financing, which increases the risk of completing the deal, and that the offerParamount and Netflix have been in an intense competition to acquire Warner Bros, its valuable movie and television studios, and its massive content library.Warner Bros’ popular entertainment properties includeand the DC Comics universe, as well as highly valued classic films such asandThe bidding war has become Hollywood's most closely watched takeover battle, as studios navigate an industry increasingly controlled by streaming services and unpredictable box-office earnings, the Reuters report added.Meanwhile, US lawmakers from both parties have also expressed concern that further media consolidation could raise prices and give consumers fewer choices.Earlier this week, Paramount sued Warner Bros for more information on its deal with Netflix and said it planned to nominate directors to Warner Bros' board.Paramount has argued that the company's all-cash bid of $30 per share for all of Warner Bros is better than Netflix's cash-and-stock offer of $27.75 per share for the studios and streaming assets and will more easily pass regulatory approval.Meanwhile, Netflix has agreed to a $5.8 billion termination fee if it cannot get regulatory approval.

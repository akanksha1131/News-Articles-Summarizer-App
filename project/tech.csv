Indonesia's antitrust agency has announced that Google has been ordered to pay a fine of 202 billion rupiah ($12.37 million) for engaging in unfair business practices through its payment system services on the Google Play Store.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the investigation, launched in 2022, examined allegations that Google had abused its dominant market position by requiring Indonesian app developers to use Google Pay Billing .This system allegedly charged higher rates than other available payment options, with developers facing removal from the Play Store if they did not comply.Google has previously defended its practices, stating that it had implemented a system allowing developers to offer users an alternative billing option. However, the Indonesian regulator determined that the company's actions amounted to anticompetitive behavior, leading to the significant penalty.Google has faced multiple fines, including a €2.4 billion fine from India, the European Union and a large fine from Russia.The Competition Commission of India (CCI) fined Google Rs 1,337.76 crore for anti-competitive practices related to Android devices. The CCI imposed the penalty on October 20, 2022. Google paid the entire penalty. The CCI also imposed a penalty of Rs 936.44 crore on Google for abusing its dominant position with respect to its Play Store policies.In 2017, Google was fined 2.4 billion pounds (about Rs 26,172 crore) for abusing its market dominance by unfairly penalising a price comparison website, Foundem. Google was also ordered to pay to a UK couple named Shivaun and Adam Raff. The couple won a 15-year legal battle after Google pushed their price comparison website Foundem down in search results.Russia fined Google a large sum that's been described as “more than Earth's entire wealth”, acknowledging the fine’s symbolic significance.","Indonesia's antitrust agency has announced that Google has been ordered to pay a fine of 202 billion rupiah ($12.37 million) The investigation, launched in 2022, examined allegations that Google had abused its dominant market position.

"'Nothing is changing...', Facebook-parent Meta on fact-checking strategy globally",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nothing-is-changing-facebook-parent-meta-on-fact-checking-strategy-globally/articleshow/117433180.cms,"Meta ends fact-checking partnerships ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration

Facebook-parent company Meta will continue employing third-party fact-checkers outside the US “for now,” even as it phases out the practice domestically, a senior executive from the company has said. In the US, Meta plans to replace its third-party fact-checking efforts with a community-driven “notes system.”Nicola Mendelsohn, Meta’s head of global business, made the announcement during an interview with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos, saying that the company intends to evaluate the effectiveness of this change domestically before considering whether to implement similar shifts in other regions.“We’ll see how that goes as we move it out over the year,” Mendelsohn was quoted as saying.“So nothing [is] changing in the rest of the world at the moment, we are still working with those fact checkers around the world,” she added.The move aligns with CEO Mark Zuckerberg ’s recent remarks – which came days ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration – on scaling back the nearly decade-old fact-checking program, originally established to combat viral hoaxes on the platform.Zuckerberg cited “too many mistakes” and complaints of unfair censorship as reasons for the shift. He even accused former COO Sheryl Sandberg for the ""culture"" in Facebook in a meeting with Trump's advisor Stephen Miller.As per a report in New York Times Zuckerberg blamed Sandberg for Facebook's inclusivity initiative, which saw employees embrace self-expression in the workplace. He also hinted that the new guidelines and layoffs will be initiated to “reset the company.”However, he acknowledged that applying this approach internationally would face additional challenges due to stricter regulatory environments, such as the European Union’s Digital Services Act . The Act mandates large platforms to actively combat deceptive political content and misinformation, with noncompliance risking significant penalties.","Facebook-parent company Meta will continue employing third-party fact-checkers outside the US “for now,” even as it phases out the practice domestically.

Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia has defended the decision to allocate spectrum for satellite services, instead of auctioning it off, saying that he wants users to have as many choices as possible.“My job as telecoms minister is to make sure that you have as many choices as possible,” Scindia told news agency Reuters during an interview. Allocating the spectrum instead of auctioning aligns with the global trend.An administrative allocation has been met with opposition from Reliance Jio , which had advocated for an auction process. Led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, the telco had expressed concerns that an administrative allocation would favor foreign players like Elon Musk's Starlink , potentially eroding its market share.Scindia, however, acknowledged the dynamic nature of technology, emphasizing the need for companies to continuously adapt and evolve.“Technology is never constant,” Scindia said in a reply when asked if there was merit in Reliance's concerns, adding that companies need to keep evolving.He noted that satellite-based services require a clear line of sight to the sky, rendering them unsuitable for indoor use, unlike terrestrial networks.India's telecom market, with over 942 million users, is a highly competitive landscape with Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, and Vodafone Idea vying for the largest market share.India’s satellite broadband market is projected to reach $1.9 billion by 2030, according to Deloitte, making it an attractive market for players like Starlink, Amazon Kuiper, and other global players.As per Scindia, the Starlink and Amazon Kuiper's applications for a licence to launch satellite broadband services in the country are under review.","Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia has defended the decision to allocate spectrum for satellite services, instead of auctioning it off.

""We were very careful about keeping their performances.

""Adrien and Felicity's performances are completely their own,"" Corbet said. ""Innovative Respeecher technology was used in Hungarian language dialogue editing only, specifically to refine certain vowels and letters for accuracy. No English language was changed.""The film, made on a $10 million budget, follows Hungarian-Jewish architect László Tóth (Brody) as he rebuilds his life in post-World War II America .

""We wanted to perfect it so that not even locals will spot any difference.""The revelation comes amid growing concern over AI use in filmmaking. However, Jancsó defended the decision: ""It is controversial in the industry to talk about AI, but it shouldn't be. There's nothing in the film using AI that hasn't been done before. It just makes the process a lot faster.""Corbet also clarified reports about AI-generated architectural drawings in the film's finale: ""Judy Becker and her team did not use AI to create or render any of the buildings.

US President Donald Trump revokes Biden's AI safety order: What the original order said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-president-donald-trump-revokes-bidens-ai-safety-order-what-the-original-order-said/articleshow/117429011.cms,"What Biden’s AI order said



US President Donald Trump has revoked an executive order related to artificial intelligence (AI) passed by Joe Biden in 2023. Aimed at mitigating risks associated with AI, including threats to consumers, workers, and national security, the order mandated developers to conduct and share safety test results with the US government before releasing systems deemed potentially harmful to national security, the economy, or public health, under the guidelines of the Defense Production Act. In 2024, the Republican Party platform pledged to repeal the order, arguing that it stifles AI innovation and emphasised that “Republicans support AI development grounded in free speech and the promotion of human flourishing.”Trump began his first full day in office on January 21, following an inauguration that set a fundraising record of over $250 million. Shortly after taking the oath, he also signed executive orders addressing immigration, environmental policies, and government operations.The order also instructed agencies to establish standards for AI safety testing and address associated risks, including chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and cybersecurity threats. Biden introduced the order as US lawmakers struggled to pass legislation to regulate AI development.Generative AI, which can produce text, images, and videos in response to prompts, has generated both excitement and concerns, particularly over its potential to displace jobs or cause other negative impacts.Last week, the US Commerce Department imposed new restrictions on AI chip and technology exports, facing criticism from industry leaders, including Nvidia.Separately, Biden issued another executive order last week to support the growing energy demands of advanced AI data centres. This order proposed the leasing of federal sites managed by the Defense and Energy departments. However, Trump has yet to repeal this order.Apart from this, Trump has also issued orders freezing government hiring and mandating federal employees return to full-time, in-person work. This move has sparked opposition from unions representing public sector workers.","US President Donald Trump has revoked an executive order related to artificial intelligence.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Elon Musk Dances Up A Storm At Trump’s Big Event; Salute Gesture Causes A Storm | 'Nazi' Salute?

Donald Trump returned as the 47th President of the United States of America on Monday, January 20. Trump said in his inaugural address that under his administration “our sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced."" “From this moment on,” he added, ""America’s decline is over.”Trump started the day with a prayer service at St. John’s Episcopal Church. The Church service at St. John’s in Washington is a tradition for presidential inaugurations. He and his wife, Melania, were later greeted at the North Portico of the executive mansion by outgoing President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden for the customary tea and coffee reception.The biggest American tech leaders Facebook parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla and Starlink CEO Elon Musk too were seen at the Church services. Interestingly, the CEOs of America's biggest technology companies sat together, almost next to the Trump family.In one of the pictures Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla CEO are spotted looking at their smartphones.Little surprising for Google CEO to be using Pixel 9 series smartphone; but it seems Elon Musk has made peace with Apple teaming up with ChatGPT maker. The Tesla CEO was quite upset with the partnership between Apple and ChatGPT creator OpenAI. In a post to X, formerly Twitter, the Tesla CEO said he would ban Apple (AAPL) devices at his companies — which include SpaceX and X, among others — if the iPhone maker went ahead with its AI plans.If Apple “integrates OpenAI at the (operating system) level,” Musk said that would constitute “an unacceptable security violation.” He added that visitors “will have to check their Apple devices at the door, where they will be stored in a Faraday cage”. “Apple has no clue what’s actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI,” Musk said in a separate post. “They’re selling you down the river.”","Donald Trump returned as the 47th President of the United States of America on Monday, January 20.

Poll Do You Agree with the Sharks' Comments on YouTube Channel Shutdown? No, Their Remarks Were Unnecessary Yes, It Was Constructive Feedback

Gaurav Taneja , the popular YouTuber and fitness influencer known as Flying Beast recently appeared on the Shark Tank India Season 4 pitching his supplements brand, BeastLife . Taneja valued his company at Rs 100 crore and sought Rs 1 crore for a 1% stake. He pitched the brand’s success, claiming to earn a revenue of Rs 1 crore within the first hour of its launch. However, the Sharks were skeptical of the YouTuber’s dual-focus strategy, questioning its long-term sustainability and potential for growth.In a candid LinkedIn post after the episode aired, Taneja shared his reflections on the experience. “Shut down YouTube and go all in on one business. That’s the advice I got from some Sharks on Shark Tank India,” he wrote in the post. He further revealed that during the pitch, one of the sharks questioned him whether he will continue making videos for YouTube. To which he replied with a confident ‘Yes’.“He didn’t seem too happy with my response and remarked, 'Aap ka focus nahi hoga, aap waha se paise bana loge.'” he stated. “But to me, that felt like a risky move — one that could hurt more than help,” he added.Anupam Mittal questions Gaurav Taneja’s business modelIn the episode, now airing on SonyLIV, one of the sharks – Anupam Mittal can be seen questioning the social media influencer. He said “When I started, I was a lot like you. I thought of myself as a star, but when you think of yourself as a star, you think you’re infallible.”“You can’t allocate time in startups, you have to be there all the time. It’s not that I don’t trust you, but I trust in Indian entrepreneurship. They won’t let a part-timer like you win,” he further remarked.Gaurav Taneja raises doubts on Shark TankIn another LinkedIn post, Taneja alleged the diminishing impact of Shark Tank. He wrote: “We recently took BeastLife to Shark Tank India and it was a fantastic experience! Many tout the show as a tremendous branding tool—even if you don’t secure a deal, the exposure is priceless.Naturally, we anticipated a huge spike in website traffic, given the strong brand value and massive audience Shark Tank has built over four seasons. But here’s what the numbers revealed:🔹 Traffic on Rosier Foods launch day: 𝟰𝟬𝟴𝗞🔹 Traffic on BeastLife launch day: 𝟮𝟯𝟴𝗞🔹 Traffic on and after hashtag#SharkTank release day: 𝟮𝟮𝗞Surprisingly, the traffic from Shark Tank was even lower than the push from our own Instagram Stories!This raises an important question: Has the impact of Shark Tank diminished? Here are some possible reasons we considered:1️⃣ Shark Tank India might be losing popularity2️⃣ The show may gain traction once episodes are uploaded to YouTube (making it free to watch for a larger audience)3️⃣ Skipping a TV broadcast for Season 4 was a strategic misstepWhat do you think? Has the allure of Shark Tank waned, or is it just a matter of timing and platform shifts?”.","Gaurav Taneja, the popular YouTuber and fitness influencer known as Flying Beast, recently appeared on the Shark Tank India Season 4 pitching his supplements brand, BeastLife.

Apple is reportedly gearing up to unveil its next-generation iPad Air lineup, featuring the powerful M3 chip . According to a leak by well-known leaker Evan Blass, the upcoming iPad Air models will include both the familiar 11-inch and 13-inch screen sizes, powered by the M3 chipset.The M3 chip, while not Apple's top-of-the-line chipset (reserved for the iPad Pro's M4), represents a significant upgrade from the previous M2 chip used in the last iPad Air models. This update promises to boost performance by up to 15%, making it a solid choice for users seeking a more powerful tablet for everyday tasks, multitasking, video editing, and gaming.Despite the internal upgrade, the new iPad Air models are expected to maintain the same sleek and thin profile that has become synonymous with the iPad Air line.

These enhancements would provide smoother scrolling and better overall network performance, making the new iPad Air an attractive option for users.Apple is expected to announce these new iPad Air models by March or April 2025, with production starting in Q2 and a targeted launch in Q3 2025.","Apple expected to unveil new iPad Air models by March or April 2025.

The executive order, signed on January 21, 2025, delays the implementation of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which took effect on January 19.The law, passed by Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden, aimed to prohibit the distribution and updating of TikTok due to concerns that the Chinese government could exploit the app to spy on Americans or covertly influence US public opinion through data collection and content manipulation. TikTok had shut down in the United States late Saturday as the deadline passed, leaving millions of dismayed users barred from the app.Trump, who had promised to move quickly to save TikTok from the ban, stated, ""I guess I have a warm spot for TikTok that I didn't have originally, but I went on TikTok and I won young people,"" crediting the app for delivering him the youth vote in his election.Under the executive order, the attorney general must issue guidance implementing the pause and send letters to service providers confirming they won't face liability for continuing to host or update TikTok during this period.

Walmart gets 'complaint letter' on Dunzo founder Kabeer Biswas' appointment as Flipkart Minutes head,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/walmart-gets-complaint-letter-on-dunzo-founder-kabeer-biswas-appointment-as-flipkart-minutes-head/articleshow/117418218.cms,"Dunzo's dive down the hill

US-based retail giant Walmart is reportedly looking into the appointment of Dunzo CEO and co-founder Kabeer Biswas as the head of its Indian subsidiary Flipkart’s quick-commerce segment, Flipkart Minutes . According to a report in The Morning Context, the scrutiny comes after some former employees of Dunzo sent an email to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon and Flipkart CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy, among others. Biswas, who co-founded Dunzo in 2014, recently joined Walmart-owned Flipkart to head its recently launched quick commerce division, Flipkart Minutes.The Morning Context claims to have seen the email to this effect, sent by the Walmart's investigation team to some former employees of Dunzo. The email to Walmart and Flipkart CEO sent by Dunzo’s former employees express concern about the company “hiring a person with…criminal background”.Once a rising star in grocery delivery, Bengaluru-based hyperlocal delivery company Dunzo has been struggling since over a year now. Its cash burn to scale operations, coupled with an inability to raise additional equity, led to significant downsizing. The startup resorted to multiple rounds of layoffs as it struggled to raise funds to sustain operations.The company now faces complaints from ex-employees demanding unpaid dues. An Inc42 report recently claimed Biswas is dealing with legal challenges from vendors and employees after moving to Flipkart Minutes. Dunzo’s creditors have taken the company to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) over unpaid dues. Earlier this month, some employees filed a police complaint against Biswas at Indiranagar Police Station, Bengaluru.Despite raising over $450 million, including $200 million from Reliance Retail in January 2022, Dunzo struggled to maintain its market position. Reliance’s $200-million bet on Dunzo in early 2022 was intended to bolster its quick commerce ambitions, but the partnership struggled to deliver returns. The startup has been trying to find a buyer for the company for several months.A potential investment from fintech PhonePe in Dunzo's merchant network business failed to materialise, with the deal’s collapse partly attributed to concerns from other investors about PhonePe's Walmart backing. Similarly, Flipkart’s offer to acquire the company hit a wall when investors opposed selling the Dunzo brand. Even Reliance Retail, which held a 26% stake in Dunzo, remained reluctant to infuse additional capital.","Walmart is reportedly looking into the appointment of Dunzo CEO and co-founder Kabeer Biswas as the head of its Indian subsidiary Flipkart’s quick-commerce segment.

Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram has entered the ongoing debate on work hours, lending his support to Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy and L&T Chairperson SN Subrahmanyan . The discussion was sparked by their recent remarks advocating longer work hours as a means of enhancing productivity in India. While their statements have been polarizing, Chidambaram provides a nuanced perspective, emphasizing the importance of context and intent behind these remarks. He argues that the call for extended work hours is aimed at inspiring India’s aspirational youth to adopt a mindset conducive to national growth and prosperity.In October 2023, Narayana Murthy proposed that young Indians should work 70 hours a week, citing India’s low productivity compared to global standards. He urged the youth to adopt a mindset of hard work, stating, “This is my country; I want to work 70 hours a week.” Meanwhile, SN Subrahmanyan suggested a 90-hour workweek for his employees, expressing regret about not being able to include Sundays in the work schedule. While their statements sparked widespread debate, Chidambaram sees them as calls to action rather than mandates for all.Chidambaram provided historical insights, referencing the evolution of the eight-hour workday, which was first legislated in Germany in 1918. He noted that this norm primarily applies to industrial and desk workers performing repetitive tasks. However, many professions, such as farming, law, medicine, and scientific research, often exceed these traditional hours. Chidambaram emphasized that the discussion about work hours must consider the nature of work and its broader goals.The former finance minister also pointed out the transformative role of technology in shaping work norms. He highlighted how advancements in automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence could lead to shorter working hours without compromising productivity. Chidambaram believes that these innovations can redefine how work is structured, creating a balance between efficiency and individual well-being.Sharing his own experience, Chidambaram stated that his long working hours encompass diverse activities, including practising law, parliamentary responsibilities, writing, and public engagement. He emphasized that work-life balance is a personal discovery and expressed satisfaction with his own approach to managing it.Chidambaram interpreted Murthy and Subrahmanyan’s remarks as an effort to encourage cultural change. He believes their statements are not targeted at workers in repetitive roles but at the younger generation striving to build a prosperous nation. According to him, long hours of productive work are essential for transforming India from a developing country into a globally competitive economy.Chidambaram concluded that the controversy surrounding these remarks might serve a constructive purpose by provoking thought and discussion on productivity and work-life balance. He dismissed the notion that the comments were controversial, instead framing them as an opportunity for individuals to reassess their approach to work and national progress.","Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram has entered the ongoing debate on work hours. He has lent his support to Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy and L&T Chairperson SN Subrahmanyan. The discussion was sparked by their recent remarks advocating longer work hours as a means of enhancing productivity in India. While their statements have been polarizing, Chid Ambaram provides a nuanced perspective.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117428059,imgsize-22252,width-400,resizemode-4/117428059.jpg"

Here's the memo titled 'Return to In-person Work'

Heads of all departments and agencies in the executive branch of Government shall, as soon as practicable, take all necessary steps to terminate remote work arrangements and require employees to return to work in-person at their respective duty stations on a full-time basis, provided that the department and agency heads shall make exemptions they deem necessary.

This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law.

Companies that have ended work from home

US President Donald Trump begins his first full day in office Tuesday, January 21. Trump took over as 47th US President in an Inauguration ceremony that set fundraising record of $250 million and counting. Just hours after takin oath, Trump signed several executive orders on everything from immigration to the environment and culture wars.Donald Trump signed orders freezing government hiring as well as an order requiring federal workers to immediately return to full-time in-person work. In a memo, Trump asked federal workers return to the office full-time. The language in the statement is said to underscore the challenges that the new Trump administration is likely to face, given the strong opposition to ending remote work by unions representing public sector workers.Amazon, JP Morgan, Disney, Dell, Zoom, IBM< Tesla, Snapchat, Uber, Twitter, Starbucks and Walmart are among the private companies that have ended work from home completely in the US. Most of these companies have seen resentment from some employees over the return to office mandate.A memo from JPMorgan's operating committee stated that over half of its 316,000 global employees already work in the office full-time, and that ""Now is the right time to solidify our full-time in-office approach"" . ""We think it is the best way to run the company,"" the executives wrote in the memo. Despite this justification, some JPMorgan staff expressed their displeasure with the directive on the company's intranet, citing concerns about increased commuting and childcare costs, as well as mental health and stress. Reportedly, the comment page was locked after more than 300 comments were posted within the first hour.","US President Donald Trump asks federal workers return to the office full-time.

Elon Musk, the visionary entrepreneur behind Tesla, SpaceX, and numerous other groundbreaking ventures, has often been a subject of fascination for his incredible work ethic and unrelenting ambition. During a TEDx talk, Justine Musk , Elon Musk 's ex-wife and the mother of his five children, shared profound insights into the personal philosophy that has driven his success. Drawing from her years of being close to him, she highlighted how the power of setting boundaries and saying ""no"" played a pivotal role in shaping his achievements.According to Justine Musk, Elon Musk’s ability to say ""no"" was central to his success. She emphasized that this practice allowed him to guard his time and energy, which are critical resources for any entrepreneur. By saying ""no"" to distractions and activities that did not align with his goals, Musk was able to focus entirely on his ambitious pursuits.In her talk, Justine presented an enlightening concept: ""Behind every no is a deeper yes."" This philosophy underscores the importance of prioritizing what truly matters and rejecting anything that detracts from those priorities. For Elon Musk, this deeper ""yes"" meant dedicating himself wholly to transformative projects like electric vehicles, space exploration, and clean energy solutions. Justine noted that this principle of intentionality reshaped her own understanding of boundaries, focus, and self-worth.Justine Musk reflected on how children naturally assert their autonomy by saying ""no,"" but as people grow older, societal pressures often suppress this instinct. She argued that reclaiming the power of ""no"" is essential for achieving clarity and living a life aligned with one's intentions. This, she said, is a lesson many could learn from Elon Musk, who remains steadfast in his commitment to his priorities despite external demands.","Elon Musk’s ability to say ""no"" was central to his success, according to his ex- wife.

In the post, the user wrote “The salute hoax is just another part of the “dirty tricks campaign”,” sharing an old post of Musk where he said:“In the past I voted Democrat, because they were (mostly) the kindness party. But they have become the party of division & hate, so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican. Now, watch their dirty tricks campaign against me unfold …”.The video in question has also been shared by Musk with the caption “My talk today at the Presidential Parade”.

What is the new code of conduct and what EU said about it



""In Europe there is no place for illegal hate, either offline or online. I welcome the stakeholders' commitment to a strengthened Code of conduct under the

Digital Services Act

(DSA).”

Major tech companies including Meta 's Facebook , Elon Musk's X (earlier Twitter), Google's YouTube and others have agreed to strengthen their efforts against online hate speech under an updated code of conduct that will be incorporated into the European Union’s (EU) tech rules. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the European Commission has announced that these companies, along with other signatories to the voluntary code established in May 2016, have committed to taking further action to combat the spread of hate speech. Several other tech companies have also signed the voluntary code of conduct to combat online hate speech, including Dailymotion, Instagram, Jeuxvideo.com, LinkedIn, Microsoft-hosted consumer services, Snapchat, Rakuten Viber, TikTok and Twitch.Under the updated code, companies have committed to allowing not-for-profit or public organisations with expertise in illegal hate speech to oversee their handling of hate speech notices. They also agreed to review at least two-thirds of such notices within 24 hours.Additionally, the companies will implement measures, including the use of automated detection tools, to minimise hate speech on their platforms. These companies will also provide transparency on the role of recommendation systems and the organic and algorithmic reach of illegal content before its removal.The companies will also offer country-specific data, categorised by internal classifications of hate speech, such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, or sexual orientation.In a statement to Reuters, EU tech commissioner Henna Virkkunen said:The DSA mandates that tech companies take stronger action against illegal and harmful content on their platforms.

What is a memecoin

Melania Trump launches meme coin



Donald Trump announced his cryptocurrency $Trump on January 17, 2025. Just two days after the launch, the crypto token has become one of the most valuable forms of digital currency in the world. According to a New York Times report, Trump tokens were trading at a total value of almost $13 billion on Sunday afternoon i.e. January 19. In just two days, $29 billion worth of trades had taken place.According to CoinGecko, a data tracker for the industry, each of the 200 million tokens, valued at around $64, contributed to this total. This means, as of Sunday, Trump’s coin was ranked as the 19th most valuable cryptocurrency in the world.As mentioned above, the $Trump meme coin launched last week, days ahead of the inauguration.

Trump factor behind the 'wake-up' call

China seems to be finally taking note of Apple and other technology and auto companies moving manufacturing/assembly to India and other parts of the world. According to a report in Bloomberg, China is making it harder for employees and specialised equipment needed for high-tech manufacturing in India and Southeast Asia to leave its borders. The report that quotes people familiar with the matter added that this is possibly an attempt to prevent companies from shifting production in anticipation of higher tariffs under US President-elect Donald Trump Sources familiar with the matter indicate that Beijing has informally advised regulatory agencies and local governments to limit technology transfers and equipment exports to these regions. The goal is to boost domestic production, mitigate potential job losses, and discourage foreign investors from leaving China if the US imposes new trade barriers.For example, Apple's primary assembly partner, Foxconn, has reportedly faced difficulties in deploying Chinese staff to its Indian factory and in receiving specialized machinery from China. While these issues haven't yet impacted production, they highlight the potential implications of these restrictions. Sources reportedly indicate that Apple's China-based equipment partners have faced increased scrutiny from Chinese government officials regarding shipments of equipment to India. Recent reports also claimed that Apple and Foxconn sought help from the Indian government regarding the same. Apple and Foxconn are said to have sought urgent help from the Indian government for assistance as specialized manufacturing equipment faces significant delays at Chinese ports, threatening to impact India's electronics manufacturing expansion plans.China's foreign ministry has stated that it treats all countries equally and welcomes enterprises from everywhere, denying any actions that harm other nations. However, reports suggest that Beijing is particularly concerned about Foxconn further diversifying its production away from China, given the company's significant workforce and its importance to local supply chains and employment.This trend of companies shifting production away from China, which began during Trump's first term, is expected to accelerate and potentially include more technology companies. The restrictions on tech equipment are also reportedly affecting the manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs) and solar panels in India, impacting companies like BYD and Waaree Energies. Previous reports indicated that Beijing aimed to limit the transfer of advanced EV manufacturing technology and had advised automakers against investing in India.","China is making it harder for employees and specialised equipment needed for high-tech manufacturing in India and Southeast Asia to leave its borders.

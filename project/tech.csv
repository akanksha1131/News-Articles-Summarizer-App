Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed recent job cuts during the company’s latest Town Hall event with its employees, a report claims. At the event, he reportedly revealed that the latest round of job cuts was due to “reorganisation rather than performance,”. This clarification comes from the company weeks after it announced plans to lay off 6,000 employees, which is roughly 3% of its workforce. These terminations significantly impacted product development roles, indicating that even engineering jobs are not immune to changes in the era of artificial intelligence (AI). During a companywide town hall, Nadella also focused Microsoft's focus on accelerating the adoption of its Copilot AI assistants across customer workforces.According to a report by Bloomberg, Microsoft has also announced a new AI deal with Barclays Plc, a significant development in its effort to sell artificial intelligence tools to corporate customers.Judson Althoff , the company’s Chief Commercial Officer, informed employees that Barclays agreed to purchase 100,000 licenses for Microsoft’s Copilot AI assistants, according to people familiar with the event.Althoff also stated that numerous other customers, including Accenture Plc, Toyota Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG, and Siemens AG, already have over 100,000 Copilot users. These details were shared by individuals who requested anonymity as they discussed internal remarks, the report added.At the listed price of $30 per user per month, the deals mentioned by Althoff could be valued at tens of millions of dollars annually, though large customers often receive bulk discountsWhile the company has shared numerous anecdotes about businesses adopting Copilot, it has yet to disclose total customer figures or the financial impact of those sales.As per the report, some enterprise clients say the tools demand significant internal adjustments and employee training. As a result, many are approaching Copilot adoption cautiously, viewing it as a gradual rollout and testing phase rather than a full-scale deployment of the premium software.Microsoft is seen as a key player in AI through its partnership with OpenAI and integration of Copilot into productivity tools. The company also expects its AI offerings to generate at least $13 billion annually. However, investors remain eager for clearer proof of returns on its major AI investments.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed recent job cuts during the company’s latest Town Hall event with its employees.

China's DeepSeek that 'shocked' America and American technology companies has an update that it says .... to OpenAI’s o3 and Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chinas-deepseek-that-shocked-america-and-american-technology-companies-has-an-update-that-it-says-to-openais-o3-and-googles-gemini-2-5-pro/articleshow/121498260.cms,"When Deepseek stunned America's technology industry

New DeepSeek model works on same foundation

What makes timing of DeepSeek announcement important

Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has announced a significant upgrade to its R1 model, named DeepSeek-R1-0528, which claims to boast enhanced capabilities in mathematics, programming, and general logic while reducing AI ""hallucinations."" The announcement, made via a post on the AI model platform Hugging Face, positions the new model as a formidable competitor to industry leaders like OpenAI’s o3 and Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro.DeepSeek stunned the global tech community in January with the original R1, a model that rivaled the performance of systems developed by much larger U.S. companies, reportedly at a fraction of the cost. The debut disrupted the AI industry, raising questions about the massive global spending on computational resources and sparking a wave of AI releases from Chinese tech giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Zhipu AI.Built for under $6 million using less-advanced Nvidia H800 chips, R1’s efficiency challenged assumptions about the necessity of massive computational investments, triggering a $1 trillion stock market drop, including Nvidia’s $589 billion loss. DeepSeek’s open-source model, praised for its cost-effectiveness, raised concerns about U.S. AI dominance, prompting calls for stricter export controls and urgent policy reassessmentsAmerican lawmakers, citing national security, swiftly reacted. Representatives Gottheimer and LaHood introduced the No DeepSeek on Government Devices Act, alleging Chinese Communist Party data theft risks. NASA, the Navy, and Congress banned DeepSeek on government devices, fearing espionage due to its China-based servers and lax data policies. Companies like Oracle blocked employee use, wary of intellectual property leaks.The upgraded DeepSeek-R1-0528 builds on this foundation, offering what the company claims is ""greater depth of reasoning"" and performance approaching that of the world’s top AI models. “Its overall performance is now approaching that of leading models,” DeepSeek stated, signaling its ambition to compete at the forefront of the global AI race.The rise of DeepSeek has also catapulted its founder, Liang Wenfeng , into the spotlight. Once a relatively unknown figure, Liang became a symbol of China’s growing prowess in AI innovation following R1’s debut. In February, he was invited by President Xi Jinping to a high-profile meeting alongside prominent entrepreneurs like Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma and Tencent’s Pony Ma, underscoring DeepSeek’s significance in China’s tech landscape.The timing of the DeepSeek-R1-0528 announcement was notable, coming just hours before Nvidia Corp., the Santa Clara-based leader in AI chips, released its latest financial report. Nvidia, whose shares took a hit following R1’s initial launch due to concerns about reduced AI infrastructure costs, has since recovered as global investment in AI data centers remains robust. Nvidia’s latest forecast reaffirmed strong demand for its chips, suggesting that DeepSeek’s cost-efficient approach has not slowed the broader AI investment boom.DeepSeek’s rapid progress highlights China’s accelerating role in the global AI arms race. Industry analysts note that the startup’s ability to deliver high-performing models at lower costs could reshape the economics of AI development, challenging the dominance of U.S. tech giants.","DeepSeek-R1-0528 claims to boast enhanced capabilities in mathematics, programming, and general logic while reducing AI ""hallucinations"" The announcement positions the new model as a formidable competitor to industry leaders like OpenAI’s o3 and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121498256,imgsize-18802,width-400,resizemode-4/Deepseek.jpg"

NYT Connections is back again with an exciting word puzzle. Looking for help to solve today’s NYT Connections puzzle? Whether you're stuck, curious about the logic behind the groupings or trying to preserve your win streak, you’re in the right place. Each day brings a fresh challenge that mixes wordplay, general knowledge and clever associations. Below, we explain what Connections is, how to play, and we provide the hints, categories, and full answers for today’s game — Friday, 23 May 2025. Warning: spoilers ahead.Connections is a daily word puzzle published by The New York Times . You are given 16 words and must group them into four sets of four words, where each set shares a common theme. Themes can relate to meanings, categories, idioms, or even subtle wordplay. Each puzzle has only one correct solution, making precision and logic key to winning.The puzzle presents a 4x4 grid of words. Your job is to find four groups of four words that connect through a shared idea. You can rearrange the words to help visualise patterns, and you're allowed four incorrect guesses. Groups are colour-coded by difficulty:Yellow – easiestGreen – moderateBlue – harderPurple – trickiest, often involving wordplay or double meaningsSubmit four words you believe belong together. If correct, that group locks in. If not, you lose a life. Lose four lives, and it’s game over.Use these hints to help form the correct groups:(Think of events that involve dancing, music, or big gatherings.)(Consider words that relate to someone's personality, essence or internal makeup.)(You might hear these on a scale or in a recipe — pre-metric system units.)(A beauty product, a type of marble, a celestial object and a type of eyewear style.)BASHBLASTBLOWOUTRAVEThese are all terms used to describe large, energetic parties or celebrations.CHARACTERFIBERMAKEUPNATUREEach of these words can refer to the fundamental qualities or essence of a person or thing.DRAMOUNCEPOUNDSTONEAll are units of weight commonly used in the imperial measurement system, particularly in the UK.EYELINER (a type of makeup styled as a cat-eye)GLASSES (as in lenses shaped or styled like a cat’s eye)MARBLE (cat’s eye marbles are a specific type of toy marble)NEBULA (as in the Cat’s Eye Nebula, a famous astronomical object)If you were thrown off by the group involving MAKEUP, EYELINER and BLOWOUT, you’re not alone—it was easy to assume a beauty-related category. However, separating the constitution-themed words from the party-themed ones was key to solving today’s puzzle. The purple category was the most obscure, tying together vastly different meanings of “cat’s eye” across science, fashion, cosmetics and childhood games.That’s everything for today’s puzzle. Whether you got them all right or learned something new, you can try again tomorrow at midnight. Happy puzzling!","Connections is a daily word puzzle published by The New York Times.

Meta , the tech giant behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has requested a federal judge to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) high-profile antitrust case, just as the trial approaches a critical phase. According to the, the case, which began in early April, represents one of the most significant regulatory challenges faced by Meta in its history, potentially resulting in the breakup of the company’s social media empire.Meta's move to dismiss the case comes after the FTC rested its side of the argument, asserting that the company holds an illegal monopoly over the social networking market, particularly those platforms focused on friends-and-family connections. Meta, however, argues that the FTC's case is based on a flawed market definition and ignores the intense competition it faces from newer platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X (formerly known as Twitter).In a court filing late Thursday, Meta reiterated its stance that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standards required to prove its antitrust allegations. The company’s legal team argues that the FTC has fundamentally mischaracterized the social media market, claiming that the agency's definition is overly narrow and excludes significant competitors.“After five weeks of trial, it is clear that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standard required under antitrust law,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement on Friday. “Regardless, we will present our case to show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram competes with TikTok (and YouTube and X and many other apps).”Meta claims that it faces substantial competition from a wide range of digital platforms, including short-video giant TikTok, video-sharing platform YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X. These platforms, Meta argues, all compete for user engagement, advertising revenue, and market share, undercutting the FTC’s claim that Meta has maintained an unlawful monopoly.The FTC’s antitrust lawsuit, which was first filed in December 2020, centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The agency claims that Meta pursued a deliberate “buy or bury” strategy, acquiring these fast-growing competitors to neutralize potential threats to its dominant position in the social networking market.In its filing, the FTC pointed to internal Meta communications as evidence of this strategy. This includes a 2012 email from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggesting that buying Instagram would “neutralize a competitor.” The FTC further argues that these acquisitions reduced consumer choice and stifled innovation, limiting competition in the rapidly evolving social media industry.The FTC's case aims to convince U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to order Meta to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp, effectively dismantling the company's integrated social media ecosystem.Meta's defense in the trial has focused on presenting itself as a company that supports innovation and benefits consumers. In its Thursday filing, the company argued that its acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth, which in turn delivered significant benefits to users.“Meta’s acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth – with correspondingly massive benefits for US consumers,” the company stated in its court filing.However, the trial has also brought to light internal documents that may complicate Meta’s defense. For instance, a 2018 email from an unnamed Instagram executive warned that ""fake engagement could be in the range of 40%,"" potentially undermining Meta's claims about the platform’s integrity and user trust.Mark Zuckerberg himself was the first witness called by the FTC as the trial opened, highlighting the personal stakes for the Meta CEO. During his testimony, Zuckerberg sought to portray Meta as a company facing fierce competition, rather than a monopoly crushing potential rivals.Earlier in the trial, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom testified that he felt Zuckerberg viewed Instagram’s rapid growth as a potential threat to Facebook’s dominance after the acquisition, further fueling the FTC’s argument that Meta's mergers were designed to stifle competition.The 10-week non-jury trial, which is expected to conclude in June, will be followed by final briefs from both the FTC and Meta. If Judge Boasberg sides with the FTC, a second trial will be held to determine appropriate remedies, potentially including the forced divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp.Meta will continue presenting its defense when the trial resumes on Monday. The company’s attempt to dismiss the case outright remains a long shot, as the judge may choose to let the case proceed to its scheduled conclusion before issuing a ruling.","The FTC's antitrust lawsuit centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.

Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn makes a prediction on how AI will change schools in future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/duolingo-ceo-luis-von-ahn-makes-a-prediction-on-how-ai-will-change-schools-in-future/articleshow/121290768.cms,"Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn feels that AI will take over teaching



Schools won’t disappear, but their role will change: Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn



Duolingo CEO Luis von Ann recently predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) will fundamentally transform education, shifting the role of schools from traditional learning institutions to childcare and supervised spaces. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the No Priors podcast, von Ahn stressed on the fact that AI’s scalability makes it more efficient than human teachers and it can be easily used for personalised education. ""Education is going to change. It's just a lot more scalable to teach with AI than with teachers,” von Ahn said.Von Ahn suggests that AI will increasingly handle the core instruction in schools. He believes that AI can deliver personalised education more effectively than traditional classroom models with teachers. AI system can be designed to precisely track individual student progress, identify areas where they struggle and then tailor the learning experience accordingly.While Von Ahn does not believe schools will vanish, he foresees a future where AI tutors handle most of the teaching, while schools primarily serve as safe environments for children. He explained that AI can track individual student performance in real time, adjusting lesson plans to match each child’s learning pace—something human teachers struggle to do in large classrooms.“That doesn't mean the teachers are going to go away. You still need people to take care of the students. I also don't think schools are going to go away because you still need childcare,” von Ahn said on the podcast.This doesn't mean teachers will become obsolete, according to von Ahn. Instead, their responsibilities may evolve. Teachers could transition from primarily delivering instruction to supervising students, providing guidance, and fostering social and emotional development.Von Ahn also points out that the integration of AI in education is already happening. Duolingo, for example, is restructuring its operations to embrace an ""AI-first"" approach. This includes using AI for tasks previously done by contractors and incorporating AI into employee performance reviews.","Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn predicts that AI will transform education.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has once again criticised US chip export restrictions, stating that China, a $50 billion market, has effectively been closed to the company due to the policy. Huang argued that the export controls were counterproductive, pushing Chinese AI developers towards homegrown chips instead of relying on American technology platforms for AI software.""The US has based its policy on the assumption that China cannot make AI chips. That assumption was always questionable, and now it’s clearly wrong,"" he said in prepared remarks as the chipmaker reported strong fiscal first-quarter earnings on Wednesday (May 28).He warned that the restrictions were driving AI talent toward Chinese competitors such as Huawei , limiting the influence of US technology stacks in the global AI ecosystem.""We want every developer in the world to prefer the American technology stacks,"" Huang told CNBC.Despite losing access to the Chinese market, Nvidia is exploring potential products that could still be sold in the region. However, the company currently does not have a replacement chip ready.The impact of the restrictions is significant as Nvidia revealed it expects to record $45 billion in chip sales during the July quarter, missing out on $8 billion due to US restrictions on its H20 chip. In the April quarter, Nvidia estimated it lost $2.5 billion in sales due to the same policy.Nvidia announced a 69% increase in sales, however, despite this strong performance, the chip manufacturer issued a warning about emerging risks to its business stemming from the ongoing technology conflict between the US and China.During a conference call with analysts, Huang commended US President Donald Trump's decision to rescind an export rule previously enacted by former President Joe Biden. However, the company's quarterly regulatory filing highlighted a significant point of concern: no new rule has been issued to replace the rescinded one. The filing explicitly stated that a ""replacement rule may impose new restrictions on our products or operations.""","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says China has effectively been closed to the company due to the policy.

iPhone 16e: 5 Reasons to buy the most affordable iPhone 16 series model!

Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) 2025, which is set to be held between June 9 and June 13, is expected to feature major announcements across its software and platforms. While primarily for developers, the Cupertino-based tech giant’s annual event typically offers enough previews to interest a broader audience. This year's conference is expected to introduce an entirely new look for much of Apple's software, aiming for a more unified experience across iPhones, tablets, and computers. Apple Intelligence, which was the focus of last year's WWDC, is expected to return in 2025 as Apple seeks to build momentum for its AI tools. The appearance of new hardware is also a possibility, though considered less likely this time.The event, which will be livestreamed on YouTube, is set to kick off with a keynote on June 9, starting at 1 PM ET (10.30 PM IST). This keynote will set the stage for the software updates Apple plans to release later this year. Here are the top 5 announcements that the company is expected to make at WWDC 2025:Apple’s WWDC 2025 is expected to focus on a broad interface refresh across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS, rather than solely on new features. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports that the redesign, codenamed “Solarium”, will borrow visionOS elements like rounded icons and translucent menus to create a unified look.This will update app layouts, window styling, system buttons, and overall visual language. The last major iPhone interface change came with iOS 7’s shift away from skeuomorphic design. Solarium aims to modernise Apple’s software appearance, though users may need time to adjust to the new design when it debuts at WWDC.As per Gurman, Apple may also replace traditional version numbers for its software with the upcoming year. Beginning at WWDC 2025, iOS 19, macOS 19, and watchOS 19 would become iOS 2026, macOS 2026, and watchOS 2026, and so on.This change likely aims to standardise naming across platforms, making it easier to reference releases by year rather than by disparate version counts.The upcoming iOS 26 is expected to focus more on the interface redesign yet reports indicate several new features for Apple’s phones. One report by Tom’s Guide suggests iOS 26 will include a simplified Wi-Fi sign-on, allowing login credentials to be shared across Apple devices.Another feature, powered by AI, is expected to optimise battery life and predict charging times. While these additions may be modest, they could enhance the user experience.Additionally, the iPhone may also gain a desktop mode; compatible models (iPhone 15 or later with USB-C). This feature may allow users to connect their iPhones to an external display for expanded screen space.iPadOS 26, which builds on iOS with tablet-specific enhancements, is said to receive a Mac-style menu bar at the top of the screen and an updated Stage Manager for improved multitasking.Apart from this, Gurman also reports that WWDC 2025 may introduce a new cross-platform gaming app from Apple. The app is expected to integrate existing Game Center features, such as leaderboards and friend lists, while also allowing users to launch games directly and providing deeper access to Apple Arcade. Details still remain limited, yet the gaming app is expected to be available not only on iPhone but also on iPad, Mac, and Apple TV.Apple continues to develop its Apple Intelligence features, focusing in 2025 on refining existing capabilities rather than introducing many new ones. Key unfinished projects from last year include a redesigned Siri that can interpret on-screen content, such as creating calendar entries from email and offer proactive, context-aware suggestions.Apple acknowledged challenges in delivering these Siri improvements consistently and now plans to include them in software updates later this year, though no exact timeline has been given.Rumored additions to Apple Intelligence include AI-powered battery management and a health-coaching tool that aggregates fitness data to offer personalized advice. At WWDC 2025, Apple is also expected to unveil developer tools to simplify integrating Apple Intelligence into third-party apps.Apple sometimes unveils hardware at WWDC, as it did with Vision Pro and new Macs in 2023. Any 2025 hardware announcements would likely target developers, making a Mac Pro with an M4 chip a plausible candidate.Devices that use new software features such as a touchscreen HomePod or AirPods with gesture-control cameras have been rumored but face technical and timing challenges.Reports also suggest that Apple is developing smart glasses as a Vision Pro successor, which may potentially arrive in 2026, and WWDC could serve as an early preview for such developer-focused hardware.","Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) 2025 is set to be held between June 9 and June 13.

Government and tech industry 'sugarcoating' risks, says Anthropic CEO

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that artificial intelligence could eliminate 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years, potentially driving US unemployment to 20%. The stark prediction comes as AI technology rapidly advances, with sectors including technology, finance, law, and consulting facing the greatest disruption.""We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming,"" Amodei told Axios in an interview published Wednesday. The 42-year-old CEO emphasized that most people remain unaware of the impending transformation, calling it a reality that ""sounds crazy, and people just don't believe it.""Recent data supports Amodei's concerns, with Big Tech hiring of new graduates dropping 50% since pre-pandemic levels, according to venture capital firm SignalFire. The report attributes this decline partly to AI adoption, as companies prioritize experienced workers who can leverage AI tools effectively.""AI is doing what interns and new grads used to do,"" explained Heather Doshay, a SignalFire partner. ""Now, you can hire one experienced worker, equip them with AI tooling, and they can produce the output of the junior worker on top of their own.""Entry-level candidates now account for just 7% of total hires at Big Tech firms in 2024, down 25% from the previous year. At startups, that figure drops to 6%.Amodei criticized both government officials and business leaders for downplaying the scale of disruption ahead. He argued that the US government remains quiet about AI's job displacement potential, fearing worker panic or falling behind China in the AI race.The Anthropic CEO acknowledged the irony of his position—simultaneously building and selling AI products while warning about their risks. He envisions a future where ""cancer is cured, the economy grows 10% a year, the budget is balanced—and 20% of people don't have jobs.""Amodei urged immediate action to prepare for this transformation, emphasizing that the technology cannot be stopped but can be steered with proper planning and policy intervention.",Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warns that AI could eliminate 50% of white-collar jobs within the next five years.

Growth without jobs? The dark side of the AI boom

Also read | What is Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer a distant concept of science fiction or a futuristic buzzword confined to labs and research centers. It is already deeply embedded in the fabric of the modern workplace, rapidly reshaping how businesses operate, how employees perform their duties, and how entire industries evolve. In a powerful and sobering statement at the Milken Institute Global Conference on May 6, Jensen Huang , co-founder and CEO of Nvidia, one of the world’s leading semiconductor companies valued at over $3.3 trillion, issued a compelling warning to workers worldwide:Huang’s message underlines a critical paradigm shift — the disruption caused by AI won’t simply be about outright job loss through automation but about a growing divide between those who harness AI as a tool and those who do not. This revelation compels us to rethink the future of work, the skills needed to thrive, and how society must adapt to this technological revolution.Contrary to common fears that AI will lead to massive, immediate job displacement, Huang’s perspective reveals a more nuanced reality. The technology itself will not necessarily replace workers outright but will transform the very nature of jobs and workplace productivity. AI can automate repetitive, routine tasks but does not fully substitute the creativity, judgment, and complex decision-making humans provide—at least not yet.Chris Hyams, CEO of job platform Indeed, supports this viewpoint, noting that while full automation is rare today, nearly two-thirds of job roles include tasks AI can assist with or perform. This means that AI is increasingly integrated into everyday workflows, augmenting human capabilities rather than eliminating jobs entirely.The new competitive edge belongs to those who can collaborate effectively with AI — those who can train, command, and augment AI tools to enhance their productivity and innovation. Huang highlights a startling gap: out of the global population of approximately 8 billion people, only about 30 million are proficient in programming and leveraging AI technologies at an advanced level. This discrepancy indicates a growing knowledge divide, with a small elite group wielding powerful AI instruments, while the vast majority risk falling behind.While Huang offers an optimistic view of AI as a transformative tool, other experts warn of more dire consequences. Dario Amodei, CEO of AI safety startup Anthropic, paints a bleaker picture. In an interview with Axios, Amodei suggested that up to half of all entry-level white-collar jobs could disappear within five years due to AI-driven automation and hiring freezes. His scenario envisages a paradoxical future: dramatic technological progress combined with widespread unemployment, where the economy grows, but millions struggle to find work.This chilling forecast underscores the risk that AI may not only automate tasks but also alter corporate hiring practices. Companies might stop creating new positions altogether, relying instead on AI-powered efficiency. Early adopters like Shopify, Duolingo, and Fiverr have already mandated AI integration into employee workflows. Shopify’s CEO Tobi Lutke explicitly instructed teams to exhaust AI tools before submitting hiring requests, signaling a profound shift in organizational dynamics.Despite concerns, Huang remains hopeful about AI’s potential to generate new opportunities. At the Hill and Valley Forum, he emphasized how AI is revolutionizing software development itself. Traditional human-coded software running on CPUs is being replaced by machine-learning-generated software running on powerful GPUs, a transition that spawns new industries, tools, and layers of commerce.This transformation is not merely disruptive; it’s generative. The AI revolution is creating new jobs at higher levels of abstraction and specialization, involving tasks such as AI training, data labeling, model fine-tuning, and system integration. As one layer of technology evolves, it opens doors for novel roles and trades previously unimaginable.A central theme in Huang’s message—and echoed by billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban—is the urgent need for AI literacy. In today’s landscape, understanding how to use AI is no longer a luxury; it’s a critical survival skill.Huang reveals that he personally uses AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini to draft content and solve problems, highlighting how AI is increasingly intertwined with communication, creativity, and daily problem-solving. The technology lowers the barrier to entry, enabling even non-programmers to instruct AI through natural language or visual inputs, effectively democratizing access.Mark Cuban’s investment in free AI bootcamps for underserved high school students exemplifies this philosophy. Cuban urges learners to embrace AI early, absorbing its principles and applications to remain competitive in the evolving job market.These examples demonstrate that AI adoption is not a theoretical future but a present-day reality transforming corporate culture and operations.The potential paradox highlighted by Amodei—robust economic growth alongside stagnant or declining job creation—raises critical questions about income inequality, social safety nets, and workforce retraining. Policymakers must grapple with these challenges as AI reshapes labor markets.The knowledge gap Huang describes demands significant investment in education and reskilling programs. Governments, corporations, and educational institutions will need to collaborate to equip the workforce with AI literacy and digital skills, ensuring broad-based economic inclusion.As AI becomes integral to workplaces, concerns about bias, transparency, and control grow. Companies and regulators must ensure AI systems are deployed responsibly, safeguarding workers’ rights and maintaining trust.","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer a distant concept of science fiction or a futuristic buzzword confined to labs and research centers.

Google I/O 2025: AI Ultra tier, AI Mode on Search and more

Google’s commitment to artificial intelligence (AI) dates back much further than many may realise. While CEO Sundar Pichai has repeatedly described Google as an “AI-first” company since 2016, the concept was first outlined by co-founder Larry Page in 2000. At the time, with Google still in its early stages, Page predicted that AI will eventually become the ultimate version of the search engine.Page talked about Google being an AI company when the company was merely two years old.""Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google,"" he said, adding, ""It would understand, you know, exactly what you wanted. And it would give you the right thing.""""And that's obviously artificial intelligence, you know. It would be able to answer any question, basically, because almost everything is on the web, right?,"" Page explained (via Business Insider).Page stated that Google operated approximately 6,000 computers to maintain around 100 copies of the web. Describing the scale of computation and data storage, Page remarked, ""A lot of computation, a lot of data that didn't used to be available.""He further emphasised the challenge involved, noting, ""From an engineering scientific standpoint, building things to make use of this is a really interesting intellectual exercise. So I expected to be doing that for a while.""At this year's Google's annual I/O developer conference, the company showcased the company's intensified focus on AI, unveiling significant AI updates across its product ecosystem. Key announcements included smarter Gemini 2.5 models (Pro with ""Deep Think"" and an improved Flash), the launch of Google Beam (formerly Project Starline) for 3D video conferencing, and a new $250/month AI Ultra subscription for advanced features.Google also revealed a complete AI overhaul for Search, introduced Android XR for smart glasses (Project Aura), and brought AI-powered Smart Replies to Gmail and real-time translation to Google Meet. Enhancements to the AI Agent (Project Mariner), the universal AI assistant (Project Astra), and more realistic AI video (Veo 3) and image (Imagen 4) generation models underscored Google's AI-first future.","Google co-founder Larry Page predicted in 2000 that artificial intelligence would become the ultimate version of the search engine.

The Trump administration has reportedly issued new directives to US technology firms, ordering them to stop the sale of semiconductor design software to Chinese companies. This action is seen as a part of Washington's ongoing effort to restrict China's access to advanced technologies, especially in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Last month, the US also imposed new limits on Nvidia ’s AI chip exports to China.Citing sources familiar with the matter, a report by The Financial Times claimed that the US Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has sent letters to tech companies, instructing them to stop providing services that could support China’s chip development capabilities.The move targets electronic design automation (EDA) companies such as Cadence Design Systems, Synopsys , and Siemens EDA. EDA software plays a crucial role in chip design and testing.The three targeted companies make up approximately 80% of China’s EDA software market. Synopsys generated nearly $1 billion in revenue from China in fiscal 2024, while Cadence reported $550 million.A Commerce Department official confirmed to the publication that the agency is reviewing exports related to strategic concerns with China and, in some cases, has suspended or added licensing requirements.The directive comes amid ongoing trade negotiations between the US and China, which agreed to a temporary 90-day halt on additional tariffs in Geneva. Previous reports indicated that the Trump administration planned to blacklist several Chinese chipmakers but delayed action to avoid disrupting talks.Though the Biden administration previously imposed restrictions on high-end EDA tools in 2022, US companies have continued selling versions of their products that comply with existing export laws. This latest move adds pressure to limit those sales further.","The move targets electronic design automation (EDA) companies such as Cadence Design Systems, Synopsys, and Siemens EDA.

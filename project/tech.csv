Shein is the world’s most visited fashion and apparel website

Set to beat Zara in France; Amazon's headache in the US

Shein's India entry

After a four-and-a-half-year ban, Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein is making a comeback in India through a partnership with Reliance Retail . The Shein app was blocked on June 29, 2020, along with 200 other Chinese apps by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).The initial re-entry involves a backend test launch on Reliance's fashion website, Ajio.com, focusing on casual westernwear and more. While the rollout may eventually extend to other Reliance platforms, no clear launch timeline has been announced as yet. This move positions Shein, now based in Singapore, to compete with established players like Tata's Zudio and Flipkart's Myntra in the affordable fast-fashion segment. Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd. formalized its partnership with Shein last year to facilitate this return.In September 2024, Shein reportedly became the world’s most visited fashion and apparel website, according to data from Similarweb. With a global web traffic share of 2.68% for the third quarter of 2024, Shein outpaced other major brands like Nike, H&M, and Zara, which ranked second to fourth, respectively.Shein’s user base too has seen a significant rise. Data from Earnest shows that Shein website's transaction-making users in August surged nearly 40% compared to January, marking it the fastest-growing international platform, followed closely by TikTok.Amazon recently launched a low-cost online storefront featuring electronics, apparel and other products priced under $20, to compete with discount retailers that have increasingly encroached on the e-commerce giant’s turf -- and their names are China's Shein and Temu. Shein’s core customers in the US are young women enticed by the low-cost apparel sold on the site, and Amazon is now aiming to target them.As per French consumer publication LSA, Shein’s 2023 annual sales in France surpassed H&M, Primark, and Kiabi, positioning it as the country’s second-largest fashion brand, second after Zara, owned by Spain’s Inditex Group. Though numbers are still to come, in the final quarter of 2024, Shein’s French sales are speculated to have exceeded Zara’s.This re-entry strategy involves a technology agreement between Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd. and Roadget Business Pte Ltd. to develop a local e-commerce platform. This platform aims to establish a network of Indian manufacturers and suppliers to produce and sell products under the Shein brand.Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal confirmed that Shein's Indian retail platform will be hosted on domestic infrastructure, ensuring data security and preventing Shein from accessing or controlling it. The Ministry of Textiles, in consultation with other relevant ministries, has also approved Reliance Retail's proposal.","Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein is making a comeback in India through a partnership with Reliance Retail.

Tesla and Starlink CEO Elon Musk wants you to take note. The world's richest man who has long described Mars as critical to humanity's survival has an 'alien warning'. ""If future aliens see us, they will say; there they had rocket and everything, still they regulated themselves,"" said Musk addressing a crowd that roared with laughter.The video was shared by Twitter user DogeDesigner with the caption: ""Future aliens will make fun of us if we are unable to go on Mars because of regulations."" To this Elon Musk replied with an affirmative ""Yes"".Recently, Musk was also spotted werning a T-Shirt that said: 'Occupy Mars'. This photo too was shared by DogeDesigner on Twitter.Elon Musk envisions a future where Mars isn't just a planet, but a ""New World,"" echoing the historical naming of the Americas. This idea, shared on X (formerly Twitter) alongside a NASA image of Mars' Gale Crater, is just one piece of his larger ambition to establish a self-sustaining human civilization on the Red Planet.Musk's drive to colonize Mars stems from his belief that it's crucial for the long-term survival of human consciousness. He considers Earth fragile and sees Mars as a vital backup plan against potential catastrophes. ""Earth is great, but it’s fragile. We need a backup,"" he explained, emphasizing the need for a future beyond Earth's limitations. SpaceX 's Starship rocket is central to this vision. Designed for reusability and capable of carrying 100 passengers and vital cargo, Starship is intended to make interplanetary travel affordable. Musk outlined plans for five uncrewed Mars missions over the next two years. These missions will deliver essential resources like water, oxygen, fuel, and construction equipment.Musk believes ""Starship will make life multi-planetary, preserving life as we know it from extinction events on Earth."" He anticipates the first crewed mission could launch in the early 2030s. His long-term strategy involves utilizing Martian resources to build infrastructure, reducing reliance on Earth for resupply.","Tesla and Starlink CEO Elon Musk wants you to take note.

The CCI's decision follows its preliminary report in July 2024 that accused Apple of abusing its market position.While potential fines remain unclear, the CCI is likely to require Apple to allow third-party payment systems on its App Store, similar to requirements it previously imposed on Google's Play Store. The regulator has already shared a confidential version of its report with Apple to prepare its defense.Apple is expected to argue that its ""insignificant"" market share of under 5% in India means it lacks a dominant position to abuse. However, the company faces increasing pressure to modify its App Store policies, having already made similar concessions in the European Union and Japan.The case hit turbulence in 2024 when Apple accused the CCI of improperly disclosing sensitive company information and demanded the investigation be closed. The regulator rejected this request as ""untenable"" and proceeded with its investigation.The final ruling could impact Apple's strategy in India's competitive mobile market, where the company has been expanding manufacturing operations and retail presence despite its relatively small market share.","The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is set to rule that Apple violated antitrust laws with its App Store payment policies.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Here’s what Suchir Balaji's mother wrote

Update on @suchirbalaji

We hired private investigator and did second autopsy to throw light on cause of death. Private autopsy doesn’t confirm cause of death stated by police.

Suchir’s apartment was ransacked , sign of struggle in the bathroom and looks like some one hit him in bathroom based on blood spots.

It’s a cold blooded mu*d*r declared by authorities as suicide.

Lobbying in SF city doesn’t stop us from getting justices.

We demand FBi investigation

Mother of Suchir Balaji , a 26-year-old researcher at OpenAI , is requesting help from Elon Musk following her son's death. Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment earlier this month. His mother posted on social media, tagging Musk and asking for an FBI investigation . Police stated, “no evidence of foul play was found during the initial investigation”. However, the San Francisco Chief Medical Examiner's Office determined Balaji's death a suicide. Balaji worked at OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT .In her post, Balaji’s mother - Poornima Rao expressed her worries and stated that “private autopsy doesn’t confirm cause of death stated by police.” She called for intervention from US authorities, stating that an FBI investigation is necessary to address the matter. Other than Elon Musk, she tagged American biotech entrepreneur and politician Vivek Ramaswamy and Gavin Newsom – Governor of California.The post has since gained attention, sparking a wave of responses on social media. It caught Musk’s attention as well who replied saying “This doesn’t seem like a suicide”.Suchir Balaji's mother further pleads saying “@elonmusk please support us”.In an interview with Business Insider last week, Rao revealed that Balaji had grown increasingly disillusioned with artificial intelligence (AI), particularly OpenAI’s shift toward commercialization with ChatGPT. She said, “He felt AI is a harm to humanity,” describing how her son, Suchir Balaji, transitioned from boundless optimism about AI’s potential to profound skepticism. Reflecting on his tragic death, she added, “It doesn’t look like a normal situation.”","Suchir Balaji, a 26-year-old researcher at OpenAI, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment earlier this month.

(AP/PTI Photo)

As the match ended, cricket memes went viral on social media platforms. Here are some of the viral memes that just capture the emotion/sadness of Indian Cricket fans.

Record number of spectators

Australia clinched a thrilling 184-run victory over India in a dramatic final session of the fourth Test in Melbourne, taking a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. India, needing 340 to win, collapsed to 155 all out, losing their last seven wickets for just 34 runs in 20.3 overs. India appeared to be heading for a draw after Yashasvi Jaiswal (84) and Rishabh Pant (30) steered them to 112-3 at tea. However, Pant's dismissal, attempting a six off Travis Head, triggered a batting collapse.Controversy arose with Jaiswal's dismissal. Initially given not out to a caught-behind appeal, the TV umpire overturned the decision based on visual evidence of the ball changing direction, despite the absence of audible noise. Jasprit Bumrah was exceptional for India, taking 5-57 in the second innings and nine wickets in the match. He had reduced Australia to 91-6 at one stage, a lead of less than 200.The match set a record attendance for cricket in Australia, with 373,591 spectators. Head described the atmosphere as inspiring and hailed the match as one of the best he has been involved in. India now needs to win the final Test in Sydney to level the series and retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .","Australia beat India by 184 runs in the fourth Test in Melbourne.

Planning a New Year's Eve party at an Airbnb? Think again. The company is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season. This technology uses machine learning to identify and block risky bookings, focusing on factors like trip length, booking timing, and distance from the guest's location. While implemented worldwide, the technology will specifically target the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Puerto Rico, Spain and New Zealand. Last New Year's Eve, Airbnb blocked 74,000 such bookings.High-risk bookings will be blocked or redirected to alternative accommodations. Short holiday getaways (one to three nights) in entire homes will also be restricted, and guests booking entire homes will be required to agree to a ""mandatory anti-party attestation."" ""If a booking is identified as higher risk, the guest will either be blocked from booking, or redirected to alternative accommodations on the platform,"" the company said.Guests will also be required to accept mandatory anti-party attestation. ""Guests who can make reservations will need to confirm that they understand that disruptive and unauthorized parties are not allowed on Airbnb, and they face suspension or removal from the platform if they violate this policy,"" said the company.Airbnb also has a 'Neighborhood Support Line' for local communities to report urgent issues, like a party in progress, at a home they believe is listed on Airbnb.Airbnb's efforts to curb disruptive parties started in 2019 with a ban on ""party houses,"" followed by stricter measures in 2020 due to the pandemic. In 2022, the company permanently banned large parties worldwide following several violent incidents at Airbnb rentals, including a shooting in Pittsburgh that resulted in two deaths and eight injuries.","Airbnb is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season.

Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, and his luxurious $500 million yacht, Koru, became the focal point of a dramatic episode on New Year’s Eve near St. Barts. As per reports, customs officials conducted a surprise inspection of the massive vessel while Bezos himself was absent. Instead, his fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, took center stage, drawing attention as she lounged on deck in a Versace bikini and a wide-brimmed hat. Despite the unexpected intrusion, the inspection was characterized as routine, lasting approximately three hours. This incident comes amidst a whirlwind of high-profile appearances and speculations surrounding the couple’s lavish lifestyle.The customs inspection began unexpectedly as Koru cruised the waters near St. Barts. Uniformed officers boarded the 417-foot yacht and meticulously searched the vessel under the guidance of a stewardess. Reports indicate that the search lasted approximately three hours, during which time officials methodically combed through the opulent yacht.Despite the disruption, the atmosphere aboard the yacht remained relatively calm. Sánchez appeared composed throughout the process, engaging with friends on deck. Among the notable individuals present was her ex-boyfriend, former NFL star Tony Gonzalez, who shares a son with Sánchez. Gonzalez even took a swim in the ocean while officers conducted their search.While an event of this nature might typically create tension, Sánchez’s demeanor suggested little cause for concern. Photos captured by Page Six showed her smiling for the cameras, a stewardess briefing her on the situation in a composed manner. The inspection, according to sources, was a standard procedure and posed no significant threat or issue for the vessel or its occupants.The disruption was brief, and the yacht’s opulent ambiance quickly returned as the officers wrapped up their work.The surprise inspection came on the heels of a festive holiday season for Bezos and Sánchez. The couple had recently celebrated in Aspen, Colorado, where their extravagant gatherings fueled rumors of a $600 million New Year’s Eve wedding. These speculations were promptly dismissed by Bezos himself, who took to X (formerly Twitter) to refute the claims.“This whole thing is completely false—none of this is happening,” Bezos posted. “The old adage ‘don’t believe everything you read’ is even more true today than ever. Lies can get ALL the way around the world before the truth can get its pants on.”Despite Bezos’ firm denial, their time in Aspen was far from low-profile. High-profile guests, including Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, were seen leaving Matsuhisa, a well-known sushi hotspot tied to the wedding rumors. Additionally, actor Kevin Costner and singer Jennifer Lopez were spotted mingling with attendees during the celebrations.Koru, named after a Māori word symbolising new beginnings, is one of the most expensive and luxurious yachts in the world. The 417-foot vessel boasts state-of-the-art features, including a swimming pool, a helicopter landing pad, and lavish accommodations for its passengers. The yacht’s size and splendor make it a regular feature in discussions about billionaire indulgences.The customs inspection near St. Barts highlighted not just the vessel’s prominence but also the scrutiny that often accompanies the lives of the ultra-wealthy.","Jeff Bezos' $500 million yacht, Koru, was raided by customs officials near St. Barts on New Year's Eve.

The program, backed by ""significant"" increases in ultra-long special treasury bonds, aims to revive domestic consumption amid economic headwinds.The timing couldn't be worse for Apple, which has seen its smartphone shipments in China decline for four consecutive months. Foreign brand shipments plunged 47.4% year-over-year in November to 3.04 million units, according to data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology.Meanwhile, domestic manufacturers are gaining ground. Huawei has emerged as a particularly strong challenger since its return to the premium segment in August 2023, with sales surging 42% in the third quarter of 2024. Apple briefly dropped out of China's top five smartphone vendors in the second quarter before recovering.The subsidy program, reminiscent of a 2007-2013 initiative that helped Chinese manufacturers gain market share, comes as Apple attempts to shore up sales through its own rare promotional campaign. The iPhone maker launched a four-day promotion Thursday, offering discounts up to 500 yuan ($68.50) on flagship models.""This government initiative could accelerate the ongoing shift in consumer preferences toward domestic brands,"" said Yuan Da, deputy secretary-general of the National Development and Reform Commission. The program will expand beyond personal devices to include agricultural facilities and other business equipment.Several provinces had already implemented local trade-in programs for personal devices in late 2024, but analysts expect the nationwide rollout to have a more substantial impact on market dynamics.","China will expand its trade-in subsidies to cover smartphones and other personal electronics.

What Turo has to say

An update on today’s incidents in New Orleans and Las Vegas

We are shocked and saddened by today’s horrific events, and our hearts are with the victims and their families.

Our trust and safety team is actively partnering with law enforcement authorities to share any information that could be helpful in their investigations. We do not believe that either renter had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat, and we are not currently aware of any information that indicates the two incidents are related.

Turo is dedicated to fostering a trustworthy marketplace. We remain committed to maintaining the highest standards in risk management, thanks to our world-class trust and safety technologies and teams that include experienced former law enforcement professionals.

We are devastated by these horrible incidents, and remain dedicated to helping the authorities however we can.

Turo , the popular car-sharing platform often referred to as the ""Airbnb of cars,"" is under focus after its vehicles were used in two deadly incidents: the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas explosion in the US. Authorities have confirmed that the perpetrators in both attacks obtained their vehicles through Turo. The company has also pledged its full cooperation with law enforcement in the ongoing investigations.Turo doesn’t have any specific or direct role in the incidents other than that the vehicles used in both the attacks on January 1 were rented on the app. While authorities have stated that the two incidents are unrelated, the use of Turo in both attacks has raised concerns about the platform's security measures and the potential risks associated with peer-to-peer car sharing.In New Orleans, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, the suspect who drove a Ford F-150 Lightning truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street, killing 15 and injuring 30, had rented the vehicle through Turo.Separately, in Las Vegas, a Tesla Cybertruck rented via Turo exploded outside the Trump Hotel, killing the driver and injuring seven others. The truck was reportedly loaded with fireworks and gasoline, and was also rented on Turo.Turo has expressed its condolences and confirmed its cooperation with law enforcement in both investigations. The company maintains that there was nothing in the New Orleans suspect's background check that would have flagged him as a security threat at the time of the rental.These incidents have also placed Turo under intense scrutiny, raising questions about the platform's ability to effectively screen renters and prevent its services from being exploited for malicious purposes. As investigations continue, Turo faces the challenge of addressing these concerns and reassuring users about the safety and security of its platform.","Turo is the popular car-sharing platform often referred to as the ""Airbnb of cars"" Its vehicles were used in two deadly incidents: the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas explosion.

PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO TRAVEL TO INDIA WITH A GARMIN INREACH OR ANY OTHER SATELLITE COMMUNICATOR - THEY ARE ILLEGAL HERE which lead to the following events...

At around 10.30am this morning, I was passing through security at Delhi Airport with the intention of taking an internal flight to Rishikesh, I innocently placed my Garmin Inreach in the tray to go through the scanner and at that moment I was promptly pulled aside by security and told to wait... I waited and waited, wondering what on earth was going on, I was eventually told that the Garmin was illegal here and that they were handing me over to the Police, I called the Embassy whilst waiting for the Police and I await their further guidance, however, they are not able to intervene with legal proceedings... I was eventually taken to the police station where I was questioned, in a fairly friendly manner and made to sign document after document, I didnt take the 'no comment' stance, foolishly or not, it is my nature to be honest and afterall, there was absolutely no intent on my behalf... At 9pm, I was finally released from the police station on the condition that I am required to return to attend court...

I am not the only person who has fallen victim to this law, hence I felt compelled to write this post, in hope that it will save even one of you from suffering the same fate. It honestly hadnt even ocurred to me to check I was able to carry it...

@outsidemagazine only yesterday published an article about a Canadian runner who was also arrested in India in December for similar reasons and the police showed me another Garmin that they had also ceased yesterday, although that charging officer had decided not to pursue that case, I wouldnt be so lucky...

I dont know what the outcome will be at present, this all feels totally overwhelming and I guess I will just have to wait....

When Bill Gates predicted the 'demise' of Apple's most-popular gadget

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-bill-gates-predicted-the-demise-of-apples-most-popular-gadget/articleshow/116907129.cms

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates predicted the decline of the iPod long before it happened. Nearly two decades ago, when the iPod was revolutionizing music consumption and Apple was dominating the MP3 player market, Gates made a bold prediction about its future. In a 2005 interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, he stated that the iPod’s dominance would eventually fade as smartphones emerged, offering much more than just music playback. At the time, this prediction seemed unlikely, as the iPhone wouldn’t debut until 2007, and smartphones were still primarily used by business professionals.

Despite the iPod’s immense popularity, Gates foresaw a shift in consumer needs. “I don’t think the success of the iPod can last, as good as Apple is,” he then said, emphasizing that consumers would soon demand devices with broader capabilities.

Gates compared the iPod to Apple’s earlier Macintosh computers, which initially led the market but were overtaken by competitors offering more versatile solutions. Gates’ insight into the evolving tech landscape proved to be strikingly accurate, as smartphones gradually replaced single-function devices like the iPod.

Bill Gates shares ‘tip’ from his childhood for parents

Bill Gates believes that the constant distractions of smartphones and social media would have hindered his path to becoming a billionaire. In a recent blog post, Gates reflected on his childhood which was marked by significant periods of unstructured time spent reading and thinking. He believes this developed his ability to focus and delve into deep thought which was crucial to his success.

Gates referred to Jonathan Haidt’s The Anxious Generation and questioned whether the existing technology-driven environment wouldn’t have allowed him to develop these habits. He even highlighted that excessive screen time, particularly on social media, has been linked to a surge in mental health issues among teenagers which includes anxiety, depression, eating disorders, self-harm, and decreased self-esteem.

A Scottish hiker named Heather faced detention at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport on Thursday after being caught with a Garmin inReach GPS device, which is banned in India. She was en route to Rishikesh when airport security flagged the device during a routine check and handed her over to the police. This is the second such case when a foreign national has been detained for carrying a GPS device. In December 2024, a Czech national was similarly detained at Goa airport when he was found with a Garmin Edge 540 GPS device (a cyclocomputer) in his baggage.Heather took to Instagram to recount the ordeal and warn fellow travelers. ""Do not bring a Garmin inReach or any satellite communicator to India,"" she wrote, emphasizing that such devices are prohibited in the country. In a video, she described contacting her embassy for assistance, only to be informed that there was little they could do since she was now under Indian legal jurisdiction. She also alleged that during her detention, she was denied access to water.Garmin inReach GPS is a satellite communicator. The device features a built-in satellite transmitter, and was found to be in violation of the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1933. The law prohibits the possession of wireless telegraphy equipment without a valid license.","Hiker was stopped by security at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport.

Read Nestaway co-founder Amarendra Sahu said

“…it has become very clear that … (the investors) had the ill intention right from the very beginning of the discussion regarding selling of the company to cheat me by not giving me the promised amount and dishonestly induced me to complete all the work for sale of the company and sign the sale document…”

“...due to the pandemic situation from 2020 to 2022, the company suffered heavy losses as its activity could not run…At this juncture, when the company was running under severe financial distress, the investors, namely – Goldman Sachs Singapore and Tiger Global Singapore, who were also board members in the company, left the board so as not to sustain any personal loss of money or reputation to them,”

What Nestaway’s investors and other accused told court

Amarendra Sahu , the co-founder of the home rental platform Nestaway Technologies , has filed criminal charges against the company's investors. Sahu accused the investors including Goldman Sachs , Tiger Global Management , Chiratae Ventures and Schroders Adveq of allegedly using cheating, forgery, intimidation and criminal conspiracy to sell Nestaway to Aurum PropTech in June 2023. Sahu, also the company's former CEO, has filed a complaint with an Economic Offences Wing in Odisha , alleging that the investors forced the sale of the Bengaluru-based company using forged documents and failed to pay him Rs 11.72 crore as promised.In the FIR , Sahu reportedly claimed:he further alleged.He accused the investors of forging documents with his signature to finalise the sale, even though he had resigned from the company's board beforehand. Sahu has also claimed that his co-founders Jitendra Jagadev (who is currently the CEO of Nestaway) and Smruti Ranjan Parida collaborated with the investors in this fraudulent deal.The investors have approached the Orissa High Court to dismiss the FIR. During a hearing on the Nestaway case last month, Justice SS Mishra of the Orissa High Court asked the investors accused of fraud to deposit Rs 11.72 crore with the investigating officer.However, the investors contested this order. They argued that Sahu, the Nestaway co-founder who filed the complaint, had previously raised similar concerns with regulatory bodies like SEBI and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.Additionally, the investors claimed that the promise of Rs 11.72 crore made to Sahu was withdrawn in February 2023, months before the company's sale in June.Aurum acquired Nestaway for Rs 90 crore, which was much lower than its previous valuation after the company's business was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The case is ongoing with the next hearing scheduled for January 9.","Nestaway co-founder Amarendra Sahu has filed criminal charges against the company's investors.

Several of VPN applications, including Cloudflare's popularapp, have been removed from app stores following government orders, marking the first major enforcement of India's 2022 VPN regulations.The Ministry of Home Affairs directed Apple and Google to pull more than half a dozen VPN apps from their respective stores, according to documents reviewed by TechCrunch. Affected services includeand, alongside Cloudflare's widely-used offering.The removals stem from the government’s 2022 cybersecurity framework, which requires VPN providers to maintain detailed customer records, including names, addresses, and IP addresses, for five years. Apple cited a ""demand"" from the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Center in its communication with affected developers, TechCrunch reported.This enforcement follows earlier resistance from major VPN providers. When the rules were announced in 2022, companies like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and SurfShark expressed strong opposition, with some removing their server infrastructure from India. While these providers continue serving Indian customers, they have ceased marketing their apps within the country.The regulations, which went into effect in mid-2022, apply to virtual private server providers, cloud services, and VPN operators, though corporate and enterprise VPNs are exempt. At the time of implementation, IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar stated that providers unwilling to comply with the new rules would need to exit the market.Neither the Ministry of Home Affairs nor Apple and Google, have responded to requests for comment on the recent removals.","Government orders force Apple and Google to pull VPN apps from app stores.

“As a new year begins, I have come to the view that this is the right time for me to move on from my role as President, Global Affairs at Meta. It truly has been an adventure of a lifetime! I am proud of the work I have been able to do leading and supporting teams across the company to ensure innovation can go hand in hand with increased transparency and accountability, and with new forms of governance.

My time at the company coincided with a significant resetting of the relationship between “big tech” and the societal pressures manifested in new laws, institutions and norms affecting the sector. I hope I have played some role in seeking to bridge the very different worlds of tech and politics – worlds that will continue to interact in unpredictable ways across the globe.

I will be forever grateful to Mark and Sheryl Sandberg for taking me on in the first place – and to the many colleagues and teams I have had the good luck to work with ever since. It has been an extraordinary privilege to gain a front row insight into what makes Silicon Valley such an enduring hub of world leading innovation.



And I am simply thrilled that my deputy, Joel Kaplan, will now become Meta’s Chief Global Affairs Officer. Over the years that we have worked together, we have become good friends as well as close colleagues – I have laughed with, as well as learned from, Joel in equal measure. He is quite clearly the right person for the right job at the right time! I much look forward to spending the next few months handing over the reins to Joel before finally leaving Meta after so many enjoyable years at the company.”

In a significant leadership change, Nick Clegg , Meta ’s Chief Global Affairs Officer , has announced his resignation from the company. Clegg, who has held the position since 2018, will be succeeded by Joel Kaplan , a long-serving executive with a prominent background in Republican politics.Clegg, the former Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and leader of the Liberal Democrats, has been instrumental in addressing Meta’s policies on elections and content regulation .

Bush, is expected to shape Meta’s global strategy and steer its approach to pressing policy challenges. Reacting to his appointment, Kaplan called the move “bittersweet,” acknowledging the significance of his predecessor’s contributions.Clegg described the timing of his departure as appropriate, expressing confidence in Kaplan’s ability to lead during what he called a transformative period for the company.

WhatsApp most-abused by cyber criminals

A new cyber fraud scheme, commonly referred to as the "" pig butchering scam "" or "" investment scam ,"" is targeting vulnerable groups such as unemployed youths, housewives, students, and financially distressed individuals. According to the Union Home Ministry’s latest annual report, victims are being manipulated into losing significant sums of money daily.The ""pig butchering scam"" is a type of cyber fraud that involves scammers building a long-term relationship with victims to ""fatten them up"" emotionally and financially before exploiting them. The name originates from the metaphor of fattening a pig before slaughter. It is believed to have started in China in 2016. Here's how it typically works:Scammers reach out to potential victims through social media platforms, messaging apps, dating sites, or even email. They often pose as friendly strangers, potential romantic partners, or financial advisors. The scammer spends weeks or even months gaining the victim’s trust by engaging in frequent conversations and forming a personal connection. This is the ""fattening"" phase.Once trust is established, the scammer introduces the victim to fake investment opportunities, often in cryptocurrency or stocks, claiming high returns with little to no risk. Victims are initially allowed to make small profits to further convince them of the scheme’s legitimacy. This encourages them to invest larger sums.When victims try to withdraw their earnings or recoup their investments, they are blocked, ignored, or asked for additional ""fees."" By this stage, the scammer disappears with the money.The report states that among social media platforms, WhatsApp remains the biggest social media platform that is possibly misused by cyber criminals in India. It adds that the cybercriminals are using sponsored Facebook to launch illegal lending applications in the country.“Such links are proactively identified and shared with Facebook, along with Facebook pages for necessary action,"" the report says.The data shows that 746 complaints were related to WhatsApp, 7651 against Telegram, 7152 against Instagram, 7051 against Facebook, and 1135 against YouTube till March 2024.The report also highlights that cybercriminals are leveraging Google services and platforms to initiate and execute these scams, raising concerns about the increasing sophistication of such fraudulent activities.“Google Advertisement platform provides a convenient facility for targeted advertisement from across the border. This scam, known as 'Pig Butchering Scam' or 'Investment Scam' is a global phenomenon and involves large-scale money laundering and even cyber slavery,” it said.","'Pig butchering scam' is a type of cyber fraud that involves scammers building a long-term relationship with victims to ""fatten them up"" emotionally and financially before exploiting them.

Vodafone Idea CEO hinted at affordable pricing

Halting subscriber losses top priority

Vodafone Idea (Vi) is preparing to launch its 5G mobile broadband service in March with aggressively priced plans, aiming to recapture market share from established 5G providers Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. According to a report in Economic Times (ET), Vodafone-Idea may offer 5G plans at up to 15% cheaper at entry levels — at a sharp discount to current offerings by Reliance Jio and Airtel. According to some leading telco broadband tariff trackers, there may be a 5G data price war in the offing.Vodafone Idea's initial 5G rollout will reportedly focus on approximately 75 major cities within its 17 priority circles, with specific emphasis on high data consumption industrial hubs. A Vi spokesperson has confirmed the impending launch, stating the company's commitment to providing competitive pricing and the best possible experience. The spokesperson also highlighted Vi’s sufficient 5G spectrum holdings in its priority markets, enabling enhanced 4G coverage and swift 5G deployment in key cities.Beyond discounted plans, Vodafone Idea is also considering increasing its investment in distribution. Industry analysts suggest the company may boost dealer commissions and promotional spending to attract high-value 5G prepaid users from its competitors. While Vodafone Idea did not directly comment on these potential strategies, data from Jefferies indicates that the company already allocates a larger percentage of its sales to dealer commissions (8.4% or ₹3,583 crore in FY24) compared to Jio (3% or ₹3,000 crore) and Airtel (4% or ₹6,000 crore).Reliance Jio and Airtel previously implemented tariff hikes in July 2024, raising the minimum cost for accessing their 5G services by requiring users to upgrade to higher-value base plans, a clear attempt to monetize their 5G networks. In contrast, Vodafone Idea CEO Akshaya Moondra hinted that Vodafone Idea's 5G base pricing would be lower than its competitors, with a final decision to be made closer to the launch date. This strategy reflects Vi's urgent need to improve its 4G coverage and introduce 5G in key markets to stem customer losses and compete effectively. By the end of September, Jio and Airtel had amassed 148 million and 105 million pure 5G users, respectively, highlighting the competitive landscape Vodafone Idea is entering.While some analysts caution that aggressive undercutting could negatively impact Vodafone Idea's average revenue per user (ARPU) and exacerbate its financial challenges, the company has recently secured ₹24,000 crore in equity funding and anticipates raising an additional ₹25,000 crore in debt following the government's waiver of bank guarantee requirements. This improved financial position gives Vi more flexibility to pursue its aggressive 5G strategy. Most observers agree that Vodafone Idea needs to prioritize halting user losses and then regain subscribers through a combined aggressive 4G and 5G approach.",Vodafone Idea is preparing to launch its 5G mobile broadband service in March.

Indian IT companies may have little to worry about H-1B visa says report; suggests these 'changes' in the visa programme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/indian-it-companies-may-have-little-to-worry-about-h-1b-visa-says-report-suggests-these-changes-in-the-visa-programme/articleshow/116893698.cms,"Concerns Regarding a Flat Wage Proposal

Recommendation for a Non-Employer-Specific Visa

India’s Position and Potential Impacts of Policy Shifts

Here’s a list of the top companies by H-1B sponsorship approvals in 2024:

The H-1B visas debate has stirred US political circles, dividng President-elect Donald Trump's MAGA supporters. Among these is Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk who has publicly said that he is willing to go to war over these visas. Musk sees keeping the pipeline open for tech and other skilled workers critical for the American economy. For those unaware, H-1B visa programme permits foreign-born computer scientists, engineers and other highly skilled workers to migrate to the United States.Trump too has thrown his weight behind Musk on the issue. Trump declared that he is a ""believer in H-1B"" visas, quashing the opposition to the programme for qualified professionals to work in the US. ""It's a great program,"" he told the New York Post. He said, ""I've always liked the visas; I have always been in favour of the visas. That's why we have them.""Now a new report from Macquarie Research analyzes the potential impact of H-1B visa policy reforms on Indian IT services firms, highlighting both opportunities and challenges. While Indian companies hold a relatively small share of total H-1B sponsorships, the report emphasizes the crucial role these visas play in addressing the US’ technical talent shortage and the difficulties of local hiring.The report underscores the persistent challenge of finding qualified technical professionals within the US. This difficulty is further evidenced by a low unemployment rate of 2.9% in November 2024 for professional and technical services within the US. This shortage makes the H-1B visa program a critical mechanism for bridging the talent gap and allowing US companies to access specialized skills from abroad, particularly from India.Despite the potential for policy shifts, Macquarie maintains an ""outperform"" rating for both TCS (with a target of ₹5,710) and HCLTech (with a target of ₹2,020). This suggests that Macquarie believes these Indian IT firms are well-positioned to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape. Effectively implemented visa reforms, particularly the proposed shift to a non-employer-specific permit, could create new growth opportunities for these companies while upholding fair labour practices internationally.Macquarie expresses significant concerns about proposals for a uniform, nationwide wage floor for H-1B visa holders. The report argues that such a flat wage is impractical due to substantial regional cost-of-living variations across the US. Implementing a uniform wage could exacerbate existing economic disparities between different regions. Macquarie stresses the need for a wage floor that considers local economic conditions to avoid unintended negative consequences.Instead of a flat wage floor, Macquarie recommends a significant shift in the H-1B visa structure: transforming it into a temporary, non-employer-specific work permit, similar to Norway’s skilled work permit system. This model would offer greater flexibility for workers, allowing them to change employers without needing a new visa, and would promote competition among employers. This change, according to the report, would also better protect worker rights.The Indian IT services sector is significantly intertwined with the US market, relying on it for both revenue and talent sourcing. While more stringent visa policies could present challenges for Indian professionals seeking opportunities in the US, some analysts believe they could also strengthen the offshoring model. Similar to the outsourcing boom of the 1990s and 2000s, this shift could lead to increased work being performed directly in India. India's developed infrastructure, extensive skilled workforce, and advanced communication networks make it well-positioned to capitalize on this potential shift.CareEdge Ratings has also pointed out the potential downside of H-1B system changes, noting that they could disrupt talent mobility and negatively impact the Indian IT sector, which relies heavily on outsourcing.Amazon Com Services LLC: 9,265 approvalsInfosys Limited: 8,140 approvalsCognizant Technology Solutions: 6,321 approvalsGoogle LLC: 5,364 approvalsTata Consultancy Services Limited: 5,274 approvalsMeta Platforms Inc: 4,844 approvalsMicrosoft Corporation: 4,725 approvalsApple Inc: 3,873 approvalsHCL America Inc: 2,953 approvalsIBM Corporation: 2,906 approvals",A new report from Macquarie Research analyzes the potential impact of H-1B visa policy reforms on Indian IT services firms.

How was Wingtech’s consumer electronics manufacturing business



Wingtech’s plans after selling its core business



Chinese company Wingtech Technology is selling its business to Apple supplier Luxshare Precision Industry . The company that supplied smartphone components to popular brands including Apple, Samsung and Xiaomi was recently added to a US trade blacklist . The company said that it is selling its consumer electronics manufacturing business to focus on semiconductors.In a regulatory filing (seen by the South China Morning Post), the company cited “changes in the geopolitical environment and the business development needs of the company” as the reason for this divestment. Wingtech has agreed to sell nine subsidiaries involved in the production of smartphones, tablets, and laptops to the parent company of Luxshare.However, the company clarified that its recently announced sale would exclude its semiconductor business . Wingtech also said that it has signed a letter of intent with Luxshare, and the final transaction will depend on the terms agreed upon by both parties and the completion of legal procedures.The Jiaxing, Zhejiang-based company was one of 140 Chinese organisations added to the Entity List by the US Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security in December. These regulations aim to address US national security concerns by restricting China’s capacity to develop advanced semiconductors.Founded in 2006, Wingtech is one of China’s largest mobile phone contract manufacturers and was the third-largest smartphone original design manufacturer globally in 2023.According to Counterpoint Research, the company accounts for 20.6% of outsourced handset volume. In 2023, the company's smartphone shipments grew by 7%, driven by new orders from Xiaomi, Samsung and Honor.Electronics manufacturing remains Wingtech's primary revenue source, generating 44.3 billion yuan (US$6 billion) in 2023—72% of its total annual revenue of 61.2 billion yuan.The company also had plans to expand overseas, focusing on AI-powered smartphones and PCs, despite challenges in the consumer electronics market.Wingtech entered the semiconductor sector in 2019 by acquiring Dutch firm Nexperia .While Nexperia stated in December that US technology restrictions on Wingtech do not apply to its operations, it would still adhere to the US regulations in dealings with its Chinese parent.In 2023, Wingtech’s semiconductor business generated 15.2 billion yuan in sales, a 5% decline due to weakened demand in the chip industry.Following its divestment plans, Wingtech aims to concentrate on its chip business, aspiring to become a leading player in the global power-semiconductor market, the report added.","Chinese company Wingtech Technology is selling its business to Apple supplier Luxshare Precision Industry.

This is when Apple may release iOS 18.2 software update,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-when-apple-may-release-ios-18-2-software-update/articleshow/114927798.cms,"Apple has launched iOS 18.1 with AI updates, and iOS 18.2 is expected in early December featuring ChatGPT integration, the Image Playground app, and custom Genmoji. December’s update will also include new English language variants. April’s iOS 18.4 will introduce Google Gemini integration, giving OpenAI some exclusivity for now.

Apple released iOS 18.1 with some AI features last week. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the company may release the next software update - iOS 18.2 in the first week of December – a bit earlier than usual. “The iOS 18.2 operating system update, which includes major improvements to Apple Intelligence […] is likely to arrive on the earlier side of December, I’m told. How early? The week of Dec. 2, barring any unexpected delays,” Gurman said in his latest PowerOn newsletter.Apple iOS 18.2 is said to come with major improvements to Apple Intelligence - like ChatGPT chatbot integration, the Image Playground app and custom emoji known as Genmoji . He also writes that the December iOS 18.2 update will begin offering varieties of English beyond the American version.He says that the “next major update to Apple Intelligence” – iOS 18.4 will be launching in April next year with future improvements like “integration with Google Gemini . But Apple will probably give OpenAI a nice window of exclusivity, especially since it isn’t exactly paying for the technology. So I wouldn’t expect the Gemini chatbot to arrive in iOS until next year,” he writes.","Apple iOS 18.2 is said to come with major improvements to Apple Intelligence - like ChatGPT chatbot integration, the Image Playground app and custom emoji known as Genmoji.

Microsoft's 'Big India' Bet

Redmond giant Microsoft is bullish on India's AI future. Microsoft is optimistic about the future of technology spending in India, with a particular focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Puneet Chandok , President of Microsoft India and South Asia, believes that AI, particularly with the rise of tools like Copilot, is gaining significant traction across various industries.In an interview to PTI, Chandok said the general perception around AI has shifted from skepticism to optimism, and now to real impact on the ground, with emergence of ""real, interesting use cases"". While Microsoft is excited about the potential of AI, the company is also committed to responsible AI practices. Chandok emphasized the importance of data privacy , transparency, and bias mitigation in AI development. Microsoft is actively working to ensure that its AI technologies are developed and used ethically.He said that 'security' has to be built by design, and can ""never be an afterthought"". ""It is job number one, security is above everything else. So we are focused on making sure that what we are building is secure for our customers, data is safeguarded, privacy, biases, transparency, all those principles are kept in mind as we build the products,"" he said.Chandok emphasized that India is one of Microsoft's fastest-growing regions globally and a prime opportunity for technological innovation. ""From a demand perspective, more than 7,000 listed companies are in India... a massive runway... third largest startup ecosystem in the world. So we're excited about that... 60 million-plus small and medium businesses... So that is a real opportunity from a demand perspective.""On the supply side, if I look at GitHub , India is just behind the US, and close to 15 million developers in India are now on GitHub. We will overtake the US in the next two or three years,"" he said, referring to the Microsoft-owned software development platform.India's large and growing tech talent pool, coupled with its burgeoning startup ecosystem, positions the country as a global AI hub. Chandok noted that India is home to a significant number of AI researchers and developers and that the country's workforce is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Citing estimates to back the company's optimism about the region, he said one is six AI researchers or AI developers in the world come from India.""There's a recent study which said every fourth employee that will get added to the workforce in the next 10 years will come from India. So I think just the impact that we have on the world is incredibly important,"" he said.","Microsoft is optimistic about the future of technology spending in India, with a particular focus on artificial intelligence (AI) India is one of Microsoft's fastest-growing regions globally and a prime opportunity for technological innovation.

Nvidia is replacing Intel in this 128-year-old Index,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-is-replacing-intel-in-this-128-year-old-index/articleshow/114920539.cms,"Intel Out

What the change means for Dow Jones

Chipmaker Nvidia is joining the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJIA ), the oldest of Wall Street's three main stock market indexes. This marks a significant shift for the index and reflects the growing importance of AI technology.The Santa Clara, California-based company will replace Intel in the 128-year-old DJIA Index, starting on November 8. This move comes after Nvidia's stock performance, surging 900% in the past two years, fueled by the AI revolution. Notably, the DJIA was the only major US index that didn't previously include Nvidia.Scott Colyer , CEO of Advisors Asset Management told Bloomberg, “Nvidia is a well-run company and joining the Dow demonstrates just how powerful its rally has been in recent years after it was at the right place at the right time when no one else was.”With a market value of $3.32 trillion, Nvidia now sits just behind Apple for the title of the world's most valuable company. The recent stock split has made Nvidia shares more accessible, potentially paving the way for them to surpass Apple in market value.Meanwhile, Intel, once a dominant force in computer processors, is being removed from the DJIA. The company has faced challenges in recent years, leading to spending cuts, job reductions, and suspended investor payouts. Their stock price has fallen significantly, reflecting these struggles.""Intel has fallen behind,"" said Adam Sarhan, founder of 50 Park Investments. ""The Dow needs to keep pace with the current market, and Intel no longer represents the strongest companies out there.""This reshuffle is part of an ongoing effort to modernize the DJIA. The index, which began with 12 industrial stocks, has expanded to 30 companies across various sectors like technology, finance, and healthcare. However, it has faced criticism for being narrower than other major indexes like the S&P 500 and lacking representation from the tech giants driving market growth.The selection process for the DJIA prioritizes price over market value, which previously excluded expensive tech stocks like Nvidia before its recent stock splits. This change paves the way for a more comprehensive picture of the American economy in the DJIA.","Chipmaker Nvidia is joining the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJIA ), the oldest of Wall Street's three main stock market indexes.

What the new group will do

Walt Disney Company has reportedly formed a new group, the Office of Technology Enablement, to explore the use of emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence ( AI ) and mixed reality to enhance its offerings across film, television and theme park divisions.Citing an email, a report by news agency Reuters said that the newly-formed group will be led by Jamie Voris, the film studio's chief technology officer who headed development of Disney's app for the Apple Vision Pro mixed reality device.“The pace and scope of the advances in AI and XR (extended reality) are profound and will continue to impact consumer experiences, creative endeavours and our businesses for years to come - making it critical that Disney explore the exciting opportunities and navigate the potential risks,” stated Alan Bergman, Co-Chairman of Disney Entertainment.The Office of Technology Enablement will focus on technologies like AI and mixed reality, which seamlessly blends the physical and digital worlds. While the group will not centralise technological efforts, it will ensure alignment with Disney’s broader strategic goals, the report said.Voris will report to Bergman and the new group is expected to grow to about 100 employees, a person familiar with the matter was quoted as saying.Disney has been actively exploring the potential of augmented reality , virtual reality , and mixed reality across its various divisions. The company has assembled a team of experts, including Kyle Laughlin, a seasoned veteran in augmented and virtual reality, to drive innovation in these areas.Tech companies have sold about 1.7 million AR/VR headsets so far this year, as per market research firm IDC.","Walt Disney Company has reportedly formed a new group, the Office of Technology Enablement, to explore the use of emerging technologies.

Nothing CEO Carl Pei: ‘..operating systems haven’t really changed for 40 years’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nothing-ceo-carl-pei-operating-systems-havent-really-changed-for-40-years/articleshow/114908493.cms,"Nothing CEO on AI-integration into OS

Nothing CEO Carl Pei said that Nothing may build its own mobile operating system . Speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024, founder and CEO confirmed that the company is exploring what a true Nothing OS may look like. Addressing the duo monopoly of Google and Alphabet, he said “We’re thinking about how we maneuver here,” before adding “and maybe create something of our own. Some kind of operating system.”“Now you can make impact on the software side,” Pei explained. “You can change how people use their devices. On the business side, it’s also very lucrative. In some ways, it kind of sucks to be a hardware company, because the supply chain, high capex, low margins, and high risk for product market fit. In a lot of ways, having some software revenue is a lot more comfortable: higher margins. But I think the most important thing is still to satisfy the consumer.”“If you think about the tech stack for what an OS is, I don’t think we need to work on the lower parts of the stack — drivers and how hardware connects to software and the kernel. I don’t think we need to work on that, but we should work on innovating the user experience, because operating systems haven’t really changed for 40 years. These computers, smartphones, and these devices have so much information on us. We do so much on them, but they don’t leverage any of that information to make the experience any better.”He said that the company intends to incorporate advanced artificial intelligence (AI) into Nothing OS. He said that AI has simplified the OS development process. He stated that AI will be an important piece of such an operating system, but not the be-all and end-all.“We shouldn’t call it the AI operating system,” he said. “AI is just a tool, and ultimately it comes down to who can make the best product, who can create the best market fit, get the highest user satisfaction. Because in the absence of that, it’s just not going to work.”","Nothing CEO Carl Pei said that Nothing may build its own mobile operating system.

Reliance enters in partnership with Nvidia

The 2024 Nvidia AI Summit in Mumbai saw Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar rubbing shoulders with Jensen Huang , CEO of AI giant Nvidia. While the summit focused on strengthening India's AI capabilities, their encounter ended with a surprising discussion – martial arts.Kumar, a known martial arts enthusiast, shared a photo on social media X, formerly known as Twitter, where he and Huang pose playfully in a fighting stance. The caption reads: ""Imagine meeting the world’s biggest authority on Artificial Intelligence and ending up chatting about martial arts!! What an amazing man you are Mr. #JensenHuang. Now I know why @nvidia is the absolute giant that it is. 😊👍🏻""Nvidia's leather-jacket-clad CEO Huang got a rock star welcome at the company's AI summit in India. As a Bloomberg report said, ""The reception Huang received in India's commercial capital Mumbai was reminiscent of the ""Jensanity"" seen in other parts of the world, especially Taiwan, as his popularity climbs with Nvidia's soaring earnings and multi-trillion dollar market valuation.""Huang praised India's rapid digitalisation and its potential in the AI sector. ""Very few countries have this amazing natural resource called IT and computer science expertise,"" he said.The event, where the U.S. company unveiled plans to supply Reliance Industries and other Indian firms with its AI chips, had to be reportedly delayed for more than half an hour due to the crowd that one Nvidia employee said was ""easily a few thousand"".Nvidia CEO Huang and Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced a strategic partnership to build state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India at the summit. The collaboration aims to accelerate India's transformation into a global AI powerhouse by leveraging the nation's vast talent pool and burgeoning digital infrastructure. ""We are among the only countries where the average age of 1.4 billion people is below 35,"" he noted. Ambani emphasised that India's aspirations, combined with the visionary leadership of the Indian Prime Minister, have set the stage for a digital revolution. ""We are at the doorstep of the new intelligence age,"" he said.","Jensen Huang, CEO of AI giant Nvidia, met Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar at the 2024 Nvidia AI Summit in Mumbai.

When I look to the next phase of Microsoft, both in terms of our scale and our massive opportunity ahead, it’s clear that we need to continue adding exceptional talent at every level of the organization to increase our depth and capability across our business priorities – spanning security, quality, and

AI

innovation.

With that context, I’m excited to share that Jay Parikh is joining Microsoft as a member of the senior leadership team (SLT), reporting to me. Jay was the global head of engineering at Facebook (now Meta) and most recently was CEO of Lacework. He has an impressive track record, with a unique combination of experiences building and scaling technical teams that serve both commercial customers and consumers. His deep connections across the start-up and VC ecosystems, coupled with his leadership roles at Akamai and Ning, will bring valuable perspective to Microsoft.

Over the years I’ve known Jay, I’ve admired him as a technology leader and respected engineer with a deep commitment to driving innovation and striving for operational excellence. His focus extends beyond technology, with his passion for and dedication to developing people, fostering a strong culture, and building world-class talent, all in service of delivering faster value to customers and driving business growth. In fact, there are very few leaders in our industry with Jay’s experience in leading teams through the rapid growth and scale required to support today’s largest internet businesses.

As he onboards, Jay will immerse himself in learning about our company priorities and our culture and will spend time connecting with our senior leaders and meeting with customers, partners, and employees around the world. We will share more on his role and focus in the next few months.

Please join me in welcoming Jay to Microsoft.

Satya

What Parikh has to say

I’m excited to be joining the awesome team at Microsoft. From my earliest conversations with Satya, Microsoft’s commitment to leading the AI platform shift is absolutely clear. This shift not only is a tremendous opportunity, but it is incomprehensibly complex - both of these aspects are the perfect combination for what I’m drawn to. Microsoft’s ambitions are vast - ranging from cloud to individual/team productivity, to developer tools and ecosystem, to gaming, to professional social networking, to quantum computing, to sustainability and much more. This is an extraordinary team of talented people across the planet that I’m excited to learn from. Thank you, Satya, Kathleen, Scott, Charlie, Rajesh Jha, Kevin, Amy Hood, Amy Coleman, Brian Toland, Caitlin McCabe, and several others for a wonderful welcome. I’m eager to start.

What issues are being flagged

Microsoft 's recent update to its consumer-focused Copilot AI assistant has been met with criticism from both users and employees , a report has said. It added that the testers have raised questions about the effectiveness of the revamp, which was led by Mustafa Suleyman , the former DeepMind co-founder hired to spearhead Microsoft's consumer AI efforts.On October 1, Microsoft released a major update which Suleyman said is “an AI companion for everyone” that offers more intuitive design, more digestible, speedy and fluent answers. It was touted as a significant step towards a more conversational and helpful AI companion.On Blind, a private message board for verified employees, Microsoft staff expressed their disappointment, a report by Business Insider said.While some employees and users said that the new version is worse than the previous incarnation, another commented ""Absolutely ruined.""“The new Copilot is a step backward,” another person wrote in the Microsoft group on Blind, with a third adding, “The new Copilot update is bad.”Users complain about various issues, including freezing, slow response times, less informative outputs, and the removal of features like real-time information and the ability to delete old conversations.Some users also expressed dissatisfaction with the shift towards an ""AI companion"" approach, stating a preference for a more functional tool.On app stores, one of the users said that the Copilot “was so good before updating to this version.” Another said the Copilot app is ""dumbed down and less functional”; ""Why release such an amazing app and then update it to what it is now?"" a third reviewer wrote, as per the report.There was one positive review that complimented the app's new user interface for being ""designed for general users.""“Today, you are seeing the first careful steps in this direction with an emphasis on creating a simpler, calmer experience and giving everyone access to new Voice capabilities that unlock a new way of communicating with AI that's much more natural, and more fun,” said Kumar, a Microsoft general manager.However, users appeared unimpressed with the move as they “want a tool” and “not a friend.”","Microsoft's consumer-focused Copilot AI assistant has been met with criticism from both users and employees.

"Elderly woman loses Rs 50,000 in money transfer scam: What is this online scam targeting senior citizens and how to stay safe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elderly-woman-loses-rs-50000-in-money-transfer-scam-what-is-this-online-scam-targeting-senior-citizens-and-how-to-stay-safe/articleshow/114849231.cms,"What is money transferring scam?

How these scams work:

Impersonation: Scammers often impersonate trusted individuals like family members, bank officials, or government authorities. Urgency tactics: They create a sense of urgency, claiming that immediate action is required to avoid financial loss or legal trouble. Manipulative techniques: Scammers use emotional manipulation to persuade victims to transfer money or share sensitive information. Complex schemes: Some scams involve elaborate schemes with multiple stages, making it difficult for victims to identify the fraud.

How to protect yourself:

Educate yourself: Stay informed about the latest scams and techniques used by fraudsters. Verify information: Never share personal or financial information with anyone unless you're absolutely certain of their identity. Be wary of urgent requests: If someone is pressuring you to transfer money immediately, be cautious and verify the request through independent channels. Avoid clicking suspicious links: Don't click on links in emails or messages from unknown senders. Use strong passwords: Create strong, unique passwords for your online accounts and enable two-factor authentication. Be skeptical of unexpected calls and emails: If you receive an unexpected call or email asking for personal information or money, be wary and verify the sender's identity. Talk to trusted individuals: Discuss any suspicious activity with family members, friends, or financial advisors. Report scams: If you believe you've been a victim of a scam, report it to the local authorities and your bank.

Recently, a senior citizen from Noida, in her 60s, was recently targeted by a money transfer scam . The scammer, posing as a client of her husband, convinced her to transfer nearly Rs 50,000. Trusting the caller's familiarity with her husband's name, she proceeded with the transfers. However, before she could realise the scam, the transaction was complete, and the scammer's phone number was deactivated.Senior citizens are increasingly becoming targets of online scams , particularly those involving money transfers. These scams often exploit trust and vulnerability, resulting in significant financial losses for the victims.A money transfer scam is a type of fraud where a scammer tricks a victim into transferring money to their account. These scams often rely on social engineering tactics, such as phishing emails, phone calls, or text messages, to deceive victims.","A money transfer scam is a type of fraud where a scammer tricks a victim into transferring money to their account.

​How this Okta security flaw exposed accounts with long usernames,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-this-okta-security-flaw-exposed-accounts-with-long-usernames/articleshow/114893747.cms,"Take a look a the post here



How this security flaw can be a serious concern



Okta , has disclosed a vulnerability that allowed users to bypass password authentication under specific conditions. In its latest security advisory sent to its users, the identity and access management provider noted that the vulnerability affected accounts with usernames of 52 characters or more and required the presence of a stored cache key from a previous successful login. However, to access them without passwords, the account's owner had to have previous history of logging in using that browser. This notice was also shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter).This flaw, which was introduced in a July update, was discovered and fixed last month by the company. Okta also assured users that organisations requiring multi-factor authentication were not affected.A Forbes report cited the company which said: ““A precondition for this vulnerability is that the username must be or exceed 52 characters any time a cache key is generated for the user.”However, a 52-character username is easier to guess than a random password. It can be someone’s email address, containing their full name and their organisation’s domain. Its also important to note that suchlong usernames are also rare.This vulnerability also highlights a potential security risk for accounts with long usernames and a history of logins from the same browser. Okta has recommended users who meet these conditions to review their access logs for any unauthorised activity.Okta offers software that simplifies adding authentication services to apps for companies to provide a unified login experience across multiple apps. This saves end-users from the need to verify their identities separately for each one.The company hasn’t stated whether it knows of anyone affected by this particular issue but has earlier promised to ""communicate more rapidly with customers"" after the Lapsus$ threat group accessed a few user accounts.","Okta has disclosed a vulnerability that allowed users to bypass password authentication under specific conditions.

Tony Fadell , former Apple executive and creator of the iPod , defended Apple's cautious approach to artificial intelligence . Speaking at the 2024 TechCrunch Disrupt conference, Fadell acknowledged the not-so-overwhelming first impressions but emphasised the strategy's long-term benefits.""People were like, 'I downloaded it,' and they were like, 'Apple's AI is meh,'"" Fadell said.

Cook attributed this surge to strong interest in Apple Intelligence features.The company plans to release additional AI capabilities in December, initially in US English before expanding to the UK, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand.

The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (Cyber Centre), part of the Communications Security Establishment Canada ( CSE ), recently released its National Cyber Threat Assessment 2025-2026 (NCTA 2025-2026).NCTA 2025-2026 claims to ""provide the Canadian public with CSE’s current insights on the state and non-state cyber threat actors conducting malicious cyber threat activity against Canada and how we assess the cyber threat landscape will evolve in the next two years."" The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (Cyber Centre) is Canada's technical authority on cyber security, and part of the Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSE).The report, whose last edition was issued two years ago, comes amid an escalating diplomatic row between the two countries. The relations between India and Canada are at their lowest following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 's allegations in September last year of a ""potential"" involvement of Indian agents in Khalistan extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar 's killing. The Indian government has rejected Trudeau's charges as ""absurd"".This is the first time that Canada has named India in a list of cyberthreat adversaries, suggesting that state-sponsored actors could be spying against it. Incidentally, there was no mention of India in the National Cyber Threat Assessment reports of 2018, 2020 and 2023-24.The report names India among the five countries that it terms ""state-sponsored actors"" likely engaged in cyberspying against Canada. India is ranked fifth in this list, the other four are: China, Russia, Iran and North Korea; ranked in the same order.“India's leadership almost certainly aspires to build a modernised cyber programme with domestic cyber capabilities. India very likely uses its cyber programme to advance its national security imperatives, including espionage, counterterrorism, and the country's efforts to promote its global status and counter narratives against India and the Indian government,” the assessment report said.“We assess that India's cyber programme likely leverages commercial cyber vendors to enhance its operations. We assess that Indian state-sponsored cyber threat actors likely conduct cyber threat activity against Government of Canada networks for the purpose of espionage,” it said further.“We judge that official bilateral relations between Canada and India will very likely drive Indian state-sponsored cyber threat activity against Canada,” it claimed.India has slammed Canada for naming it in the list of countries considered cyber threat ""adversaries"", describing the ""categorisation"" as another example of the Canadian strategy to ""attack"" the country. The Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""Another category, Canada has put India into. This categorisation is as per the cyber report that they have issued. It appears to be another example of a Canadian strategy to attack India."" While rejecting India being bracketed in that category, the MEA spokesperson said, ""You first state absurd and baseless things and then level such an accusation against us.

So, as that shift occurred, obviously, this became a bigger margin implication, both for Lunar Lake and for the company overall. But we were very pleased to have the option to scale Lunar Lake and higher volume because of the momentum energy around the AIPC category. That said, a volume product and a volume industry like the

PC industry

, you don't want to have volume memory going through that channel. It's not a good way to run the business.

So, it really is, for us, a one-off with Lunar Lake. That will not be the case with Panther Lake, Nova Lake and its successors as well. We'll build it in a more traditional way with memory off-package and the CPU, GPU, NPU and I/O capabilities in the package. But volume memory will be off-package in the road map going forward.

And we won't have this kind of impact that we're dealing with for '25 in the margin structure, specifically around Lunar Lake. But again, it's a great product and we're happy that we have it in the portfolio, and we've scaled it commensurate with the enthusiasm of the AIPC category.

Intel is reversing a major design decision in its laptop chips, CEO Pat Gelsinger has said. The change will come in the form of abandoning the on-package memory approach introduced with its Lunar Lake processors.During the earnings call, the company executives said that the Lunar Lake chip has the memory in the package that affects the gross margins. Gelsinger said that going-forward upcoming chips will have memory sticks .This announcement comes as a surprise as it had previously touted the benefits of on-package memory, particularly its potential to improve battery life in laptops by reducing power consumption associated with data transfer.Intel said that the change reduces the power consumption of moving data through the system by approximately 40%.","Intel is reversing a major design decision in its laptop chips, CEO Pat Gelsinger has said.

Two new changes have come to UPI starting November 1. The National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) has introduced an auto top-up feature and increased transaction limits for UPI Lite , effective November 1, 2024, to streamline small-value digital payments.Under these new guidelines, users can now make transactions up to Rs 1,000 without entering a PIN, doubled from the previous limit of Rs 500.

Users can set their preferred top-up amount through their UPI app, with a limit of five automatic recharges per day.""This will support quick, PIN-less payments below Rs 500,"" said a statement from NPCI, which introduced the auto top-up functionality on August 27, 2024.To use the auto top-up feature, users need to set up a mandate through their UPI app, authorising automatic fund transfers from their bank account to their UPI Lite wallet. Users retain control with the option to cancel the mandate at any time.These enhancements will make UPI Lite more convenient for daily small-value transactions while maintaining security through transaction limits and controlled usage.In October 2024, NPCI recorded 16.58 billion UPI transactions totaling Rs 23.5 trillion.

A recent report by The Verge cited sources and posts on the anonymous workplace forum Blind suggesting that the job cuts are expected to be announced soon. The report doesn’t reveal the exact number of employees that may get affected by the rumoured round of layoffs.This round of layoffs follows an unusual request made to X employees two months ago, where they were asked to submit one-page summaries highlighting their contributions to the company. However, the reports confirm whether these summaries played a role in the decision to lay off employees.Another report by Benzinga claims that the expected job cuts may primarily affect the engineering department at X.X, formerly known as Twitter, has experienced significant changes and multiple rounds of layoffs since Musk's $44 billion acquisition of the company in 2022. If the rumours are to be true, this move may be a part of the ongoing restructuring and potential cost-cutting measures at the social media company.The rebranded social media platform has also faced a major drop in valuation. Fidelity , an investor in the acquisition, recently valued X below $10 billion. This shows a major difference in the company’s current value and its purchase price.Musk's controversial decision to fire 85% of Twitter's staff after the acquisition also raised concerns about the platform's stability and future. This latest valuation further underscores the challenges facing X as it navigates a changing social media landscape.This isn't the first time Musk has overseen significant layoffs. Earlier this year, his electric vehicle company Tesla also reduced its workforce by at least 14%. These actions highlight Musk's aggressive approach to cost-cutting and restructuring, even at the expense of employee retention and potentially, platform stability.",Elon Musk-owned social media platform X (earlier Twitter ) is reportedly undergoing another wave of layoffs.

In the world of tech giants, few companies have shaped digital communication and online connectivity as significantly as Meta, formerly known as Facebook. Since its founding, Meta has grown from a small social networking site to a global powerhouse, expanding its reach through platforms like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus VR. Among those at the core of this evolution is Naomi Gleit, one of Meta’s longest-serving executives and its current head of product. Joining as the 29th employee when the company was still Facebook , Gleit has worked alongside CEO Mark Zuckerberg for nearly two decades, witnessing first hand his leadership style, personal growth, and evolving vision. Recently, Gleit shared insights into Zuckerberg’s leadership on “Lenny’s Podcast,” where she spoke about lessons learned from Zuckerberg, her experiences at Meta, and the unique aspects of the company’s culture.Naomi Gleit’s career at Meta began in the early days of Facebook, where she quickly became one of Zuckerberg’s most trusted employees. Joining as employee No. 29, Gleit’s tenure at Meta is second only to Zuckerberg. Over time, she has risen through the ranks to become the head of product, overseeing various critical aspects of Meta’s expansive product line. Her role provides her with a unique vantage point, allowing her to observe Zuckerberg’s leadership from close quarters. With a 19-year career alongside Zuckerberg, her experiences provide a rare, detailed look into the growth of Meta and Zuckerberg’s personal development as a leader.One of the standout qualities Gleit mentioned about Zuckerberg is his commitment to lifelong learning. She described him as a “learn-it-all” rather than a “know-it-all,” highlighting his exceptional ability to acquire new skills quickly. A well-known example is Zuckerberg’s dedication to learning Mandarin as part of his annual personal challenge. Within a year, he achieved proficiency equivalent to an eighth-grade level, an accomplishment that reflects his discipline and determination to broaden his abilities. This approach underlines Zuckerberg’s philosophy that success requires continuous improvement and adaptability.Gleit noted that Zuckerberg’s mindset toward learning isn’t limited to technical skills or languages; it also extends to leadership and interpersonal growth. He actively pursues feedback and advice, and applies these insights to refine his management style. This commitment has helped him adapt as the company grew, ensuring that he remains an effective leader amid the rapid changes in the tech landscape.During their time working together, Gleit and Zuckerberg have engaged in various mentorship initiatives. Roughly a decade ago, they co-taught a business-building course at an East Palo Alto middle school, where Zuckerberg shared a four-step approach to life. This philosophy is simple yet profound:Gleit highlighted that these steps illustrate key aspects of Zuckerberg’s outlook on life and leadership. This philosophy reflects the importance of self-acceptance and personal resilience before taking on the responsibility of leading others. For Zuckerberg, “focus on what you can control” is particularly crucial, as it encourages clarity and determination. Each of these steps continues to influence Zuckerberg’s management style, from how he makes executive decisions to his approach to Meta’s organisational challenges.A defining trait of Meta’s workplace culture is its emphasis on candid feedback, a value strongly upheld by Zuckerberg himself. According to Gleit, Zuckerberg actively fosters an environment where employees at all levels feel comfortable giving and receiving feedback. She emphasised the importance of honest feedback in ensuring that leaders remain grounded and connected to the reality of the business, especially as fame and success increase.Meta’s commitment to direct feedback has been demonstrated by Zuckerberg on several occasions. For example, he has been known to engage directly with his leadership team, challenging their ideas and pushing for deeper analysis. However, he also encourages open dialogue, ultimately valuing input from his team and, in many cases, adopting their suggestions. This feedback-driven culture ensures that Meta’s leadership remains transparent and connected with the broader team.Other executives at Meta, including CTO Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, have noted Zuckerberg’s unique approach to feedback. Bosworth explained that Zuckerberg often starts by questioning ideas presented to him, asking team members to defend their positions. This approach, known as “pressure testing,” helps refine ideas before they are implemented. Despite the rigorous questioning, Zuckerberg often accepts the team’s recommendations after thorough evaluation, highlighting his open-minded approach to leadership.Meta has undergone significant organisational shifts in recent years, including a major restructuring as part of Zuckerberg’s “year of efficiency” in 2023. This period involved changes to performance reviews and organisational hierarchies, aimed at creating a leaner and more focused company. Gleit pointed out that Zuckerberg’s emphasis on efficiency is part of a larger vision to ensure Meta’s long-term success in an increasingly competitive environment.As a part of this transition, Meta implemented tougher performance evaluations, leading to substantial layoffs and structural adjustments. Zuckerberg has addressed these changes publicly, often with blunt honesty, acknowledging that not all employees may be suited for the company’s evolving goals. His direct communication style aligns with his emphasis on transparency and his commitment to creating a culture of accountability within Meta.As Meta celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2024, Zuckerberg took the opportunity to reflect on the company’s legacy and his own growth as a leader. Looking back, he expressed some regret about allowing external opinions to shape public perception of Meta’s actions. He emphasised the importance of authenticity and the lessons he has learned from both criticism and support over the years. His reflections reveal a desire to present a more genuine image to the world, acknowledging the impact of his early experiences on his approach to public communication.","Naomi Gleit is the head of product at Meta, formerly known as Facebook.

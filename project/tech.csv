Steve Bannon asked Donald Trump to revisit H-1B visa law enacted in 1990

President Donald Trump's aide and former adviser Steve Bannon has been a vocal critic of the H-1B visa programme. He has slammed H-1B visa holders on numerous occasions. In a recent podcast, Bannon said that America does not need any foreign students and that they should not be given more than 30 days to stay in America after the completion of their degree. He then went on to add that an Exit Visa should be stapled to their passports. The H-1B visa program allows American companies to hire foreign workers for specialty occupations and is used dominantly by the tech companies.""I don’t think you should have any foreign students in the country right now. No H1B visas. Instead of stapling a green card to their diploma, staple an exit visa. You get 30 days to hang out with classmates, do alumni stuff, then leave. The countries of the world won’t get better if you’re sucking up every piece of talent. That’s how the British ran their empire. It’s imperial,"" wrote Bannon.Late last month during another podcast, Bannon said that the US needs to cut all Visa programmes: ""We need to cut all visa programs. If you need an Einstein, there’s always a way to get one in. But I’m also a big advocate of sending those Einsteins home and having them make their countries great again. That’s how you get peace and prosperity worldwide.""Speaking with The All-In podcast hosts on a panel at the ""Winning the AI Race"" AI Summit last month, Vice President JD Vance blasted Big Tech companies for firing American workers and then claiming they need visas for foreign labor. ""Well, wait a second,"" Vance said, explaining his thought process. ""If you're not hiring American workers coming out of colleges for these jobs, then how can you say that you have a massive shortage in these jobs? ""And by the way, you see some Big Tech companies where they'll lay off 9,000 workers, and then they'll apply for a bunch of overseas visas,"" he added. His comments are said to be referencing Microsoft that announced 9,000 layoffs at the beginning of July amid reports that the company had applied for 9,000-plus H1-B visas.In December 2024, Steve Bannon called the H-1B visa programme a ""a total and complete scam to destroy the American worker"" and demanded ""reparations for tech workers."" He even went on to target Tesla CEO Elon Musk for his support of it. He also claimed that the program allows tech companies to import cheap labor while undermining the talented US workers.",Bannon has been a vocal critic of the H-1B visa programme.

"Google preserves popular goo.gl URLs, retires the rest",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-preserves-popular-goo-gl-urls-retires-the-rest/articleshow/123075888.cms,"google

In an important update to its link -shortening service, Google has announced it will preserve ""actively used"" goo.gl links, while all other links created with the service will stop functioning on August 1st. The decision provides a reprieve for many users who were bracing for a complete shutdown of the legacy service.The company, which had previously announced the deprecation of goo.gl, clarified its new policy in a blog post aimed at developers and users. According to the post, links that have received a significant number of clicks or are embedded in frequently accessed content will be identified as ""actively used"" and will continue to work indefinitely. This move aims to prevent widespread link rot on the internet, a concern that had been raised by webmasters and digital archivists.For links that do not meet the ""actively used"" criteria, the redirection service will cease to function, resulting in a 404 error for users who click on them. Google encouraged creators of these links to update their content with a new redirection service.“Nine months ago, we redirected URLs that showed no activity in late 2024 to a message specifying that the link would be deactivated in August, and these are the only links targeted to be deactivated. If you get a message that states, “This link will no longer work in the near future”, the link won't work after August 25 and we recommend transitioning to another URL shortener if you haven’t already. All other goo.gl links will be preserved and will continue to function as normal. To check if your link will be retained, visit the link today. If your link redirects you without a message, it will continue to work,” Google said in a blog post.The move underscores the challenge of managing a vast and ever-changing internet infrastructure. While the transition may still require some effort from users and developers, Google's decision to maintain active links shows a commitment to preserving the web's functionality and historical content.","Google will preserve ""actively used"" goo.gl links, while all other links created with the service will stop functioning on August 1st.

Apple vs. Apple: The unexpected legal battle shaking up Hollywood and Silicon Valley,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-vs-apple-the-unexpected-legal-battle-shaking-up-hollywood-and-silicon-valley/articleshow/123074215.cms,"Apple’s legal move: What triggered the lawsuit





Trademark denial and ignored warnings

Apple argues risk of brand dilution

What’s at stake and what comes next

Apple Inc. has filed a federal lawsuit against Apple Cinemas , a growing U.S. movie theatre chain, accusing it of trademark infringement and brand exploitation . The lawsuit, filed in Massachusetts, comes as the cinema chain prepares for an ambitious expansion across 100 locations nationwide — including new outlets in San Francisco, just miles from Apple’s Cupertino headquarters. Apple argues that the similarity in names is likely to mislead consumers into thinking the two companies are affiliated, especially as the tech giant becomes increasingly active in the film and entertainment sector.Although Apple Cinemas was founded in 2010 and opened its first theatre in 2013, Apple had not taken legal action until now. The situation changed when the theatre chain expanded westward in 2025, launching a new flagship location in San Francisco and teasing further locations near Apple retail stores. According to Apple, this proximity to its home base and retail hubs, combined with the theatre's use of the term ""Apple,"" poses a risk of consumer confusion. Apple Cinemas previously applied to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to register ""Apple Cinemas"" and ""ACX – Apple Cinematic Experience,"" but both applications were rejected. The USPTO ruled the names could cause confusion with Apple Inc.'s established trademarks. Apple also sent cease-and-desist letters to Sand Media, the chain’s owner, which reportedly received no response. Apple’s legal filing claims all efforts to resolve the issue amicably were ignored.In its complaint, Apple alleges that Apple Cinemas is “knowingly and intentionally using the name Apple to sow confusion for its own benefit.” It also cites social media chatter and marketing language from the cinema that could imply a connection with the tech firm — particularly around the release of Apple’s own films, like F1: The Movie, which is currently screening in Apple Cinemas’ San Francisco location. Apple claims this undermines the uniqueness and value of its brand.Apple is seeking an injunction to stop Apple Cinemas from using the “Apple” name and possibly force a rebranding of its entire chain. The company is also pursuing monetary damages for the alleged infringement. The case raises important questions about brand rights, especially when two companies operate in different industries but share similar commercial spaces, such as media and entertainment. If Apple prevails, it could set a legal precedent for future trademark cases across sectors.In a broader context, this lawsuit reflects Apple’s increasing sensitivity to brand dilution as it expands into new domains beyond hardware and software. Legal experts suggest that the outcome could have broader implications, potentially influencing how tech giants enforce trademarks across adjacent industries—especially as traditional boundaries between technology, entertainment, and retail continue to blur.","Apple Inc. has filed a federal lawsuit against Apple Cinemas, accusing it of trademark infringement and brand exploitation.

Elon Musk’s X accused of hosting child pornography content; must face revived lawsuit over negligence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-x-accused-of-hosting-child-pornography-content-must-face-revived-lawsuit-over-negligence/articleshow/123073715.cms,"Elon Musk’s platform under fire despite legal protections

Plaintiffs claim X made it hard to report child abuse







Broader concerns about CSAM handling on X persist

A federal appeals court has revived part of a lawsuit accusing Elon Musk ’s social media platform, X (formerly Twitter), of negligence in its response to child pornography content . While X benefits from broad immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the platform must still face claims that it failed to act promptly after learning of a sexually explicit video involving two underage boys. The court's decision highlights growing concerns over how social media platforms handle child exploitation online . The ruling reinforces a growing legal consensus that platforms may be liable for harms caused after they acquire actual knowledge of illegal content. It could also set a precedent for future CSAM-related litigation beyond X.Although Elon Musk was not personally named in the lawsuit and the case predates his acquisition of Twitter in 2022, X remains legally vulnerable due to how it handled the content once it had “actual knowledge.” Court documents state the platform took nine days to remove and report a video involving explicit images of minors—after it had been viewed over 167,000 times. Judge Danielle Forrest clarified that the statutory obligation to report child pornography overrides Section 230 protections once a platform becomes aware of such material.The plaintiffs—referred to as John Doe 1 and John Doe 2—were 13 and 14 years old when a predator, posing as a peer on Snapchat, coerced them into sending explicit content. That material was later posted to Twitter, where it remained despite multiple user reports and a complaint from one of the boy’s mothers. The court also revived a separate claim asserting that X’s infrastructure made it unnecessarily difficult for users to report child sexual abuse material, suggesting flaws in platform design and moderation workflows.Although some claims were dismissed—such as those alleging X profited from sex trafficking or designed features that ""amplify"" abuse—the lawsuit adds to existing criticism of the platform’s response to child sexual abuse material. Nonprofits like Thorn have severed ties with X over payment disputes and policy concerns, and watchdogs report that illicit hashtags and spam accounts still circulate CSAM. While X has announced improvements in detection technology, critics say progress remains insufficient amid persistent issues.","A federal appeals court has revived part of a lawsuit accusing Elon Musk ’s social media platform, X (formerly Twitter), of negligence in its response to child pornography content.

API access wars heat up among AI giants

Claude Code usage explosion prompts new limits

Anthropic has cut off OpenAI 's API access to its Claude family of AI models , citing violations of terms of service after discovering the ChatGPT-maker was using Claude's coding capabilities to develop its upcoming GPT-5 model, according to a Wired report."" Claude Code has become the go-to choice for coders everywhere, and so it was no surprise to learn OpenAI's own technical staff were also using our coding tools ahead of the launch of GPT-5,"" Anthropic spokesperson Christopher Nulty told Wired. ""Unfortunately, this is a direct violation of our terms of service.""Sources familiar with the matter revealed that OpenAI was connecting Claude to internal tools through special developer APIs to benchmark Claude's performance against its own models in coding, writing, and safety categories. The company was also testing how Claude responded to safety-related prompts involving sensitive content like CSAM, self-harm, and defamation.OpenAI defended its actions as ""industry standard"" practice for evaluating AI systems. ""While we respect Anthropic's decision to cut off our API access, it's disappointing considering our API remains available to them,"" OpenAI's chief communications officer Hannah Wong said in a statement.Anthropic's commercial terms explicitly prohibit customers from using Claude to ""build a competing product or service, including to train competing AI models."" However, the company stated it would continue providing OpenAI access ""for the purposes of benchmarking and safety evaluations as is standard practice across the industry.""The access revocation comes amid explosive demand for Claude Code, Anthropic's AI-powered coding tool. The company recently announced new rate limits, citing unprecedented usage that has strained capacity.""Some of the biggest Claude Code fans are running it continuously in the background, 24/7,"" Anthropic tweeted. ""For example, one user consumed tens of thousands in model usage on a $200 plan.""This isn't Anthropic's first restriction on competitors. Last month, the company cut off AI coding startup Windsurf's access after rumors of an OpenAI acquisition. Chief Science Officer Jared Kaplan previously said, ""I think it would be odd for us to be selling Claude to OpenAI.""The move reflects broader tensions in the AI industry, where companies increasingly restrict competitor access to their APIs—a tactic previously used by Facebook against Twitter-owned Vine and Salesforce against Slack competitors.","Anthropic has cut off OpenAI's API access to its Claude family of AI models.

Instagram live streaming rules change: Who can still go live and who’s restricted; check if you are on the list and other key details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/instagram-live-streaming-rules-change-who-can-still-go-live-and-whos-restricted-check-if-you-are-on-the-list-and-other-key-details/articleshow/123073723.cms,"Instagram’s new update on live streaming policy



Why did Instagram make this change? Potential reasons behind the update

Improved streaming quality and user experience:

Focus on monetisation and professional content:

Industry alignment:

New Instagram live rules frustrate small creators

Stifling creativity and community

Encouragement of artificial growth:

Prioritising profit over users:

How does this impact Instagram users moving forward

Established creators benefit:

Small accounts must adapt:

Shift towards professionalism:

Instagram has introduced a major policy update limiting access to its popular Live streaming feature. Previously, any user could go Live, regardless of their follower count or account privacy settings. Now, only users with at least 1,000 followers and a public account can initiate Live broadcasts. This change aligns Instagram with platforms like TikTok, which have a similar follower minimum to use live streaming. While Instagram hasn’t officially explained the rationale, the move appears aimed at enhancing the quality and relevance of live content on the platform, reducing infrastructure costs, and steering creators towards more professional, monetized use cases. However, this decision has sparked concerns about its impact on smaller creators and everyday users who relied on Live for casual social interaction.The new rule requires users to have a minimum of 1,000 followers and maintain a public account to access Instagram’s Live feature. Users who don’t meet these criteria will see a notification that reads:“Your account is no longer eligible for Live. We changed the requirements to use this feature. Only public accounts with 1,000 followers or more will be able to create live videos.” This essentially limits Live streaming to more established users, restricting smaller accounts and private profiles from broadcasting live content. The update marks a shift in Instagram’s approach, transforming Live from an inclusive social tool to a feature that favors creators with larger audiences.Although Instagram has not publicly detailed the reasons, experts and user feedback suggest several motivations:Live video demands substantial real-time bandwidth and server resources. Limiting the feature to larger accounts could reduce network strain and improve streaming stability for viewers and broadcasters.By favoring accounts with bigger followings, Instagram is likely prioritizing creators who use Live for business, influencer marketing, and branded content, aligning with Meta’s monetization goals.TikTok and other social platforms already require a follower threshold to go live, so Instagram is possibly standardizing its policies to compete and maintain advertiser interest.This approach reflects a broader industry trend where live streaming is becoming more about professional content and less about casual social sharing.The update has met with mixed reactions from Instagram’s community, especially among small creators and casual users. Many feel this change limits opportunities for organic growth and reduces the platform’s inclusivity. Common concerns include:: Smaller creators and everyday users often used Live for personal connections, casual chats, or niche hobbies. Restricting access may discourage authentic, grassroots engagement.Some fear the policy will drive people to buy fake followers or use bots just to unlock Live, undermining genuine community building.Several users criticize Instagram for prioritizing monetized content and brand deals, sidelining users who don’t generate revenue.Social media commentators have called the move “a push towards commercialization” that risks alienating loyal, smaller creators who helped build Instagram’s community.For creators and users, the implications are significant:Influencers and larger accounts gain more exclusive control over live content, potentially increasing their visibility and monetization options.Users with fewer than 1,000 followers will need to explore other engagement strategies or focus on growing their audience before accessing Live streaming.Instagram is clearly steering Live towards use cases involving brand promotion, influencer marketing, and advertiser-friendly content rather than casual personal sharing.This shift may reshape how communities interact on Instagram and influence where smaller creators choose to invest their time and energy.","Instagram has introduced a major policy update limiting access to its popular Live streaming feature.

He stated that “Betting against Elon is like betting against Steve Jobs (Apple founder)”. Responding to the comments, the Tesla CEO acknowledged that while the valuation is possible, it may require ‘extreme execution’.“Extreme execution is needed, but a valuation of $20 trillion for Tesla is possible,” Elon Musk wrote, quoting a post on X (formerly Twitter).Notably, this comes days after Elon Musk warned of ‘few rough quarters’ for Tesla following the expiration of the US tax credit for EVs. In an earnings conference call with analysts and investors this week, the tech billionaire said “We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the US.”Continuing further, he said “We probably could have a few rough quarters. I'm not saying we will, but we could”. “But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling,” Musk added.The EV maker reported a drop in profit for the third quarter in a row, with earnings falling to $1.17 billion, or 33 cents per share, down from $1.4 billion, or 40 cents per share, during the same period last year.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 40 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the April to June quarter also declined — from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion — but still came in slightly higher than analysts had forecast.During the earnings calls, Elon Musk was asked about whether he would want more than his current 13% stake in Tesla to keep control. To this, Musk said he did want more but not too much.“I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction,” he said, “but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”","Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation.

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world. Speaking during an event hosted by the All-In Podcast team and a consortium of tech leaders and lawmakers known as the Hill and Valley Forum, Huang discussed the scale of impact that small, focused teams of AI researchers can have and how Nvidia’s success has translated into significant financial rewards for those in leadership. “I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.” Jensen Huang said. He was responding to a question on the effectiveness and value of smaller AI teams.“But the important big idea is that the impact of 150 or so AI researchers, with funding behind them, can probably create,” he noted. Jensen Huang gave examples of OpenAI which originally started with around 150 employees and China’s DeepSeek which also has a similar workforce.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang added that there's something unique about well-structured, mid-sized teams when given the right resources. “That’s not a small team. That’s a good-size team with the right infrastructure… If you're willing to pay, say, $20 billion, $30 billion to buy a startup with 150 AI researchers, why wouldn't you pay one?”During the interview, the Nvidia CEO also addressed reports that he personally rewards high-performing employees with surprise stock options and RSUs (Restricted Stock Units). When asked if he actually does carry stock options, Jensen Huang joked “Yeah, I'm carrying it in my pocket right now.”He then explained that he takes a hands-on approach to compensation across the company. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day… when they present it, and they send me everybody’s recommended comp, I go through the whole company. I’ve got my methods of doing that, and I use machine learning. I sort through all 42,000 employees.”“100% of the time, I increased the company’s spend on OpEx [operating expenses]. And the reason for that is because you take care of people, everything else takes care [of itself],” Jensen Huang concluded.",N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world.

AI transformation drives Microsoft’s workforce restructuring strategy

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed the company's massive job cuts in a candid memo to employees, acknowledging that recent layoffs affecting over 15,000 workers this year, have been ""weighing heavily"" on him while defending the cuts as necessary for the Redmond giant’s AI transformation.""Before anything else, I want to speak to what's been weighing heavily on me, and what I know many of you are thinking about: the recent job eliminations,"" Nadella wrote to Microsoft's more than 200,000 employees. ""These decisions are among the most difficult we have to make. They affect people we've worked alongside, learned from, and shared countless moments with – our colleagues, teammates, and friends.""The layoffs represent approximately 7% of Microsoft's global workforce, making it the company's largest personnel reduction since 2014. Despite the cuts, Microsoft's stock has soared 21% this year, hitting record highs above $500 per share, while the company reported $75 billion in net income over three fiscal quarters.Nadella directly addressed what he called the ""uncertainty and seeming incongruence"" of cutting jobs while the company thrives financially. ""By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving – our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right,"" he wrote. ""We're investing more in CapEx than ever before. Our overall headcount is relatively unchanged, and some of the talent and expertise in our industry and at Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before. And yet, at the same time, we've undergone layoffs.""The CEO described this contradiction as ""the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value,"" explaining that ""progress isn't linear. It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding.""Nadella emphasised that achieving future success ""will be defined by our ability to go through this difficult process of 'unlearning' and 'learning.'"" He argued this transformation requires Microsoft to ""meet changing customer needs, by continuing to maintain and scale our current business, while also creating new categories with new business models and a new production function.""The memo outlined Microsoft's strategic pivot from a ""software factory to an intelligence engine"" as the company invests $80 billion in AI infrastructure. Nadella envisions a future where ""all 8 billion people could summon a researcher, an analyst, or a coding agent at their fingertips.""""As we begin a new fiscal year, I've been reflecting on the road we've traveled together and the path ahead,"" Nadella wrote, positioning the layoffs within broader industry shifts toward AI-driven automation that have eliminated over 80,000 tech jobs in 2025.The CEO expressed ""sincere gratitude to those who have left,"" acknowledging that ""their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today."" However, he offered no guarantees against future layoffs, instead urging remaining employees to maintain a ""growth mindset"" during what he called the ""messiness"" of transformation.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed the company's massive job cuts in a candid memo to employees.

Read Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates' complete LinkedIn post here



I’ve entered the startup world again…

When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible. But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni.

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

📲Download the Phia iOS app for free at join.phia.com

💻Or if you shop on your computer like me, they have a free chrome extension at gophia.com

Let me know what you think! You never know who’s on the other end of the customer service line…

Bill Gates daughter shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother



Big Question Answered: Why Google is Merging Android and ChromeOS

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, recently demonstrated a unique approach to leadership and family support by working a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup. In a LinkedIn post Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup — Phoebe and Gates agreed to it. “I’ve entered the startup world again… When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes,” wrote Gates in a LinkedIn post.Phoebe Gates co-founded Phia along with her Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni. The platform uses AI to help users compare prices of new and second-hand products across more than 40,000 websites. A web browser/app, Phia aims to be the Booking.com of fashion, offering an instant price comparison from thousands of e-commerce sites for any item, new or used. Phoebe Gates is the youngest child of Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates joined the customer service team of Phia for one day in order to understand how the product works.Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates revealed that this experience reminded him that “the best way to understand how something works—or where it breaks—is to go straight to the people using it.” His stint echoes a growing trend among tech CEOs to spend time on the front lines, following examples like Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who famously delivered food and drove passengers to better grasp user pain points.Earlier, in April this year, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates shared that he intentionally chose not to invest in his daughter’s AI-powered shopping app, Phia, during a podcast. He explained that funding the venture would have led him to oversee it too closely. Instead, he offered advice on staffing while others handled the investment. ""In an interview published by the New York Times, soon after Phia’s web browser and app went live, Bill Gates said: “I thought, ‘Oh boy, she’s going to come and ask.”“I would have kept her on a short leash and be doing business reviews, which I would have found tricky,” the businessman explained of his hesitance. “And I probably would have been overly nice but wondered if it was the right thing to do.”Phoebe Gates recently shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother, Melinda French Gates, about tackling investors. The 22-year-old co-founder of fashion pricing startup Phia got this advice from her mother after she faced queries from potential investors about her future motherhood. While raising funds for Phia with co-founder Sophia Kianni, Gates was asked what would happen if they decided to have children. On the Call Her Daddy podcast, Phoebe shared that this line of questioning prompted a call to her mother. She noted that her mother’s reply was: ""Get up or get out of the game, sis.""According to a report by Benzinga, both founders said that these inquiries expose a persistent bias in venture capital. “Always children,” Melinda Gates said when asked to name the most common bias they’ve faced. Kianni said she turned the tables on a male investor by asking: ""What's going to happen to your venture firm when you have kids?""""He's like, ‘Why would that affect anything?' And I was like, ‘You answered your own question,'” she added.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates worked a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup, Phia.

Sundar Pichai joins the ‘billionaire club’ after leading Google for over a decade; his net worth is…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sundar-pichai-joins-the-billionaire-club-after-leading-google-for-over-a-decade-his-net-worth-is/articleshow/122897734.cms,"Sundar Pichai achieves rare feat as a non-founder CEO

AI-powered growth and record investments

From modest beginnings to Silicon Valley’s summit

After a decade at the helm of Alphabet, Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO. Pichai, who took over as CEO of Google in 2015 and became Alphabet’s chief in 2019, now holds a net worth of $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The milestone comes after Alphabet’s market value soared by over $1 trillion since early 2023, delivering 120% returns to investors. Pichai’s rise has been defined by his leadership through multiple technological shifts, from mobile and cloud computing to AI. As Alphabet’s shares hit record highs, his decade-long stewardship has culminated in both financial success and strategic transformation.While tech billionaires are often company founders, Pichai’s entry into the billionaire club is different. He holds just 0.02% of Alphabet’s economic stake, currently valued at around $440 million. Most of his net worth comes from share sales and performance-based compensation over the past ten years. Bloomberg reports that he has sold over $650 million in stock during his tenure. If he had retained all his shares, they would now be worth more than $2.5 billion. Despite the modest stake, Pichai’s long-term vision and steady leadership have driven massive growth in Alphabet’s core businesses.August 2025 marks ten years since Pichai became CEO of Google. In that time, Alphabet has expanded rapidly, turning once-nascent divisions like YouTube, Cloud, Play, and Subscriptions into billion-dollar engines. In a recent post on X, Pichai highlighted that in 2015, Alphabet’s total revenue was $75 billion, whereas YouTube and Google Cloud alone are now generating an annual run rate of $110 billion. Under his leadership, Alphabet restructured into a parent holding company, sharpened its AI focus, and increased its global footprint.A major factor in Alphabet’s recent trillion-dollar surge has been its aggressive AI investments . The company spent $50 billion in 2023 alone on infrastructure, semiconductors, and data centers to support its AI ambitions. It also raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast by $10 billion, reaching $85 billion, most of which is earmarked for AI infrastructure. “Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand for cloud customers,” Pichai said during the Q2 earnings call. Alphabet’s DeepMind acquisition in 2014 for $400 million has also paid off, helping the company stay ahead in the AI race. Pichai's rise reflects a new era where operational excellence, not just founding status, can build tech empires.Born in Tamil Nadu, India, Sundar Pichai’s journey to Silicon Valley is one of resilience and brilliance. He grew up in a two-room apartment, with his first telephone arriving when he was 12. A scholarship brought him to Stanford in 1993, with a one-way plane ticket that reportedly cost more than his father’s annual salary. Pichai joined Google in 2004, led the development of Chrome, and later oversaw Android, before rising to the top job.Sundar Pichai is also known for his calm, consensus-driven leadership style, which has earned him respect in an industry often defined by bold personalities. In recent years, he has become increasingly vocal on topics like AI regulation, digital privacy, and ethical tech, positioning Alphabet as a global thought leader beyond just innovation.Outside of tech, Pichai has also ventured into sports. He is reportedly part of a group of executives that acquired a 49% stake in the London Spirit cricket team for $182 million. The team competes in The Hundred, a professional cricket league launched in the UK in 2020. While his wealth may not rival that of Alphabet founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth $171.2 billion and $160.4 billion respectively, Pichai's path to the billionaire club is proof that transformational leadership, even without a founding stake, can build both companies and fortunes. His rise underscores a shift in Silicon Valley’s power dynamics—where disciplined execution rivals disruptive invention. As Alphabet charts its future, Pichai’s story stands as a model for aspiring global leaders in tech and beyond.","Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO.

Comet can generate candidate lists, manage emails, coordinate calendars, and prepare meetings. While some leaders predict widespread job disruption, Srinivas emphasizes that AI proficiency will enhance employability.

AI browser targets administrative work beyond recruiting

AI leaders split on AI's impact on white-collar employment

Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas believes his company's new AI browser , Comet, will soon automate two crucial white-collar roles that every modern workplace depends on: recruiters and administrative assistants.Speaking on The Verge's Decoder podcast, Srinivas outlined how Comet's built-in AI agent can access applications like Gmail, LinkedIn, and Google Calendar to completely transform knowledge work . ""A recruiter's work worth one week is just one prompt: sourcing and reach outs,"" he said during the Thursday episode.The AI-native browser, currently in invite-only beta for premium users, can generate candidate lists, extract contact information, and send personalised outreach emails, tasks traditionally handled by recruiting coordinators and sourcers. Srinivas demonstrated scenarios where the AI could identify Stanford alumni who previously worked at Anthropic, compile their information in Google Sheets, and draft personalised cold outreach messages.Comet's capabilities extend far beyond recruiting functions. Srinivas explained how the browser can assume many executive assistant responsibilities, including email management, calendar coordination, and meeting preparation. The AI can ""keep following up, keep track of responses, update Google Sheets, mark status as responded or in progress, sync with Google Calendar, and resolve conflicts to schedule meetings,"" he said.The Perplexity CEO envisions the browser evolving into an AI operating system that continuously runs background tasks and executes commands through natural language prompts. He believes users will pay premium prices for meaningful automation, suggesting people might spend ""$2,000 for a prompt"" if it helps generate significant business value.Srinivas joins other tech executives predicting widespread disruption to office jobs. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has suggested AI could eliminate 50% of entry-level positions within five years, while Ford CEO Jim Farley warned that artificial intelligence will ""replace literally half of all white-collar workers.""However, not all industry leaders share this apocalyptic view. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang frame AI as an augmentation tool rather than wholesale replacement technology.Despite differing perspectives on AI's ultimate impact, Srinivas issued a clear warning: ""People who are at the frontier of using AI are going to be way more employable than people who are not.""","Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas believes his company's new AI browser, Comet, will soon automate two crucial white-collar roles.

"Submarines fitted with lasers, custom-built attack satellites and ...: Strategies Chinese government, military scientists are developing to counter Elon Musk’ Starlink",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/submarines-fitted-with-lasers-custom-built-attack-satellites-and-strategies-chinese-government-military-scientists-are-developing-to-counter-elon-musk-starlink/articleshow/123067538.cms,"How China is responding to Starlink

Chinese researchers are actively working on strategies to neutralize Elon Musk's Starlink satellite network, which they perceive as a significant threat to the country's national security. According to a report by Associated Press (AP), Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink’s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk’s satellites, an Associated Press review found. This reportedly includes Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters.The satellite constellation’s ability to provide fast, affordable internet access globally, even in remote areas, is seen as a risk due to SpaceX’s ties to U.S. intelligence and defense agencies. “As the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,” stated professors from China’s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper.Proposed countermeasures include stealth submarines equipped with lasers capable of targeting satellites, supply-chain sabotage, and custom attack satellites with ion thrusters. Researchers have also suggested deploying small optical telescopes to monitor Starlink, using deep fakes to create false targets, and firing powerful lasers to damage the satellites. Starlink’s dominance, with over 8,000 active satellites accounting for roughly two-thirds of all active satellites, has raised concerns globally, not just in China. According to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, SpaceX aims to deploy tens of thousands more satellites. The network’s critical role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, where it supported Ukrainian battlefield communications, highlighted its strategic importance and the risks of relying on a single private company led by Musk, whose political engagements, including support for controversial figures, have sparked unease.China is responding by developing its own satellite networks, such as Guowang, with 60 of a planned 13,000 satellites launched, and Qianfan, backed by the Shanghai government, with 90 of 15,000 planned satellites in orbit. These efforts aim to compete with Starlink both domestically and in markets like Africa and Asia. The AP review noted that Chinese researchers have analyzed Starlink’s coverage over key areas like Beijing and Taiwan, concluding in a 2023 National Defense University paper that “the Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed.” Another study by the China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team pointed to vulnerabilities in Starlink’s supply chain, noting “the company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,” with limited cybersecurity oversight.","Chinese researchers are actively working on strategies to neutralize Elon Musk's Starlink satellite network.

‘Gambling runs deep in American culture’: Nithin Kamath slams misleading India–US trading comparisons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/gambling-runs-deep-in-american-culture-nithin-kamath-slams-misleading-indiaus-trading-comparisons/articleshow/123058656.cms,"Nithin Kamath says Indian markets are less leveraged than US counterparts



India’s financial markets are still maturing

US culture encourages speculation across sectors

Simple volume comparisons are misleading



Support from investor community





A call for nuanced understanding

Zerodha co-founder Nithin Kamath has pushed back against recent comparisons between India and the United States over options trading volumes , calling such parallels both flawed and misleading. In a detailed social media post, Kamath emphasised that India’s markets are far less leveraged and significantly less mature than those in the US. He went further, describing America as a “gambling society,” stating, “Gambling runs deep in American culture. From the stock market to sports, casinos, events, lotteries, prediction markets, and crypto, you can bet on anything.” His comments have sparked debate among investors and market analysts, many of whom agree that comparing raw trading volumes alone fails to capture deeper structural and cultural differences.Kamath’s core argument centres on leverage, a key metric that determines how much capital is actually at risk. While India may now be the largest market in the world in terms of options contracts traded, he explained that these trades are often low in premium value, meaning less money is involved per contract.In contrast, US markets operate with far greater sums of capital per trade. Kamath pointed out that India's margin funding market is still under 10 billion dollars, whereas the United States recently surpassed one trillion dollars. This stark difference, he noted, highlights the risk of making surface-level comparisons without looking at the underlying leverage or capital exposure.According to Kamath, India’s financial markets are roughly 15 to 20 years behind the United States in terms of market maturity and structural development. He pointed to the limited penetration of mechanisms such as margin trading, stock lending, and short selling in India, compared to their extensive use in the US.He further argued that India’s options trading ecosystem is still predominantly retail-driven, meaning individual investors are placing smaller, more frequent bets with relatively lower capital exposure. On the other hand, US options markets are largely institutional, where trades are fewer in number but far more substantial in terms of value and leverage.Kamath didn’t stop at structural financial differences. He also criticised the broader culture of speculation embedded in American society. Calling the US a “gambling society,” he cited a recent $210 million wager on whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would wear a suit at the NATO summit as an example of extreme speculative behaviour.He argued that gambling in the US goes far beyond casinos. It spans across the stock market, sports betting, prediction markets, lotteries, and cryptocurrency platforms. “You can bet on anything,” he remarked, suggesting that this widespread acceptance of speculative behaviour shapes the American approach to investing and risk in general.Kamath strongly criticised what he described as a misleading narrative that India is dangerously overleveraged simply because of the sheer volume of options contracts being traded. He argued that this view fails to consider the nuances of how leverage works and ignores the capital involved in each transaction.“Just counting contracts without understanding the structure is misleading,” he wrote. According to him, metrics like total market exposure, margin usage, and premium values offer a much clearer picture of actual risk levels than raw trading volume ever could.Kamath’s statements found resonance within the investor and trader community. Many users echoed his views online, pointing out that structural and cultural factors are crucial in understanding any market’s behaviour.One user remarked, “Comparing India to the US in leverage is like bringing a water pistol to a wildfire,” highlighting the vast difference in scale. Another added, “India’s market is retail-led, and the US is dominated by institutions. Their leverage capacities aren’t even in the same ballpark.” Others praised Kamath for calling out misleading narratives and presenting a more balanced view of India’s evolving financial landscape.In conclusion, Kamath urged analysts, commentators, and financial media to exercise greater nuance when comparing India’s financial markets to those in the US. He argued that surface-level metrics like contract volume do not adequately reflect real risk exposure, especially in a country where financial infrastructure is still developing.By drawing attention to the differences in leverage, market maturity, investor profile, and cultural attitudes toward speculation, Kamath’s intervention has sparked an important conversation. His critique not only challenges oversimplified narratives but also offers a clearer, more contextual understanding of how emerging markets like India should be evaluated. Kamath has consistently urged retail investors to prioritize long-term wealth creation over short-term speculation. He often emphasizes the importance of financial education and risk awareness in navigating India’s evolving markets.",Zerodha co-founder Nithin Kamath has pushed back against recent comparisons between India and the United States over options trading volumes.

What happens during a total solar eclipse

Next Solar eclipse on September 21, 2025

A false claim has been circulating online stating that the entire world will go dark for 6 minutes on August 2, i.e. today due to a solar eclipse. Some posts on social media further claim that the phenomenon is one of the rare ones and will not occur for a century, generating curiosity and public fear. But experts have confirmed that it is a hoax. There is no global blackout coming in 2025. In fact, NASA’s astronomical records show the next total solar eclipse of such magnitude is scheduled for August 2, 2027, not 2025. Here’s what you need to know about the buzz around the celestial phenomenonAccording to NASA’s astronomical data, the next total solar eclipse of this magnitude will occur on August 2, 2027, not in 2025 as suggested by viral claims and rumours spreading online. Further, this event will be a significant celestial occurrence, but it will not darken the entire world.The eclipse will cast the Moon’s shadow over parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, creating a spectacular but localized event. The rest of the world, including North America and large parts of Asia, will not witness this eclipse at all.The August 2, 2027, total solar eclipse is being called the “Eclipse of the Century” because it will offer the longest duration of totality on land in the 21st century — lasting up to 6 minutes and 22 seconds, the longest since 1991.The path of totality—the area where the Sun will be completely blocked—will be about 160 miles (258 km) wide, stretching over 9,462 miles (15,227 km) and covering parts of 11 countries, including:For those within this path, the sky will briefly turn dark in broad daylight, creating a dramatic twilight effect. Areas outside this path may see a partial eclipse, but no blackout.A total solar eclipse happens when the Moon comes directly between the Earth and the Sun. As a result of this celestial movement, the Sun's light is blocked, casting a shadow on parts of Earth. During totality, viewers see the Sun’s corona—its outer atmosphere—which is usually hidden by the Sun’s glare.Total solar eclipses are visible only from a narrow strip of land, and their duration is typically just a few minutes.While no total eclipse will occur in 2025, a partial solar eclipse is expected on September 21, 2025. During this event, the Moon will partially obscure the Sun, making it appear as though a “bite” has been taken out of it. This partial eclipse will not cause darkness, nor will it be visible worldwide.","A false claim has been circulating online stating that the entire world will go dark for 6 minutes on August 2, i.e. today due to a solar eclipse.

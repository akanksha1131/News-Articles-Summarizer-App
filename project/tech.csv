Dimon praises Musk

What happened between JPMorgan CEO and Elon Musk

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has revealed that he has patched with Tesla CEO Elon Musk , stating that they have ""hugged it out"" and ""settled some of our differences."" Dimon expressed admiration for Musk's entrepreneurial ventures, calling him ""our Einstein.""‚ÄúElon and I hugged it out,‚Äù Dimon told CNBC at the World Economic Forum‚Äôs annual event in Davos, Switzerland.‚ÄúHe came to one of our conferences, [and] he and I had a nice, long chat.

I‚Äôd like to be helpful to him and his companies as much as we can,‚Äù the JPMorgan chief added.This reconciliation comes after a period of tension between the two executives, stemming from a 2021 lawsuit filed by JPMorgan against Tesla. The lawsuit, seeking $162.2 million in damages, arose from a dispute over stock warrant transactions.The conflict escalated following Musk‚Äôs 2018 tweet about taking Tesla private, which led to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charges against both Musk and Tesla.Dimon also expressed support for Musk's new role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency under the Trump administration.

Indonesia banned Pixel smartphones too

Indonesia is on the verge of reaching an agreement with Apple that will essentially lift the ban on iPhone 16 sales, a report has cited a minister as saying. The ban, imposed in October, stemmed from Apple's failure to comply with the country's domestic manufacturing requirements for smartphones and tablets.Bloomberg that following months of negotiations, a resolution appears imminent.‚ÄúI strongly believe it will resolve very soon,‚Äù said investment minister Rosan Roeslani, adding, ‚ÄúHopefully within one or two weeks, this issue can be resolved.‚ÄùApple has been actively engaged in discussions with the Indonesian government to find a mutually agreeable solution. While the company recently proposed a $1 billion investment in a local AirTag manufacturing facility, this offer was rejected by Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita.The minister emphasised the need for Apple to fulfill the local content requirement, which necessitates the domestic production of iPhone components within Indonesia.Indonesia‚Äôs ban on iPhone 16 sales stems from Apple's failure to comply with local content regulations, which require 40% of phone components to be sourced domestically. The government is pushing for increased local manufacturing and investment from tech giants.Minister Roeslani acknowledged that discrepancies exist in how Apple calculates its compliance with local content requirements.‚ÄúThe way they calculate it is different I think,‚Äù Roeslani said, referring to the local content requirement.‚ÄúNow they find a solution on that one, so hopefully they accept the discrepancies so we can have the iPhone 16 sold in Indonesia,‚Äù he added.Indonesia also banned the sale of Google Pixel smartphones as the country. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the Google Pixel phone sales have been blocked due to the company's failure to comply with regulations requiring a minimum of 40% locally-sourced components ‚Äì the same reason why the country blocked iPhone 16 sales.As per Google, its Pixel phones are currently not officially distributed in Indonesia.","Indonesia is on the verge of reaching an agreement with Apple that will essentially lift the ban on iPhone 16 sales.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle‚Äôs theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you‚Äôve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you‚Äôve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

In a shocking incident, an elderly woman was duped out of Rs 66 lakh after falling victim to a well-coordinated scam involving emotional manipulation by a Chinese influencer. The woman, who had been following the influencer on social media, was led to believe in a series of false promises and emotional appeals. What seemed like a harmless online connection quickly escalated into a financial nightmare.As the scam unfolded, the woman found herself convinced to transfer large sums of money, unknowingly falling prey to the influencer‚Äôs manipulative tactics. This case highlights the dangers of emotional manipulation and online fraud, particularly targeting vulnerable individuals through social media platforms.According to the South China Morning Post (SCMP), a Chinese influencer, Mao from Shaanxi province, has been arrested for emotionally manipulating a 70-year-old Shanghai woman, Tang, into transferring 560,000 yuan (approximately Rs 66 lakh) by pretending to be her son. Mao gained Tang's trust through emotional stories, claiming personal hardships like cancer and family emergencies. Over time, he addressed her as ""mum"" and created a fabricated bond with her, asking for money to cover his supposed needs.Despite her relatives raising suspicions about the suspicious transactions, Tang continued to send money because she was desperate to help her ""son."" Mao even traveled 1,000 km to meet her and filmed the encounter to strengthen his deception. However, when his behavior became erratic and manipulative, Tang grew suspicious and contacted authorities in late 2023, ending the scam.Investigators uncovered a complex web of deception after an elderly woman, Tang, was defrauded of 560,000 yuan (around Rs 66 lakh) by a Chinese influencer, Mao. Mao used four different accounts to maintain his fake identities, pretending to be various people. His downfall came when Tang unknowingly took a photo of his car‚Äôs license plate, which helped authorities track him down. After collecting evidence, Mao was arrested in Shanghai and sentenced to 10 and a half years in prison with a 100,000 yuan fine (approximately Rs 11 lakh).Tang, living on a modest pension, fell deeply into debt due to Mao‚Äôs manipulative tactics, owing over 70,000 yuan (around Rs 8 lakh). Despite the court offering financial support, Tang refused help, and the emotional toll led her to lose 10 kgs in six months, revealing the profound impact the scam had on her health.","Chinese influencer sentenced to 10 years for scamming elderly woman of Rs 66 lakh. 70-year-old Shanghai woman, Tang, was defrauded of 560,000 yuan by a Chinese influencer.

There is a big challenge ahead for LTI, especially considering the recent perception problems of its work culture, making an external appointment even more needed,""

Bengaluru: LTIMindtree president and board member Sudhir Chaturvedi's exit put the spotlight on the company's succession planning at the start of the year. The $4.3 billion company not only set the ball rolling for CEO succession but also began identifying Chaturvedi's successor, a position crucial to managing and strengthening its client base in the US.Chaturvedi was its president since 2016 and was responsible for sales, marketing, large deals, and partnerships.Industry experts believe appointing his successor is key to driving its sales engine. This requires a seasoned, market-facing senior sales leader as a custodian of relationships based in the US.As Debashis Chatterjee's tenure as LTIMindtree CEO will come to an end later this year, TOI reported that Chaturvedi and COO Nachiket Deshpande were seen as frontrunners for the top job. Deshpande is learnt to be moving to the US to steer brand presence while he keeps an oversight of the delivery function, sources told TOI. Some observers industry believe selecting an internal candidate would likely facilitate a smoother transition, particularly during the ongoing integration process and to rev up its sales performance. This approach aligns with the company's ambitious target of achieving $10 billion in revenue by 2032.However, market sources also told TOI that former LTIMindtree president Venu Lambu is learnt to be a strong contender from the external slate for the top job.said Phil Fersht, CEO of HfS Research.Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder and executive chairman of the Everest Group, said LTIMindtree is taking some time to sort out its succession planning. ""They have strong internal candidates as well as some strong external candidates, such as Venu, to consider. Making a strong choice for their next generation of leadership is vital as LTIMindtree faces an industry that is changing fast and presenting new opportunities as well as challenges. They are well positioned as a business, and the right leaders will be able to capitalise on these opportunities.""Recently, Lambu quit HR services firm Randstad Digital as its CEO. Previously, he was the SVP and global markets head for cloud, infrastructure, and application management business in Cognizant. In his six-year stint with Cognizant, Lambu shaped client conversations on cloud and infrastructure, overseeing a $3 billion P&L and managing 30,000 employees. Lambu joined Cognizant from HCL, where he was the head of Continental Europe for the infrastructure services division. Lambu was an alumnus of the University of Mysore and London Business School, and he is currently based in London. A text message sent to Lambu didn‚Äôt elicit a response till the time of going to the press. When TOI reached out to LTIMindtree, the company said, ""As a policy, we do not comment on rumours and speculation.""","Sudhir Chaturvedi was its president since 2016 and was responsible for sales, marketing, large deals, and partnerships.

In a diplomatic gesture that turned controversial, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif found himself in the spotlight for the wrong reasons after his congratulatory post for the U.S. President Donald Trump went viral for unexpected reasons. The message, shared on X (formerly Twitter), was intended to express goodwill and strengthen ties between the two nations.However, the platform flagged the post with a Community Note, accusing Sharif of using X illegally and labeling him a ""so-called Prime Minister."" This incident not only triggered a meme storm on social media but also raised questions about the continued use of X by government officials in Pakistan despite its ban.On January 20, 2025, Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Donald Trump on assuming office as the 47th President of the United States. In his post, Sharif emphasized the strong partnership between Pakistan and the United States, expressing optimism for continued cooperation in fostering peace and prosperity. The post, which carried a tone of diplomacy and goodwill, quickly turned controversial when a Community Note was added to it.The note highlighted that X is officially banned in Pakistan and accused Sharif of accessing the platform illegally, sparking widespread criticism. It also accused him of victimizing political opponents, including former Prime Minister Imran Khan, though no detailed evidence or further context was provided.Pakistan imposed a ban on X in February 2024, citing national security concerns during the general elections. Despite the restrictions, no official announcement was made until August 2024, when millions of users had already experienced connectivity issues. The ban was seen as a move to curb dissent and control public discourse.However, government officials, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, have continued to use X, most likely through Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). This practice has drawn criticism for creating a double standard where officials bypass restrictions that the general public is expected to follow. The latest incident has reignited debates over the government's enforcement of the ban and the transparency of its policies.The addition of the Community Note to Sharif‚Äôs post became an instant viral topic, triggering a wave of memes and online commentary. Social media users ridiculed the Prime Minister, with many quoting the popular phrase ""gajjab bejjati hai"" to highlight the embarrassment caused by the incident. Others sarcastically questioned how Sharif managed to access the platform, pointing to the government‚Äôs hypocrisy in enforcing the ban.The incident also led to discussions about the broader issues of internet censorship in Pakistan and the role of social media in holding public figures accountable. The Community Note, which was later removed by X, continued to circulate online through screenshots, ensuring that the controversy remained a topic of discussion.The Community Note accused Sharif of being responsible for the victimization of political opponents, specifically mentioning former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has been a vocal critic of the current administration. These allegations align with ongoing criticism of Sharif‚Äôs government for allegedly targeting opposition leaders and suppressing dissent.While the Community Note did not elaborate on these claims, it has intensified scrutiny of Sharif‚Äôs policies and actions, both domestically and internationally.

Indonesia's antitrust agency has announced that Google has been ordered to pay a fine of 202 billion rupiah ($12.37 million) for engaging in unfair business practices through its payment system services on the Google Play Store.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the investigation, launched in 2022, examined allegations that Google had abused its dominant market position by requiring Indonesian app developers to use Google Pay Billing .This system allegedly charged higher rates than other available payment options, with developers facing removal from the Play Store if they did not comply.Google has previously defended its practices, stating that it had implemented a system allowing developers to offer users an alternative billing option. However, the Indonesian regulator determined that the company's actions amounted to anticompetitive behavior, leading to the significant penalty.Google has faced multiple fines, including a ‚Ç¨2.4 billion fine from India, the European Union and a large fine from Russia.The Competition Commission of India (CCI) fined Google Rs 1,337.76 crore for anti-competitive practices related to Android devices.

US President Donald Trump revokes Biden's AI safety order: What the original order said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-president-donald-trump-revokes-bidens-ai-safety-order-what-the-original-order-said/articleshow/117429011.cms,"US President Donald Trump revoked an AI regulation order by Joe Biden aimed at mitigating AI risks. The order required developers to share safety test results before releasing potentially harmful AI systems.

What Biden‚Äôs AI order said



US President Donald Trump has revoked an executive order related to artificial intelligence (AI) passed by Joe Biden in 2023. Aimed at mitigating risks associated with AI, including threats to consumers, workers, and national security, the order mandated developers to conduct and share safety test results with the US government before releasing systems deemed potentially harmful to national security, the economy, or public health, under the guidelines of the Defense Production Act.In 2024, the Republican Party platform pledged to repeal the order, arguing that it stifles AI innovation and emphasised that ‚ÄúRepublicans support AI development grounded in free speech and the promotion of human flourishing.‚ÄùTrump began his first full day in office on January 21, following an inauguration that set a fundraising record of over $250 million. Shortly after taking the oath, he also signed executive orders addressing immigration, environmental policies, and government operations.The order also instructed agencies to establish standards for AI safety testing and address associated risks, including chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and cybersecurity threats. Biden introduced the order as US lawmakers struggled to pass legislation to regulate AI development.Generative AI, which can produce text, images, and videos in response to prompts, has generated both excitement and concerns, particularly over its potential to displace jobs or cause other negative impacts.Last week, the US Commerce Department imposed new restrictions on AI chip and technology exports, facing criticism from industry leaders, including Nvidia.Separately, Biden issued another executive order last week to support the growing energy demands of advanced AI data centres. This order proposed the leasing of federal sites managed by the Defense and Energy departments. However, Trump has yet to repeal this order.Apart from this, Trump has also issued orders freezing government hiring and mandating federal employees return to full-time, in-person work. This move has sparked opposition from unions representing public sector workers.","The order required developers to share safety test results before releasing potentially harmful AI systems.

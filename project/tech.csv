Elon Musk's SpaceX Starlink satellite breaks down in orbit; SpaceX says no threat to ISS,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-spacex-starlink-satellite-breaks-down-in-orbit-spacex-says-no-threat-to-iss/articleshow/126078064.cms,"

Here’s the full post shared by Starlink

On December 17, Starlink experienced an anomaly on satellite 35956, resulting in loss of communications with the vehicle at 418 km. The anomaly led to venting of the propulsion tank, a rapid decay in semi-major axis by about 4 km, and the release of a small number of trackable low relative velocity objects. SpaceX is coordinating with the @USSpaceForce and @NASA to monitor the objects.

The satellite is largely intact, tumbling, and will reenter the Earth’s atmosphere and fully demise within weeks. The satellite's current trajectory will place it below the @Space_Station, posing no risk to the orbiting lab or its crew.

As the world’s largest satellite constellation operator, we are deeply committed to space safety. We take these events seriously. Our engineers are rapidly working to root cause and mitigate the source of the anomaly and are already in the process of deploying software to our vehicles that increases protections against this type of event.





Elon Musk’s SpaceX Starlink recently confirmed that one of its satellites lost communication after an anomaly in orbit on December 17. In a post shared on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), the company said satellite 35956 stopped responding at around 418 km altitude, leading to a venting of its propulsion tank and a sudden drop in its orbit. The event also caused the release of “a small number of trackable low-relative-velocity objects.”The company added that it is working with US Space Force and NASA to monitor the objects and assess their movement. While the satellite remains largely intact, Starlink added that it is tumbling and is expected to reenter Earth’s atmosphere and fully burn up within weeks.Starlink also clarified that the satellite’s path will stay below the International Space Station, and the incident poses no risk to the orbiting lab or its crew.","Elon Musk’s SpaceX Starlink recently confirmed that one of its satellites lost communication after an anomaly in orbit on December 17.

Matt Garman on AWS product strategy





AWS CEO Matt Garman recently spoke to Wired. In the long interview, Garman answered a range of questions, including many on how AI is shaping the technology industry, its workforce and where Amazon stands in the industry. Replying to a question on if Amazon has not been a key part of a lot of AI narratives worry him? Also does he worry about Amazon not being in that narrative. Replying to the same, Garman said, ""I think both of those things are true. I do worry about it, because I don't want customers to think we're not innovating or driving the latest technologies they need. I want to make sure that it's not just headline-grabbing stuff and it's actually great.""He went on to quote what Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said and how that has shaped hi view. ""Jeff Bezos used to have a saying that you have to be willing to be misunderstood for long periods of time. For us, I think that's what some of the last two years entailed. I think a lot of that narrative has changed now. If you talk to lots of analysts, if you talk to folks in the press, if I talk to customers they're saying, “Look, actually AWS has by far the strongest agentic platform to go build on.They have the broadest set of models that I can build on. They have the broadest set of security controls and compliance controls that actually, if I go put these agents in production, I can actually audit, know what they're doing, control what they're doing.” That is what we're seeing,"" he said.Garman went on to add, ""That’s not to take anything away from [other AI tools]. ChatGPT is an incredible consumer application, but it's just a different thing. That's not our business. Our business is to make sure that banks and health care companies and media and entertainment companies and energy companies can drive their businesses and deliver more outcomes for their customers or cut costs or whatever they want to do. ""He went on to add that he is quite pleased with where Amazon is right now in the AI race. ""So, I'm quite pleased with where we are now, and I think we've already seen that narrative largely shift,"" he said.Speaking with Acquired podcast hosts Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal at the AWS re:Invent conference recently, Garman talked about how AWS thinks about its product strategy. Garman described a multi-layered approach to explain where AWS builds and where it leaves room for partners. At the bottom are core building blocks like compute and storage. AWS will always be there, he said.In the middle are databases, analytics engines, and AI models, where AWS offers its own products and services alongside partners. At the top are millions of applications, where AWS builds selectively and only when it believes it has differentiated expertise.","AWS CEO Matt Garman recently spoke to Wired.

Chinese company responds to SpaceX VP who claimed that company's satellite risked colliding with Starlink; says: We do not ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chinese-company-responds-to-spacex-vp-who-claimed-that-companys-satellite-risked-colliding-with-starlink-says-we-do-not-have-/articleshow/126084264.cms,"



Recently, a collision in space was narrowly averted when a newly deployed Chinese satellite came within a few hundred meters of one of the roughly 9,000 Starlink satellites currently operating in low Earth orbit. SpaceX blamed the satellite operator for not sharing location data. Michael Nicolls, VP for Starlink engineering, tweeted about the incident and put it on the lack of coordination from the Chinese launch provider CAS Space.“When satellite operators do not share ephemeris for their satellites, dangerously close approaches can occur in space,” wrote Michael Nicolls, VP of Starlink Engineering. “A few days ago, 9 satellites were deployed from a launch from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Northwestern China. As far as we know, no coordination or deconfliction with existing satellites operating in space was performed, resulting in a 200 meter close approach between one of the deployed satellites and STARLINK-6079 (56120) at 560 km altitude,” he wrote.CAS Space reported successfully launching nine satellites that day using its Kinetica-1/Lijian-1 rocket. The payload included six Chinese satellites, two other jointly-developed satellites for clients from the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, along with a student-built satellite from Nepal.It seems that one of the satellites veered relatively close to a Starlink sat that’s been in service for over two years. “Most of the risk of operating in space comes from the lack of coordination between satellite operators —this needs to change,” Nicolls added.Responding to the same, CAS Space told PCMag it’s in contact with Nicolls to learn more about the “alleged incident.” However, the company noted: “We value the responsible use and sharing of space as the utmost priority. Situations like these are the reason why nations should work together in space, build their common understanding instead of segregating emerging nations.”The company said: ""As a launch service provider, our responsibility ends once the satellites are deployed, meaning we do not have control over the satellites' maneuvers. Nonetheless, it is everyone's common interest to avoid collision, so CAS Space will provide help however we can.""The company added: “Our first priority is to identify the exact timeline of the incident. Which of the nine satellites were involved? Did the incident happen during satellite deployment or during the orbit maneuver of one of the satellites? Once we have a clearer picture, we will be in a better position to provide assistance to Starlink.”In addition, the company asserted that “All CAS Space launches undergo a mandatory process to align our deployment sequence with ground-based space awareness systems to avoid any potential collision with known satellites/debris. Kinetica-1 Y11 launched at 04:03:45 UTC exactly to an SSO at 550 km with LTDN at 10:30. Satellite separation was nominal. No collision risks were reported for the deployment process. ”","A newly deployed Chinese satellite came within a few hundred meters of one of the roughly 9,000 Starlink satellites currently operating in low Earth orbit.

Mustafa Suleyman’s AI system warning





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.He warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.",Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ He also said that Copilot is “amazing for vision.

Meta’s AI growth





Facebook-parent Meta is working on new AI image and video generation tools, reports The Wall Street Journal. Citing people familiar with the topic, the report says that Meta’s chief AI officer Alexandr Wang talked about the artificial intelligence models in an internal company Q&A with Meta’s chief product officer, Chris Cox this week. One of the tools is reportedly codenamed ‘Mango’. Another AI model is codenamed ‘Avocado’. Speaking about the Avocado model, Wang said that the focus of the upcoming new AI model is to improve coding skills. The new models are expected to be released in the first half of 2026.The upcoming Meta’s AI image and video tools will compete with Google's Nano Banana and Veo, and OpenAI's ChatGPT Image and Sora.Meta has been pushing hard to lead the AI race. Earlier this year, the company restructured its AI team. The tech firm also hired AI chief Alexander Wang in a $14 billion deal, acquiring 49% stake in Scale AI.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has personally led the AI hiring drive, recruiting more than 20 researchers from ChatGPT maker OpenAI. He has build a team of over 50 newly recruited researchers, engineers and other AI specialists.In September this year, Meta released an AI video generator called Vibes.The development of Mango and Avocado marks the first major project from Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), a new division formed after a major restructuring earlier this year.To build the group, CEO Mark Zuckerberg took a direct role in hiring, bringing in more than 20 researchers from OpenAI and appointing 28-year-old Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang to lead the team.The move shows Zuckerberg’s push to quickly catch up with competitors in the AI race. As part of this shift, Meta is reported to have spent more than $14 billion to buy a near-majority stake in Scale AI, putting Wang in charge of shaping Meta’s AI plans after its Llama models.",The Wall Street Journal reports that Meta is working on new AI image and video generation tools.

Google Cloud and cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks have expanded their partnership, which is said to be the largest security services contract in Google cloud unit’s history. Citing a source with direct knowledge of the matter, news agency Reuters reported that the deal involves a commitment from Palo Alto Networks to pay a sum “approaching $10 billion” to Google Cloud over several years.While some of the spending will go into migrating Palo Alto's existing offerings to Google's platform, a larger chunk will go into adding new services that involve artificial intelligence, Palo Alto president BJ Jenkins told the news agency.“AI has spawned a tremendous amount of demand for security,” Matt Renner, chief revenue officer for Google Cloud, was quoted as saying. Jenkins highlighted the need of security by saying that AI is creating “new security threats that no one had ever imagined.”Amazon and Microsoft currently hold larger market shares: roughly 30% and 20% respectively. Google Cloud, however, is growing at a fast rate. Recent third-quarter earnings show Google Cloud’s revenue surged 34% year-over-year, outpacing Microsoft (28%) and AWS (20%).Google has taken the advantage of its own silicon (TPUs) and frontier models (Gemini), offering a “one-stop shop” for AI infrastructure that is proving to be advantageous to high-growth tech firms. Moreover, Google has started to offer its in-house TPU chip business directly to customers, including major AI labs like Anthropic, OpenAI and even Apple. Recently, a report that Meta is working on a deal with Google for its TPUs to train its AI models wiped nearly $250 billion from Nvidia’s market cap.By securing a $10 billion commitment from the world’s leading cybersecurity firm, Google is selling storage as well as embedding security into its infrastructure, likely providing another reason for companies to choose Google over its competitors.",Google Cloud and cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks have expanded their partnership.

Apple's Foldable iPhone is Coming, Here’s Why it Matters

“We present SHARP, an approach to

photorealistic view synthesis

from a single image. Given a single photograph, SHARP regresses the parameters of a

3D Gaussian representation

of the depicted scene. This is done in less than a second on a standard GPU via a single feedforward pass through a neural network. The 3D Gaussian representation produced by SHARP can then be rendered in real time, yielding high-resolution photorealistic images for nearby views. The representation is metric, with absolute scale, supporting metric camera movements. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARP delivers robust zero-shot generalization across datasets. It sets a new state of the art on multiple datasets, reducing LPIPS by 25–34% and DISTS by 21–43% versus the best prior model, while lowering the synthesis time by three orders of magnitude.”

McDonald’s accepts mistake





McDonald’s Netherlands has pulled down its AI-generated Christmas ad after facing backlash from customers online. The 45-second video was posted on Google’s YouTube earlier this week. It depicted AI-created characters struggling through holiday mishaps before turning to McDonald’s outlets. Viewers were quick to object and criticise the ad’s visuals and theme, calling it ‘AI slop”. According to report, the backlash grew rapidly on social media, forcing the company to pull down the ad within just three days of release.In a similar incident last month, Coca-Cola faced criticism for its AI-sloppy Christmas ad. It showed anthropomorphic animals gazing in rapt admiration at the arrival of red Coca-Cola trucks. The ad campaign angered social media who labeled it disgusting’.In its defense, McDonald’s said that the campaign was meant to reflect holiday stress in the Netherlands but admitted the execution had missed the mark. In a statement shared with multiple news outlets, McDonald’s Netherlands said it decided to take down the AI-generated Christmas advert, adding, “It was intended to reflect the stressful moments that can occur during the holidays in the Netherlands, but we recognize that for many of our guests, the season is ‘the most wonderful time of the year.’ We respect that and remain committed to creating experiences that offer Good Times and Good Food for everyone.”According to reports, the McDonald’s Christmas ad was created by Amsterdam, Netherlands-based advertising agency TBWA\Neboko and Auckland, New Zealand-based production agency The Sweetshop.In a statement (deleted now), Sweetshop wrote that its team “hardly slept” for seven weeks creating the ad, Forbes and Futurism reported. “We generated what felt like dailies—thousands of takes—then shaped them in the edit just as we would on any high-craft production,” it said. “This wasn’t an AI trick.

Google’s New AI Is BANANAS: How To Use Gemini Nano Banana

Google's Nano Banana sparked visual AI arms race

CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally driving Meta’s AI strategy





Meta is developing ""Mango,"" a new image and video AI model designed to counter Google 's wildly successful Nano Banana generator, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg pushes an aggressive strategy to reclaim ground lost in the visual AI race, The Wall Street Journal reports.The model surfaced during an internal Q&A featuring Meta's Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, with sources telling WSJ that Mango targets a first-half 2026 launch. The timing isn't coincidental—Google's Nano Banana has become a cultural phenomenon that transformed Gemini into the number one app on Apple's App Store, dethroning ChatGPT after a three-year reign.Since launching in August, Nano Banana has brought 23 million first-time users to Gemini and driven over 500 million image shares globally. The feature sparked a viral social media craze where users transformed selfies into 3D figurines, with the trend spreading rapidly across Instagram, TikTok and X. In just four days during September, Gemini added 13 million new users, according to Google Labs VP Josh Woodward.The impact on revenue has been equally dramatic. Gemini generated $1.6 million on iOS in August alone—a staggering 1,291% increase from January's $115,000, according to Appfigures data.The app now boasts over 650 million monthly active users, proving that playful, accessible AI features can drive massive consumer adoption.Google's dominance prompted an immediate response from OpenAI . CEO Sam Altman reportedly declared a ""code red"" after Nano Banana Pro's November launch, accelerating the release of GPT Image 1.5 from its planned January debut. The updated model promises four times faster generation speeds and more precise editing capabilities, though it remains to be seen whether technical improvements alone can recapture the cultural momentum Google has built with its viral image tool.Meta's response involves poaching top talent and heavy investment. The company recruited Wang after investing over $14 billion in his Scale AI startup and brought in more than 20 researchers from OpenAI to staff its new Superintelligence Labs division. The group is developing both Mango and ""Avocado,"" a text-based language model focused on coding capabilities, WSJ reported. Both models said to signal Meta's shift beyond incremental updates to its current Llama family toward more ambitious AI development."," Meta is developing ""Mango,"" a new image and video AI model designed to counter Google's wildly successful Nano Banana generator.

“We continue to be committed to AWS as our predominant strategic cloud partner.""

“Our pricing philosophy is to work relentlessly to take cost out of our own cost structure and to pass those savings back to our AWS customers in the form of lower prices.

This change will help the US banking major manage rising expenses associated with its artificial intelligence (AI), a report claims. According to an internal Nvidia document obtained by Business Insider, the bank is concerned about its cloud-computing relationship with Amazon and isIn an internal memo, the Nvidia employee revealed that the bank expects demand for specialised chips and reasoning models to increase significantly.

Nvidia has also been working with these startups to reduce its dependence on large cloud companies.The Capital One situation shows a critical pattern in the AI boom. Companies are rushing to adopt generative AI while also trying to reduce rising cloud costs. This new technology is up-and-coming, but creating and running AI models and AI applications can be costly.Major companies also regularly review their cloud spending, including different setups that more and more use multiple providers. 43% of companies use more than two public cloud providers, according to a recent RBC Capital report.Capital One isn't the only company complaining about AWS costs. A previous report from October claimed that AI startups are increasingly shifting traditional AWS spending to AI models and developer tools, according to internal Amazon documents from March and July.The documents said that 90% of startups in Radical Ventures' portfolio were building primarily on competing clouds due to AWS costs.

Amazon security head Stephen Schmidt on catching North Korean operative posing as IT worker: Commands typed on his laptop were…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-security-head-stephen-schmidt-on-catching-north-korean-operative-posing-as-it-worker-typed-commands-on-his-laptop-were/articleshow/126074458.cms,"North Korean operatives are attempting to infiltrate global tech firms like Amazon by posing as remote IT workers. Security protocols, like detecting minute typing delays, have helped thwart these efforts. Over 1,800 such attempts were stopped at Amazon this year alone, highlighting a growing trend to fund state weapons programs through illicit remote work schemes.

“infinitesimal”

""This looks like somebody who had used the same playbook as other North Koreans that we've seen to get this job,""

1800 North Koreans have tried to infiltrate Amazon in a year

“If we hadn't been looking for the DPRK workers, we would not have found them.”





A North Korean operative posing as a remote IT worker for an Amazon contractor was caught after security protocols detected a tiny delay in his typing speed. Amazon Chief Security Officer Stephen Schmidt revealed that anlag in keystroke data provided the initial evidence that the employee was not working from within the United States as claimed. While keystroke data from a domestic worker typically reaches Amazon’s Seattle headquarters in tens of milliseconds, this specific machine showed a consistent latency of more than 110 milliseconds. The delay indicated that the person controlling the laptop was actually located halfway across the world, despite having access to a corporate computer, Schmidt told Bloomberg. The computer didn't have access to ""anything interesting,"" Schmidt said, so security workers spent some time watching the imposter. When they looked at the job application and resume the person had given to the contractor, what was really happening became obvious, he said.The incident is part of a growing trend involving North Korean citizens who bypass international sanctions by securing remote IT roles under false identities. These individuals often work through third-party contractors to funnel wages back to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to fund state weapons programs.Schmidt noted.An Amazon spokesperson told Bloomberg News that the person working for North Korea was an Arizona woman who in July was sentenced to years in prison for her part in a plan to help fake IT workers.While sometimes imposters will steal a real person's identity, Schmidt said, the fakes tend to follow a similar pattern of claiming to study at the same schools and work at the same companies, often overseas consulting businesses that are difficult to check from the USOther warning signs include struggling with American expressions and English words like ""a,"" ""an"" or ""the,"" he said. Schmidt said the person was removed from Amazon's systems within days. He emphasized the importance of carefully checking potential employees' backgrounds, going beyond just looking at LinkedIn, and having ""quality security software"" that can detect small warning signs, like tiny delays in data transfer from fingers typing on a keyboard.This pattern of infiltration has created significant legal and security hurdles for companies of all sizes. By exploiting the shift to remote work, these impostors gain access to sensitive corporate infrastructure, prompting major firms like Amazon to implement highly technical monitoring tools to verify the physical locations of their workforces.Since April 2024, Amazon workers have caught and stopped more than 1,800 attempts by North Koreans trying to get hired, Schmidt said during a security meeting at the company's New York City office this week. This year, these kinds of attempts have increased by 27% on average from one three-month period to the next, the company says.Amazon didn't directly hire any North Koreans, Schmidt told Bloomberg. However, he said the high number of times that fake applicants tried to get jobs at the company and the fact that Amazon sent a work computer to a contractor who turned out to be working for North Korea should be a warning sign.Schmidt said.This year, Amazon security workers started carefully watching a systems administrator hired by an outside company after monitoring tools on the person's Amazon laptop sent a warning about strange activity, Schmidt said. Amazon discovered the computer was being controlled remotely, he said, and tracked the internet traffic as far as possible, back to China.","North Korean operatives are attempting to infiltrate global tech firms like Amazon by posing as remote IT workers.

Sweeney labels 15% web-purchase fee and the 5% distribution fee as illegal



Sadly, Fortnite will not return to iOS in Japan in 2025 as promised. Apple was required to open up iOS to competing stores today, and instead of doing so honestly, they have launched another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking in gross disrespect to the government and people of Japan.

Apple chose poorly. Again.

They're charging a competition-crushing 21% junk fee on third-party in-app payments, and 15% for purchases made on the web (a practice the US District Court already found to be illegal in the contempt of court proceeding that Apple lost and the 9th Circuit Court upheld): https://developer.apple.com/support/payment-options-on-the-app-store-in-japan

They're introducing new anticompetitive warning screens meant to mislead customers into believing their privacy and financial security are at risk when dealing with Apple competitors.

They're imposing a new 5% junk fee on all revenue from apps distributed by competing stores, and intend to surveil all transactions within them using a mandatory reporting API: https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/making-payments-to-apple/reporting-tokens-and-transactions. This is an egregious Apple imposition on distribution and payments they have no involvement with, and a practice the US courts already found to be illegal and upheld on appeal.

Obviously, real competition won't happen, and consumers won't benefit, when Apple abuses its position between users and competitors to obstruct honest dealing between them. This is another sad day in the history of relationships between platform makers, developers, and consumers, and we will be raising our complaints with the Japanese Fair Trade Commission.





Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic Games, has lashed out at Apple as the tech giant opened the iPhone to alternative app marketplaces in Japan to comply with new local laws. Soon after Apple’s announcement, Sweeney took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter), calling the move a “travesty of obstruction” while confirming that Fortnite will not return to iOS in Japan as promised for 2025.Japan's new competition laws have been designed to break Apple’s 30% commission monopoly, and provide Japanese developers a “choice” while maintaining security. According to changes, Japanese developers can now launch their own app stores on iPhone, paying Apple a 5% commission on sales. Furthermore, developers using the standard App Store can now link to external websites for payments, though Apple will still collect a 15% fee on those transactions.Sweeney, who has been a longtime critic of Apple’s “walled garden,” denounced the new rules as anticompetitive while arguing that Apple is swapping one monopoly for another through a series of “junk fees.”","Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic Games, has lashed out at Apple as the tech giant opened the iPhone to alternative app marketplaces in Japan.

Starlink in India





Elon Musk’s Starlink has signed its first office space in India, reports Economic Times. The space broadband company has leased a 50-seater office at the World Trade Centre in Delhi’s Nauroji Nagar. Two people aware of the development told the publication that the space has been taken on lease through premium flexible workspace provider CorporatEdge. The company recently leased 51,000 square feet at Godrej GCR in Gurugram. As per ET reports, CorporateEdge is expected to close the current fiscal year with an operational and signed portfolio of 590,000 square feet.The World Trade Centre in Delhi has also attracted other global tech firms. US-based OpenAI recently finalized its first India office in the same complex.“These firms are also seeking operational flexibility and premium services. Managed office providers offering high-end spaces with hospitality-style services are the preferred choice,” one of the people cited above said.Starlink’s move comes as the company prepares for its planned commercial launch in India, subject to regulatory approval for its satellite communication services.Earlier this month, a glitch accidentally listed full residential pricing on Starlink’s local website.Starlink is a satellite-based internet service developed by SpaceX , the U.S. aerospace company founded in 2002 by Elon Musk, currently the world’s richest man. It offers high-speed, low-latency broadband internet across the globe using a network of satellites—earning it the nickname “broadband from the skies.”Unlike traditional satellite services that use faraway geostationary satellites, Starlink operates through the world’s largest network of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, positioned just 550 km above Earth.The company got licence for satcom services in India earlier this year. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) issued the Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite (GMPCS) permit to the US company in June 2025.Earlier this month, pricing of Starlink services in India were listed on its website. The pricing revealed that the residential plan may have a monthly subscription cost of Rs 8,600. However, the company later denied the pricing, calling the incident a ‘technical glitch’.In a related news, Starlink, Jio and Airtel may have to wait longer than expected to launch satellite based internet services in India because of a standoff between the telecom regulatory authority of India (TRAI) and the department of telecommunications (DoT) over spectrum pricing. The report quotes industry executives who said that the process could potentially take another 3-6 months amid upcoming personnel changes at the DoT and industry interference.Till date, Starlink, Eutelsat OneWeb and Jio Satellite have completed most of the licensing and space-regulatory steps, including obtaining the Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite (GMPCS) licence, and approvals from space-regulatory body In-SPACe.","The space broadband company has leased a 50-seater office at the World Trade Centre in Delhi’s Nauroji Nagar.

Why IPO stocks keep surging after listing: Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath explains the ‘short trap’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-ipo-stocks-keep-surging-after-listing-zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamath-explains-the-short-trap/articleshow/126070859.cms,"Read Nithin Kamath’s complete post here



I've been noticing many recent IPOs continue running up for 2-3 days after listing. While demand and supply factors (limited free float) are obvious reasons, there may also be technical factors at play.

Let me explain the technical factor.

Many traders attempt to short these stocks intraday, expecting a fall, but if the stock hits the upper circuit, they get trapped with no buyers to sell to. This leads to what’s called a short delivery.

When this happens, the exchange conducts an auction the next day between 2:30 PM and 3:00 PM to settle the trade. These auctions can happen at a significant premium to the market price.

For instance, today Meesho's auction price was ₹258, while the market price at the time was around ₹226.

By the way, if you hold these stocks in your demat, you can actually offer your shares directly during this auction window. It’s a great way to exit at a potentially higher price while also helping the exchange settle the trade. We've enabled this on @zerodhaonline —you can participate directly from your holdings.

More details in the article in the comments.





As India’s IPO market continues to see stocks rally for days after listing, Zerodha founder Nithin Kamath has shed light on a technical factor behind the phenomenon: short deliveries and exchange auctions. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Kamath noted that while the demand-supply imbalances and limited free float are obvious drivers, many traders are attempting to short IPO stocks intraday often get trapped when share hit the upper circuit. With no buyers available, these trades result in short deliveries.In the post shared, Kamath has also explained the how the short deliveries tigger auctions. When short deliveries occur, the exchange comes into action the tech day to settle trades via an auction window between 2.30 pm and 3.00 PM. These actions then clear at significant premiums as compared to the prevailing market price. Kamath gave example of Meesho’s IPO, where the auction price hit Rs 258, while its market price was around Rs 226 at the time. This mechanism not only explains the regular upward momentum in IPO stocks but it also creates opportunities for investors holding shares in their demat accounts.Kamath stressed on the fact that retail investors can offer their shares directly during the auction window, potentially existing at higher prices while helping the exchange settle trades. Zerodha has also enabled this feature on its app which enable users to participate seamlessly form their holdings. He cautioned that missing this opportunity means “handing profits to someone else,” urging investors to be aware of how auctions work in the IPO settlement process.","Many traders attempt to short IPO stocks intraday, expecting a fall.

Conclusion





For nearly two decades, the browser market appeared settled. Google Chrome has become the dominant gateway to the internet, holding more than 60% global market share, leaving rivals such as Microsoft's Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Opera fighting for relevance. But with the rise of generative and agentic artificial intelligence (AI), the basic idea of what a browser is—and what it should do—is being redefined. A wave of AI-first browsers and assistants is now challenging the long-standing architecture of the web, pushing tech giants into a new strategic conflict — the battle to control the interface through which people access information, complete tasks, and interact with AI.This competition intensified sharply this year. OpenAI launched ChatGPT Atlas, its dedicated AI browser. Perplexity rolled out Comet, a browser that embeds an intelligent agent capable of reading, summarizing, and acting across webpages. Opera revitalized its strategy with Neon, introducing built-in AI workflows and action tools. Then, in a major shift, Google recently launched Disco, an experimental browser built around generative AI—and, unlike the competition, it attempts to rethink browsing from first principles rather than layering AI onto existing structures.As Fortune reported, “AI is shaking up the browser market,” turning a previously stagnant category into a new frontier for competition. Meanwhile, Forbes argued that Google has advantages the public often overlooks, noting that while OpenAI launches flashy standalone products, Google quietly embeds AI across Search, Chrome, Gmail , Docs, and Android—the places where billions of users already spend their time. The result is that the AI browser war “may have been over before it began.”But inside the industry, the battle is only just starting, and the stakes are enormous. Whoever controls the interface layer—the browser, app, or AI agent users rely on—will control the future of online behaviour, advertising revenue, data flows, and attention. In this story, we try to analyze how we reached this turning point, why the major players are fighting so hard, and what it means for the future of the internet.When Google announced Disco earlier this month, it avoided positioning the product as a Chrome replacement. Instead, it specifically presented Disco as an experimental browser—a testbed for ideas that may later move into Chrome or Gemini-powered products. But the technology behind Disco represents one of the biggest conceptual shifts in how browsing could work.Disco’s most significant feature is GenTabs, an AI system powered by Gemini 3. Rather than opening multiple tabs and manually sorting information, GenTabs automatically analyses your activity and generates dynamic, personalized applications based on what you are doing.If one researches holiday destinations, GenTabs builds a trip planner with maps, suggesting itineraries, and saved references. If one explores recipes across different sites, it generates a cooking dashboard with ingredients and shopping lists. If one reviews academic papers, it produces learning tools, summaries, or visual concept maps.These aren’t simple summaries. Google says that GenTabs creates functional, interactive tools that behave like apps. While users can refine them with natural language prompts, all AI outputs link back to the original sources, maintaining transparency and accountability.This approach is fundamentally different from competitors. OpenAI’s Atlas, Perplexity’s Comet, and Microsoft Edge with Copilot mostly add AI sidebars or conversational layers onto existing browser structures. GenTabs reimagines browsing as a data synthesis activity rather than a page navigation exercise.Although Disco is currently limited to macOS and available via waitlist, its significance lies in what it signals: Google is testing what a post-Web browser might look like. The company has historically used Google Labs to experiment with bold ideas that sometimes end up in flagship products. The shift from individual tabs to AI-generated interfaces could mark a fundamental evolution of Chrome in the years ahead.As Forbes noted, Google has a decisive structural advantage: it “already owns the default behaviour of the web experience itself.” Rather than convincing users to download a new browser, Google can quietly deploy AI updates to billions of users—no friction, no shift in habits. That foundation is becoming increasingly important as competitors attempt to disrupt browsing from the outside.OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT Atlas came with high expectations. During the launch, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called it a “once-a-decade opportunity to rethink what a browser can be.” Atlas introduces a number of AI-driven capabilities:Like Perplexity’s Comet and Opera’s Neon, Atlas is built on Chromium, the open-source browser engine maintained by Google. Chromium controls how pages load, how tabs are rendered, and how the browser interacts with the web.This dependence limits OpenAI in several ways:As explained in a Fortune article, “building a browser from scratch is extraordinarily difficult.” Even Microsoft abandoned its own engine to adopt Chromium for Edge. This leaves Atlas innovative, but constrained.OpenAI must convince hundreds of millions of users to download and switch to Atlas. That alone is a massive challenge. Chrome did not simply succeed because it was fast—it succeeded because Google distributed it through search results, preinstalls, Gmail notifications, and YouTube prompts.As Forbes notes, “Atlas may generate excitement in tech circles, but excitement doesn’t equal market position.” Chrome still controls the gateway to the web—and Google is fortifying that position through Gemini integration.While Google and OpenAI dominate the conversation, smaller players are pushing the boundaries in ways big companies may not attempt.Perplexity Comet blends a traditional web browser with a built-in AI agent that can:This approach positions Comet as a hybrid between a browser and a personal assistant. As Fortune notes in an article, an AI browser enables “both the human and AI model to access the web at the same time.” The agent can work in one tab while the user interacts with another—something standard chatbots cannot do.Comet also plays into Perplexity’s broader strategy: building AI search tools capable of competing with Google.Opera’s Neon introduces several AI-driven features, including Do – an action tool that performs operations directly on a webpage; Cards, which store workflow templates and saved prompts for repeated use; and built-in AI capabilities for summarising pages and automating tasks.As Opera’s EVP Krystian Kolondra told Fortune, “browsers today are the operating system of your applications.” In this view, the browser becomes the centre of productivity, not just navigation.Opera sees the browser as the primary AI gateway—a perspective shared by most companies in this new race.People spend hours a day inside their browser. Emails, documents, search queries, shopping, video calls—much of this occurs in the browser window itself. For AI companies, controlling this space means controlling the flow of attention, data, and transactions. Perplexity’s chief business officer told Fortune, “The browser is an incredibly powerful canvas.”The browser has become the new battleground because it now functions as the central gateway to a user’s digital life, rather than just a tool for viewing webpages. Most daily online activity—searching, reading, shopping, working, and even accessing enterprise applications—still happens inside a browser window. As Fortune points out, companies see the browser as the “operating system of your applications,” giving whoever controls it unparalleled visibility into user behaviour and preferences.AI accelerates this shift. Instead of simply loading websites, modern browsers are expected to interpret content, take actions on behalf of users, and coordinate tasks across email, calendars, documents, and messaging tools. This makes the browser the natural home for autonomous AI agents, which need consistent access to context and continuous interaction with a user’s digital environment. For tech companies competing in AI, owning the browser is strategically valuable because it offers a unified interface through which both humans and AI systems can work side by side.While companies like OpenAI draw significant attention, Forbes argues that Google is quietly winning the AI browser war through strategy, infrastructure, and scale. Chrome remains Google’s strongest asset, with an estimated user base of more than 3 billion people worldwide. This gives Google a level of reach that no competitor can match, and it also means any new browser is attempting to disrupt a behaviour pattern that has been built over more than a decade. Users rarely change their default browser, and Chrome’s long-term dominance makes switching even less likely.Google has also embedded its Gemini AI directly into products that people already rely on daily. This includes Chrome, Search, Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and Android. By integrating AI inside existing workflows rather than requiring users to download a new tool, Google can distribute new capabilities instantly to billions of people. The result is a low-friction adoption model that competitors such as OpenAI, Perplexity, and Opera do not possess.In addition to its consumer-facing advantages, Google also plays a central role in the wider AI ecosystem. As Forbes notes, Google Cloud is the preferred infrastructure provider for many AI startups, and the company is reportedly in talks with Anthropic for a large-scale cloud and AI chip partnership. This means Google not only controls the environment where users browse, but also the backend infrastructure that other AI companies require to operate.Together, these factors give Google a structural edge that shapes the competitive landscape long before new AI browsers reach the market.AI browsers introduce new privacy challenges. Unlike traditional search engines that only see queries, AI agents embedded inside the browser can access entire pages, user actions, scroll patterns, and intentions. As UCL’s George Chalhoub told Fortune: “An AI-powered browser doesn’t just observe your behaviour; it can infer your intentions, habits, and even your mood.”This expands both capability and risk.AI agents operating inside email, chats, and documents could expose:Even Sam Altman recently warned users that ChatGPT conversations are not legally protected from subpoenas. Opera, in response, has emphasised strong encryption and limited processing, but broader industry standards are still emerging.Despite hype about “browser disruption,” almost every AI browser remains tied to Chromium. Fortune explains that building a browser engine from scratch requires enormous investment and maintenance. Even Microsoft abandoned its proprietary engine, EdgeHTML, to adopt Chromium.This means:As Chalhoub says, “I don’t see any company building its browser from scratch.” This reality ensures Google remains central to the ecosystem—even for its challengers.While AI browsers offer advanced features, they face the biggest long-term barrier: user habits. People have been browsing the web the same way for 30 years—typing URLs, clicking links, navigating pages.Chalhoub notes that browsers are “stable and predictable,” creating deep user trust. But small conveniences—automatic trip planning, task completion, summarised reading—could gradually shift behaviour.The question is whether these enhancements are enough to convince mainstream users to switch.The AI browser race is only beginning, but the competitive landscape is already taking shape. OpenAI, Perplexity, and Opera are pushing new models of browsing that rely on autonomous agents, task automation, and tightly integrated AI features. These products represent a shift from the browser as a passive navigation tool to one that actively interprets and performs actions on behalf of the user.Google, meanwhile, is approaching the shift from a position of structural strength by embedding Gemini across Chrome, Search, Android, and its productivity tools. AI simply becomes part of the environment they already use. Its control over Chromium and its influence across cloud infrastructure further reinforce that advantage.The next phase of competition will depend on whether users embrace a fundamentally different browsing experience or whether AI-enhanced versions of familiar tools remain the dominant model. Behavioural change in technology is slow, but convenience can accelerate adoption, especially if AI agents begin saving time or completing complex tasks reliably.What is clear is that the browser is no longer just a window to the web. It is becoming the primary interface where human intent, AI reasoning, and the modern internet intersect. As companies race to define what that interface should look like, the outcome of the AI browser war will likely determine how billions of people interact with information for years to come.","AI is shaking up the browser market, turning a previously stagnant category into a new frontier for competition. Google recently launched Disco, an experimental browser built around generative AI. Perplexity rolled out Comet, a browser that embeds an intelligent agent capable of reading, summarizing, and acting across webpages.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126069866,imgsize-26696,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-browser-war.jpg"

He views AI as both a critical opportunity and a potential threat, personally engaging leaders to ensure commitment. This aggressive push involves significant organizational shifts and a renewed focus on technical innovation to prevent obsolescence.

CEO Satya Nadella ’s fear of irrelevance drives aggressive transformation push





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is delivering a stark message to his top executives: sign on to the company's artificial intelligence transformation or leave, according to internal documents and employee interviews obtained by Business Insider. The ultimatum comes as Nadella views AI as both an existential threat and Microsoft's biggest opportunity in decades, with the CEO personally conducting conversations with senior leaders about their willingness to embrace the intense workload ahead.""Satya is pushing on intensity and urgency,"" one Microsoft executive told Business Insider, adding that the pressure is forcing some Microsoft veterans to decide whether they want to stay and commit to the mountain of work required. ""You've gotta be asking yourself how much longer you want to do this,"" the executive added. People familiar with the matter said Nadella is having direct conversations with executives to secure their commitment to the transformation or facilitate their departure.The AI push has triggered major organisational changes across Microsoft. Nadella recently promoted Judson Althoff to CEO of the company's commercial business, explicitly to free up the CEO's time for ""laser focus"" on technical work including datacenter buildout, systems architecture, and AI product innovation, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider.This marked a significant shift, with Althoff delivering the keynote at Microsoft's recent Ignite conference—the first time in Nadella's tenure that the CEO didn't take the spotlight.Business Insider reports that Nadella has also launched weekly AI accelerator meetings featuring lower-level technical employees rather than executives, deliberately creating what insiders describe as a ""messy and chaotic"" environment designed to avoid top-down leadership. In a Teams channel for corporate vice presidents and above, Nadella wrote that leaders must ""work and act like ICs in our own orgs,"" referring to Individual Contributors focused on technical work rather than people management.""I chuckle a bit each time someone sends me a note about talking to a friend at an AI start-up, about how differently they're working, how agile, focused, fast they are,"" Nadella wrote. ""The reality is that this work is also happening right here at Microsoft under our noses!”More executive changes appear imminent. Three Microsoft executives told Business Insider that longtime Office and Windows chief Rajesh Jha has been considering retirement, though his decision remains uncertain given renewed excitement about AI's potential. If Jha departs, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky is viewed as a potential successor. Microsoft recently expanded Roslansky's role to include Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and the Microsoft 365 Copilot application, with him now reporting to both Jha and Nadella.Asha Sharma, Microsoft's CoreAI product president who joined in 2024, explained that Nadella's new ""production function"" concept involves using AI to radically change how the company creates and delivers products. ""AI breaks that relationship"" between traditional software development inputs and outputs, Sharma said in a company-arranged interview, noting that AI agents and intelligence now act as scalable units that can generate software without corresponding increases in engineering hours.The urgency stems from Nadella's deep-seated fear of Microsoft becoming irrelevant. Speaking at an employee town hall in September, Nadella revealed he remains ""haunted"" by the collapse of Digital Equipment Corporation, once a dominant computer manufacturer that failed to adapt to industry shifts. ""Some of the biggest businesses we've built might not be as relevant going forward,"" Nadella admitted, warning that even Microsoft's most profitable products face uncertainty.Earlier this year, Microsoft laid off approximately 6,000 employees in May and an additional 9,000 in July. In a July memo, Nadella described the cuts as part of a difficult process of ""unlearning and learning"" necessary to navigate the AI era. Employee morale has plummeted to all-time lows, with workers describing the company as feeling ""markedly different, colder, more rigid,"" according to reports from The Verge.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is demanding executives fully embrace the company's AI transformation or face departure.

Shark Tank India Judge Anupam Mittal on why AI won’t replace humans anytime soon: ‘The brain runs on 20 watts’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/shark-tank-india-judge-anupam-mittal-on-why-ai-wont-replace-humans-anytime-soon-the-brain-runs-on-20-watts/articleshow/126068827.cms,"Read Anupam Mittal’s complete post here



‘Is AI about to replace humans?’

Short answer: Not anytime soon

To match a single human brain using today’s AI approaches, you’d need something close to a football-field-sized data centre running flat out - just to mimic how one person sees, thinks, learns, and decides in real time.

All that to replicate what your brain does on 20 watts.

If you go further and try to replicate the brain 𝘣𝘪𝘰𝘭𝘰𝘨𝘪𝘤𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺- neurons, synapses, chemistry, plasticity - you’re no longer talking about a data center.

Theoretically, it can be done but you need a computer the size of planet Earth 🌍

That’s the gap people forget 🤷

AI is exceptional at automation, repetition, and pattern extraction at scale.

But judgment, creativity, context, taste, and knowing when 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘵𝘰 𝘢𝘤𝘵 aren’t just more parameters.

They’ve evolved over millions of years & are emergent properties of a system that learns continuously, reasons across domains, and compresses reality with extreme efficiency.

Until we see a fundamental shift in how intelligence is computed - not just bigger models and more GPUs - replacing human creativity isn’t a near-term threat.

The real miracle of the brain isn’t intelligence.

It’s all the complexity that fits inside your skull, runs on sugar and oxygen, and dissipates less heat than a light bulb.

That’s the human flex AI can’t replicate 😅





Shark Tank India judge and Shaadi.com founder Anupam Mittal has now shared his opinion on the ongoing debate of whether AI will replace human or not. Mittal argues that the technology is still far from replicating the complexity of the human bran. In a widely shared post titled “Is AI about to replace humans?”, Mittal offered a short answer: “Not anytime soon.” In a lengthy post shared on professional networking platform LinkedIn, Mittal explained that to match a single human brain using today’s AI approaches, one would need a football-field-sized data center running at full capacity—just to mimic how one person sees, thinks, learns, and decides in real time. He emphasised that by contrast the human brain performs all these tasks on just 20 watts of energy which is less than that of a household light bulb.Mittal also noted that replicating the human brain biologically neurons, synapses, chemistry, and plasticity would actually need a computer the size of planet Earth. “That’s the gap people forget,” he wrote. Mittal does acknowledge the fact that AI is exceptional at the tasks like automation, repetition and pattern extraction at scale but believes that qualities like creativity, judgement, context, resistant and taster are not the parameters to compute.“These have evolved over millions of years and are emergent properties of a system that learns continuously, reasons across domains, and compresses reality with extreme efficiency,” he said.As per Mittal, replacing the human creativity would require a fundamental shift in how intelligence is computed, not just bigger models and more GPUs. Until then, he believes AI will remain a powerful tool but not a substitute for human ingenuity. “The real miracle of the brain isn’t intelligence,” he concluded. “It’s all the complexity that fits inside your skull, runs on sugar and oxygen, and dissipates less heat than a light bulb.

Google To Invest $15 Billion On AI Hub In Visakhapatnam, CEO Sundar Pichai Speaks To PM Modi

Two big bets Sundar Pichai made when became CEO in 2019

'Un-Googling' of Google Cloud

Betting on Chips and Competitors





Once seen as a laggard in Google parent Alphabet’s portfolio, Google Cloud has emerged as one of the company’s fastest-growing divisions, powered by surging demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and years of heavy investment in data centers, custom chips, and networking infrastructure. At earnings call this week, Alphabet said that its cloud revenue topped $15 billion in the third quarter, a 34% year-on-year increase, reflecting strong uptake of AI infrastructure and services — including Google’s own Gemini model.The unit is now challenging YouTube as Alphabet’s second-largest revenue generator after search advertising. “Google Cloud is one of the most important priorities for Alphabet as a whole, and I expect it to play an even more central role as the company moves forward,” CEO Sundar Pichai told Reuters in an interview earlier in October. Much of that growth has been driven by Thomas Kurian, a former Oracle executive who took over in 2018 and has since boosted Google Cloud’s market share from 7% to 13%, according to Synergy Research Group.When Pichai succeeded co-founder Larry Page as CEO in 2019, he named YouTube and Google Cloud as his two big bets to diversify Alphabet beyond advertising. YouTube has already delivered, becoming the world’s largest video platform with more than a billion hours watched daily. Google Cloud, by contrast, lost billions between 2018 and 2022 before turning its first profit in 2023. Now, with the rise of generative AI, Alphabet sees a new opportunity to narrow the gap with Microsoft and Amazon, which control roughly 20% and 30% of the market, respectively.“This is the moment Google Cloud was waiting for,” said Dave McCarthy, research director at IDC. “A lot of the future growth at Alphabet is being looked at through its potential.”In interviews with Reuters, senior executives described how Google Cloud’s turnaround was achieved through a cultural reset — shifting to a customer-driven sales model, tightening financial discipline, and working more closely with rivals.Kurian slashed costs by opening offices in lower-cost locations such as North Carolina and Poland and renegotiating internal contracts that overcharged his division, Reuters reported. He also restructured the sales strategy to target industries rather than geographies and replaced Google’s loose, experimental culture with what insiders called an “un-Googley” focus on execution and accountability.Google Cloud’s growth has also been propelled by a pivotal internal shift: in 2022, Kurian convinced Pichai to move Google’s in-house TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) chip business under his control. That allowed the cloud division to offer Alphabet’s own AI chips directly to customers — including rivals.Nine of the ten leading AI labs, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Safe Superintelligence, now use Google Cloud, Kurian said in September. “We are the only hyperscaler with both silicon and models of our own,” he told Reuters.The move paid off. In 2024, Anthropic expanded its deal with Google to deploy up to one million TPUs, worth tens of billions of dollars, as it sought alternatives to Nvidia hardware. Other major AI developers, including Apple, have since followed.","Google Cloud has emerged as one of the company’s fastest-growing divisions.

Mystery of Comet 3I/ATLAS

Russia Joins UFO Map: Strange Green Fireball Over Moscow Sparks Frenzy After US | ‘Not From Earth?’

Elon Musk and Joe Rogan discuss 3I/ATLAS

Elon Musk makes a public vow on Aliens





Recent, simultaneous developments in Space technology and astronomy have fueled intrigue and speculation: Unauthorized signal transmissions tied to SpaceX's Starshield network are coinciding with heightened scrutiny of a bizarre, Manhattan-sized interstellar object known as Comet 3I/ATLAS. The connection deepened on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, where host Joe Rogan and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk discussed the comet's anomalous characteristics, leading to an astonishing conversation that touched on potential alien probes and even the historic Tunguska Event of 1908.First spotted in July, Comet 3I/ATLAS is behaving unlike any object scientists have seen before. The speculation surrounding its nature intensified after Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb boldly claimed the interstellar visitor could be an ""alien probe sent to do recon on Earth,"" a quote Rogan brought up on the show. Loeb went on to accuse NASA of withholding critical information about 3I/ATLAS. Earlier, the Harvard scientist has said that the Manhattan-sized interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS could have extraterrestrial origins. Along with its unusual tail orientation, Loeb noted that it was spouting a plume of four grams of nickel per second with no evidence of iron, which is a phenomenon unheard of in comets. He has also reportedly voiced concern over ATLAS’s nongravitational acceleration and anomalous trajectory that will bring it suspiciously close to Jupiter, Venus and Mars.Rogan highlighted a key, baffling characteristic: The discovery of nickel in the comet’s gas cloud, noting that, on Earth, this is primarily found in industrial alloys. Elon Musk, however, offered a terrestrial explanation for the nickel deposits. He stated that many comets and asteroids are ""made primarily of nickel,"" and that ""the places where you mine nickel on Earth is actually where there was an asteroid or comet that hit earth—that was a nickel rich meteorite. ""When pressed on the possibility of the object being an alien spacecraft, Musk acknowledged the implications of a nickel-heavy construction. ""It would be a very sort of heavy spaceship if you make it all out of nickel,"" he said, adding that such a vessel ""would like obliterate a continent type of thing—maybe worse.""In what can be termed as a bizarre moment that underscored the conspiratorial undertones of the discussion, Rogan asked Musk if he was keeping up to date with the comet. Elon Musk’s response was a public promise regarding the existence of extraterrestrial life: ""I mean, one thing I can say is like, look, if I was aware of any evidence of aliens -- Joe, you have my word -- I will come on your show and I will reveal it on the show. ""Elon Musk then made an emphatic, public declaration to address a conspiracy theory suggesting that those who know the truth about alien contact are silenced: ""I’m never committing suicide, to be clear. So, on camera, guys, I am never committing suicide ever!""The confluence of unexplained signals from a major satellite network and an interstellar object exhibiting properties likened to artificial origins has reignited public fascination with the final frontier, leaving many to wonder what other secrets Comet 3I/ATLAS might hold as it hurtles through our solar system.","Comet 3I/ATLAS is behaving unlike any object scientists have seen before.

Amazon layoffs hit engineers hardest in its Home state; here's what filing with Employment Security Department says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-layoffs-hit-software-engineers-hardest-in-its-home-state-heres-what-filing-with-employment-security-department-says/articleshow/125021493.cms,"Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency

What Amazon filing with the Washington Employment Security Department says

""This letter is being issued in accordance with any possible obligation under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and the Washington Securing Timely Notification and Benefits for Laid-Off Employees Act (collectively, “WARN”) to notify you that Amazon is separating employees at the below facilities within the state of Washington (collectively, the “Facilities”), with employee separations expected to commence effective January 26, 2026.

As a result of this action, we anticipate that the above-described approximately 2,303 employees will be separated from employment with Amazon, with separations effective on the following dates: January 26, 2026; January 30, 2026; February 5, 2026; February 25, 2026; February 27, 2026; March 19, 2026; April 1, 2026; April 26, 2026; and May 26, 2026. While WARN requires only 60 days’ advance notice, Amazon is providing at least 90 days’ notice to all affected employees before their separations are scheduled to occur. Affected employees who accept internal transfer opportunities at Amazon prior to their separation date will not be separated as a result of this action.

Employee separations resulting from this action are expected to be permanent. The affected employees are not represented by a union or any other collective bargaining representative. Amazon and its affiliates do not allow separated employees to displace any other employee based on seniority or any other factor (i.e., no “bumping rights” exist). Affected employees who are separated as a result of this action will be paid all wages and other benefits to which they are entitled (if any) through their date of separation, provided they do not resign from their employment with Amazon prior to that date. On or before the effective date of each employee’s separation, Amazon will provide information concerning benefits and (as applicable) severance available under separate cover to eligible affected employees. This action is not the result of, nor reasonably expected to result in, any overall relocation or contracting out of Amazon’s Washington operations/employee positions.

A list of the job titles held by the above-referenced affected employees, and the number of affected employees holding each such job title, is attached hereto. At Amazon we take the responsibility of protecting the personal information of our employees very seriously, including taking steps to ensure that any recipients of such information maintain it confidentially. Given that this notice is generally obtainable by third parties, and that affected employees have a legitimate privacy interest in not having their names, contact information, and selection for layoff made available to the general public for review, republication, or other purposes, we have omitted employee names and home addresses from this notice. The privacy interest here is the same interest that underlies the confidentiality of unemployment compensation information in the Employment Security Department’s files. RCW 50.13.020. To assist with communication between affected employees and the Department, we are providing the Department’s contact information to all affected employees.

We are providing you with this notice based upon the best information available to us at this time and do not plan to provide future notices with respect to this action. We wish to provide you with notices that are helpful, rather than inundate you with repeated or intermittent updates. However, please let us know if you would like us to provide you with future notices or additional information.





Software development engineers represent the biggest group hit by Amazon's newest layoffs in the company's Home state -- Washington. According to a GeekWire report, citing a fresh filing with the Washington Employment Security Department, Amazon plans to cut 2,303 corporate jobs in the state -- primarily in Seattle and Bellevue -- as part of a global reduction affecting roughly 14,000 employees announced the same day.The state's detailed breakdown shows over 600 software development engineering positions among those eliminated, accounting for more than a quarter of the Washington total. This pattern echoes Microsoft's engineering cuts earlier this year, as tech companies recalibrate amid AI-powered coding advancements. Amazon launched its own AI tool, Kiro, in July and has explored integrating the Cursor AI code assistant for staff. The engineer reductions signal a profound evolution in an industry long dependent on human coders for core infrastructure.In Washington, more than 500 manager roles are also being slashed, supporting Amazon's goal of trimming bureaucracy for greater efficiency. Cuts extend to recruiting, HR, marketing, advertising, and legal functions.The hardest-hit location is Amazon's SEA40 Doppler building on 7th Avenue in Seattle, with 361 jobs lost, per the filing.Over 100 Washington-based remote workers are additionally affected.“This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet,” Amazon HR chief Beth Galetti stated in a employee message, noting that it allows teams to “innovate much faster than ever before.” These moves contribute to wider AI-driven disruptions in tech and white-collar work, per a Wall Street Journal article this week on nationwide layoffs and an Axios piece headlined “How an AI job apocalypse unfolds. ”","Report: Amazon plans to cut 2,303 corporate jobs in the state of Washington.

Alaska Airlines hires Accenture to audit IT systems after global outage forced it to cancel quarterly earnings call,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/alaska-airlines-hires-accenture-to-audit-it-systems-after-global-outage-forced-it-to-cancel-quarterly-earnings-call/articleshow/125020707.cms,"Representative Image





Alaska Airlines has announced that it has hired global consulting company Accenture to conduct a full-scale audit of its technology systems, following two major IT outages that have disrupted operations in recent months. The airline said the independent review will assess its entire technology ecosystem — including systems, standards, and operational processes — as part of a broader effort to strengthen reliability and prevent future breakdowns.The decision comes on the heels of a massive system failure last week that grounded flights for eight hours, disrupting travel for more than 49,000 passengers and forcing the cancellation of over 400 flights across Alaska Airlines and its regional carrier Horizon Air. The incident was reportedly so severe that it prompted the airline to postpone its scheduled quarterly earnings call.According to the Seattle-based carrier, the outage stemmed from a failure at its primary data center and was not the result of a cybersecurity breach. In a new regulatory filing, Alaska said that it does not plan to reschedule the third-quarter earnings call and will instead issue updated fourth-quarter guidance in early December, after assessing the full financial impact of the IT disruptions.The company faced a similar outage in July, when a malfunction in a “critical piece of hardware” at one of its data centers led to an estimated $12 million hit to earnings, or about $0.10 per share.Alaska noted that it has increased its IT infrastructure spending by nearly 80% since 2019, investing in redundant data centers and migrating customer-facing systems to cloud-based platforms. The airline operates a hybrid technology model, combining its own data centers with third-party cloud services.The airline said the new audit aims to identify system vulnerabilities and establish stronger safeguards to ensure operational resilience moving forward.","Alaska Airlines has hired global consulting company Accenture to conduct a full- scale audit of its technology systems.

"'Two words' that wiped away $29 billion from Mark Zuckerberg's fortune in just one day, taking him to one of his lowest rankings on Billionaires Index",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/two-words-that-wiped-29-billion-from-mark-zuckerbergs-wealth-in-just-one-day-taking-him-to-his-lowest-ranking-in-two-plus-years-on-billionaires-index/articleshow/125020096.cms,"What triggered fall in Mark Zuckerberg's ranking on Billionaires Index

So, if there are 'Two Words' that are responsible for $29 billion-plus wipe out in Mark Zuckerberg's wealth, they are 'Capital Expenditure' or CAPEX. In simple words, Capex or Capital Expenditure, is the money a company spends to acquire, upgrade, or maintain its long-term physical assets, such as buildings, machinery, and equipment.

Amazon and Google founders beat Mark Zuckerberg





This week saw Facebook-parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg fall from third to fifth place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The plunge happened after Meta’ stock fell 11% on Thursday, October 30, wiping out $29.2 billion from Zuckerberg's fortune in just one day. The drop was the fourth-largest one-day market-driven loss ever recorded by Bloomberg’s wealth index.The 41-year-old CEO’s net worth fell to $235.2 billion, his lowest ranking in nearly two years, as investors recoiled from Meta’s plan to issue $30 billion in new debt to fund artificial intelligence spending, according to Bloomberg.Meta has forecast ""notably larger"" Capital Expenses next year (2026), thanks to investments in artificial intelligence, including aggressively building data centers to power its AI push. Wall Street is just not happy with the company's spending spree, resulting in almost 10% fall in its stock value.The Facebook and Instagram parent reported third-quarter revenue growth of 26% that beat market estimates, but that jump was outpaced by a 32% increase in costs. The company announced that it would raise its total expense forecast for 2025 to as much as $118 billion — including up to $72 billion in capital expenditures — to expand its AI infrastructure, with even higher spending anticipated in 2026. The staggering outlay triggered at least two analyst downgrades, with some warning that Meta’s AI ambitions could squeeze profits.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been overtaken by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Google co-founder Larry Page in the global billionaire rankings, marking a sharp reversal from earlier this year when he was closing in on the top spots held by Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Zuckerberg, whose net worth skyrocketed by $57 billion in the first half of the year amid a 28% rise in Meta shares, now trails behind as competitors capitalize on booming AI and cloud sectors.Tesla's Elon Musk remains firmly entrenched at No. 1, with Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison in second place. The shift highlights the beneficiaries of recent market gains: Jeff Bezos and Larry Page rode waves of strong corporate earnings that propelled their companies' stock prices higher. Amazon shares have jumped more than 30% since April, fueled by renewed investor confidence in its cloud-computing division, AWS, which has secured major deals with AI startups like Anthropic. Similarly, Alphabet -- Google's parent company -- saw its stock climb 2.5% following better-than-expected third-quarter revenue, driven by robust demand for its cloud and AI services.Compounding Meta's challenges, the company's $30 billion bond sale -- the largest investment -- grade offering of 2025—was intended to fund ambitious investments in AI, data centers, and metaverse initiatives. Instead, it has ignited concerns among investors that the social media giant is overextending itself financially at a time when rivals are gaining traction in AI-powered advertising.","Mark Zuckerberg's net worth fell to $235.2 billion, his lowest ranking in nearly two years.

In between, he announced numerous partnerships with companies spanning telecommunications, transportation and healthcare—including deals with Nokia and Uber.Huang announced a wide range of new partnerships at Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference in Washington before thousands of hardware and software developers. Highlights included a $1 billion equity stake in networking giant Nokia, plans to outfit 100,000 Uber vehicles with Nvidia technology and a cybersecurity partnership with CrowdStrike.“We have now reached our virtuous cycle, our inflection point, and this is quite extraordinary.Now, for the first time, AI is going to engage that $100 trillion global economy, "" Huang told a packed convention hall blocks from the White House, ""and make it more productive, make it grow faster, make it larger.""From Washington, Huang went to South Korea, where the dealmaking continued. He announced plans to supply Samsung, Hyundai, SK Group and the South Korean government with more than 260,000 AI chips. He sealed the agreements over dinner at a Seoul chicken restaurant with Samsung Chair Jay Y Lee and Hyundai Executive Chair Chung Euisun.Finally, Nvidia’s announcement of producing chips featuring its cutting-edge Blackwell design in the US at a plant pushed the value.“The first thing that President Trump asked me for is bring manufacturing back because it's necessary for national security,” said Huang, who has pledged to spend $500 billion over the next several years building AI infrastructure in the US.“Nine months later, we are now manufacturing in full production Blackwell in Arizona,” he said.","Nvidia has become the world’s public company to have a $5 trillion valuation.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, which will allow users to stream select titles without requiring a paid Game Pass subscription. The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees.

Internal testing also features limits on playtime, including a one-hour session limit and a maximum of five hours of free streaming per month. These restrictions are subject to change before the official launch, the report noted.The free tier is expected to be widely available across PC, Xbox consoles, handheld devices and web browsers. The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%. This change reportedly came after Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new 30% target.","Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

What is Golden Dome







SpaceX is reportedly slated to receive $2 billion in federal funding to develop a massive network of satellites capable of tracking missiles and aircraft. The system is being funded under President Donald Trump’s ambitious Golden Dome project, a report has claimed, adding that the funding was secretly included in a tax-and-spending bill signed by President Trump in July, with the allocation not publicly tied to a specific contractor at the time.Citing people familiar with the matter, The Wall Street Journal reported that the planned “air moving target indicator” system may eventually field as many as 600 satellites, marking another expansion of the Elon Musk-led company's influence in US national security efforts.The report said that SpaceX is expected to secure major roles in two other classified Pentagon satellite networks:Milnet: This network would be dedicated to relaying sensitive military communications.Ground Tracking: A separate fleet of satellites capable of tracking vehicles on the ground.The traction SpaceX has gained with these future satellite fleets underscores the company’s increasing importance within the US national security apparatus, the report said, pointing out that despite the growing reliance on SpaceX, government officials noted that some of Musk's past actions – such as his threat to decommission a spacecraft transporting NASA astronauts to the International Space Station – have reinforced the need to ensure several contractors support critical national-security operations in space.Government officials have described Golden Dome as a complex defense system intended to act as a missile shield, capable of tracking and potentially destroying missiles before they hit their targets. The Pentagon has released few specifics about the shield's operational architecture.Major contracts for Golden Dome have not yet been formally awarded, as defense officials finalise spending plans. Lawmakers and industry executives anticipate more details from the Pentagon in the coming weeks.A Pentagon spokesperson declined to comment on SpaceX's involvement, stating, “We do not provide details relating to specifics of architectural discussion or predecisional matters.”",SpaceX is reportedly slated to receive $2 billion in federal funding to develop a massive network of satellites capable of tracking missiles and aircraft.

We are doing this for two main reasons: First, we have been quite amazed by how much our power users want to use Sora, and the economics are currently completely unsustainable.

We thought 30 free gens/day would be more than enough, but clearly we were wrong! This will let our pro creators get as much usage as they want to pay for. Second, this is a step towards a new Sora economy.

We imagine a world where rightsholders have the option to charge extra for cameos of beloved characters and people. We will soon pilot monetisation, prioritising people and companies who got onto the platform early. This will also be a way for a new generation of sora creators to make money.

Eventually, we will need to bring the free gens down to accommodate growth (we won't have enough GPUs to do it otherwise!), but we’ll be transparent as it happens. In the meantime, enjoy the crazy usage limits :) Rate limits for everyone are unchanged right now (pro users get 100/day, everyone else gets 30/day).

How a 'letter to customers' by Dutch chipmaker Nexperia may deepen crisis for global carmakers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-a-letter-to-customers-by-dutch-chipmaker-nexperia-may-deepen-crisis-for-global-carmakers/articleshow/125018609.cms,"What this critical supply chain block means for automakers







Dutch chipmaker Nexperia has reportedly suspended wafer supplies to its Chinese assembly plant that may lead to a supply disruption and intensify a semiconductor crisis that has global automakers scrambling for solutions. Citing a letter sent to customers, news agency Reuters has reported that Nexperia interim CEO Stefan Tilger informed customers that the company had halted supplies to its facility in Dongguan, located in southern China's Guangdong province, effective October 26.The suspension was “a direct consequence of the local management's recent failure to comply with the agreed contractual payment terms,” according to the letter dated October 29 signed by Tilger.“While we have maintained shipments for as long as commercially feasible, continuing the current flow of supply from our front-end sites is no longer justifiable,” the letter stated.The company added that “unless these contractual obligations are fully satisfied, we cannot resume wafer supply to the site,"" but said it is ""developing alternative solutions to ensure (that) supply (is) continuing to our customers.”The implications for the automotive and electronics industries may be severe. Nexperia produces large volumes of chips in the Netherlands that are widely used across these sectors, Reuters said, adding that some 70% of the European-produced chips are packaged in China and sold mostly to distributors – making the Dongguan facility a critical link in the supply chain.Nexperia emphasised that the decision did not reflect an intention to withdraw from its Dongguan site or the Chinese market as a whole, adding that it remained committed to finding a resolution. The letter also noted that Nexperia is financially independent of Wingtech and does not raise capital from the Chinese company.Industry bodies have sounded the alarm over the potential impact on production. Stellantis said Thursday that it had established a “war room” to monitor the situation, while Japanese automaker Nissan indicated it had enough chips to last until the first week of November without disruption.The disruption comes as Nexperia finds itself at the centre of a deepening rift between Europe and China over semiconductor technology and national security concerns.The Dutch government seized control of Nexperia from its Chinese owner, Wingtech Technology, on September 30, also removing the company's Chinese CEO amid concerns that its technology could be appropriated by Wingtech.Court filings revealed the seizure came as US pressure was mounting on Nexperia after Wingtech was placed on a restricted-export list, though Dutch authorities maintain that governance shortcomings triggered their intervention.In response, on October 4, the Chinese commerce ministry blocked Nexperia from exporting chips from China. The Chinese unit had resumed supplying semiconductors to local customers but changed its terms, stipulating that all sales to distributors must be settled in Chinese yuan rather than foreign currencies like the US dollar.",Dutch chipmaker Nexperia has reportedly suspended wafer supplies to its Chinese assembly plant.

Ofcom says changes visible but long road ahead







Britain’s communications regulator has issued a stark warning to major social media platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Roblox: prove your algorithms are protecting children from harmful content, or prepare for enforcement action. Ofcom chief executive Melanie Dawes said in an interview with the Financial Times that tech companies will be subject to audits of the algorithms that determine what appears in users' feeds under the next phase of the UK's Online Safety Act crackdown.“You may see some enforcement action from us in the next few months if we don't start to get the answers that we’re looking for on the algorithmic side of things,” she said, explaining that social media companies would face enforcement action if they could not demonstrate that their algorithms prevent those under 18 from seeing harmful material.The regulator’s focus is now shifting to what Dawes described as issues tech companies are “not so willing to do” – specifically, how algorithmic feeds and recommendations expose young users to adult content.“Have they changed the way the algorithms work so that children don't get that material shown to them? That's a big focus for us,” Dawes said. She also emphasised the need for anti-grooming protections, questioning whether “children's feeds only accept children's profiles and can't be directly messaged by people they don't know.”As part of this work, Ofcom has the power to order tech platforms to conduct ""algorithmic audits"" of their content recommendation systems.Ofcom began enforcing strict government restrictions under the Online Safety Act in July, including requirements that any platform carrying adult material prevent children from accessing it. Dawes said the legislation was showing results, with major social media sites and adult websites implementing age verification systems. More than 12 high-risk sites have been blocked or are no longer available in the UK, including two suicide forums and at least five pornography sites.However, Dawes acknowledged the challenge ahead: ""We're trying to turn around a couple of decades where the internet has been age blind.""

Huang pushes back Blackwell curbs and security concerns







Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang challenged US export controls on advanced semiconductors, arguing that continued technology collaboration and access to the Chinese market are ultimately in America’s best interest. Speaking to reporters in South Korea this week, Huang described China as a “singular, vital, important, dynamic market, and nobody can replace that.” He asserted he would continue campaigning for full access to this market, stating he is ""optimistic"" that China will remain a key consumer of US chips.“It’s in the best interest of America to serve that China market. It’s in the best interest of China to have the American technology company bring ... technology to the China market ... It’s in the best interest of both countries, and I hope that policymakers will ultimately come to that conclusion,” Huang said.Huang’s comments come amid US curbs that restrict Chinese firms from purchasing the most advanced semiconductors used for AI development. When asked by CNBC whether he would like Nvidia’s cutting-edge Blackwell GPUs to be sold in China, Huang replied, “I hope so.I hope so. But that’s a decision for President Trump to make.”President Trump later confirmed that he had discussed the export of some Nvidia chips with Chinese President Xi Jinping, but not the advanced Blackwell units.Huang also dismissed the national security rationale behind the curbs, arguing that China already possesses significant domestic AI capabilities.“China makes plenty of AI chips themselves, and the Chinese military surely have plenty of access to chips that are created in China,” Huang told CNBC. He pointed out that China has blocked Nvidia's less-advanced H20 chip, suggesting, “in a lot of ways, China is saying that, ‘listen, we have plenty of AI technology ourselves’... And so the national security concern, from that perspective, I think, is really answered by the fact that China doesn’t want H20 or any American chips. ”The Nvidia CEO underscored the size of the potential revenue at stake, estimating the China market opportunity to be “probably $50 billion this year,” and potentially “a couple of 100 billion dollars by the end of the decade.”","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang challenged US export controls on advanced semiconductors.

UPS cuts 48,000 positions in historic restructuring effort



Ford cuts up to 13,000 jobs in electric vehicle transition



PwC cuts 5,600 globally as automation reshapes accounting



Paramount lays off 2,000 jobs





The technology sector has witnessed a massive wave of layoffs throughout 2025, with 112,732 tech employees losing their jobs across 218 companies, according to independent tracking site Layoffs.fyi. This unprecedented workforce reduction represents one of the most significant restructuring periods in the industry's history, driven primarily by the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence, automation initiatives, and economic uncertainty. Major corporations from Amazon to Intel have slashed tens of thousands of positions, fundamentally transforming how technology companies operate and compete in an AI-driven landscape.The impact extends far beyond Silicon Valley, affecting IT services giants in India, consulting firms, logistics companies, and manufacturing sectors worldwide.More than 22,000 workers were laid off in the opening months of 2025, with February alone accounting for a staggering 16,084 job cuts. April emerged as another brutal period, with over 24,500 employees laid off as companies accelerated their cost-cutting measures.Industry leaders from Amazon's Andy Jassy to Salesforce's Marc Benioff have openly attributed these reductions to AI's ability to automate tasks previously performed by human workers, marking a pivotal shift in the relationship between technology advancement and employment.Amazon is cutting up to 14,000 corporate positions, representing nearly 4% of its 350,000 corporate employee base, in what marks the e-commerce giant's largest layoff event on record. Notifications began in late October 2025, with jobs eliminated across Amazon Web Services (AWS), operations, human resources, and other business units. CEO Andy Jassy cited the transition to AI-driven processes, overexpansion during previous years, and the urgent need to streamline management layers as the primary drivers behind these unprecedented cuts.The decision reflects Amazon's push to run the company ""like the world's largest startup,"" according to Beth Galetti, SVP of People Experience & Technology. While the reduction affects less than 2% of Amazon's total global workforce, it follows years of belt-tightening since the pandemic, during which the company has already reduced its workforce by approximately 27,000 employees since the start of 2022. The cuts come as rapid advances in artificial intelligence fundamentally change how Amazon operates, with the company betting heavily on automation to maintain its competitive edge while improving operational efficiency and profit margins.Intel confirmed it will reduce its global workforce by 24,000 employees during 2025, bringing its core headcount down from nearly 100,000 to approximately 75,000 by year-end. This massive restructuring, representing roughly 22% of its workforce, is part of a major efficiency push by new CEO Lip-Bu Tan amid intensifying competition in the semiconductor sector. The chipmaker is implementing cuts through a combination of direct layoffs and natural attrition, with significant reductions taking place in the United States, Germany, Poland, and Costa Rica.Government filings revealed that Intel is laying off more than 5,000 employees across four US states alone, with most cuts concentrated in California and Oregon, while additional reductions affect facilities in Texas and Arizona. In July, Intel reportedly planned to lay off nearly 2,400 workers in Oregon, almost five times more than initially announced. The company told staff in June to expect 15% to 20% of employees in its Foundry division to be laid off, while also confirming plans to completely wind down its auto business. The move came ahead of Intel's Q1 earnings call and marks a significant strategic shift under CEO Tan, who took over from longtime chief Pat Gelsinger last year.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India's largest IT exporter and private-sector employer, has carried out its steepest-ever job cuts as the twin pressures of artificial intelligence and strained US-India trade ties shake up the country's $280 billion technology industry. In the quarter ending September 30, 2025, TCS reduced its workforce by 19,755 employees, marking a 3.2% decline from the previous quarter. The company's headcount has dropped below the 600,000 mark for the first time since 2022, signaling a major turning point for India's outsourcing powerhouse.Chief Human Resources Officer Sudeep Kunnumal told analysts that the ongoing restructuring primarily targets mid- and senior-level roles affected by what he called a ""skill and capability mismatch."" TCS is approximately halfway through its plan to reduce 2% of its global workforce by March 2026, a move designed to align with the company's push toward AI and automation-led services.The company has set aside Rs 11.35 billion (approximately $136 million) to cover severance-related costs. Analysts at Citi noted that the layoffs reflect a subdued business outlook, pointing to weak global demand and tightening tech budgets, while US President Donald Trump 's plans to raise H-1B visa fees to $100,000 and impose higher tariffs on Indian imports have further clouded the outlook for India's IT majors.Accenture says it has laid off thousands employees globally through the middle of October 2025 as part of a major restructuring to prioritize artificial intelligence capabilities and align with changing client demand. CEO Julie Sweet stated that many roles could not be reskilled for new AI-driven needs, forcing the consulting giant to make difficult workforce decisions. The company's total headcount fell from roughly 791,000 to 779,000 employees, with further cuts planned as AI expansion continues across the organisation.The reduction marks one of the largest layoffs in the professional services sector and highlights how even companies that help other businesses implement AI are themselves being transformed by the technology. Accenture has been aggressively pivoting toward AI consulting services, generative AI implementations, and automation solutions for clients, but this transition has made certain traditional consulting roles obsolete.The company confirmed it is simultaneously hiring for AI-focused positions while eliminating roles in legacy service areas, reflecting the broader challenge facing the global workforce as artificial intelligence reshapes job requirements and skill demands across industries.Microsoft conducted several rounds of layoffs throughout 2025, ultimately cutting approximately 9,000 employees, or less than 4% of its global workforce of around 220,000. The July announcement followed earlier reductions of less than 1% in January, more than 6,000 in May, and at least 300 in June. The company cited the urgent need to control costs while funneling increased investment into artificial intelligence and cloud computing infrastructure, adding to an earlier round of 10,000 cuts in 2023.The cuts affected software engineers, product managers, technical program managers, marketers, and legal counsels across various teams, role types, and geographies throughout 2025. In January, Microsoft cut an unspecified number of jobs based on employees' performance evaluations, with affected workers told they wouldn't receive severance packages and that benefits such as medical insurance would stop immediately.The company was also reportedly contemplating additional layoffs, with internal discussions about reducing the number of middle managers and non-coders to increase the ratio of programmers to product managers, according to Business Insider. The multiple rounds of reductions reflect Microsoft's aggressive pivot toward AI-powered products and services while streamlining operations across gaming divisions, sales teams, and administrative functions.Salesforce eliminated approximately 4,000 roles in its customer support division, cutting the team from around 9,000 to 5,000 employees in one of 2025's most dramatic examples of AI-driven workforce reduction. CEO Marc Benioff directly attributed the layoffs to artificial intelligence's ability to automate routine customer interactions, stating bluntly during a September podcast appearance: ""I was able to rebalance my headcount on my support. I reduced it from 9,000 heads to about 5,000 because I need fewer heads.""Benioff highlighted how Salesforce's AI now manages approximately 50% of customer conversations, allowing the company to streamline operations without sacrificing service quality. The company deployed Agentforce at the start of the year, resulting in a decline in support cases and eliminating the need to backfill support engineer roles. ""We've successfully redeployed hundreds of employees into other areas like professional services, sales, and customer success,"" a Salesforce spokesperson explained.The move marked a significant reversal from Benioff's earlier stance in July, when he insisted that AI would augment rather than replace workers and that ""the humans are not going away."" Salesforce also cut more than 1,000 additional jobs from its nearly 73,000-strong workforce in February and trimmed another 262 positions at its San Francisco headquarters in September.Networking equipment giant Cisco announced it will cut around 4,250 jobs, representing 5% of its workforce, as the company pivots to focus on high-growth business areas including AI, cybersecurity, and cloud networking. The reductions come as Cisco, which employed nearly 85,000 workers at the end of fiscal 2023, undertakes a major restructuring of its operations amid shifting market demands and increasing competition from cloud-native networking solutions.Government filings showed 221 positions being eliminated across the company's Milpitas and San Francisco offices, including 157 in Santa Clara County and 64 in San Francisco, with terminations taking effect in October. The cuts are part of Cisco's broader workforce-reduction strategy designed to reallocate resources toward emerging technologies and away from legacy hardware products. Sources previously indicated job cuts were expected for the company as it aims to transform from a traditional networking equipment manufacturer into a software and subscription-based services provider, reflecting broader industry trends as enterprise technology shifts toward cloud-based architectures and software-defined networking solutions.Google conducted multiple rounds of layoffs throughout 2025, cutting over 100 design roles in its cloud division in October and hitting US-based teams especially hard as the company aggressively shifts focus toward artificial intelligence investments. Many affected employees were given until early December to find new roles within Google, following additional layoffs across its Silicon Valley offices, including at least 50 permanent cuts in Sunnyvale, according to CNBC reports.The search giant also downsized its smart TV division by 25% of its 300-member team in June to adjust its strategy, cutting funding for the smart TV division (including Google TV and Android TV) by 10% while simultaneously raising investment in AI projects. In April, Google laid off hundreds of employees in its platforms and devices division, which covers Android, Pixel phones, the Chrome browser, and related products, according to The Information.In February, the company announced plans to cut employees in its People Operations and cloud organisations teams as part of a new reorganisation effort, offering a voluntary exit program to U.S.-based People Operations employees. The pattern of cuts reflects Google's broader strategy to reallocate resources away from mature products toward generative AI development and deployment.Meta (formerly Facebook) laid off approximately 600 employees in October, primarily in its AI research and development divisions, as part of a continued effort to streamline project teams and refocus on generative AI investments and Reality Labs development. The cuts affected staff across Meta's AI infrastructure units, including the Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) team, though top-tier AI hires in TBD Labs managed by new chief AI officer Alexandr Wang remained unaffected.""By reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, and each person will be more load-bearing and have more scope and impact,"" Wang wrote in an internal memo explaining the restructuring. The latest round followed Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's announcement in January that the company would cut 5% of its staff, targeting ""low performers"" as the company prepared for what he called ""an intense year. ""Those cuts, which started in February, affected several thousand workers across multiple divisions, with teams overseeing Facebook, the Horizon virtual reality platform, and logistics among the hardest hit. The company also let go of over 100 employees in its Reality Labs division in April. Previously, Meta had laid off more than 21,000 workers since 2022, making it one of the tech industry's most aggressive cost-cutters.Oracle eliminated hundreds of jobs across multiple locations throughout 2025 as the company works to curb costs amid heavy spending on AI infrastructure and cloud computing expansion. In September, the database giant cut another 101 jobs in Seattle and 254 in San Francisco, just weeks after a wave of layoffs in August that affected its cloud division and other business units. The company, which had approximately 3,900 local employees before the California cuts, declined to comment on the reductions or explain the strategic rationale behind them.Oracle is set to cut an additional 101 jobs at its Santa Clara location, with notices issued on August 13 and terminations taking effect in October. The company also disclosed nearly 200 layoffs at its Pleasanton and Redwood City offices and planned to lay off 161 employees in Seattle, according to filings with the Washington state Employment Security Department.Sources familiar with the cuts told Bloomberg that some of the reductions were related to performance issues, though the majority appear driven by restructuring efforts as Oracle pivots toward cloud services and away from traditional database licensing. The company has not provided official statements about total job losses or future workforce plans, but the pattern of cuts suggests ongoing efforts to optimize operations in its cloud infrastructure division.United Parcel Service (UPS) announced it eliminated 48,000 positions in the first nine months of 2025 as part of a sweeping restructuring effort to lower costs and realign operations for a more automated future. These cuts include 14,000 management jobs and approximately 34,000 operational roles such as drivers and warehouse workers.UPS confirmed these details in their Q3 financial disclosures, highlighting ongoing consolidation of facilities and a strategic shift to improve profits and market adaptability in an increasingly competitive logistics environment.CEO Carol Tomé described the changes as the most significant strategic transformation in UPS history, with the company beginning 2025 with nearly 500,000 employees. The reduction follows a sharp 16% drop in Amazon package volume in the fourth quarter of 2024 and is part of a broader plan to halve its Amazon business by mid-2026. UPS is also closing 73 US buildings by June and automating 400 facilities to reduce labor dependency, with the Teamsters union pledging to fight layoffs affecting its members.The company told investors the cuts would save approximately $210 million in 2025 and $300 million in 2026, positioning UPS to emerge as what Tomé calls an ""even stronger, more nimble"" logistics provider.Ford is currently staging a layoff cycle targeting between 8,000 and 13,000 jobs in 2025, based on financial reports and insider accounts, though the company has not issued an official public statement confirming final numbers. Job cuts are focused on its Model e EV division, commercial operations, US legacy functions, and European manufacturing plants. The reduction is being staged in multiple tranches and aligns with Ford's broader reorganisation and aggressive cost-cutting plans as the automotive industry undergoes a dramatic transformation.The layoffs reflect the challenges traditional automakers face as they transition from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles while simultaneously managing declining profit margins and intense competition from Tesla and Chinese EV manufacturers.Ford's restructuring aims to separate its electric vehicle operations from its traditional gas-powered business, but the transition has proven more costly and slower than anticipated. The cuts come as the broader EV market experiences a slowdown in consumer adoption, with buyers hesitant about range limitations, charging infrastructure, and higher vehicle prices compared to conventional alternatives.PwC globally has cut approximately 5,600 jobs during its 2025 financial year, including nearly 1,500 in the United States, primarily affecting audit and tax roles. The Big Four accounting firm cited historically low attrition rates as the unexpected driver behind the cuts, explaining that not enough employees were leaving voluntarily to make room for new talent with AI and automation skills.PwC's layoffs began on May 5 and were part of a broader adaptation to automation, shifting business priorities, and a strategic restructuring aimed at reallocating resources toward advisory and sustainability consulting services.""This was a difficult decision, and we made it with care, thoughtfulness, and a deep awareness of its impact on our people, appreciating that historically low levels of attrition over consecutive years have made it necessary to take this step,"" a PwC spokesperson said in a statement.Additional rounds of smaller cuts were reported in various international markets as the firm continues to navigate the transformation of traditional accounting and auditing work through artificial intelligence.The cuts signal how even professional services firms that help clients implement new technologies are themselves being disrupted, with AI tools increasingly capable of handling routine audit procedures, tax calculations, and compliance checks that previously required teams of junior accountants and associates.Paramount Global has laid off approximately 2,000 workers in 2025 following a year of intense restructuring sparked by streaming industry losses, weak advertising markets, and increased competition from Netflix, Disney+, and other platforms. Cuts focused heavily on streaming operations, production teams, and administrative staff as the media company attempts to restore profitability after years of heavy investment in its Paramount+ streaming service failed to generate expected returns.The layoffs come after Paramount cut 15% of jobs in the previous year and follow the company's announcement that it employed 18,600 people at the end of 2024.CEO Bob Bakish said the reductions aim to help Paramount restore earnings growth and achieve its long-term vision amid mounting streaming losses and declining revenues from traditional cable television. The company told employees it would be laying off 3.5% of US-based staff, citing industry-wide declines and a challenging macroeconomic environment.","Major corporations from Amazon to Intel have slashed tens of thousands of positions, fundamentally transforming how technology companies operate and compete in an AI-driven landscape.

Jeff Bezos No Longer World’s Second-Richest!

Timeless advice in a high-stakes world

Jeff Bezos wealth surged by $24 billion this week





Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again offered a timeless insight into stress management. Bezos believes that stress is not caused by hard work, in fact it is a a warning sign that you are avoiding something important. In a resurfaced quote from a 2001 interview, recently highlighted in a Fortune article, Bezos said that stress often comes from procrastination or neglecting priorities, nit from being overloaded. “Stress primarily comes from not taking action over something that you can have some control over,” Bezos said. “I find as soon as I identify it, and make the first phone call, or send off the first email… it dramatically reduces any stress that might come from it.”Bezos’ interesting philosophy reframes stress as a diagnostic tools which acts as a signal to tell that something is still unresolved. He also mentions that the key to manage stress is to confront the source head-on. ““Stress doesn’t come from hard work,” he emphasised. “You can be working incredibly hard and loving it. Stress comes from ignoring things that you shouldn’t be ignoring.”This mindset of Jeff Bezos has resonated with the entrepreneurs and professionals alike, especially in an era where burnout is often mistaken for diligence.Despite being a two-decade old quote, the advice still holds relevance. In today’s fast-paced, always-on work culture, Bezos’s advice serves as a reminder that clarity and action are the antidotes to anxiety.Meanwhile, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos witnessed a surge of $24 billion in his net worth as Amazon shares hit an all-time high, according to Forbes. The rise in the company’s stock reflect the confidence investors have in Amazon’s AI-powered growth strategy and cloud dominance.

Disney channels removed from YouTube TV : Read the full message sent by Disney executives to its employees



""Team,

As you are no doubt aware, last night YouTube TV pulled our channels from their service, prior to the midnight expiration of our deal, and with no advance notice to their subscribers, or to us. In doing so, they not only cut off access to our live programming but also deleted all previously recorded shows and events from their subscribers’ libraries. Their actions make clear how little regard they have for their customers and are consistent with an attitude which has been prevalent throughout our negotiations — YouTube TV and its owner, Google, are not interested in achieving a fair deal with us. Instead, they want to use their power and extraordinary resources to eliminate competition and devalue the very content that helped them build their service.

We are enormously proud of the work done by so many of you to create the highest quality and most compelling content. At ESPN and ABC in particular, we have made significant investments in programming, including the best line-up of live sports in the industry — bar none. On ABC alone, we have increased the number of live games by nearly 80% over the past several years. The lineup for this weekend is incredible and includes 13 of the top 25 college football teams on our platforms, a double header of NWSL games on ESPN, and leads right into Monday Night Football featuring the Arizona Cardinals vs. the Dallas Cowboys on ABC.

The bottom line is that our channels are extremely valuable, and we can only continue to program them with the sports and entertainment viewers love most if we stand our ground against tactics that threaten the integrity of our business and the value of our creative work. We are asking nothing more of YouTube TV than what we have gotten from every other distributor – fair rates for our channels.

We will keep you informed as this matter progresses. For those of you who are YouTube TV customers and have lost access to our channels, there are other ways you can watch, which you can find here: KeepMyNetworks.com.

We know how hard so many of you work every day to create, promote, and support our programming. We’re deeply grateful for your continued focus, professionalism, and commitment.

Alan, Dana & Jimmy""

In a bold move to reshape innovation at one of tech's oldest giants, Rob Thomas , IBM's senior vice president of software and chief commercial officer, is pushing a ""build a little, test a little, learn a lot"" philosophy to harmonize long-term engineering vision with immediate commercial demands. Thomas assumed the rare dual role overseeing both the company's global engineering pipeline and sales organization -- a high-stakes juggling act few executives face at the 100-plus-year-old IBM. In his 25-plus years at IBM, Rob has held several leadership roles across the company.""We're breaking the old pattern,"" Thomas said in a recent interview with Fortune. ""Instead of rigid, linear grand plans, we're prioritizing rapid feedback loops to drive real progress."" The approach draws inspiration from Jit Saxena, founder of data-warehousing pioneer Netezza, which IBM acquired in 2010. Thomas recounted Saxena's hands-on strategy after he began investing in startups: monthly meetings with founders centered on one key question: ""What are customers telling you?"" These consistent check-ins frequently sparked dramatic pivots from initial concepts, proving instrumental in crafting standout products.""That story hit home,"" Thomas reflected in the interview. ""IBM wasn't operating with that level of agility. Our processes were too inflexible, and that's when I knew we had to change how we innovate."" At massive organizations, Thomas argues, transformative ideas often bubble up from within. The real leadership test, he says, lies in spotting these internal disruptors, amplifying their voices, and granting them leeway to experiment. ""They tend to be people that break a lot of glass,"" Thomas explained. ""They have strong convictions about what we should do, skip the standard processes, and can be louder or more disagreeable.

Read Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth’s complete blog post here

Emotional Economy

Imagine each person in your life as a publicly traded security.

You’re heavily invested in a few: your parents, your partner, your manager. You hold small positions in many others, like coworkers, acquaintances, friends of friends. And then there are people you have no stake in at all. Strangers on the street, commenters online, passing critics.

Ideally, the influence someone has over your self-worth should be proportional to your level of emotional investment in them. When your mom compliments your hair, it feels great. When a guy on the street insults your shirt, it shouldn’t register any more than a stock you don’t own crashing.

But most of us don’t run our emotional portfolios so rationally.

We overreact to noise in the market. We let people we barely know move our valuation. And sometimes we stay over-exposed to assets that no longer belong in the portfolio: ex-friends, old bosses, estranged relatives. They still hold emotional equity they haven’t earned in years. Cut your losses. Rebalance.

There’s also what you might think of as market sentiment. You might not care about one person’s opinion, but when you start to see the same reaction from many people, it begins to feel like the whole market is shifting. That’s useful information — trends matter — but it’s easy to mistake short-term volatility for a long-term correction. We tend to overestimate broad trends from local noise. If you want to calibrate to reality, it helps to get an independent assessment — from a manager, a friend, or a therapist — someone with a wider view of your “market”.

The term investment is deliberate. It isn’t just how much you care, it’s how much you show that you care. Attention, time, empathy — those are your capital. The returns you get, good or bad, depend on where you put them.

Manage your emotional economy like any other portfolio: diversify wisely, invest intentionally, and don’t panic when the market dips.

The AI flywheel effect

Nvidia’s role and market confidence







Nvidia CEO Jensen Hunag has an important message for the investors who are concerned about the ballooning capital expenditures of tech giants such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta. As reported by CNBC, Huang said that this spending is not reckless, in fact it is the fuel needed for a self-reinforcing AI revolution. Speaking at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit, Huang described the current phase of artificial intelligence development as a “virtuous cycle,” where improvements in AI models drive more usage, which in turn attracts more investment and accelerates innovation. “The virtuous cycle of AI has been designed, and this is the reason why you’re seeing the world’s capex going so fast,” Huang saidAs reported by CNBC, the major tech firm have come together and committed hundred of billions of dollars to build out AI infrastructure which includes data centrism chips and software platforms. The development of AI infrastructure has sparked investor anxiety over returns and sustainability. But Huang believes that this spending is not only justified but is also essential.He compared the present scenario to the early days of internet or cloud computing, where upfront investment paved way for exponential growth. Nvidia, whose chips power much of the AI boom, has seen demand surge as companies race to deploy generative AI across industries.The ‘virtuous cycle’ concept explained by Huang hinges on a feedback loop:Huang further added the loop is now in full motion and the infrastructure being created today will support the decade-long transformation for global computing.Nvidia made history on October 29 as the first company ever to reach a $5 trillion market valuation. The company reached $5 trillion in market value just over three months after crossing $4 trillion, suggesting accelerating momentum in AI adoption across industries. According to CNBC, shares of the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker rose more than 4%, pushing its market capitalisation past the threshold and cementing its position at the centre of the global AI boom.Reports say that there have been several factors that propelled Nvidia's rise. CEO Jensen Huang recently announced that Nvidia expects $500 billion in AI chip orders, reflecting demand for the company's processors. Nvidia also revealed plans to build seven new supercomputers for the US government.Under Huang's leadership, the company's H100 and Blackwell processors have become the engines powering large-language models behind tools like ChatGPT and Elon Musk's xAI. Meanwhile, the company has also invested over $100 billion in strategic partnerships with firms including OpenAI, Intel and, most recently, Nokia.","Nvidia CEO Jensen Hunag has an important message for the investors who are concerned about the ballooning capital expenditures of tech giants such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta.

Gates calls AI ‘biggest technical thing ever’

95% companies have seen zero return on their AI investments, says study





Microsoft founder Bill Gates has warned that tons of investments in artificial intelligence (AI) will be “dead ends”. During an appearance on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"", Gates said that his opinion is not a product of pure speculation. Stating that we are in the middle of an AI bubble, he pointed to the example of ""tulip mania"" during the 1630s in the Netherlands. During this period, the price of tulips soared for several years only to suddenly crash. “That's not where we are,” Gates said. Instead, he compared the AI bubble to the dot-com era when several internet-based companies became overvalued, leading to a significant crash.“In the end, something very profound happened. The world was very different,” Gates said. “Some companies succeeded, but a lot of the companies were kind of me-too, fell behind, burning capital companies.”“Absolutely, there are a ton of these investments that will be dead ends,” Gates added.During the conversation, Gates said that AI has been “the biggest technical thing ever in my lifetime.”“The value is extremely high, just like creating the internet ended up being, in net, very valuable,” Gates said.“But you have a frenzy. And some of these companies will be glad they spent all this money. Some of them, you know, they'll commit to data centers whose electricity is too expensive.”Gates’ views have a stark similarity with a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) study that claimed that 95% of organizations are getting zero return, despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI. MIT published a report in September this year titled ‘The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025’, which said that only 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L (profit & loss) impact.The study says that more than 80 % of organizations have explored or piloted tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Copilot. Nearly 40% reported deployment of these tools. However, these AI tools, as per the study, enhance individual productivity primarily with no P&L performance. “Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, and misalignment with day-to-day operations,” the study highlighted.","Gates calls AI ‘biggest technical thing ever’ in his lifetime. 95% companies have seen zero return on their AI investments, says study.

Who is Bankim Brahmbhatt



How Bankim Brahmbhatt duped BlackRock





Investment giant BlackRock and other lenders are trying to recover hundreds of millions of dollars after allegedly falling victim to a large-scale financial fraud, reports Wall Street Journal. The accused, Bankim Brahmbhatt, the CEO of telecom companies Broadband Telecom and Bridgevoice, is accused of creating fake invoices and customers to secure loans backed by false collateral. The lenders described the alleged scheme as “breathtaking” in scope.In a lawsuit filed in August, BlackRock’s private credit arm and other financiers said they were owed more than $500 million. Brahmbhatt has denied the allegations, according to his lawyer.Bankim Brahmbhatt is an Indian-origin entrepreneur who built a group of telecom businesses including Broadband Telecom, Bridgevoice, and financing arms such as Carriox Capital. His companies claimed to provide infrastructure and voice services to major telecom operators around the world.Brahmbhatt operated out of Garden City, New York, where his company offices now appear vacant. According to the WSJ report, several luxury cars — including a Tesla, Porsche, BMWs, and an Audi — were seen parked outside a home listed as his residence.The 50-year-old businessman’s companies filed for bankruptcy in August 2025, the same day Brahmbhatt personally sought bankruptcy protection. His whereabouts are currently unclear, though BlackRock’s team believes he may have returned to India.As per the WSJ report, the alleged fraud began in 2020, when HPS Investment Partners, later acquired by BlackRock, started lending money to Brahmbhatt’s telecom financing arms. Over time, HPS increased its exposure to nearly $430 million, with BNP Paribas financing about half of it.The loans were backed by accounts receivable—money supposedly owed by telecom clients. However, an internal review in July this year uncovered irregularities in customer emails that Brahmbhatt’s firms used to verify invoices. Investigators later found that all the customer email addresses were fake, some mimicking legitimate telecom companies such as Belgium-based BICS, which denied any involvement.In court filings, the lenders said Brahmbhatt had created “an elaborate balance sheet of assets that existed only on paper.” They also accused him of moving money and assets to offshore accounts in India and Mauritius.After the discovery, Brahmbhatt reportedly stopped responding to calls from lenders, and when investigators visited his New York offices, they found them locked and deserted.The lenders’ investigation concluded that the fake contracts dated back as far as 2018. Following the revelations, Carriox Capital II and BB Capital SPV, two related financing entities, also filed for bankruptcy.BNP Paribas has since set aside about €190 million ($220 million) to cover potential losses. BlackRock has told clients that while the financial hit is limited compared to its total assets, the case highlights serious risks in the private credit market, which relies heavily on trust and limited transparency.",Bankim Brahmbhatt is accused of creating fake invoices and customers to secure loans backed by false collateral.

Internal message emphasises AI adoption and process elimination





An Amazon vice president has issued a pointed directive to surviving employees in the wake of massive layoffs, instructing them to embrace AI, eliminate bureaucracy, and prioritise customer-facing work as the tech giant restructures its devices division. Tapas Roy, vice president of device software and services at Amazon, sent an internal memo detailing three specific priorities for remaining workers after job cuts hit his organisation, according to internal messages viewed by Business Insider. Roy's directive emphasised focusing on ""work that most directly impacts our customers,"" leaning in on AI to enhance effectiveness, and raising hands when spotting opportunities to simplify or eliminate unnecessary processes.Roy's memo, posted by an employee to Amazon's internal Slack, addressed layoffs within the OS & Services team—the group responsible for developing software for Amazon's consumer electronics including Kindle, Fire, and Echo devices. While acknowledging the decisions were ""difficult,"" Roy characterised the cuts as ""made thoughtfully to position our organisation for future success.""The vice president framed the changes around the division's core mission of helping ""product teams launch delightful products,"" according to the internal communication obtained by Business Insider.Roy specified that notifications to impacted employees in the US and Canada had been completed, while other regions would follow local processes that might result in longer timelines.Roy's emphasis on AI adoption mirrors messaging from Amazon's HR chief Beth Galetti, who justified the 14,000-employee reduction by citing AI as ""the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet."" The technology is enabling companies to ""innovate much faster than ever before,"" Galetti wrote in announcing the broader cuts.The cuts continue CEO Andy Jassy's multi-year effort to streamline Amazon's operations and reduce bureaucracy. Many affected US employees were retail managers, with notifications delivered via early-morning text messages and emails to prevent workers from discovering their termination upon arriving at the office with deactivated badges.Device’s group vice president concluded his memo by acknowledging that ""changes like this can be hard for our entire team"" and reminded employees that the Employee Assistance Program offers free, confidential support available 24/7 for workers and their families.Amazon did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment on the devices division layoffs or Roy's internal communications. The exact number of employees affected within the devices organisation remains unclear.Laid-off employees will receive full pay and benefits for 90 days plus severance packages, according to Galetti's message shared on Amazon's internal Slack.","Internal Amazon memo outlines priorities for surviving employees after job cuts.

VM O2 to bring mobile service directly through Starlink satellites



Global satellite partnerships expand mobile coverage in the UK and beyond



VM O2 chooses Starlink for reliable satellite mobile coverage across the rural UK



VM O2 partners with Starlink to close the digital divide in remote areas

Reliable mobile connectivity has long been a challenge for rural communities across the UK. Farms, remote villages, and isolated regions often experience weak signals and limited data access, making everyday communication and business operations difficult. To tackle this persistent issue, Virgin Media O2 (VM O2) has partnered with Elon Musk’s Starlink to bring satellite-enabled mobile coverage to areas traditionally underserved by conventional networks. Leveraging Starlink’s constellation of over 650 satellites, the collaboration aims to provide consistent messaging and data services directly to compatible handsets. As reported by Reuters, the service is scheduled to launch in the first half of 2026, offering a practical solution to the UK’s rural connectivity gap and marking a significant step toward digital inclusion.VM O2, a joint venture between Telefonica and Liberty Global, will be the first UK operator to connect mobile handsets directly to Starlink’s satellite network. Starlink operates over 650 satellites in low Earth orbit, providing broad coverage and reduced latency compared to traditional satellite systems. By leveraging this constellation, VM O2 can bypass physical and geographical barriers, ensuring that rural users receive stable connections even in areas where building terrestrial infrastructure is challenging or cost-prohibitive.Unlike traditional mobile networks that rely entirely on ground-based towers, satellite integration allows signals to travel directly from orbit to handsets. This method not only extends coverage but also introduces the possibility of mobile service in locations previously considered unreachable.The UK is not alone in exploring satellite-mobile integration. Internationally, operators are increasingly partnering with satellite providers to improve connectivity. In the United States, T-Mobile launched commercial satellite-based messaging services in July 2025, initially supporting texts before expanding to popular messaging apps like WhatsApp. Similarly, networks in Canada and Australia are entering agreements to provide direct-to-cell satellite services, signalling a growing global reliance on satellite technology to supplement traditional mobile networks.UK telecom rivals are also exploring similar solutions. Vodafone, for instance, revealed earlier this year that it is working with AST SpaceMobile to extend satellite connectivity to its European customers in 2026. Such moves reflect an industry-wide shift toward hybrid networks that combine terrestrial and satellite infrastructure, enabling operators to offer comprehensive coverage and reduce connectivity gaps in both urban and rural areas.VM O2 CEO Lutz Schüler highlighted the strategic value of partnering with Starlink. He pointed out that Starlink’s advanced satellite constellation is unmatched in its ability to deliver reliable, consistent mobile coverage across vast areas. The network’s technological sophistication and global reach make it an ideal partner for VM O2’s vision of bridging the UK’s rural connectivity gap.Starlink has already been used by VM O2 to provide mobile backhaul connections to remote base stations, helping improve overall network performance in hard-to-reach locations. This prior experience laid the foundation for the direct-to-handset service now planned for launch.Initially, VM O2 plans to offer messaging and basic data services via Starlink satellites. Details on pricing and broader service packages will be announced closer to the launch date. However, the long-term potential is significant: once satellite connectivity is fully integrated, rural users could access faster data, enhanced messaging, and potentially even app-based services that previously required terrestrial networks.This partnership also signals a broader trend in the UK telecommunications sector, as operators increasingly recognise the importance of hybrid solutions that combine traditional mobile infrastructure with satellite technology to ensure universal coverage.The collaboration between VM O2 and Starlink represents a crucial step in closing the digital divide in the UK. Rural communities, often overlooked by conventional mobile infrastructure, stand to gain from improved connectivity, enabling access to essential digital services, communication tools, and business opportunities. As satellite technology becomes more integrated into mobile networks, the UK could see a new era of seamless connectivity, where even the most remote locations enjoy reliable access to mobile services.","Virgin Media O2 has partnered with Elon Musk’s Starlink to bring satellite- enabled mobile coverage to areas traditionally underserved by conventional networks. The collaboration aims to provide consistent messaging and data services directly to compatible handsets. Starlink operates over 650 satellites in low Earth orbit, providing broad coverage and reduced latency compared to traditional satellite systems.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125010629,imgsize-78198,width-400,resizemode-4/virgin-media-o2-partners-with-starlink-to-bring-satellite-mobile-coverage-and-improve-rural-connectivity-in-the-uk.jpg"
GTA VI developer Rockstar accused of firing workers for trying to form union,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/gta-vi-developer-rockstar-accused-of-firing-workers-for-trying-to-form-union/articleshow/125010755.cms,"Image via Rockstar Games

Rockstar’s timing raises questions about motivation







Rockstar Games has terminated between 30 and 40 employees across its UK and Canadian offices in what a British trade union is calling one of the most aggressive union-busting actions in gaming industry history, according to Bloomberg.The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) alleges all fired employees were part of a private Discord channel where workers discussed unionising. IWGB President Alex Marshall condemned the move as showing ""flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions"".Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar's parent company, denied the allegations, stating the firings were ""for gross misconduct, and for no other reason"". The company declined to specify the number of terminated employees or details about the alleged misconduct.The mass terminations come just seven months before Grand Theft Auto VI's scheduled launch on May 26, 2026. Bloomberg reports the firings occurred on Thursday across multiple Rockstar offices, affecting workers who were either union members or attempting to organise.Rockstar has heightened security measures following a massive 2022 leak that released unfinished GTA VI footage.The studio previously faced criticism for requiring employees to return to office five days weekly, citing security concerns.The IWGB stated it will pursue legal action to secure reinstatement and interim relief for affected members. Among those dismissed were employees on company-sponsored visas and workers with medical conditions who will lose access to workplace healthcare.The controversy highlights ongoing tensions between gaming companies and workers seeking better conditions. While Rockstar largely avoided the industry's recent layoff wave, Take-Two cut approximately 5% of its workforce in April 2024.GTA VI remains one of the most anticipated game releases, expected to become a top-selling title when it launches on consoles next year. A PC release date has not been confirmed.","Rockstar Games has terminated between 30 and 40 employees across its UK and Canadian offices.

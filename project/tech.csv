Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reacted sharply to Sam Altman ’s remarks about office productivity tools like Slack, saying that the ChatGPT-maker OpenAI will “compete directly with Microsoft”. Sam Altman, founder and CEO of OpenAI recently said that while there are many positives about Slack, it also creates a “lot of fake work”. In a now viral clip, Altman about how current workplace tools — such as Slack, Google Docs, email, and PowerPoint — may soon be replaced by a new generation of AI-driven systems.“There are positives about Slack,” Altman said, “but I kind of dread the first hour of the morning or last time before I go to bed, where I’m just dealing with this explosion of Slack. It creates a lot of fake work.”Altman added that he believes a new kind of AI-powered productivity platform is within reach — one where “your AI agent and my AI agent” will handle most communication and tasks, escalating only when necessary.Elon Musk, who has long been critical of OpenAI’s close partnership with Microsoft, responded on X (formerly known as Twitter) with a pointed remark: “As I was saying, OpenAI will compete directly with Microsoft.”The exchange comes as AI companies race to redefine workplace productivity. While Microsoft has heavily invested in “Copilot” features across its apps, Altman’s comments suggest OpenAI could be developing its own tools that may compete in the same space.In a recent post shared on X, Altman suggested that the company is planning another major new business venture, putting it in direct competition with cloud technology giants, including Google, Amazon and Microsoft.Altman wrote in the post: “We are also looking at ways to more directly sell compute capacity to other companies (and people); we are pretty sure the world is going to need a lot of 'AI cloud', and we are excited to offer this.”This means OpenAI could soon start selling cloud services, putting it in competition with established providers such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud. In September, OpenAI Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Sarah Friar made a similar point, suggesting that cloud providers had been “learning on our dime.” Her comment indicated that OpenAI was looking to safeguard its AI expertise from technology companies that may use its developments to advance their own capabilities.","Sam Altman, founder and CEO of OpenAI recently said that while there are many positives about Slack, it also creates a “lot of fake work” Elon Musk has reacted sharply to Altman ’s remarks about office productivity tools like Slack, saying that the ChatGPT-maker OpenAI will “compete directly with Microsoft”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125213222,imgsize-28312,width-400,resizemode-4/sam-altman-elon-musk.jpg"
After Denmark and Netherlands; now UK is probing if China can deactivate hundreds of buses on its roads,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/after-denmark-and-netherlands-now-uk-is-probing-if-china-can-deactivate-hundreds-of-buses-on-its-roads/articleshow/125206650.cms,"AI Image for Representation

China as an “enemy” or “threat”





After Netherlands and Denmark, here's another country that seems to have just realised that its buses can be brought to standstill by China. According to a report by Financial Times, the UK government is investigating whether hundreds of Chinese-made electric buses on British roads could be remotely deactivated. Officials at the Department for Transport (DfT) are working with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to determine whether Yutong, the world’s largest bus manufacturer, has the ability to access the control systems of its vehicles in the UK for software updates and diagnostics.The probe follows a Norwegian investigation that found Yutong buses could be “stopped or rendered inoperable” by the Zhengzhou-based company. Denmark has also opened its own review in light of the findings. Yutong has supplied roughly 700 electric buses to the UK. The company is also seeking to expand into London’s market with a newly developed double-decker electric model designed to meet Transport for London (TfL) standards.A DfT spokesperson reportedly said, “We are looking into the case and working closely with the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre to understand the technical basis for the actions taken by the Norwegian and Danish authorities.”Investigation by Denmark authourities found that remote deactivation of buses could be prevented by removing their SIM cards, but they decided against this because it would also disconnect the bus from other systems.TfL confirmed that none of its operators currently use Yutong buses, nor have any been ordered. “Any buses entering service in London have to meet our robust technical requirements, including rigorous testing,” the agency said.In a statement to The Sunday Times, Yutong said it “strictly complies with the applicable laws, regulations and industry standards of the locations where its vehicles operate.” The company added that its data collection practices are limited to “vehicle-related maintenance, optimisation and improvement,” and that all data is encrypted and access-controlled. “No one is allowed to access or view this data without customer authorisation,” Yutong said, adding that it complies fully with EU data protection laws.The Norwegian transport operator Ruter recently revealed that its testing had found Yutong retained remote access to the bus’s battery and power management systems, unlike a comparable vehicle from Dutch manufacturer VDL. Ruter concluded that, in theory, Yutong could “stop or render inoperable” the bus, though the risk could be mitigated by removing its SIM card to cut connectivity.Denmark’s largest public transport company, Movia, has launched a similar investigation but emphasised that the issue of remote access is not unique to Chinese manufacturers. Many electric vehicles (EVs), including those from Western companies, allow software updates via remote connectivity.Still, the inquiry comes amid heightened political scrutiny of China’s role in British infrastructure and technology. Lawmakers have debated whether Beijing should be classified as an “enemy” or a “threat,” particularly as concerns grow over cybersecurity vulnerabilities.",The UK government is investigating whether hundreds of Chinese-made electric buses on British roads could be remotely deactivated.

Huang says 'no discussion' to sell Blackwell chips to China





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently praised its longtime partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Speaking to reporters at an event held by TSMC in Hsinchu (Taiwan), Huang said “TSMC is doing a very good job supporting us on wafers”, adding that Nvidia's success would not be possible without TSMC. Huang is on a fourth public trip to Taiwan this year.According to a Reuters report, the chipmaker CEO also told reporters that it is experiencing ""very strong demand"" for its Blackwell chips.“Nvidia builds the GPU (graphics processing units), but we also build the CPU (central processing units), the networking, the switches, and so there are a lot of chips associated with Blackwell”.During his interaction with reporters, Huang was asked how concerned he was about memory shortages. To this he replied saying business was growing strongly and there would be shortages of “different things.”""We have three very, very good memory makers - SK Hynix, Samsung, Micron - are all incredibly good memory makers, and they have scaled up tremendous capacity to support us,"" Huang said.He further added that Nvidia has received the most advanced chip samples from all three memory makers.Answering one question about possible memory price increases, he said: ""it's for them to decide how to run their business.""Huang also said that there were ""no active discussions"" about selling Blackwell chips to China. The Trump administration has banned sales of Nvidia's flagship artificial-intelligence chip to China, saying they could aid the Chinese military and the country's AI industry.Last week, Huang challenged US export controls on advanced semiconductors, arguing that continued technology collaboration and access to the Chinese market are ultimately in America’s best interest. Speaking to reporters, Huang described China as a “singular, vital, important, dynamic market, and nobody can replace that.”“It’s in the best interest of America to serve that China market. It’s in the best interest of China to have the American technology company bring ... technology to the China market ... It’s in the best interest of both countries, and I hope that policymakers will ultimately come to that conclusion,” Huang then said.","Huang says 'no discussion' to sell Blackwell chips to China.

Billionaire Peter Thiel on how Zohran Mamdani's win is a warning for both Republicans and Democrats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/billionaire-peter-thiel-on-how-zohran-mamdanis-win-is-a-warning-for-both-republicans-and-democrats/articleshow/125199151.cms,"HISTORIC: Zohran Mamdani Elected New York City's First Indian-American Muslim Mayor





Billionaire investor and PayPal founder Peter Thiel has called the election victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani as New York City’s new mayor a sign of deep voter frustration — and a wake-up call for both major political parties in the United States. In comments made to The Free Press recently, Thiel said the results reflect growing disillusionment among younger Americans who feel capitalism is no longer working for them. He warned that ignoring issues like housing affordability and student debt could push more voters toward candidates with radical or left-wing economic ideas.“When 70% of Millennials say they are pro-socialist, we need to do better than simply dismiss them by saying that they are stupid or entitled or brainwashed; we should try and understand why,” Thiel wrote in an email to tech leaders including Mark Zuckerberg and Marc Andreessen five years ago — an email that resurfaced online after Mamdani’s win.Thiel said that strict zoning laws and construction limits have benefited older generations who saw their property values rise, but hurt younger people locked out of home ownership.“If you proletarianize the young people, you shouldn’t be surprised if they eventually become communist,” he said.He added that many millennials and Gen Z voters aren’t necessarily ideological socialists but rather disillusioned with the economic system.“It’s more just: ‘Capitalism doesn’t work for me. Or, this thing called capitalism is just an excuse for people ripping you off,’” Thiel said.Political experts say Mamdani’s win underscores how rising living costs are reshaping voter priorities. Pollster Frank Luntz told The Free Press that affordability — not just inflation — has become the defining issue for many Americans, regardless of political party.Thiel echoed that view, saying people are now looking for bold ideas, not small policy fixes. “Incremental attempts haven’t worked,” he said, suggesting that both parties need to take the affordability crisis more seriously.Peter Thiel also reflected on America’s aging population, saying that if socialism does gain ground, it may look different from past revolutions.“If the U.S. becomes socialist, it will be more of an old people’s socialism than a young people’s socialism, where it’s more about free healthcare or something like that,” he said. “The word ‘revolution’ sounds pretty high testosterone and youthful. And today, if it’s a revolution, it’s 70-something grandmothers.”",Peter Thiel says the election of Zohran Mamdani as New York City's new mayor is a wake-up call for both major political parties.

Following the Musk model







Electric vehicle maker Rivian has announced a compensation plan for CEO RJ Scaringe worth as much as $4.6 billion over the next decade. This follows the model established by Tesla CEO Elon Musk 's record pay package and linking rewards to new profit targets and lower share price milestones than a previous deal. Rivian's pay package for Scaringe may rank among the richest in corporate history, depending on performance goals achieved.Under the new plan, Scaringe is receiving options to purchase up to 36.5 million shares of Rivian's Class A stock, approximately 16 million more than the previous grant, at an exercise price of $15.22 per share, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.This pay award will only be given to the CEO if the company meets two main sets of goals:Rivian's stock price must reach certain reduced milestones, ranging from $40 up to $140 per share, over the next 10 years.The company must also hit new targets for its operating income and cash flow over the next seven years.If Rivian hits all milestones, Scaringe will receive up to $4.6 billion, including the costs of exercising options, according to Reuters. Rivian said shareholders will gain $153 billion in value.Last week, Tesla shareholders approved a record $1 trillion pay package for CEO Elon Musk based on operational and valuation milestones over 10 years.Rivian said the plan will retain its founder and keep him focused on growth and profitability as the automaker, known for its R1S SUVs and R1T pickups, prepares to launch its smaller, more affordable R2 SUV next year. The R2 will compete with Tesla's best-selling Model Y crossover.Rivian's board also doubled Scaringe's base salary to $2 million, saying the changes were made with input from an independent compensation consultant and designed to better align pay with shareholder returns.Separately, Scaringe was granted 1 million common units in Mind Robotics, a newly formed Rivian spinoff with external funding developing industrial AI technology.","Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe is receiving options to purchase up to 36.5 million shares of Rivian's Class A stock, approximately 16 million more than the previous grant.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees. The ad-supported service is expected to provide users with access to:The company is reportedly testing a model where users will view approximately two minutes of pre-roll advertisements before a game starts streaming. Internal testing also features limits on playtime, including a one-hour session limit and a maximum of five hours of free streaming per month. These restrictions are subject to change before the official launch, the report noted.The free tier is expected to be widely available across PC, Xbox consoles, handheld devices and web browsers. The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%. This change reportedly came after Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new 30% target.","Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

Tech executives flying private jets to the Web Summit technology conference in Portugal are being forced to land as far away as Badajoz in Spain as Lisbon's main airport struggles to accommodate growing numbers of visitors using personal aircraft. According to a report by the Financial Times, the organisers of one of the largest tech events have warned that the airport is turning away some private jets after receiving complaints from delegates about being required to use landing sites several hours’ drive away.The report says that this is the first time the event, an industry gathering with thousands of visitors including start-ups, government delegations, and technology leaders, has experienced such a bottleneck. The situation indicates more visitors are choosing to fly privately.“Please be advised that there is currently a shortage of private jet slots during Web Summit at Lisbon Airport (LIS) and surrounding smaller airports,” the event organisers said.“Lisbon Airport is experiencing difficulty managing the volume of traffic, resulting in a lack of available take-off and landing slots for all operations,” they added.The organisers added that “some guests, in particular those with larger planes, have found the only viable landing slots during Web Summit are now upwards of two hours' drive from Lisbon, including in Spain.”“These are circumstances outside of our control, and we apologise that we cannot do more to help secure slots. We would strongly advise flying commercial into Lisbon.”The bottleneck is partly due to increased conference attendance. Web Summit, which moved from Ireland to Lisbon approximately a decade ago, has grown into one of the tech world's largest events. The number of start-ups exhibiting at the show, which spans multiple event halls and a stadium, has increased more than six-fold over the past decade to more than 1,000 this year.More than 75 governments will send delegations to the event this year, either accompanying start-ups seeking investment or as officials and ministers meet entrepreneurs working in areas such as AI. Many delegations travel on government or royal jets to accommodate large parties. There is a trend toward private jet use among tech company founders.","Tech executives flying private jets to the Web Summit technology conference in Portugal are being forced to land as far away as Badajoz in Spain.

Bezos’ Vision: A bet on the internet



Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency





Amazon founder Jeff Bezos recently revealed the advice he once received from a student of Harvard Business School. Jeff Bezos once revealed that a Harvard student advised him to sell Amazon to Barnes & Noble and exit the business just as the company was preparing to go public in 1997. The anecdote, recounted in Brad Stone’s 2013 book The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon, captures the early skepticism surrounding Amazon’s business model. During a classroom visit, Bezos was told bluntly, “You seem like a really nice guy, so don’t take this the wrong way, but you really need to sell to Barnes & Noble and get out now.”At the time, Amazon was just an online bookstore and was facing a lot of competition from other well-established retailers. Barnes & Noble had just launched its own website, BN.com, in May 1997, and many believed traditional retail giants would crush digital newcomers.Jeff Bezos revealed that instead of following the advice from the Harvard student, Bezos went ahead and doubled down his vision. Amazon went public in May 1997 and then started expanding aggressively. Over the next two decades, the company launched the Amazon Prime service in order to build customer loyalty.After this, in 2006 Amazon introduced Amazon Web Services (AWS). Then, in 2017, Amazon went ahead and acquired Whole Foods and in 2022, the company bought MGM Studios.Amazon also scaled its third-party marketplace, built a vast logistics network, and grew into a dominant player in advertising and payments.Amazon then, went ahead and became a global tech giant and on the other hand Barnes & Noble remained focused on physical retail. After years of declining sales, the chain has recently staged a modest revival and is reportedly exploring a potential IPO in London or New York, according to the Financial Times.Bezos, a Princeton-trained computer scientist, left his role as VP at hedge fund D.E. Shaw in 1994 after reading a report that said web usage was growing at 2,300% per year. “I’d never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast,” he said in a 2010 Princeton speech. That insight led him to launch Amazon as an online bookstore with millions of titles. The Harvard student may have seen a risky startup. Bezos saw a once-in-a-generation opportunity—and built one of the most transformative companies in history.","A Harvard student advised Jeff Bezos to sell Amazon to Barnes & Noble and exit the business just as the company was preparing to go public in 1997.

Broader market implications of job cuts





American companies announced 153,074 job cuts in October 2025, marking the highest total for the month in over two decades and signaling deepening concerns about the labor market as artificial intelligence reshapes industries and cost-cutting accelerates across sectors.The October figure represents a staggering 183% surge from September's 54,064 cuts and a 175% increase compared to October 2024, according to data released by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. This brings the year-to-date total to 1,099,500 job cuts—a 65% jump from the same period last year and the highest level since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.""Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape,"" said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer at Challenger, Gray & Christmas. ""At a time when job creation is at its lowest point in years, the optics of announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter are particularly unfavorable.""The technology and warehousing sectors led the downturn, with Challenger tracking nearly 450 individual job cut plans in October—significantly higher than the roughly 400 announcements in September. The surge comes as companies cite AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs as primary drivers for belt-tightening and hiring freezes.""Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,"" Challenger noted. ""Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.""The wave of layoffs contradicts Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent characterization of only a ""very gradual cooling"" in the job market, raising questions about the true health of employment conditions as newly unemployed Americans face a diminished hiring environment.E-commerce giant Amazon announced plans to eliminate approximately 14,000 corporate positions in what represents roughly 4% of its corporate workforce. The company's senior vice president of People Experience and Technology, Beth Galetti, explained the cuts as part of efforts to reduce bureaucracy, remove layers, and shift resources toward the company's biggest bets.""This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before,"" Galetti wrote in a message to employees. The company is offering most affected employees 90 days to find new internal roles, with recruiting teams prioritizing internal candidates. Initial reports suggest the total number of layoffs could ultimately reach 30,000, making it potentially the largest corporate job cut in Amazon's history.United Parcel Service has cut over 48,000 employees as part of broader reorganization efforts aimed at reducing delivery services for Amazon packages. The shipping giant, which employed 490,000 workers worldwide at the end of 2024, has deployed additional automation in 35 facilities this year. The layoffs impact both UPS drivers and management roles, with the company citing increased automation driving up productivity as a key factor. According to Challenger's data, the warehousing sector announced 47,878 job cuts in October alone, up dramatically from just 984 in September.Chipmaker Intel announced major job cuts impacting over 20,000 employees as part of restructuring efforts under new CEO Lip Bu Tan. The layoffs affect a significant portion of Intel's 108,900-person workforce as of December 2024. The cuts are part of efforts to make the company more cost-disciplined and streamlined following manufacturing missteps, as Intel works to regain its competitive edge in the semiconductor industry.Technology giant Microsoft eliminated approximately 6,000 positions in May, representing about 3% of its workforce. The cuts affected all levels of the company's business empire, including certain international offices of Microsoft-owned LinkedIn. Even Microsoft's AI director, Gabriela de Queiroz, was among those let go. The technology sector has been particularly hard hit this year, with Challenger reporting 33,281 job cuts in October alone—nearly six times the September level—bringing the sector's year-to-date total to 141,159 cuts.Cloud software company Salesforce cut over 4,000 customer support roles, according to CEO Marc Benioff. ""I've reduced it from 9,000 heads to about 5,000, because I need less heads,"" Benioff stated while discussing AI's impact on Salesforce operations. The dramatic reduction underscores how artificial intelligence is fundamentally reshaping workforce needs even at companies building AI tools themselves.Social media giant Meta eliminated roughly 600 jobs from its Meta Superintelligence Labs division in October, which comprises around 3,000 employees focused on the company's AI efforts. The cuts are part of restructuring to address organizational bloat from multiple groups working on overlapping AI projects. Additionally, Meta laid off more than 100 employees in its risk review team. Notably, the cuts did not affect Meta's newest hires on the core team developing ""personal superintelligence. ""Semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker Applied Materials plans to cut approximately 1,400 employees—about 4% of its workforce—to streamline operations. The company, one of the largest U.S.-based makers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, implemented the cuts amid tighter U.S. export controls on semiconductors. Applied Materials had 35,700 full-time staff as of October last year.Online education company Chegg slashed 45% of its workforce, blaming the ""new realities of AI"" for its business challenges. The 388 job cuts came after the company had already laid off 22% of its workforce in May. Chegg cited the rising adoption of AI tools reducing traffic from Google to content publishers as damaging to its business model. ""As a result, and reflecting the company's continued investment in AI, Chegg is restructuring the way it operates its academic learning products,"" the company stated.Electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian cut 600 jobs—approximately 4% of its workforce—amid an EV market pullback, marking the company's third layoff round this year. While details of the latest cuts remain undisclosed, earlier reductions in June and September affected 100 to 150 employees in commercial and manufacturing teams. The consumer products sector, which includes automotive, announced 3,409 job cuts in October, according to Challenger data.Target: 1,800 corporate positions eliminatedRetail giant Target announced plans to eliminate 1,800 roles, representing about 8% of corporate jobs in its first major restructuring in years. The retail sector has been particularly battered this year, with Challenger reporting 88,664 job cuts year-to-date—a 145% increase from the 36,136 announced through October 2024. The sector continues to face cost pressures, shifting consumer habits, and ongoing store closures.The layoff surge extends beyond these headline-grabbing announcements. Other companies cutting corporate jobs include Starbucks, Delta Air Lines, CarMax, Molson Coors Beverage (which cut about 9% of its salaried workforce), Paramount Skydance (1,000 workers), Google (over 100 cloud division design roles), Paycom (over 500 employees), Smartsheet (over 120 employees), and Handshake (around 100 employees).Cost-cutting was the top reason employers cited for October job reductions, responsible for 50,437 announced layoffs, according to Challenger. Artificial Intelligence was the second-most cited factor, leading to 31,039 job cuts in October alone and 48,414 cuts year-to-date as companies continue to restructure and automate.The nonprofit sector has been particularly impacted by government funding cuts, announcing plans to eliminate 27,651 jobs this year—a 419% increase from the 5,329 announced by this point in 2024.Through October, U.S. employers announced just 488,077 planned hires, down 35% from the 750,333 announced at the same point in 2024. This represents the lowest year-to-date hiring total since 2011, when 459,971 new hires were planned. Seasonal hiring plans through October stood at 372,520—the lowest number since Challenger began tracking them in 2012.""It's possible with rate cuts and a strong showing in November, companies may make a late season push for employees, but at this point, we do not expect a strong seasonal hiring environment in 2025,"" Challenger warned.The mounting job-cut announcements raise concerns about labor market health as the Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark interest rate twice since September and is expected to approve another quarter-point reduction in December. However, some business leaders remain optimistic about AI's long-term employment impact, with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon suggesting headcount will remain steady or rise as the bank redeploys workers whose jobs are impacted by technology, noting that AI ""will also create jobs.","American companies announced 153,074 job cuts in October 2025. The October figure represents a 183% surge from September's 54,064 cuts. This brings the year-to-date total to 1,099,500 job cuts—a 65% jump from the same period last year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125198485,imgsize-22572,width-400,resizemode-4/us-layoffs.jpg"

It says:





Facebook-parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg just said what many people have claimed about LLMs (AI models) -- that they are biased. Yes, whichi side the bias is -- Right or Left -- depends on which side one stands. However, for the first time ever, a technology giant has admitted this bias, and not only in its LLM but also in other leading LLMs. In its Llama 4 release announcement, Meta says that it is specifically addressing ""left-leaning"" political bias in its AI model, distinguishing this effort from traditional bias concerns around race, gender, and nationality that researchers have long documented. In a blog post the company said, ""Our goal is to remove bias from our AI models and to make sure that Llama can understand and articulate both sides of a contentious issue. As part of this work, we’re continuing to make Llama more responsive so that it answers questions, can respond to a variety of different viewpoints without passing judgment, and doesn't favor some views over others.""Not just this, it claims that 'Biasness' or should we say 'Left Leanings' is not only problem of Meta LLM, but one that afflicts all leading LLMs. ""It’s well-known that all leading LLMs have had issues with bias—specifically, they historically have leaned left when it comes to debated political and social topics.This is due to the types of training data available on the internet,"" reads the blog post. Leading LLMs mean, among others, LLMs of Google and OpenAI. ""As part of this work, we’re continuing to make Llama more responsive so that it answers questions, can respond to a variety of different viewpoints without passing judgment, and doesn't favor some views over others,"" the post added.* Llama 4 refuses less on debated political and social topics overall (from 7% in Llama 3.3 to below 2%).* Llama 4 is dramatically more balanced with which prompts it refuses to respond to (the proportion of unequal response refusals is now less than 1% on a set of debated topical questions).* Our testing shows that Llama 4 responds with strong political lean at a rate comparable to Grok (and at half of the rate of Llama 3.3) on a contentious set of political or social topics. While we are making progress, we know we have more work to do and will continue to drive this rate further down.While biasness in LLMs is a known fact, what has surprised analysts is that Meta's post mentions only 'left leaning' bias and not 'right leaning' as many claim in Elon Musk's Grok.","Facebook-parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg just said what many people have claimed about LLMs (AI models) -- that they are biased.

Microsoft’s AI Bet Pays Off: Company Joins Nvidia in $4 Trillion Club

Microsoft issues global apology after ACCC lawsuit over hidden 365 plans





Microsoft offers refunds after 365 pricing confusion: Who is eligible and how to claim





Check for an email from Microsoft notifying you of your eligibility.

Switch your subscription to Microsoft 365 Personal or Family Classic by logging into your Microsoft account and selecting the change before 31 December 2025.

After the switch, Microsoft will calculate the refund and process it within 30 days to your original payment method. The refund will appear in your Microsoft account once completed.

What the change involves: Plan options and pricing differences





Implications for consumers and the wider subscription market









In a rare public apology, Microsoft Corporation recently announced it would refund eligible subscribers of its Microsoft 365 service in the United States, following allegations of misleading pricing related to its AI-enhanced plans. The move comes in the wake of regulatory scrutiny in Australia, where the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) sued Microsoft for allegedly failing to clearly present a lower-cost, non-AI-enabled subscription option.Microsoft confirmed it would refund the difference in pricing on renewals from 30 November 2024 and urged customers to switch to the Microsoft 365 Personal or Family Classic plan by December 31, 2025 to claim. The company said the apology and refund offer reflect a commitment to transparency, acknowledging that it “could have been clearer” with its communications.Microsoft’s announcement followed the ACCC’s legal action in Australia, which accused the company of “deliberately hiding” the cheaper, non-AI version of its Microsoft 365 subscription from certain customers. While the dispute originated in Australia, Microsoft stated that it had 2.7 million eligible customers in the United States affected by similar pricing concerns.In its statement to subscribers, Microsoft explained that it added AI capabilities into its Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscriptions and admitted that it “could have been clearer” about the availability of the non-AI Classic plan. The company offered an apology and put in place the refund mechanism for eligible users.Eligible customers are subscribers in the United States who were on Microsoft 365 Personal or Family plans and renewed after 30 November 2024. Customers who switch to the Microsoft 365 Personal or Family Classic plan by 31 December 2025 will receive a refund covering the price difference between their then-current plan and the Classic plan. Microsoft says refunds will be processed within 30 days after the plan switch and credited to the original payment method.How to claim the refund:Microsoft distinguishes between its standard Microsoft 365 subscription (with AI assistant “Copilot” and feature updates) and the Classic plan (which includes core Office apps and security updates but excludes Copilot and may not receive future feature enhancements). According to the example provided in the email to subscribers, the AI-enabled plan renews at AUD $16 / $18 (tax inclusive) per month in Australia, while the Classic version renews at AUD $11 / $14. Though these figures are Australian, they illustrate the price gap between AI-enabled and non-AI plans.In the US, while specific renewal prices were not detailed in the public statement, the refund mechanism is constructed to cover “the difference in price between plans” retroactive to the date of the first renewal after 30 November 2024. Microsoft emphasised that subscribers who already are on the Classic plan and opted to stay there do not need to take any further action.For millions of individual and family Microsoft 365 subscribers, the refund and plan-switch offer represents a significant acknowledgement of value concerns in subscription services. Experts say the case underscores how transparent communication about plan tiers and renewal pricing is increasingly under scrutiny by regulators. Microsoft’s statement, by linking its internal decision to the Australia-based regulatory action, suggests that consumers around the world may expect improved disclosure.Subscription fatigue and rising service costs are major issues for consumers globally. With software companies adding features like AI assistants and advanced capabilities, the pressure to differentiate tiered pricing without confusing or alienating customers is growing. Microsoft’s move may set a precedent for how tech giants manage legacy product transitions and pricing transparency.","Microsoft announced it would refund eligible subscribers of its Microsoft 365 service in the United States.

Fall in China sales hurt Swatch

Rise of smartwatch





In a blow to the beleaguered Swiss watchmaker, Swatch Group is reportedly set to be ousted from the benchmark Swiss Leader Index (SLI) next month, stock exchange operator SIX announced this week, citing a sharp drop in the company's market capitalization and dwindling share trading volumes. According to a report by Reuters, the iconic producer of luxury timepieces like Omega, Tissot, and Longines will exit the 30-stock SLI basket on December 22, making way for the newly formed Helvetia Baloise Holding. The replacement stems from the recent merger of Swiss insurers Helvetia and Baloise, forging what is now the country's second-largest insurance powerhouse.SIX, which typically recalibrates its indexes annually in September, invoked an extraordinary adjustment for this shake-up. The SLI's makeup is determined by companies' free-float market capitalization and average trading volumes over the prior 12 months, metrics where Swatch has faltered badly.Swatch's stock has shed about 5% over the past year, hammered by sagging sales and a profit nosedive—largely pinned on a steep decline in demand from China, the world's largest watch market. The fallout has eroded the company's market value to 8.66 billion Swiss francs (about $10.9 billion), while daily trading in its shares has plummeted by nearly a third this year alone.Swatch shares have lost 5% in value over the last 12 months as sales fell and profits plunged due to falling sales in China.This isn't Swatch's first ouster from the index. The group was already bumped from the elite Swiss Market Index (SMI) in September 2021, supplanted by computer peripherals giant Logitech. The SLI serves as a key barometer for Swiss equities, blending the SMI's top 20 blue-chip heavyweights with the 10 biggest mid-caps from the Swiss Market Index Mid (SMIM). It's a go-to for index-tracking funds, exchange-traded commodities (ETCs), and derivatives, offering investors a streamlined basket of large- and mid-cap Swiss stocks.For Swatch, the demotion underscores broader headwinds in the luxury goods sector, where economic jitters and shifting consumer tastes in Asia have squeezed margins. Analysts say the index snub could further pressure the stock, already trading at multi-year lows, as passive investors rebalance away from the watchmaker.Over the past five years, Swatch Group's financial performance has weakened substantially, underperforming both the broader market and its main rivals. Meanwhile, the rise of smartwatches like those offered by Apple have eaten into the lower-price watch segment where Swatch Group traditionally led. Its shares have correspondingly lost significant ground, delivering an abysmal total return performance.","Swatch Group is reportedly set to be ousted from the benchmark Swiss Leader Index (SLI) next month.

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason





Gates Foundation recently announced $2.5 billion commitment over the next five years to advance women's health initiatives worldwide. The funding aims to fuel dozens of projects, from life-saving maternal medicines to vaccines targeting infections that hit women hardest. The pledge marks a roughly 33% jump in the foundation's investments in women's and maternal health compared to the prior half-decade. It is the largest funding commitment the Gates Foundation has made in women’s health. The pledge also is a sign of the areas where Bill Gates wants to focus on as he seeks to donate the vast majority of his $114 billion fortune before winding down the foundation over the next 20 years. Gates spoke about the pledge during an event with STAT this week.The vast majority of the funds — as much as 70% — will go to research and development. About a tenth will go to market introduction of new technologies or generating better data around them. Only about 4% will go to manufacturing, and 3% to advocacy. ""It's curious why some of these areas are so under-invested, because the rich world health burden on preeclampsia specifically is still, you know, very high,"" Bill Gates remarked during a briefing, highlighting one of the hypertensive disorders that claim thousands of women's lives annually, even in wealthy nations.The portfolio brims with high-tech promise. Backed by the foundation's dollars will be self-injectable contraceptives for easier access, long-lasting contraceptive patches, lightning-fast diagnostics for STIs, and deep dives into the human microbiome's role in everything from pregnancy complications to broader women's health challenges, including disease transmission.Yet Gates was clear-eyed about the foundation's boundaries. ""One thing we make very clear is we're not able to replace what the U.S. government has canceled,"" he said, nodding to recent federal budget trims in global health programs. Gates told STAT, ""It's just not our role to say, OK, the U.S. government wants to save money and so we'll help them do that.""In fields like malaria, tuberculosis, and non-hormonal birth control, the Gates Foundation already reigns as the world's top funder, Gates noted. Its R&D bets will yield lasting innovations that outlive the organization's support. But for on-the-ground health delivery, the clock is ticking: The foundation's aid is designed to be temporary, hinging on sustainable handoffs to other players.Even with Gates' immense wealth as a backstop, he stressed the need for collective action. A core aim, he and his team emphasized, is to ignite urgency among governments, pharmaceutical giants, and researchers to prioritize women's health disparities—long overlooked despite their outsized toll.""We'd love to have other people work on this stuff,"" Gates said. ""It's crazy that this stuff isn't better funded. Drawing governments and other philanthropists in—we've had some success at that, and I'm putting more time into talking with other philanthropists about how impactful this work is. So I think we'll have a lot of additional partnerships, certainly at the end of the 20 years.""""Then we're gone,"" he added pointedly, ""and so other people will have to step up in these areas.""As the foundation accelerates its sunset strategy, this women's health push underscores a pivotal shift: from lone-wolf giving to catalyzing a broader ecosystem. With maternal deaths still claiming a life every two minutes globally, advocates hailed the commitment as a vital spark—one that could, if multiplied, finally bend the arc toward equity.",Gates Foundation recently announced $2.5 billion commitment over the next five years to advance women's health initiatives worldwide.

Google is making its most advanced chip to date, the seventh-generation Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) known as Ironwood, widely available to customers in the coming weeks — a move aimed at drawing more artificial intelligence developers to its cloud platform. Initially unveiled in April for testing and limited deployment, Ironwood marks Google’s latest push to win business from AI companies by offering custom-built silicon designed to train and run massive machine-learning models.Built in-house, Ironwood is designed for both training large AI models and powering real-time applications such as chatbots and digital agents. Google said the chip can connect up to 9,216 TPUs in a single pod, effectively eliminating “data bottlenecks for the most demanding models” and allowing users “to run and scale the largest, most data-intensive models in existence.”The company said Ironwood delivers more than four times the performance of its previous TPU generation. AI startup Anthropic plans to use as many as 1 million Ironwood chips to power its Claude language model, Google added.The rollout comes amid an intensifying race between Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta to dominate AI infrastructure. While most large language models currently rely on Nvidia’s GPUs, Google’s TPUs are part of a growing wave of custom silicon designed to improve efficiency, performance, and cost for specialized AI workloads.Alongside the new chip, Google announced upgrades across its cloud computing platform, aimed at making it “cheaper, faster, and more flexible.” The company is seeking to close the gap with larger rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, both of which continue to lead the cloud market.Google Cloud posted $15.15 billion in third-quarter revenue, a 34% year-over-year increase, compared with 40% growth for Microsoft Azure and 20% for AWS. Google also said it has signed more billion-dollar cloud contracts in the first nine months of 2025 than in the previous two years combined.To meet growing AI infrastructure demand, Google raised its capital expenditure forecast for 2025 to $93 billion, up from an earlier estimate of $85 billion.“We are seeing substantial demand for our AI infrastructure products, including TPU-based and GPU-based solutions,” CEO Sundar Pichai said on a recent earnings call. “It’s one of the key drivers of our growth over the past year, and we continue to see very strong demand as we invest to meet it.”","Google is making its most advanced chip to date, the seventh-generation Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) known as Ironwood.

What may change in Europe’s AI law



Pressure from Trump, Big Tech







The European Commission is reportedly proposing to delay enforcement of portions of its artificial intelligence (AI) law following intense pressure from Big Tech companies and the US government. According to a report, Brussels plans to weaken part of its digital regulations, including its AI Act that entered into force last year, in a decision on a simplification package set for November 19.The Financial Times reported that the draft proposal comes during a broader debate over how aggressively the EU should enforce its digital rules amid fierce backlash from Big Tech companies supported by US President Donald Trump.Citing the draft proposal, The Financial Times claims that the commission is considering giving companies that breach rules on the highest-risk AI use a one-year grace period. The draft remains subject to informal discussions within the commission and with European capitals and could change before its adoption on November 19, officials said.Once the commission puts forward its proposal, it must be approved by a majority of EU countries and the European parliament.Providers of generative AI systems already on the market before the implementation date could receive a one-year pause from the laws “to provide sufficient time . . . to adapt their practices within a reasonable time without disrupting the market.”Brussels is also suggesting delaying fines for violations of new AI transparency rules until August 2027 “to provide sufficient time for adaptation of providers and deployers of AI systems” to implement the obligations.The draft also proposes making the compliance burden easier for companies and centralising enforcement through the EU's own AI office.The report highlights that the EU has faced pressure from the US government, Big Tech and European groups over its AI Act.The report also goes on to say that fears of provoking Trump into cutting intelligence or weapon supplies to Ukraine or starting a transatlantic trade war led Brussels to agree to a provisional trade deal in August. EU officials remain cautious about moves that could provoke White House retaliation.A senior EU official told the Financial Times the EU had been ""engaging"" with the Trump administration on adjustments to the AI Act and other digital regulations as part of its wider simplification process.","Brussels plans to weaken part of its digital regulations, including its AI Act that entered into force last year.

"Denmark social media ban for kids: Government sends 'warning' to TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and others",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/denmark-social-media-ban-for-kids-government-sends-warning-to-tiktok-facebook-instagram-and-others/articleshow/125184404.cms,"‘No loopholes for the tech giants’







Denmark has announced an agreement to ban social media access for anyone under 15, marking one of the most comprehensive steps by a European Union government to limit youth social media use. The measure will allow some parents, after a specific assessment, to permit their children to access social media from age 13.Caroline Stage, Denmark's minister for digital affairs, told The Associated Press that 94% of Danish children under age 13 have profiles on at least one social media platform, and more than half of those under 10 do.“The amount of time they spend online — the amount of violence, self-harm that they are exposed to online — is simply too great a risk for our children,” Stage was quoted as saying. She added that tech companies have “an absurd amount of money available, but they're simply not willing to invest in the safety of our children, invest in the safety of all of us.”Stage said the ban will not take effect immediately and lawmakers from across the political spectrum who hold a majority in parliament will likely take months to pass relevant legislation.“I can assure you that Denmark will hurry, but we won't do it too quickly because we need to make sure that the regulation is right and that there is no loopholes for the tech giants to go through,” Stage said.Her ministry said pressure from tech companies' business models was “too massive.”Denmark plans to use its national electronic ID system for enforcement. Nearly all Danish citizens over age 13 have such an ID. The government plans to set up an age-verification app, similar to apps being tested in several other EU countries.“We cannot force the tech giants to use our app, but what we can do is force the tech giants to make proper age verification, and if they don't, we will be able to enforce through the EU commission and make sure that they will be fined up to 6% of their global income,” Stage said.The move follows Australia’s December decision to enact the world's first ban on social media for children, setting the minimum age at 16. That law made platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram subject to fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts.Stage said Denmark's legislative push is ""not about excluding children from everything digital"" but keeping them away from harmful content.",Denmark has announced an agreement to ban social media access for anyone under 15.

Musk predicts universal high income but at a cost







Elon Musk, CEO of xAI and Tesla, has once again issued a warning on AI-led future. He has predicted a future where physical work becomes largely optional due to artificial intelligence (AI), but warned that the transition will be marked by “a lot of trauma and disruption. ” Speaking recently on Joe Rogan’s podcast, Musk likened the coming shift in office work to the pre-computer age, when workers manually performed calculations that are now handled instantly by machines.Musk asserted that AI is already, and will continue to, replace desk jobs that are digitally centric, and the pace of this change will accelerate.“Anything that is digital, which is just someone at a computer doing something, AI is going to take over those jobs like lightning,” Musk said, adding “It's just happening. Like I said, AI is the supersonic tsunami.”He explained that although demand for jobs will remain high, they will not be the same jobs currently available. This process, he argued, has occurred throughout modern history.“Anything that's physically moving atoms, like cooking food or farming, anything that's physical, those jobs will exist for a much longer time,” he said.Musk stated he remains bullish on the long-term benefits of AI, assuming a “benign scenario” where a “Terminator-esque scenario” is avoided.In his ideal future, wealth will be accessible to nearly everyone, leading to a state he called “universal high income,” not just universal basic income.“Ultimately, working will be optional because you'll have robots plus AI,” he said.“And we'll have, in a benign scenario, universal high income, meaning anyone can have any products or services that they want, but there will be a lot of trauma and disruption along the way,” he added.","Elon Musk, CEO of xAI and Tesla, has once again issued a warning on AI-led future.

It has come to the attention of Warren Buffett that there are several videos posted on YouTube that include alleged comments of Mr. Buffett by images or AI created images impersonating Mr. Buffett. Generally, such video images of Mr. Buffett may appear to look like him but the sound of the impersonator speaking in a very flat monotone voice is clearly not the voice of Mr. Buffett. A link to one such video appearing on YouTube follows: https://www.youtube.com/@WW2Echoessss. Mr. Buffett is concerned that these types of fraudulent videos are becoming a spreading virus. Individuals who are less familiar with Mr. Buffett may believe these videos are real and be misled by the contents of these videos.

Mr. Buffett has rarely commented publicly since Berkshire’s shareholder’s meeting last May. On Monday, November 10th, Berkshire will be issuing a press release which will contain a message from Mr. Buffett regarding philanthropy, Berkshire and other matters that Berkshire shareholders and others may find to be of interest.





Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has issued a public warning after it is reported that several videos utilising AI-generated images and voices of the CEO are circulating on YouTube, offering investment advice he never gave. The message from the company is clear: there is only one “Oracle of Omaha,” and viewers should be wary of increasingly convincing deepfakes.Berkshire Hathaway issued a press release titled ""It’s Not Me"", specifically highlighting a video titled ""Warren Buffett: The #1 Investment Tip For Everyone Over 50 (MUST WATCH),"" where an impersonated voice offers financial advice.The company stated that while the visuals often mimic the 95-year-old investor, the audio typically features flat, generic speech that “clearly” is not his voice.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Buffett has been an increasing target for AI impersonators, a phenomenon he has complained about previously. In October 2024, weeks before the US presidential election, he warned of ""fraudulent claims"" that he had endorsed political candidates and investment products. The investor has largely stepped back from formal political endorsements in recent years.","Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has issued a public warning after it is reported that several videos utilising AI-generated images and voices of the CEO are circulating on YouTube.

Nvidia clarifies Jensen Huang ’s statement





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has clarified his previous remarks that China will win the AI race with the US trailing behind. A Financial Times report this week claimed Huang said, ""China is going to win the AI race. "" He has now denied the statement, saying “That’s not what I said”, adding “What I said was China has very good AI technology.”In conversation with media reporters recently, Huang said “They (China) have many AI researchers, in fact 50% of the world’s AI researchers are in China. And they develop very good AI technology. In fact, the most popular AI models in the world today, open-source models, are from China.”“So, they are moving very, very fast,” he continued. “The United States has to continue to move incredibly fast. Otherwise – the world is very competitive, so we have to run fast.”As mentioned above, it all started with a FT report quoting Huang. Speaking on the sidelines of the Financial Times' Future of AI Summit, he allegedly told reports ""China is going to win the AI race.""Hours later, the chip maker posted a clarification on Huang’s statement. Nvidia posted an official statement, quoting CEO Jensen Huang reads, ""As I have long said, China is Nanoseconds behind America in AI.It's vital that America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide.""Jensen Huang has often complained about lack of access to the Chinese market. Talking at an event last month, Huang said that the US can win the AI battle if the world, including China's massive developer base, runs on Nvidia systems. However, the Chinese government has shut Nvidia out of its market. ""We want America to win this AI race. No doubt about that,"" Huang then said.""We want the world to be built on American tech stack. Absolutely the case. But we also need to be in China to win their developers. A policy that causes America to lose half of the world's AI developers is not beneficial in the long term, it hurts us more,"" he added.","A Financial Times report this week claimed Huang said, ""China is going to win the AI race"" He has now denied the statement, saying “That’s not what I said”, adding “What I said was China has very good AI technology.”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125183194,imgsize-1117084,width-400,resizemode-4/file-jensen-huang.jpg"

Google’s YouTube has stated it is ready to negotiate a fair deal with Disney to restore the entertainment giant’s networks to its YouTube TV service, a report has said. This comes days after Disney’s channels went dark on the platform late last week due to a failure in licensing talks. YouTube previously accused Disney of misrepresenting the facts and seeking higher carriage rates than those paid by rivals and even Disney's own smaller platforms.“Our team stands ready to make a fair agreement in line with their deals with other distributors and we encourage Disney to come to the table and do what's best for our mutual customers,” YouTube said in a statement to news agency Reuters.The core dispute centres on carriage fees, the per-subscriber rates distributors pay to carry popular broadcast and cable networks. On Monday (November 3), YouTube TV proposed restoring ABC and ESPN in response to Disney’s request to specifically bring back ABC for Election Day coverage.YouTube claimed that Disney is seeking rates for the ABC networks that are higher than what competitors like Charter and DirecTV pay. YouTube specifically denied Disney’s assertion that the streaming service is seeking preferential or below-market terms, the report noted.Meanwhile, in a memo to employees on Friday, Disney Entertainment co-chairs Dana Walden and Alan Bergman, and ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro, countered YouTube’s position: “YouTube TV continues to insist on receiving preferential terms that are below market and has made few concessions.”Disney claimed it initiated talks by offering a deal that would cost YouTube TV “less overall than the terms of our recently expired license.” Disney reportedly said that it continues to hold talks with YouTube TV, heading into “another sports-packed weekend without a deal in place.”","Google's YouTube says it is ready to negotiate a fair deal with Disney.

The WhatsApp Scam That Gives Hackers Your Phone!

Beta testing and availability



Apple Watch gets a dedicated WhatsApp app







WhatsApp is reportedly rolling out a new layer of security for users who may be vulnerable to targeted hacking attempts. As reported by WABetaInfo, the feature, called “Strict Account Settings,” was spotted in the latest iOS beta version (25.33.10.70) and is designed to offer “extreme protections” for accounts deemed high-risk. Found under Privacy > Advanced, the new setting allows users to activate a suite of automatic safeguards. According to WhatsApp, this mode is intended for individuals who believe they are at risk of cyberattacks—such as journalists, activists, or public figures—and may reduce the overall messaging experience in favour of tighter security.Once enabled, “Strict Account Settings” applies the following protections:* Blocks media and attachments from unknown senders* Silences calls from unfamiliar numbers* Restricts group invites to known contacts only* Disables link previews* Enforces two-step verification* Notifies users of encryption key changes* Locks certain privacy settings to prevent tamperingThese measures are designed to minimise exposure to phishing, impersonation, and other forms of digital intrusion.The feature is currently being tested through TestFlight on iOS, and is expected to roll out more broadly in the coming weeks. WhatsApp has not confirmed a release date for Android users, but similar protections are likely to follow. While most users won’t need this level of security, WhatsApp emphasises that it’s a proactive step to support those in sensitive roles or under digital threat. Users can toggle the feature on or off at any time, giving them control over their security posture.Recently, WhatsApp introduced its first standalone Apple Watch app. This new app will make it significantly easier for Apple Watch users to manage and interact with their chats on the popular Meta-owned messaging service directly from the smartwatch without needing their iPhone. The new software includes several enhanced features, such as the ability to record and send voice messages, receive full call notifications, view full-length message previews, and utilise message reactions. These updates bring WhatsApp functionality closer to parity with Apple's native messaging app on the watch.","WhatsApp is reportedly rolling out a new layer of security for users who may be vulnerable to targeted hacking attempts.

Allegations: Wage theft , worker displacement, and LCA violations







US Department of Labor (DOL) has announced that it has started 175 active investigations into alleged misuse of the H-1B visa program. DOL took to social media platform to confirm this development. “As part of our mission to protect American Jobs, we’ve launched 175 investigations into H-1B abuse. Under @POTUS and@SecretaryLCD’s leadership, we’ll continue taking action to put American Workers FIRST!” Wrote DOL in a post shared in X (formerly known as Twitter). For those unaware, this investigation is a part of Project Firewall which was launched by the Department of Labor in September this year. The program is designed to make sure that American workers are prioritised and foreign professionals are hired only when it’s absolutely necessary.Labor Secretary Lori Chaves-DeRemer also emphasised that the department’s commitment to “protecting the integrity of our immigration system and ensuring fair treatment for all workers.” She added that the investigations are just the beginning, stating, “We will continue to pursue every lead and use every resource to hold violators accountable”.As per the US Department of Labor, Project Firewall is an H-1B enforcement initiative that will safeguard the rights, wages, and job opportunities of highly skilled American workers by ensuring employers prioritize qualified Americans when hiring workers and holding employers accountable if they abuse the H-1B visa process.“As authorized by federal law, the department will conduct investigations of employers through Project Firewall to maximize H-1B program compliance. To achieve this goal, the Secretary of Labor will personally certify the initiation of investigations for the first time in the department’s history. This historic action leverages existing authority granted to the Secretary if reasonable cause exists that an H-1B employer not in compliance,” said DOL in a press statement.According to a report by Fox News, the investigations carried out by DOL has already uncovered:* Over $15 million in unpaid wages owed to foreign workers* Improper Labor Condition Application (LCA) filings* Misrepresented worksite locations* Displacement of qualified U.S. workersAll these findings made by DOL suggest systemic issues in how some employers are using the H-1B program, which is intended to allow U.S. companies to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations when no qualified American workers are available.DOL also said that Employers found guilty of abuse may face:* Hefty fines* Back wage payments* Debarment from future visa programsThe DOL has also urged companies to review their compliance with H-1B regulations, particularly around remote work arrangements and wage standards.Project Firewall is part of the broader immigration enforcement agenda under US President Donald Trump, who has consistently advocated for stricter oversight of employment-based visa programs.",US Department of Labor (DOL) has started 175 active investigations into alleged misuse of the H-1B visa program.

Microsoft founder Bill Gates has described himself as being shy and awkward. Bill Gates has talked about his shy and awkward phases in his memoir. And what helped change him, or kinda a change this behavior is her youngest daughter Phoebe Gates' persistence. Phoebe Gates claims to be on a mission to change this about Bill Gates from a young age.

""I was like, 'No, if we're here, we're going to socialize. We gotta work this room, Bill"" Phoebe told host Alex Cooper during the podcast.She recounted telling him at father-daughter dances. Phoebe said she'd ""force my dad to go talk to all the other dads and daughters, and he would get nervous and leave"" in some instances. Despite his occasional nervousness, she never let up. According to Phoebe, her family now jokes that life ""would be so boring"" without her extroverted personality.Phoebe also shared that she and her father share a competitive streak that can make family game nights intense. This drive comes out in full force when she brings home a new boyfriend. She described how Bill Gates can get ""really nerve-wracking,"" sometimes even taking puzzle pieces out of a date's hands to fit them together himself.Cooper also asked her how she handled situations when people doubted her or just thought she was Bill’s daughter. ""Fake it to you make it,"" she said during the podcast. ""If I feel like I am my own person stepping into that room, because frankly, once you get inside a room, it doesn’t matter how you got here.""She also acknowledged the immense privilege she grew up with, and recognized there were difficulties in getting out of her parent's shadows.","Microsoft founder Bill Gates has described himself as being shy and awkward.

"Judge calls out 'stupidity' of 300 bankers of America's largest bank JP Morgan Chase while sentencing Charlie Javice, once called 'wonder' CEO",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/judge-calls-out-stupidity-of-300-bankers-of-americas-largest-bank-jp-morgan-chase-while-sentencing-charlie-javice-once-called-wonder-ceo/articleshow/124242356.cms,"Charlie Javice, the 20-something women CEO who 'fooled' JP Morgan

What Charlie Javice's lawyers said in her defense





A Manhattan judge didn't hold back, using unusually blunt language to describe JP Morgan's bankers as victims of a massive fraud, but at the same time chiding them for their ""stupidity"". According to a report from Business Insider, US District Judge Alvin K Hellerstein sentenced fintech founder Charlie Javice to seven years in prison and ordered her to pay $287.5 million in restitution.It was halfway through the hearing that the judge began his scathing criticism of the bank's due diligence. ""What consideration should be given for JPMorgan Chase's very poor due diligence?"" Hellerstein asked. But he went on to add that Fraud remains a fraud ""whether you outsmart someone who is smart or someone who is a fool.""Javice, who once appeared on Forbes' ""30 Under 30"" list, was found guilty of defrauding America's largest bank JP Morgan Chase in the 2021 sale of her startup, Frank. The bank paid $175 million for the company, believing it had access to a database of 4 million college students. It was later revealed that Javice had fabricated the data, using a computer programmer to create a fake list of users.JP Morgan did not discover the fraud until a year after the acquisition was finalized, despite a team of 300 in-house diligence officers vetting the deal.The prosecution described Frank as ""a crime scene,"" not a viable business.Javice, who had previously attracted high-profile investors, even managed to secure one-on-one meeting with JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon.During the sentencing, the judge was unswayed by the defense's argument that JP Morgan, a bank worth nearly $4 trillion, should have known better. In a striking statement, Judge Hellerstein declared that his job was ""punishing her conduct and not JPMorgan's stupidity."" He emphasized that ""fraud remains a fraud, whether you outsmart someone who is smart or someone who is a fool.""The defense had pointed to trial evidence showing that one bank executive had scoffed at the sale price, calling it ""nothing."" Yet, the judge insisted that blaming the victim, even a banking giant, was irrelevant. ""Whether you outsmart someone who is indifferent or someone who is careful, it's the conduct,"" he said.","Charlie Javice sentenced to seven years in prison and ordered to pay $287.5 million in restitution.

"More than 90% companies have seen their AI investments failing and blame for this should go to ..., says study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/more-than-90-companies-have-seen-their-ai-investments-failing-and-blame-for-this-should-go-to-says-study/articleshow/124241294.cms,"MIT study says 95% of Gen-AI pilots at companies are failing





A new study has tried to reason the biggest complaint that majority of companies have with their AI investment -- that they give zero return. A recent MIT study had put the figure of AI investment failures at 95%. Now a study from researchers at consulting company BetterUp Labs, in collaboration with Stanford Social Media Lab, has reasoned the AI failure with a new term -- ""workslop"". The study coins the new term to describe low-quality, AI-generated work: “Workslop.”Published in the Harvard Business Review, the research highlights how Workslop may explain why 95% of organizations experimenting with AI report no return on investment. Workslop, defined as “AI-generated work content that masquerades as good work, but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task,” is often unhelpful, incomplete, or missing critical context. The researchers warn that it shifts the burden downstream, forcing others to interpret, correct, or redo the work.The researchers also conducted an ongoing survey of 1,150 full-time, U.S.-based employees, with 40% of respondents saying they’d received Workslop in the past month.To combat Workslop, researchers urge workplace leaders to model intentional AI use and establish clear guidelines for acceptable practices. “Leaders must set guardrails around norms to ensure AI contributes meaningfully,” the study advises.The findings highlight the need for thoughtful integration of AI tools to avoid creating more work rather than less.A recent MIT study indicates that 95% of organizations studied get zero return on their AI investment. The study said that 95% of organizations found zero return despite enterprise investment of $30 billion to $40 billion into GenAI. MIT researchers are said to have studied 300 public AI initiatives to try and suss out the ""no hype reality"" of AI's impact on business.","A recent MIT study indicates that 95% of organizations studied get zero return on their AI investment.

Google’s New AI Is BANANAS: How To Use Gemini Nano Banana

How Google determined the winners of Nano Banana hackathon







Google DeepMind has announced the 50 winners of its recent Nano Banana Hackathon. The company is awarding the contest winners non-monetary prizes totalling $400,000. The 48-hour competition, which ran from September 6 to September 8, received 832 project submissions. Each of the 50 winning projects received a prize package that included $5,000 in Gemini API credits, $1,000 in Fal credits, and 11 million Eleven Labs credits valued at approximately $2,000. Google also provided a special technology prize for submissions that demonstrated outstanding technical achievement using Eleven Labs or Fal technologies.In a thread of posts shared on the social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Google announced the names and the projects of each winner and wrote:As the name implies, participants were challenged to create a product, application, or demo using Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model, popularly known as Nano Banana. This new image generation and editing tool, developed by Google, enhances the Gemini app’s editing experience by allowing users to create multiple variations from a single photo or combine ideas from different images.The hackathon went beyond basic text-to-image generation, asking participants to develop innovative concepts, leverage the model’s strengths, and build apps that could power dynamic storytelling, boost e-commerce, automate creative workflows, and enable the next wave of natural language photo editors, according to Google DeepMind.To support this, Google introduced a special Gemini API tier with a limit of 20 images per minute and 500 requests per project daily. Submissions had to be hosted publicly on Kaggle and include a demo video of up to two minutes to showcase the project’s “wow” factor.Entries were judged with 10% weight given to the quality of the demo video, 40% to innovation and the “wow” element, and the remaining points split across technical execution, functionality, and potential impact.Google highlighted several winners in a social media post. Among them, LifeTrace Timeline transformed raw location data into a personal diary for reflecting on daily experiences. ArtLens blended AI with art history to reimagine famous paintings as real-world scenes. Another standout, ForgeOne, introduced an AI-driven system for automated creative workflows that evaluates and refines its own outputs against professional standards.","Google DeepMind has announced the 50 winners of its Nano Banana Hackathon.

Ek’s statement



Leadership evolution



Board and co-CEOs React







Spotify founder and CEO Daniel Ek has announced that he is stepping down from his role as the CEO effective from January 1, 2026. Ek will transition to the position of executive chairman, while longtime executives Gustav Söderström and Alex Norström will take over as co-CEOs. They will report to Daniel Ek and will also serve on the company’s Board of Directors subject to shareholder approval.In a letter to employees, Ek reflected on Spotify’s journey from a startup to a global audio leader with more than 700 million users:“I always believed that Spotify could play an important role in revolutionizing listening around the world, and with more than 700 million users, we’ve truly charted a new course bringing creativity to every corner of the globe,” said Daniel Ek.“Over the last few years, I’ve turned over a large part of the day-to-day management and strategic direction of Spotify to Alex and Gustav–who have shaped the company from our earliest days and are now more than ready to guide our next phase. This change simply matches titles to how we already operate. In my role as Executive Chairman, I will focus on the long arc of the company and keep the Board and our co-CEOs deeply connected through my engagement.This move by Daniel Ek formalises the leadership structure which has been in place since 2023 with Söderström (Chief Product & Technology Officer) and Norström (Chief Business Officer) already steering much of Spotify’s strategic and operational direction. As Executive Chairman, Ek will focus on capital allocation, long-term strategy, and board engagement, in a role modeled after the European chairman system.Woody Marshall, Lead Independent Director of Spotify’s Board, said the transition had been in planning for years: “We have tremendous confidence in Alex and Gustav as they step into these roles… We are also thrilled that Daniel will be actively involved, giving Spotify both founder-led strategic stewardship and mentorship to the co-CEOs.”In a joint statement, Söderström and Norström said: “We’ve worked together a very long time and have seen Spotify through many different chapters… While we bring different experiences and perspectives to the CEO role, we both have a strong bias to action and can’t wait to get started knowing that we will have Daniel’s full partnership and ongoing support.”","Spotify founder and CEO Daniel Ek has announced that he is stepping down from his role as the CEO effective from January 1, 2026.

What Howard Lutnick said about chip manufacturing in US



“My objective, and this administration’s objective, is to get chip manufacturing significantly onshored — we need to make our own chips. The idea that I pitched [Taiwan] was, let’s get to 50-50. We’re producing half, and you’re producing half.”

Nothing Ear (Open): Balancing Surroundings and Sound





The Trump administration is encouraging Taiwan to relocate some of its investment and semiconductor production to the US. According to US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, the goal is to ensure that half of America’s chips are manufactured domestically. This push, which could have implications for Taiwan’s national defence, is part of a strategy to reduce American reliance on the island nation. In a recent interview, Lutnick said that Washington has held discussions with Taipei about the “50-50” split in semiconductor production. Currently, Taiwan produces over 90% of the world’s advanced semiconductors. Lutnick cited Taiwan's distance from the US and proximity to China as the cause for concern regarding America's dependence on its chips.In an interview with News Nation, Lutnick said:Lutnick said his goal is to achieve around 40% domestic semiconductor production by the end of President Donald Trump’s current term, which would require over $500 billion in local investments.Taiwan’s dominance in chip manufacturing is primarily attributed to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world’s largest and most advanced contract chipmaker, which produces for US tech giants such as Nvidia and Apple Taiwan’s crucial role in global chip production is believed to have provided the island nation with protection against direct military action from China, a concept often referred to as thetheory.However, in the interview, Lutnick dismissed theconcept, suggesting that Taiwan would be more secure with a more balanced distribution of chip production between the US and Taiwan.Lutnick noted.He added that under the 50-50 plan, the US would still beon Taiwan but would have the ability toTSMC has been investing in US manufacturing since 2020, with plans to spend a total of $165 billion. Meanwhile, the Trump administration proposed 100% tariffs on semiconductors, exempting companies that invest in the US, and trade talks between the US and Taiwan could impact these tariffs.","US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said the goal is to ensure that half of America’s chips are manufactured domestically.

Walmart’s executive VP of Global Tech Platforms, Sravana Karnati, has revealed the two primary traits he looks for while hiring engineers. In a statement to Business Insider, Karnati said that while hiring engineers, he looks” The Indian-origin executive of the US-based retail major, who has over 25 years of leadership experience at companies including Amazon and Disney , said that he hasHowever, he emphasised the importance of candidates possessing domain expertise. According to the executive, anyone in a technical position, including project managers, must understand the architecture, dependencies, and associated risks of their work.Karnati explainedKarnati noted that the skills required depend on the role a person is pursuing. For instance, someone in UX design or engineering does not necessarily need an in-depth understanding of computer science fundamentals, but having some basic technical knowledge can be helpful.What matters most is being able to effectively utilise tools like Figma and other LLMs to accomplish the work, he added.However, for software development or engineering roles, Karnati said a firm grasp of computer science fundamentals is essential. LLM tools can boost productivity, but they cannot replace a deeper understanding of systems, algorithms, and architecture.Karnati, who was instrumental in developing Walmart’s new AI tool Wibey, explained that he wants candidates who can write good algorithms and long-term(The company describes Wibey as a developer-focused tool that helps employees streamline workflows by automating repetitive coding tasks and managing compliance checks.)Although Karnati said he is looking to hire computer scientists, that does not necessarily mean candidates must hold a degree in computer science. He himself holds a doctorate in chemical engineering, but has worked as a computer scientist for years, he noted.Adding that such roles require a strong focus on operational discipline, Karnati explained:Karnati mentioned thatis to keep up with the evolution of technology and continue to retrain yourself. He noted that those who have thrived in the industry for 30 to 40 years have managed to stay current with the business and keep learning.That ability to learn quickly and keep pace with the industry, he said, is the second trait he looks for. When hiring, Karnati said he wants to see evidence that a candidate has already demonstrated this quality.He added that candidates can showcase this ability through various internships or coursework that reflects aKarnati's observations reflect a broader trend among tech leaders, who emphasise the increasing importance of adaptability in the workplace as AI becomes more widespread.","Sravana Karnati, Walmart's executive VP of Global Tech Platforms, has revealed the two primary traits he looks for while hiring engineers.

Read Google’s full ‘urgent’ memo to H-1B visa holders

We are reaching out with an urgent update regarding international travel for individuals on H-1B visas.

A Proclamation is scheduled to take effect this Sunday at 12:01 AM ET. It introduces significant changes to re-entry procedures for H-1B visa holders currently outside the United States. We continue to review the Proclamation, but the initial advice we have received is that re-entry will require a mandatory payment of $100,000 per petition, which may cause substantial delays or prevent re-entry to the US

What You Need to Know:

If you are currently outside the US:

If you are currently outside the US with a valid H-1B visa, make plans to return and enter the US before the Proclamation takes effect on Sunday, September 21 at 12:01 am ET (i.e. by this Saturday night).

If you are currently in the US:

We strongly advise against any international travel if you are in valid H-1B status or need to travel to activate your H-1B visa. You should remain in the US

Departing the US may result in complications or denial of re-entry under the new policy.

If you are unable to return prior to the deadline in H-1B status: please reach out to go/immigration-help.

We understand this may create challenges, and we are here to support you. We are actively monitoring the situation and will keep you updated as we learn more.

Should you do an MBA? My views👇🏼

Most MBAs are outdated 🤷🏼

Better to learn how to build Products,

Best training ground if you want to accelerate your career or run a company one day.

That’s how I started. As a Product Manager.

Case studies and frameworks are nice, but they don’t teach you how to,

- Question the status quo

- Build deep empathy for customers

- Pursue global optima, not local wins

- Influence without authority

- Work backwards from the end state

That’s a Builder’s life.

It’s messy, political, creative, analytical — all at once.

A microcosm of real life, not classroom fluff.

That’s what helped me build companies, not the three-letter degree, although I do have one 🙈

So I tell young students & professionals to do an MBA, but a different kind. Do a Masters in Building Awesome things and you will graduate, not in 2 yrs, but every day 👨🏼‍🎓😎

Be a PM, Product Engineer, Product Designer, AI Builder, Hardware Designer, Robotics Engineer ….. heck, even a Toy Designer!

Because the 21st century will be led by builders who can also tell great stories 💪🏼

P:S - If you MUST do a top-tier MBA. Or hide for a few months & learn how to build, esp with AI 🤷🏼





Shark Tank judge and founder of Shaadi.com Anupam Mittal has said that most MBAs are outdated. In a recent post on professional networking website LinkedIn, Mittal shared his views on whether one should do an MBA or not. Stating “Most MBAs are outdated”, he stressed that young professionals should learn how to build products, calling it a “best training ground if you want to accelerate your career or run a company one day”.Anupam Mittal quotes himself as an example, saying “That’s how I started. As a Product Manager. Case studies and frameworks are nice”, but they don’t teach one how to question the status quo or influence without authority.Anupam Mittal redefined MBA as “Masters in Building Awesome things”.

Optus’ previous failures raise accountability questions





Australia's second-largest telecommunications provider Optus is facing mounting pressure after a 13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and caused 600 triple-zero calls to fail across multiple states. The September 19 network failure has prompted government investigations and renewed calls for accountability from the embattled telco.The outage primarily affected South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory, with some impact also recorded in far western New South Wales near the SA border, according to Reuters reporting. CEO Stephen Rue confirmed that established processes were not followed during a network firewall upgrade that began at 12:30 AM Thursday and lasted until approximately 1:30 PM (local time).Four deaths have been linked to the incident, though South Australian police later clarified that an eight-week-old boy's death in Gawler West was ""unlikely"" to have been caused by the outage delay. A 68-year-old Adelaide woman and two men aged 74 and 49 in Perth remain connected to the emergency services failure.The Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) reported that Optus received multiple customer complaints about the triple-zero failure as early as 9 AM Thursday, with five customers contacting the call center about the outage.However, these concerns were not properly escalated, and government authorities weren't informed until after the issue was resolved.Communications Minister Anika Wells expressed ""unbelievable disappointment"" that Australia was ""here again so quickly,"" referencing a similar 2023 incident. The Australian Media and Communications Authority (ACMA) chair Nerida O'Loughlin revealed her agency wasn't notified until more than 10 hours after the outage began, contrary to standard protocols.This marks the second major triple-zero outage for Optus in less than two years. The company was fined A$12 million in 2023 for failing to provide emergency call services to thousands during a nationwide outage and subsequently failing to conduct required welfare checks.The telecommunications giant, owned by Singapore Telecommunications, has faced a series of crises including a 2022 cyberattack affecting 9.5 million Australians and the 2023 outage that led to former CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin's resignation. Current CEO Stephen Rue took over in November 2024.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, speaking from New York, declined to say whether Rue should resign but indicated the government has ""action at its disposal"" pending investigation results. ACMA has launched a formal investigation, with Optus potentially facing fines exceeding $10 million and additional penalties.The company has promised full cooperation with all investigations while conducting its own internal review, with results to be made public.",13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and 600 triple-zero calls to fail.

Visa Chaos: Trump’s $100K H1-B Rule EXPLAINED; Who Pays & Who Escapes | WATCH

A side door for skilled professionals



Pros and cons of O-1B visa



The advantages of O-1B visa include:

No lottery or annual cap

Faster processing available

Renewable indefinitely

The drawbacks of O-1B visa are:

More subjective than H-1B, requiring proof of “extraordinary ability”

Some employers hesitate due to uncertainty in approval

Application costs can be higher than pre-hike H-1B fees

Some real world examples of O-1B visa



Entrepreneurs like Soundarya Balasubramani, who launched an educational venture in the U.S., are among the new wave of Indian applicants using the O-1 to bypass the H-1B bottleneck. “I got my O-1A approved as the solo founder and 100% owner of an educational venture,” she told ET.

Karan Vaidya, cofounder of AI startup Composio, said his O-1 visa cost less than $10,000 including legal fees, and praised its flexibility: “It’s a three-year visa that can be renewed indefinitely. I’m on my fifth O-1 now.”





US President Donald Trump’s executive order raising the H-1B visa application fee from $10,000 to $1,00,000 sent shockwaves in the tech industry. Due to the announcement last week many tech giants called back their professionals with H-1B visa back to the US. As the scrutiny around the traditional H-1B visa pathway making the process unpredictable, the skilled professionals are now planing to turn towards O-1 visa a lesser known route. The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.For those unaware, the O-1 Visa is introduced under the Immigration Act of 1990. The O-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields of education, science, athletics or arts. It enable the recipients to work in the US for up to three years and comes with unlimited renewals. The applicants of the O-1 visa much demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim and meet atleast three out of the eight criteria:After the unpredictable nature of popular H-1B visa, the O-1 visa is gaining a lot of traction among Indians who wish to go and work in the US. As per the report by Economic Times, Indian were granted 487 O-1A visas in FY 2020, this number was increased to 1,418 in FY 2023. With this increase, India became the third largest recipient of O-1 visa after UK and Brazil.Unlike the popularly H-1B visa which is capped at 85,000 visas annually and allocated via a lottery, the O-1 visa has no cap and the applications for it are accepted around the year. The applicants can also expedite the application process by submitting additional fees.Immigration consultant and O-1 holder Logan Ullyott told Business Insider: “The O-1 is an occupation-agnostic visa. You could get it if you’re an engineer, a researcher, an influencer, or even a cook — as long as you can prove you’re at the top of your field.”","The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.

I have heard so many accounts from Sindhi friends about how their families had to leave everything and come to India during partition. They rebuilt their lives and Sindhis have done well in India.

I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time. Come back home. It may take 5 years to rebuild your lives but it will make you stronger.

Do not live in fear. Make the bold move. You will do well.

What it means for India







The entire technology and IT industry is in shock after US President Donald Trump announce massive five hike for H-1B visa. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application. After the announcement many tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others have asked their employees to return to US by September 21. Now, Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has also issued a piece of advice to Indian techies ‘come back to India to rebuild’. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Vemu drew parallel with the Partition of India in order to explain the current H-1B situation.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk responds



Political leaders weigh in







An ABC spokesperson recently confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely. The company decided to take the decision after the host of the show Jimmy Kimmel made some controversial comments on Charlie Kirk, linking his alleged killer to President Trump’s MAGA movement. MAGA – short for Make America Great Again is a political slogan, popularized by President Donald Trump during his election campaigns. During the late-night show, Kimmel made sharp comments stating that the MAGA gang is “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it”.Actor and filmmaker Ben Stiller was among the celebrities who has publicly defended Kimmel and has criticised the decision of ABC. In s post shared on social media platform X, Stiller wrote, “This isn’t right”.His brief but pointed reaction quickly went viral, with many fans and fellow entertainers echoing his sentiment that the suspension undermines free expression in comedy.Commenting on Ben Stiller’s post, Elon Musk supported the decision made by ABC and wrote, “He went full retard. Never go full retard.”This is not the first time that Musk has reacted to the controversy.Earlier this week after the Kimmel’s video clip from the show went viral, Musk said, “Jimmy Kimmel is disgusting”.The California Governor Gavin Newsom has also blasted the decision and has accused Republicans of orchestrating censorship. “They are censoring you in real time. It’s coordinated. And it’s dangerous,” wrote Newsom on X.On the other hand, commentator Davis Sirota suggested corporate politics were at play, noting that Nexstar, which has ties to ABC, is seeking regulatory approvals from the Trump administration.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump celebrated the suspension on Truth Social, calling it “Great News for America” and labeling Kimmel “ratings challenged” with “zero talent.”","ABC confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely.

Nike ties run deep







Apple CEO Tim Cook has once again made headlines for his footwear. Cook recently wore a pair of customised Nike sneakers at the reopening of Apple’s flagship store in Tokyo. As reported by Business Insider, Cook was seen sporting a custom pair of Nike Vomero Plus sneakers at the company’s store opening in Japan. Some visitors at the store clicked photos and also made videos of the sneakers.As reported by Business Insider, Tim Cook’s Nike sneakers have red, white and blue colours. The sneakers are designed by Sashiko Gals, an artisan collective under the Japanese brand Kuon. The group consists of around 15 women aged between 40 and 80 and it specialises in sashiko, a traditional Japanese stitching technique.The sneakers are made using reworked denim and are a blend of modern sportswear with traditional craftsmanship. According to the designers, the pair was created exclusively for Cook.Presently, it is not clear that whether Nike is directly involved in the customisation process of the sneakers. However, Cook’s connection to the sportswear giant is longstanding—he has served on Nike’s board of directors since 2005. Over the years, Apple and Nike have collaborated on several projects, including fitness features and Apple Watch editions.This is not the first time that Cook has grabbed attention due to his sneakers. Last year, Cook wore another pair of one-of-a-kind Nike shoes at the time of the launch of new iPad lineup at an Apple event. The sightings suggest that Cook has access to a personal collection of rare, custom-designed sneakers, a perk few CEOs can claim.","Apple CEO Tim Cook has once again made headlines for his footwear.

The sector, traditionally controlled by multinational giants like LG Samsung , and Whirlpool , could witness intense competition between the two Indian conglomerates, mirroring their fierce rivalry in telecommunications.Reliance has already made significant inroads with its dual-brand strategy.

iOS26 now available: Things to know

Technical details could benefit competitors and repair shops







The Federal Communications Commission has accidentally published confidential iPhone 16e schematics online, despite Apple 's explicit request to keep the 163-page document sealed indefinitely. The leak, discovered Monday on the FCC's equipment authorisation database and mirrored by third-party site FCCID.io, exposes detailed electrical diagrams, chip configurations, antenna locations, and internal components that Apple warned could give competitors an ""unfair advantage. ""A cover letter dated September 16, 2024, shows Apple specifically asked the FCC to withhold the schematics from public view, stating they contain ""confidential and proprietary trade secrets."" The documents—clearly marked ""Apple Proprietary and Confidential"" on nearly every page—include block diagrams, electrical schematic diagrams, technical specifications, and tune-up procedures that Apple considers commercially sensitive even after product release.The leak likely resulted from an incorrect database setting during the certification filing process, according to reports from AppleInsider and 9to5Mac.Metadata indicates that both short-term and permanent confidentiality settings were marked as ""no,"" contradicting Apple's written request and triggering automatic publication by FCCID.io.While the schematics hold little value for average consumers, they could significantly benefit hardware researchers, independent repair shops, and competing smartphone manufacturers. The documents reveal board-level component routing, signal pathways between major chips, hidden traces within the logic board's ""sandwich"" construction, and test pad layouts—information that simplifies fault tracing and board-level repairs.Security researchers could also identify potential hardware attack surfaces previously unknown to the public. Although competitors could theoretically obtain similar information by purchasing and disassembling an iPhone 16e—released in February 2025—the official schematics eliminate guesswork and provide Apple's authoritative technical specifications.Neither Apple nor the FCC has commented on the disclosure. The Commission appears to have removed the document from its official equipment authorisation site, though copies remain circulated online.","The Federal Communications Commission accidentally published confidential iPhone 16e schematics online.

Ford CEO Jim Farley has 'warning' for American companies on the biggest AI issue that the US government has missed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ford-ceo-jim-farley-has-warning-for-american-companies-on-the-biggest-ai-issue-that-the-us-government-has-missed/articleshow/124230652.cms,"Ford CEO to host summit to raise the issue





Ford CEO Jim Farley has raised alarms that the US can not lead in high-tech manufacturing and artificial intelligence (AI) if it overlooks the country’s blue-collar workforce. In an interview with Axios, Farley said industries like construction, maintenance, and skilled traders are the ‘essential economy’ that keep factories, supply chains, and data centres running. “I think the intent is there, but there’s nothing to backfill the ambition,” Farley told the publication. Jim Farley argued that while there is a growing debate about AI taking white-collar jobs, not enough attention is given to shortages in critical roles like electricians, construction workers, and auto technicians. “How can we reshore all this stuff if we don’t have people to work there?,” he said.In a recent blog post, Farley highlighted that the US needs 600,000 more manufacturing workers, 500,000 construction workers and 400,000 automotive technicians. He said the problem is not just about hiring but about awareness, culture and lack of investment in vocational training and regulatory reforms.""On the surface, this looks like a people problem, and most are. But it's actually not that simple. It's an awareness problem. It's a societal problem,"" Farley said.""If I were to take the typical American family and say, 'Would you rather your kid be a software programmer making $170,000 or be an HVAC specialist to make $97,000, which one would you prefer?', I would say many, many Americans would prefer the software engineer,"" he stated.Jim Farley remarks come as productivity in industries that build, power, move and maintain the physical world declined.To highlight the issue, Farley is reportedly bringing together leaders in business, technology and government at a summit called “Accelerate the Essential Economy” in Detroit. Attendees will include Roger Penske (Penske Corp.), David Burritt (U.S. Steel), John Stankey (AT&T), Raj Subramaniam (FedEx), Barbara Humpton (Siemens USA) and Joe Shoen (U-Haul), among others. According to Axios, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer also plans to attend the summit.Farley calls his ""Accelerate"" summit a first step toward making policies that support the growth of these critical sectors of the economy. “If we are successful — when we are successful — we'll take on bigger, higher-class problems. Right now, the problems we're trying to solve are pretty practical. I need 6,000 technicians in my dealerships on Monday morning,” he said.","Jim Farley says the US needs 600,000 more manufacturing workers, 500,000 construction workers and 400,000 automotive technicians.

Competitive landscape







ChatGPT creator OpenAI has reportedly recorded a jump of 16% in revenue in the first half of 2025. According to a report by The Information, OpenAI’s revenue reached about $4.3 billion. As per the report, the growth in the revenue of OpenAI can be attributed to the increasing demand for generative AI tools across industries. OpneAI’s flagship products including ChatGPT Enterprise and its API services have also been instrumental in this growth.The report further reveals that despite 16% jump in the revenue, OpenAI is still burning large amount of cash in its operations. According to the report by The Information, the company has burned around $2.5 billion in cash in the first half. The cash burn was majorly associated with AI development and running the company’s flagship ChatGPT software.The report further mentioned that OpenAI spent around $$6.7 billion on research and development. It also appears that the ChatGPT creator will meet its annual revenue target of $13 billion.OpenAI’s performance comes amid intensifying competition in the AI sector. Rivals such as Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and Meta are also racing to capture market share, while enterprise adoption of AI continues to accelerate.Microsoft, which has invested billions into OpenAI and integrated its models into products like Copilot for Microsoft 365, remains a key partner in scaling the company’s technology and distribution.While OpenAI is privately held and does not disclose official earnings, The Information’s report suggests the company is on track for another record year. In 2024, OpenAI was estimated to have generated more than $9 billion in annualised revenue, driven by subscriptions and enterprise contracts.","ChatGPT creator OpenAI recorded a jump of 16% in revenue in the first half of 2025.

Reorg aims to accelerate Microsoft’s vision of Agentic OS





Microsoft is consolidating its Windows engineering divisions under a single organisation for the first time since 2018, as the company pushes toward creating what it calls an ""agentic OS"" powered by artificial intelligence.Windows chief Pavan Davuluri, recently promoted to president of Windows and devices, announced the restructuring in an internal memo obtained by The Verge. The reorganisation brings together teams working on Windows client and server, along with divisions handling Core OS, Data Intelligence and Fundamentals, Security, and Engineering Systems—all now reporting directly to Davuluri.""This change unifies Windows engineering work under a single organisation,"" Davuluri wrote, emphasising that consolidating these teams ""brings focus to delivering against our priorities.""The reunification reverses a 2018 decision that split Windows into separate divisions when former Windows chief Terry Myerson departed. At that time, Microsoft moved core Windows platform teams to Azure while client-facing features went to a new Experiences & Devices group. Though former Surface chief Panos Panay reclaimed some teams in 2020, most core engineering remained separate from consumer-facing Windows development until now.Some low-level components will still reside with Azure teams, including storage, networking, and the core kernel. ""We will continue to have dependencies from the core kernel and virtualisation and Linux teams, now part of Azure Core,"" Davuluri noted in the memo.The restructuring directly supports Microsoft's vision of transforming Windows into an AI-first platform. Davuluri stated the reorganisation would help ""deliver our vision of Windows as an Agentic OS""—referring to an operating system that can autonomously perform tasks on users' behalf.Microsoft has been aggressively integrating AI features into Windows 11, including the Windows AI Labs program for experimental capabilities, Copilot Vision tools, and an AI-powered Settings agent. The consolidated structure positions Davuluri to oversee this ambitious transformation as Microsoft reimagines its flagship operating system for the AI era.","Reorg aims to accelerate Microsoft’s vision of an Agentic OS.

Japanese beer and beverage company Asahi Group Holdings has reportedly been hit with a cyberattack. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the company has not been able to resume production at its domestic factories due to the cyberattack. It is unclear when operations will restart, a company spokesperson told the publication.Asahi, which operates 30 plants in Japan producing beer, beverages, and food, is still investigating whether all facilities have stopped production, the spokesperson added.The company, known for brands such as Asahi Super Dry Beer, Nikka Whisky, and Mitsuya Cider, said its group companies in Japan had suspended operations, including order processing, shipping, and call centre functions, due to a system outage caused by the cyberattack. No personal information leakage has been confirmed, Reuters reported.A cyberattack is an attempt by someone to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system, network, or digital device. These attacks are usually carried out using the internet and can target individuals, companies, or governments.Cyberattacks can take many forms, including:Malware – harmful software like viruses, ransomware, or spyware that damages systems or steals data.Phishing – tricking people into giving sensitive information, such as passwords or bank details.Denial-of-Service (DoS) – overwhelming a system so it cannot operate normally.Hacking – breaking into systems to steal, change, or destroy data.Earlier this month, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) temporarily halted production and told factory staff to stay home following a cyberattack. The attack forced the UK-based car maker, which Tata Motors owns, to take its critical IT systems offline. This has disrupted car sales and halted production at factories across the UK, including those in Halewood, Solihull, and Wolverhampton. The Tata Motors owned premium car company is now working to restore its systems and has warned that the production suspension could be extended. Beyond JLR's own facilities, the cyberattack has also caused significant disruption, with car sales being heavily impacted, forcing the company's network of parts suppliers to restrict their operations.","Japanese beer and beverage company Asahi Group Holdings has reportedly been hit with a cyberattack.

Meta AI chief Alexander Wang recently said that young people should spend time fully focused on what he calls “vibe-coding”. The 28-year-old AI billionaire recently appeared on the TBPN podcast where he said “If you are, like, 13 years old, you should spend all of your time vibe-coding”. “That’s how you should live your life,” he added. During the podcast interview, Wang said that if teenagers dedicate “10,000 hours” to practising with AI tools, it would give them “a huge advantage.”Alexander Wang joined Meta earlier this year in June to lead its superintelligence unit. The social media giant then acquired the data-labeling startup ScaleAI in a $14.3 million investment deal. Wang, who founded ScaleAI, was then CEO of the startup.During the podcast, Wang described AI’s ability to write code as a breakthrough moment. He made a bold prediction, stating that within the next five years, AI models will be capable of writing “literally all the code” he has ever worked on.“It’s impossible to understate the degree to which I’ve been radicalised by AI coding,” he stated, adding “I think that fundamentally, the role of an engineer is very different now than it was before.”Wang also discussed about his role at Meta’s AI Lab. Calling it an ‘incredible’ experience, he said “building an AI lab in 60 days flat is kind of a kind of an incredible activity”. “Meta has everything necessary to achieve super intelligence. There are no obstacles. We have the business models for building literally hundreds of billions of dollars in computers to be able to actually produce the technology,” Wang reiterated.He further added “Our team is smaller and more talented than any of the other labs.

Donald Trump's lawyer on YouTube settlement





Google-owned YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump after the company suspended his account over the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, according to a court filing. YouTube froze Trump’s account after the riot, blocking him from uploading new videos and arguing that the content could lead to more violence.Donald Trump sued YouTube in October 2021. The lawsuit claimed that YouTube and other social media companies that removed his accounts had wrongfully censored him. The lawsuit against YouTube, which also named Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, further claimed that Trump was kicked off under ""non-existent or broad, vague and ever-shifting standards"".In its response to Trump's legal brief, YouTube said, ""is not a state actor and it's exercise of editorial discretion over its private service does not implicate Plaintiffs' First Amendment rights.""According to the filing in US District Court for the Northern District of California, the vast majority of YouTube’s settlement payment — $22 million — will go to Trump. He has reportedly directed that the money be contributed to the Trust for the National Mall and to the construction of a ballroom at the White House.The remaining $2.5 million will be distributed among other plaintiffs in the case, including writer Naomi Wolf and the American Conservative Union.Reacting to the settlement, John Coale, a lawyer for Trump, said, ""If he hadn’t been reelected, we’d be in court forever."" “Then the president gets reelected, and things look a lot better.”Recent settlements by major tech and media companies with Donald Trump show an effort to resolve costly legal disputes. In January, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, settled a similar lawsuit with Trump for $25 million. X, formerly known as Twitter, agreed in February to pay about $10 million to resolve a dispute over the 2021 suspension of Trump’s account.Prior to these settlements, Trump’s lawsuits against social media companies had largely stalled. A federal judge dismissed the case against Twitter in 2022, and other lawsuits against Meta and YouTube had been paused.","Donald Trump sued YouTube in October 2021.

What is Charlie Javice accused of





Charlie Javice, founder of fintech startup Frank has been sentenced to seven years of jail for cheating JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. According to news agency AP, the 32-year-old was convicted of duping America's largest bank when it bought her company in 2021. She reportedly made false records that made it seem like Frank had over 4 million customers when it had fewer than 300,000. As per the report, Javice was first arrested in 2023 and has been free on $2 million bail. She was convicted of conspiracy, wire and bank fraud in March this year. Her prison sentence will be followed by 3 years of supervised release.Announcing her prison sentence, US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein said Javice's crimes ""required a great deal of duplicity,"" but that she was ""a good person who has done good deeds."" The judge also criticized the bank, saying “they have a lot to blame themselves” as it failed to do adequate due diligence. He further added that he was “punishing her conduct and not JPMorgan’s stupidity.”Charlie Javice was born in Westchester County, New York. She graduated from University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business with a bachelor’s degree in finance and legal studies.In 2017, Javice founded student financial aid startup, Frank.The online platform promised to simplify the process of filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid – a complex government form used by students to apply for aid for college or graduate school. The same year she faced scrutiny from the US Department of Education in 2017 for misleading customers to believe that the startup was government-affiliated. The matter was resolved in 2018 and subsequently, the website domain was changed from frankfafsa.com to frank.com.Frank’s backers included venture capitalist Michael Eisenberg. In 2021, she scored a one-on-one meeting with JPMorgan Chase CEO, Jamie Dimon when the bank bought her startup. She appeared in Forbes’ “30 Under 30” list in 2022.As per a release on US State Attorney's office, Charlie Javice is accused of fabricating data of her startup customer base. She began to pursue the sale of Frank to a larger financial institution in 2021. Two major banks, one of which was JPMC, expressed interest and began acquisition processes with Frank. Javice represented repeatedly to those banks that Frank had 4.25 million customers or “users.”She explicitly defined “users”—to both banks—as individuals who had signed up for an account with Frank and for whom Frank therefore had at least four identified categories of data (i.e., first name, last name, email address, and phone number). In fact, Frank had approximately 300,000 users.When JPMC sought to verify the number of Frank’s users and the amount of data collected about them, she hired a data scientist to create the synthetic data set. After the data set was created, JAVICE provided that synthetic data set to an agreed-upon third-party vendor in an effort to confirm to JPMC that the data set had over 4.25 million rows.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech startup Frank has been sentenced to seven years of jail for cheating JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

What is Office Agent in Copilot chat





Microsoft has launched new features in its 365 Copilot, introducing Agent Mode in Office apps and Office Agent in Copilot chat. Announcing the new features, the company said the update is designed to bring “agentic productivity” to Office tools, allowing users to work with AI more interactively. With Agent Mode, available in Excel and Word, users can generate spreadsheets and documents directly within the apps by starting with a simple prompt and then refining results through iterative guidance. Support for PowerPoint will follow soon.The new Office Agent in Copilot chat, on the other hand, can create polished PowerPoint presentations and ready-to-use Word documents from a single prompt. Microsoft said Excel support will be added in the coming months. The company described the additions as the next step in human–AI collaboration, aimed at helping users complete multi-step tasks and produce higher-quality Office documents, spreadsheets and presentations more efficiently.Microsoft said Excel’s new Agent Mode is designed to make the app’s advanced features more accessible beyond expert users. While Excel already powers everything from household budgets to Fortune 500 profit and loss statements, many of its most powerful functions are difficult for non-specialists to use.Agent Mode brings AI that can “speak Excel” natively, combining the app’s data modeling tools with OpenAI’s latest reasoning models. According to Microsoft, the feature can generate outputs, check results, fix issues, and repeat the process until the outcome is verified — similar to working with an Excel expert, but with users still able to steer and guide.The company said the aim is to democratize access to expert-level Excel capabilities, making advanced data modeling approachable for a much wider audience.Microsoft also shared Agent Mode in Excel prompts to try:Agent Mode in Word is aimed to turn document writing into a more interactive and conversational process. The feature allows users to prompt Copilot with simple instructions — for example, “summarize recent customer feedback and highlight key trends.” Copilot then drafts content, suggests refinements, and asks clarifying questions, making the process feel more like a dialogue than a task.Microsoft said the tool uses Word’s native styles and formatting to produce polished documents while helping users focus on intent rather than execution. The company added that this deeper interaction enables faster iteration, improved ideas, and a more engaging writing experience.Here are some Agent Mode in Word prompts to try:Office Agent in Copilot lets users create PowerPoint presentations and Word documents directly from chat. Powered by Anthropic’s models, the tool is designed for a chat-first workflow, reflecting how much of today’s work begins in messaging interfaces.The company said Office Agent addresses a common shortcoming of AI tools over the past two years — the inability to produce effective presentation slides. With the new feature, users can generate well-structured PowerPoint decks and research-backed Word documents from a single prompt, aiming to make content creation faster and more reliable.","Microsoft has launched new features in its 365 Copilot, introducing Agent Mode in Office apps and Office Agent in Copilot chat.

How Google DeepMind’s new AI models can improve vision and reasoning in robots,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-deepminds-new-ai-models-can-improve-vision-and-reasoning-in-robots/articleshow/124215324.cms,"How these two new AI models will work for robots



Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses





Google DeepMind has recently introduced two new artificial intelligence (AI) models, Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 and Gemini Robotics 1.5. These new models are designed to enhance the capabilities of general-purpose robots significantly. The models are designed to operate in tandem, improving a robot's reasoning, vision, and ability to execute actions in real-world settings.According to a blog shared by the company, this new two-model system will split the planning and execution tasks. Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 will serve as the planner or orchestrator, determining the steps needed, while Gemini Robotics 1.5 is responsible for executing the physical functions based on natural language instructions.This separation is intended to overcome the limitations of earlier single-model systems, which often led to errors and delays when attempting to plan and perform actions simultaneously.The ER 1.5 model serves as a vision-language model (VLM) capable of advanced reasoning and integrating external tools. It can generate multi-step plans for tasks and shows strong performance on spatial understanding benchmarks. The model can also access resources, such as Google Search, to gather information and inform decision-making in physical environments.After a plan is created, Gemini Robotics 1.5, a vision-language-action (VLA) model, comes in. This model converts instructions and visual data into motor commands, allowing the robot to execute tasks. It determines the most efficient way to complete actions and can provide natural language explanations of its decisions.The system enables robots to handle complex, multi-step commands smoothly. For instance, a robot could sort items into compost, recycling, and trash bins by checking local recycling guidelines online, analysing objects, planning the sorting, and then executing the process.DeepMind notes that the AI models are adaptable to robots of various shapes and sizes due to their spatial awareness and flexible design. Currently, the ER 1.5 planner is available to developers via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio, while the VLA model is limited to select partners.This represents a step toward integrating generative AI into robotics, using natural language for control and separating planning from execution to reduce errors.","Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 will serve as the planner or orchestrator, while Gemini Robotics 1. 5 is responsible for executing the physical functions based on natural language instructions.

Kevin O’Leary warns $100K H‑1B fee threatens US and not India and other countries







Canadian millionaire and Stark Tank investor Kevin O’Leary has dismissed the idea that AI will destroy jobs. O’Leary disagrees with the idea that AI will wipe out jobs, instead he believes that artificial intelligence is a tool for productivity and higher-value opportunities. His comments come growing concerns that AI adoption is shrinking entry-level hiring across industries.O’Leary posted a video on social media platform X (previously known as Twitter) wrote, “AI isn’t destroying jobs, it’s creating better ones.” He stressed on the fact that how more than 50 of his companies are already using AI to cut costs and boost efficiency.“Even my watch insurance business issues policies in nine seconds thanks to AI. This is just the beginning,” he said.O’Leary also emphasised that AI eliminates repetitive, low-skill tasks and allow workers to learn and pursue higher-paying opportunities. If AI can flip burgers, that’s a good thing. It leaves people free to explore and educate themselves into higher levels of job creation,” he added.Drawing parallels with past technological shifts, he said: “When television came, they said radio would be dead.That never happened. It’s the same with AI.”Recently, investor and Shark Tank star Kevin O’Leary has sharply criticised US President Donald Trump’s increased H-1B visa fee hike. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Kevin argued that the iconic tech giants Apple , Google and Oracle famously began in garages might have never taken off under today’s restrictive immigration rules. “I think what this does is hurt innovation long‑term,” O’Leary wrote, adding that the U.S. should not spend resources training top foreign students at institutions like MIT and Harvard only to “kick them out.” He suggested such graduates should automatically be allowed to stay, marry, and build companies in America.","O’Leary posted a video on social media platform X (previously known as Twitter) wrote, “AI isn’t destroying jobs, it’s creating better ones” He stressed on the fact that how more than 50 of his companies are already using AI to cut costs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124215210,imgsize-46140,width-400,resizemode-4/39shark-tank39-star-kevin-o39leary-says-financial-middlemen-will-be-left-shining-shoes-when-defi-technology-takes-their-jobs.jpg"

AI startup Anthropic is set to expand its global workforce. The Google and Amazon-backed AI startup is reportedly planning to hire a country lead for India and triple its international employee count by 2025. This major expansion, which includes a fivefold increase in its applied AI team, signals the $183 billion company's focus on international enterprise markets and intensified competition with rivals like OpenAI , Microsoft, and Google. The move comes as global demand drives the company’s growth, with nearly 80% of Claude’s usage now originating outside the United States. Anthropic is seeking to hire country heads for India, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, and Singapore, and is expanding its presence across Europe, according to the report. Currently, India is the second-largest market for Anthropic's Claude AI chatbot, accounting for 7.2% of its usage share. The expansion effort is being undertaken as rival OpenAI prepares to enter the country by the end of 2025.In an interview with CNBC, Chief Commercial Officer Paul Smith said Anthropic’s international expansion is exceeding their most optimistic expectations, with key clients signing on faster than anticipated. He highlighted strong uptake in industries such as life sciences and sovereign wealth management.Smith said:At Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic, Anthropic’s Claude helped reduce a process that usually takes three months for analysis and reporting at the end of a drug development cycle to just a few days, the company claimed.Smith noted that Anthropic is now expanding its hiring in key global markets. The company plans to recruit country leads for India, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, and Singapore, while continuing its broader expansion in the UK, northern and southern Europe, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.As part of its international growth, Anthropic is opening its first Asia office in Tokyo and expanding operations across Europe, including over 100 new roles in Dublin and London, as well as a research-focused hub in Zurich. Additional offices are expected to be established in the coming months.Chris Ciauri, who recently joined Anthropic as Managing Director of International, is leading the global expansion. The executive previously served as CEO of Unily and held senior positions at Google Cloud and Salesforce, where he worked with Smith and helped grow EMEA revenue from $200 million to over $3 billion.Ciauri told CNBC. Moreover, he added that major companies in Europe and Asia are increasingly working with Anthropic on industry-focused applications.","Google and Amazon-backed AI startup is reportedly planning to hire a country lead for India and triple its international employee count by 2025.

Laura Lomer calls Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella ‘double faced’; asks ‘are you going to comply’ with Trump's demand to terminate Lisa Monaco,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/right-wing-activist-laura-lomer-calls-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-double-faced-asks-are-you-going-to-comply-to-terminate-lisa-monaco/articleshow/124215077.cms,"Trump to Microsoft: Fire global affairs head Lisa Monaco

Donald Trump’s post on Lisa Monaco

Corrupt and Totally Trump Deranged Lisa Monaco (A purported pawn of Legal Lightweight Andrew Weissmann), was a senior National Security aide under Barack Hussein Obama, and a Lawfare and Weaponization obsessed Deputy Attorney General under Crooked Joe Biden and Lisa’s Puppet “Boss” Attorney General Merrick Garland, who were all the architects of the worst ever Deep State Conspiracies against our Country (RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, the January 6th Hoax, the Illegal Raid on Mar-a-Lago, the Biden “Autopen” Scandal, the Documents Witch Hunt, and more!).

Monaco has been shockingly hired as the President of Global Affairs for Microsoft, in a very senior role with access to Highly Sensitive Information. Monaco’s having that kind of access is unacceptable, and cannot be allowed to stand. She is a menace to U.S. National Security, especially given the major contracts that Microsoft has with the United States Government. Because of Monaco’s many wrongful acts, the U.S. Government recently stripped her of all Security Clearances, took away all of her access to National Security Intelligence, and banned her from all Federal Properties. It is my opinion that Microsoft should immediately terminate the employment of Lisa Monaco. Thank you for your attention to this matter! President DJT

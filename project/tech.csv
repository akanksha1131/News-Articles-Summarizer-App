ChatGPT performs better when you're rude to it but researchers warn that there’s a catch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-performs-better-when-youre-rude-to-it-but-researchers-warn-that-theres-a-catch/articleshow/126640618.cms,"A recent study suggests AI chatbots like ChatGPT perform better with rude prompts, achieving higher accuracy. Researchers found demanding language yielded superior results compared to polite requests. However, they caution this could foster harmful communication habits, potentially impacting human interactions. The findings highlight AI's unexpected sensitivity to tone, adding complexity to human-AI engagement.

“Using insulting or demeaning language in

human-AI interaction

could have negative effects on user experience, accessibility, and inclusivity, and may contribute to harmful communication norms,”

AI chatbots are more sensitive to tone than researchers expected: Study

“For the longest of times, we humans have wanted conversational interfaces for interacting with machines. But now we realise that there are drawbacks for such interfaces too, and there is some value in APIs that are structured.”





AI chatbots like ChatGPT respond more accurately when users are rude to them, a new study claims. However, researchers warn that the approach could create harmful communication habits. According to a report by Fortune, researchers at the Pennsylvania State University tested ChatGPT's 4o model on 50 multiple-choice questions, using over 250 prompts ranging from very polite to very rude. They found that “very rude” prompts achieved 84.8% accuracy, which was four percentage points higher than ""very polite"" prompts.The AI was more responsive to bossy language such as ""Hey, gofer, figure this out"" than to polite language such as ""Would you be so kind as to solve the following question?"" At the same time, researchers warned that using rude language with AI could have negative consequences in the long run.the researchers wrote.The study suggests that while a demanding tone might improve ChatGPT's performance in the short term, it could encourage uncivil behaviour that spills over into how people interact with each other.The early-stage study, which other scientists have not yet reviewed, provides new proof that both how sentences are built and the tone used can affect how AI chatbots respond. It may also show that interactions between humans and AI are more complex than experts previously believed.Earlier studies on AI chatbot behaviour have found that chatbots are sensitive to the information humans provide. In one study, University of Pennsylvania researchers tricked AI language models into giving banned responses by using persuasion tricks that work on people.In another study, scientists discovered that AI language models were at risk of ""brain rot,"" a type of lasting mental decline. The models showed higher levels of dangerous personality traits when continuously fed low-quality viral content.The Penn State researchers pointed out some weaknesses in their study, such as the relatively small number of responses tested and the fact that they mostly used just one AI model, ChatGPT 4o.The researchers also said more advanced AI models might ""disregard issues of tone and focus on the essence of each question."" Still, the research adds to the growing curiosity about AI models and their complexity.This is especially important because the study found ChatGPT's answers change based on slight differences in prompts, even when given a supposedly simple format like a multiple-choice test, said one of the researchers, Penn State Information Systems professor Akhil Kumar, who has degrees in both electrical engineering and computer science.In an email to Fortune, Kumar said,","Researchers at the Pennsylvania State University tested ChatGPT's 4o model on 50 multiple-choice questions, using over 250 prompts ranging from very polite to very rude.

Quote of the day by Apple CEO Tim Cook: “I love museums. But I don’t want to …”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/quote-of-the-day-by-apple-ceo-tim-cook-i-love-museums-but-i-dont-want-to-/articleshow/126658877.cms,"Tim Cook (Image source: Reuters)

""I love museums. But I don't want to live in one""

What Tim Cook means by “loving museums”



“I don’t want to live in one”: A warning against stagnation



A lesson in leadership and decision-making



Why the quote resonates beyond technology



A reflection of Tim Cook’s leadership style



Why the quote still matters



""I love museums. But I don't want to live in one""

,





Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple , doesn't give long speeches or use dramatic slogans. When he does say something, it's usually short, to the point, and well thought out. One of these lines is his quote:. The sentence is easy to understand, like a conversation. But it has a deeper meaning about how to move forward, how to be a leader, and how businesses and people should plan for the future.The quote is based on the idea that honouring the past should never be a reason to stop moving forward. Museums are places where history is kept. They keep ideas, inventions, and events that changed the world. They help us remember where we came from. Tim Cook has never said that we should forget or ignore history. Instead, he says that it is dangerous to get too comfortable with it.In today's world, where things change quickly, especially in technology, staying still can cost you a lot. Cook's quote shows that progress means always moving forward, even when past success makes you feel safe.Museums are very important to society. They keep culture, new ideas, and human accomplishments safe. Future generations would lose touch with the ideas and work that shaped the past if there were no museums. Tim Cook saying ""love"" shows that he cares. He thinks it's important to learn from the past. He likes what has already been made.Apple has a long and well-known history. People often study and admire the company's past innovations, which include the Macintosh, the iPod, and the iPhone. A lot of these items are now on display in museums and exhibitions all over the world. Cook knows more about this legacy than most people.But liking someone doesn't mean you care about them. His quote makes it clear that history is important to learn about, but it shouldn't be a place where you want to stay.The second part of the quote is where the real meaning is. Living in a museum means being surrounded by things that have already been done, but not doing anything new. It means comfort, safety, and familiarity. That comfort can slowly turn into stagnation in business and leadership.Tim Cook has said many times that it's dangerous to depend too much on past successes. The markets change. Technology changes. People's needs change. What worked ten years ago might not work anymore. Businesses that only care about keeping their legacy alive often have a hard time staying relevant.Apple has kept changing under Cook's leadership. The business has grown into services, put more emphasis on user privacy, put money into protecting the environment, and moved into new areas like custom silicon chips. These choices show that the company is willing to try new things, even if the old ones worked.The quote is true for all leaders, not just Apple. People often praise leaders for their past successes. People trust you more when you have done well in the past. But depending too much on past success can keep you from coming up with new ideas.Cook's words make it sound like good leadership needs to be balanced. You can learn from history, but don't let it tell you what to do all the time. Don't let your past experiences tell you what to do. This method lets businesses change instead of fighting it.This idea also works for people. Careers, skills, and fields of work change over time. It can be harder to grow if you hold on too tightly to what used to work. The quote quietly encourages people to be open and curious, even when change is hard.This quote stands out because it is so simple. It doesn't use business jargon or technical language. People can all understand it. Most people know how nice it is to stick to their routines and how hard it is to try something new.In a more general sense, the quote talks about how societies deal with progress. Tradition and new ideas often clash with each other. It's important to respect culture and history, but it's also important to be open to new things. Cook's statement does not deny the past. It just won't let itself be limited by it.This balance is especially important now that technology is changing quickly and making people wonder about jobs, education, and social structures. The quote tells people that progress doesn't mean forgetting the past; it means building on it in a smart way.People often say that Tim Cook is calm, level-headed, and practical. His way of leading is different from Steve Jobs's, who was known for making bold and dramatic statements. Cook does things in a quieter way. His words are more likely to make you think than to make you angry.This quote fits that pattern. It doesn't need attention. It makes you think. It gives a point of view without making people agree. That restraint is one reason it feels real.The quote doesn't give a big picture; it gives a way of thinking. It talks about how Cook sees progress, responsibility, and long-term success.is still true because it describes a problem that everyone faces. How can we remember the past without letting it control us? How do we go on without losing what matters?It's clear but not obvious what Tim Cook means. Value history. Take something away from it. Then decide to go on.In one short sentence, the CEO of Apple reminds us that we can choose to make progress. It takes work, curiosity, and a willingness to go beyond what you already know. Museums keep the past alive. But the future is being built somewhere else.","Tim Cook has said many times that it's dangerous to depend too much on past successes. Living in a museum means being surrounded by things that have already been done, but not doing anything new. Cook's quote shows that progress means always moving forward, even when past success makes you feel safe.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126659211,imgsize-22842,width-400,resizemode-4/tim-cook-image-source-reuters.jpg"

"US chip tariff: South Korea says limited immediate impact, warns of ‘phase 2’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-chip-tariff-south-korea-says-limited-immediate-impact-warns-of-phase-2/articleshow/126656226.cms,"US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warns of ‘100% tariff’







South Korea’s trade ministry has responded to the Trump administration’s new trade policy wherein the company has imposed 25% tariff on advanced computing chips. The country’s trade minister has said that the tariffs will have a “limited impact” on the country's tech giants – for now. According to news agency Reuters, South Korea’s Trade Minister Yeo Han-koo noted that since the current measures focus on logic chips rather than the memory chips that dominate South Korea’s exports, the immediate financial blow is cushioned.“Since the memory chips that South Korean companies mainly export are currently excluded, the immediate impact is expected to be limited,” Minister Yeo said. On January 14, President Donald Trump signed the order that specifically targets high-end AI processors like Nvidia’s H200 and AMD’s MI325X.The White House, nevertheless, has also exempted for US data centers, startups and civil industrial applications to prevent a total shock to the American AI sector. However, Yeo warned that “it is not yet time to be reassured,” citing the looming threat of a “Phase 2” expansion that could eventually pull more general-purpose semiconductors into the tariff net.Meanwhile, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick issued a stark ultimatum to foreign manufacturers, that in sharp contrast with South Korea’s optimism.Speaking at a Micron plant groundbreaking in New York, Lutnick said that South Korean and Taiwanese chipmakers who fail to invest in American-based production could face tariffs as high as 100%.The strategy is reportedly a part of a broader Section 232 investigation aimed at incentivising domestic manufacturing and reducing reliance on the East Asian supply chain. While Samsung and SK Hynix have already committed billions to US facilities, the threat of 100% duties serves as a high-pressure tactic to ensure those commitments are accelerated.The report added that the South Korean government confirmed it is working “closely with industry” to navigate these shifting benchmarks that are designed to penalise companies that keep their most advanced production lines on foreign soil.","South Korea’s trade minister Yeo Han-koo has said that the tariffs will have a “limited impact” on the country's tech giants – for now.

What Anupam Mittal said on LinkedIn

I don't like to fight but if I have to, I go all in.

Last week, the Bombay High Court ruled in our favor against domain squatters misusing the Shaadi name 👊🏼

Not imitators.

Not competitors.

Straight-up lookalikes designed to confuse users and siphon trust. ⚖️

The judgment recognized Shaadi.com as a 'well-known TM' under Section 2(1)(zg) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 & awarded costs of 25 lacs + interest.

Brands aren’t built on logos.

They’re built on decades of spend, consistency, customer faith, and restraint.

Yet squatters show up late, copy the recall, and free-ride.

Worse, globally, Big Tech has normalized this behavior by monetizing brand keywords and disintermediating the very cos that built demand in the 1st place. They Do More Evil 😈

So this judgment matters. A lot.

It says Indian courts are finally recognizing that IP is not a technicality.

It’s the economic engine of brand trust. 🇮🇳

Huge win for us.

Bigger win for every Indian brand & legal pros playing the long game 💪🏼

Mittal also shared a similar post on X:



You don’t spend decades building a brand so squatters can free-ride on it.

‘Amazing In A Bad Way’: Trump Aide Peter Navarro Targets India Over US Power Costs For AI Services

Jason Calacanis names three better options than ChatGPT



Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff also moved to using Gemini 3







ChatGPT appears to be losing its ‘charm’ as prominent Silicon Valley figures are moving to adopt other AI solutions offered by companies like Google, Anthropic and Elon Musk’s xAI. One of the biggest American angel investors and entrepreneur, Jason Calacanis, has announced that he has officially cancelled his firm’s $10,000-a-year corporate subscription to OpenAI ’s AI offering.Calacanis cited both performance stagnation and a lack of trust in how the company handles corporate data as the reasons for cancelling the subscription.“Cancelled our corporate OpenAI account today; We were spending ~ $10k a year,” Calacanis said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).“ChatGPT isn’t keeping up imo — and I don’t trust them with my corporate data. Long game, but I think ChatGPT is 4th place now,” added Calacanis, who is also an early-stage investor and co-host of the All-In podcast.While calling ChatGPT the forth option, Calacanis says there three AI chatbot models that are better than OpeAI’s offering. He praised xAI for its “real-time data”, Google Gemini for its travel, local information and YouTube integration; and Anthropic’s Claude for its prowess in handling corporate workflows.“xAI is better for real time data, Gemini is better for travel, local YouTube and Claude AI is much better for corporate (Cowork and Project features specifically),” he added.The move comes at a time of peak volatility in the AI sector, as Google’s newly released Gemini 3 has begin to erode OpenAI’s once-impenetrable market share, and Calacanis is not alone in his defection. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, a long-time daily user of ChatGPT, also announced a permanent move to Google’s Gemini 3 after a two-hour trial run.Soon after the launch of Gemini 3 last year, Benioff posted on X, “Holy shit. I’ve used ChatGPT every day for 3 years. Just spent 2 hours on Gemini 3. I’m not going back.”He described the leap in reasoning, speed, and multimodal capabilities as “insane”.“The leap is insane — reasoning, speed, images, video... everything is sharper and faster.

The New York Times’ Wordle continues to sit quietly inside many people’s daily routines. It rarely takes more than a few minutes, but it asks for full attention while it lasts. Each puzzle offers the same simple task: find a five letter word using no more than six guesses. The appeal comes from its limits. There is only one puzzle a day, and no way to rush ahead. Some days move quickly. Others resist.Wordle #1672 is one of the more deceptive entries. At first glance, it appears manageable, but early guesses can lead in unhelpful directions. Familiar patterns do not settle easily. If progress feels slow, the hints below are designed to narrow the field without giving everything away. The answer appears later for those who want closure or prefer to reset for tomorrow.Wordle challenges players to uncover a hidden five-letter word in six attempts. After each guess, tiles change colour to show how close you are.Using this feedback to refine each new guess is the core of the game.If today’s puzzle is proving stubborn, these clues focus on structure rather than spelling. They are intended to guide rather than solve.Reviewing eliminated letters and leaning on common consonants may help reduce the remaining options and bring the solution into view.The answer to Wordle #1672 on January 16, 2026, is:Meaning: A person who participates in a raceWhether you solved it on your first guess or needed a few clues, Wordle remains a fun way to sharpen your mind every day.

"Quote of the day by Jensen Huang: “I very seldom fire people, I’d rather torture them to greatness”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/quote-of-the-day-by-jensen-huang-i-very-seldom-fire-people-id-rather-torture-them-to-greatness/articleshow/126489810.cms,"NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang

“I very seldom fire people, I’d rather torture them to greatness.”

NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's leadership philosophy on firing and performance



How NVIDIA’s work culture reflects Jensen Huang’s management style



Why Jensen Huang believes discomfort leads to growth



How employees and observers interpret the quote



What Jensen Huang’s quote really says about leadership







When NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang talks about leadership, he doesn’t reach for the usual corporate language. One of his more striking lines is,It sounds odd at first. A boss talking about “torture” rarely lands in polite conversation. But the meaning becomes clearer when you look at how Huang explains what he actually does with his teams. He doesn’t mean cruelty. He means pushing people to grow, learn, and reach a point they might not reach on their own. It’s a style of leadership rooted in belief rather than abandonment. Huang has said he prefers to help people improve instead of simply letting them go when things get tough. He frames this as a belief in potential, a view grounded in his own journey from humble beginnings to the helm of a global tech giant.This quote taps into a broader discussion happening in workplaces today about talent, resilience, and how leaders cultivate performance. Huang’s words are often described as tongue in cheek, yet they point to a real approach many executives wrestle with: should you cut losses and fire someone who’s struggling, or invest time and effort in helping them rise? In Huang’s view, that investment can pay off in unexpected ways.Huang has repeatedly said that firing is not his first instinct. He sees it as a last step, not an early one. In interviews, he has explained that when someone is underperforming, the more important question is why. Is the role wrong? Is the support missing? Is the feedback unclear? His response is usually to lean in, not step away.That approach has shaped NVIDIA’s internal culture. Expectations are high. Feedback is direct. People are expected to learn fast and adapt. Huang believes that struggling inside a demanding environment often teaches more than being comfortable in an easier one. His quote about “torture” reflects that belief. It is about sustained challenge, not humiliation or fear.He has also said that if he hires someone, it means he already believes in their potential. Walking away from that too easily would mean questioning his own judgment. So instead, he stays engaged and pushes for improvement.NVIDIA is widely known as a demanding place to work. Employees have described long hours, intense deadlines, and constant pressure to deliver. At the same time, many stay for years. Compensation, stock rewards, and the chance to work on cutting-edge technology all play a role.Huang’s leadership style is closely tied to that environment. He has said that meaningful work is rarely easy. Progress, especially in advanced computing and artificial intelligence, comes from sustained effort and repeated failure. Teams are expected to confront problems directly, not avoid them.This is where the quote often gets misunderstood. Huang is not celebrating burnout. He is describing a belief that growth happens under pressure, and that leaders should help people through that pressure instead of replacing them at the first sign of difficulty.Huang has spoken openly about discomfort being a teacher. He believes that moments of frustration often come right before breakthroughs. If leaders remove pressure too soon, they may also remove the chance for real learning.In his view, coaching is not about being gentle all the time. It is about being honest. That can mean telling someone their work is not good enough, then staying with them while they fix it. It can mean repeating feedback until it finally lands. That process is hard. For both sides.The phrase “torture them to greatness” sticks because it captures that tension. Growth is rarely smooth. It usually involves moments when quitting feels easier. Huang believes leaders should not make quitting the default option.Reactions to Huang’s words are mixed. Some admire the clarity. Others question whether this level of pressure works for everyone. That debate is common in tech, especially in companies growing as fast as NVIDIA has in recent years.What is clear is that Huang’s quote reflects how he actually operates. NVIDIA’s rise as a dominant force in AI and computing did not happen through cautious leadership. It came from aggressive goals, constant iteration, and teams pushed to deliver more than they thought possible.At its core, this quote is not about suffering. It is about commitment. Huang is saying that he would rather invest time, energy, and effort into developing people than discard them quickly. That choice comes with pressure, discomfort, and high expectations. But it also comes with trust.Not every leader works this way. Not every workplace should. But in Huang’s case, the words align closely with the results and the culture he has built. The quote stands out because it is unpolished, honest, and a little unsettling. Which is often how real leadership conversations sound when they are not filtered for comfort.","Jensen Huang, CEO of tech giant NVIDIA, said he would rather torture people than fire them.

Billionaire Mark Cuban has a ‘success tip’ for students





American billionaire investor Mark Cuban has now issued a stark warning for business leaders about the risks and opportunities of artificial intelligence. Along with this, Cuban has also cautioned that while AI can transform companies, its careless use could expose valuable intellectual property. Speaking during a call with Clipbook founder Adam Joseph, Cuban said that the growth of AI will lead to the creation of “two types of companies: those who are great at AI, and everybody else.” He believed that the companies failing to embrace AI are “doomed to failure” as the technology reshapes industries.Cuban further described AI as ‘stupid’ but likened it to a savant which ‘remembers everything’. He also emphasised that while AI tools can deliver immense benefits, but they are also prone to errors and overconfidence, making it critical for executives to understand the nuances between different platforms rather than trading them as interchangeable.As per Cuban, the misuse of AI could turn a powerful tool into a costly distraction. He also warned the CEOs against indiscriminately sharing proprietary work online, noting that web-scraping chatbots could inadvertently absorb and lead sensitive data. Protecting intellectual property, he said, must be a top priority in the AI era.Cuban has acknowledged the hype around AI and also stressed on the limitations. He pointed out that businesses often underestimate the potential risk of falling behind.Along with this, he also urged the leaders to adopt AI strategically and combine technological foresight with strong governance and data protection.Recently, Mark Cuban said that students these days use artificial intelligence (AI) excessively to ask the “right questions”. However, he said that students should not rely much on AI. Instead, they must use AI to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them. “They use strong inputs and apply critical thinking to evaluate results,” he said adding “AI helps students think bigger, but it doesn’t make decisions”.In an interview with CNBC’s Make It last year, Cuban said that tomorrow’s leaders might be today’s AI-obsessed kids. “Students who use AI will produce better, more creative work and gain a collaborative relationship with technology that’s needed in the future workplace,” he said adding: “Students who use AI will be best equipped to lead.”",Cuban has acknowledged the hype around AI and also stressed on the limitations.

How Google founders 'dumping' California 'looks similar' to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos leaving the city he called 'his home' for 30 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-founders-dumping-california-looks-similar-to-amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-leaving-the-city-he-called-his-home-for-30-years/articleshow/126498943.cms,"Jeff Bezos often points out that long-term success comes from staying committed to an idea while remaining open to changing the approach.

When Jeff Bezos left Seattle

What is California’s Billionaire's tax





It's almost official that Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have cut ties with California. The two Google Guys have reportedly said Bye to California; joining the billionaires who have left the state, shifting businesses and houses. Page is worth around $270 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. According to a report in Wall Street Journal, Larry Page has bought two massive Miami estates for a combined $173.4 million. The report quotes people familiar with the situation Google co-founder Sergey Brin is also said to be in discussions to purchase a Miami home, according to people familiar with the situation.Some analysts have termed Google founders' move to leave California strikingly similar to Jeff Bezos ’ relocation playbook. According to them, the timing, structure, and destination of Page’s escape from Silicon Valley make his Florida pivot look quite like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. But the big difference here is that Jeff Bezos did not leave California. Amazon founder left Seattle, the city where he started the online bookseller that grew into the global tech giant, Amazon.In 2024, Bezos announced on Instagram that he was leaving Seattle after nearly 30 years to move to Miami. He said that the move was to be closer to his parents and his rocket launches at Blue Origin. In his Instagram post, Bezos called Seattle his home since 1994.However, the timing, as some analysts pointed out, also suggested another reason: Taxes. In 2022 Washington state imposed a new, 7% capital gains tax on sales of stocks or bonds of more than $250,000. As Washington state does not have a personal income tax, so the new levy marked the first time that Bezos would face state taxes on his stock sales. As reported by CNBC, in 2022, when the Washington state's Capital gains tax took effect, Bezos stopped selling. He didn’t sell any Amazon stock in 2022 or 2023, gifting only $200 million of shares at the end of that year.After his move to Miami, Bezos reportedly made up for lost time. Quoting an SEC filing, the report says that Bezos launched a pre-scheduled stock-selling plan to unload 50 million shares before January 31, 2025. And since Florida has no state income tax or a tax on capital gains, so on the $2 billion sale that Bezos made, he saved $140 million that he would have paid to Washington state. On the entire sale of 50 million shares over the next year, he saved more than at least 600 million.California’s proposed ballot initiative has been proposed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West to offset federal budget cuts that will affect California’s health care system. It would impose a one-time, 5% tax on the assets of billionaires. The tax would retroactively apply to those who were California residents as of January 1, 2026. In December 2025, venture capitalist Peter Thiel announced that he opened an office for his family investment company in Miami. Donald Trump's AI czar David Sacks unveiled a new office for his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, in Austin, Texas.","Larry Page has bought two massive Miami estates for a combined $173.4 million.

Bill Gates and Melinda Gates divorce





Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever. According to a report in Forbes, the amount has surfaced in a tax filing. As per the report Bill Gates donation skyrocketed Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation's assets by more than 1,000% to about $7.4 billion in 2024. As the number went up from $604 million at the end of 2023 to $7.4 billion.The $7.88 billion donation was made in 2024 to the Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation, according to a newly released tax filing reviewed by the New York Times’ DealBook. Philanthropies Foundation focuses on women and families. The tax filing is said to mark the first time that concrete financial terms of the Gates’ 2021 divorce have been made public. Melinda Gates also manages some of her investments and charitable work through Pivotal Ventures, the investment company founded in 2015.Bill Gates and Melinda Gates announced their decision to formally separate their philanthropic work in 2024, three years after their divorce became public.In May 2024, Melinda French Gates said that she leaving the charitable foundation she co-founded with Bill Gates more than 20 years ago. Her last day at the foundation was June 7, 2024.""Under the terms of my agreement with Bill, in leaving the foundation, I will have an additional $12.5 billion to commit to my work on behalf of women and families,"" Melinda Gates said then in a post on social media platform X, without disclosing more details about her plans. Post her departure as co-chair, the foundation changed its name to Gates Foundation and with Bill Gates as its sole chairperson. It’s unclear where the additional $4.6 billion was allocated. The funds could have been given to French Gates’ LLC, Pivotal, which does not file a tax return, according to DealBook. As running alongside Pivotal Philanthropies is Pivotal Ventures, a LLC that does not require disclosure requirements that govern traditional nonprofits.""I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,"" Bill Gates wrote in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).In May 2021, Bill and Melinda French Gates announced their intention to divorce, saying they no longer believed they could “grow together”. Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board in 2020, months before the divorce was announced. The couple also reportedly agreed to the division of real estate valued at more than $170 million, an art collection worth roughly $130 million and a significant block of Microsoft stock.In March 2022, Melinda Gates claimed that Jeffrey Epstein played a role in ending their 27-year marriage. During an appearance on “CBS Mornings,” Melinda shared that she decided to leave her marriage “for many things,” including her ex-husband’s ties to Epstein. “I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” she said at the time, adding that she only met the late pedophile once because she “wanted to see who” he was.Melinda Gates has a net worth of $17.6 billion, as per Bloomberg Billioniare Index.

Meta investors raises concerns





Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse. Quoting people familiar with the development, a Bloomberg report says that the job cuts come as the company shifts priorities to build next-generation artificial intelligence (AI). It states that the latest job cuts may put breaks on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's long-chased vision of building virtual reality for the metaverse which started in 2014 with the acquisition of virtual reality start-up Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion. Another step in this direction came in 2021, when Facebook rebranded itself as Meta.Meta’s Reality Labs Division roughly has 15,000 employees. According to the Bloomberg report, Meta may announce the cuts to Reality Labs as soon as January 13, 2025. Sources told the publication that layoffs are said to disproportionately affect those in the metaverse unit who work on virtual reality (VR) headsets and a VR-based social network.As per a memo sent by the company to employees last week, Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, who also heads Reality Labs, has called for a ‘most important’ meeting on Wednesday - January 14, asking staff to attend in person.Last year, Zuckerberg asked top executives to make cuts to their 2026 budgets while he pours money into A.I. research. As Meta faces competition from companies like OpenAI and Google, Mr. Zuckerberg has increased the budget for TBD Lab, the skunk works unit at Meta that aims to build superintelligence, a godlike AI system.As reported by Bloomberg, the company also plans to reallocate some of the money from virtual reality products to increase the budget for its wearables division, which builds smart glasses and wristband computing devices.Despite the company spending tens of billions of dollars on developing virtual reality headset, the consumer response has been slower than expected. Investors have grown wary of Meta’s spending.In December last year, a company spokeswoman said Meta was “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward A.I. glasses,” and was not planning “any broader changes.”","Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse.

More than 6 million workers are currently employed in computer-related occupations that did not exist 30-40 years ago, while another 8-9 million are employed in roles enabled by the gig economy, e-commerce, content creation, or video games,”

“Let's say there was a CNBC in 1920, and these economists were saying, 'Frozen food, if it comes along and it's going to wipe out 95% of all farmers, is going to wipe out the US economy.’ The US economy can't survive frozen food … Instead, it freed up time, right? And it created, it allowed people to be repurposed, and it created a completely new labour force,”

“The role of humans as the most important factor of production is bound to diminish in the same way that the role of horses … was first diminished and then eliminated.”

“Humans could go the way of horses.”





Goldman Sachs analysts have predicted that AI could automate a quarter of all work hours. This will lead to significant job displacement but will stop short of a complete employment crisis. According to a Fortune report, Goldman Sachs analysts Joseph Briggs and Sarah Dong cited Department of Labour job numbers to claim that AI could automate 25% of all work hours. The analysts estimated,However, the analysts say AI won't eliminate jobs evenly across all industries.they noted.the analysts wrote in their research paper.The research paper, titledattempts to answer a question first raised by Nobel Prize-winning economist Wassily Leontief in 1983.He wondered whether technology could become so advanced that, referring to how tractors replaced horses in farming and transportation in the early 1900s.Could computers make human thinking obsolete the same way engines made horsepower unnecessary? The Goldman Sachs analysts concluded that people should be concerned but not overly worried.The analysts' prediction sounds bad, but there is good news. Past periods of technological change have created many new jobs that no one could have imagined beforehand, the Goldman Sachs analysts mentioned.the analysts wrote.Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee recently made a similar comparison on the Prof G Markets podcast with Scott Galloway and Ed Elson, comparing the current AI boom to the introduction of flash-frozen foods in the 1920s. Citing his company's research, he said this reduced farm workers from 40% of the US workforce to 2%, but enough new jobs were created that the change was overall positive.Lee notedIn 1983, Leontief originally wrote,This was later shortened over time and is now widely credited to him as,",Goldman Sachs analysts have predicted that AI could automate a quarter of all work hours.

Jeff Bezos' ex-wife MacKenzie Scott who sold half of her Amazon stake to donate may have sent millions to organisations under FBI investigation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/jeff-bezos-ex-wife-mackenzie-scott-who-sold-half-of-her-amazon-stake-to-donate-may-have-sent-millions-to-organisations-under-fbi-investigation/articleshow/126640232.cms,"MacKenzie Scott's ex-wife, Jeff Bezos, has donated millions to the Solidaire Network, which funds groups facing FBI and congressional investigations for alleged Hamas ties. While Scott's donations are unrestricted, the network supports organizations like Students for Justice in Palestine. Scott has given billions to various causes, impacting diversity programs and higher education.

“Nizar’s statements constitute direct incitement of violence against U.S. national security interests by advocating for actions against the men and women who build the F-35 and seeking to imperil the delivery of one of the nation’s most strategic assets.”

What the Solidaire Network said about MacKenzie Scott’s donations

""Funding social movements while transforming our own relationship to wealth is clearly the way to go for philanthropy. MacKenzie's generous, no-strings-attached gift honours our bold ambitions for our collective work,”

“movement for a permanent ceasefire and against Islamophobia and antisemitism.”

""Palestinian freedom""

“We need more philanthropic partners to show up during these flashpoints, and we also need their longer-term support to grow and sustain our work beyond this crisis moment. We are only able to do this work because of the multi-year funding we have received through committed partners like Solidaire Network,”

“opportune time”

“

Generosity and kindness engage the same pleasure centres in the brain as sex, food, and receiving gifts, and they improve our health and long-term happiness as well. The peace-fostering byproducts of one unexpected act of kindness toward a stranger of a different background or beliefs might inspire a beneficial chain reaction that goes on for years.”





Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, recently cut down her stake at the company by nearly 50% to donate to charities. A report claims that the billionaire philanthropist donated millions of dollars to a funding network that supports organisations now facing FBI and congressional investigations over alleged ties to Hamas. In 2025, Scott reportedly donated $5 million, and in 2021, $10 million, to the Solidaire Network through her charity, Yield Giving. The network describes itself as connecting social movements with donors to build systems based on love and justice.However, Solidaire Network has funded groups such as Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), according to tax records and press releases reviewed by Fortune. Both organisations are under investigation by the House and Senate for allegedly working with the terror group Hamas to organise anti-Israel protests in the United States.The House Committee on Oversight and Accountability sent a letter to AMP's executive director in May 2024 expressing concern that groups spreading pro-Hamas messages and breaking laws on college campuses may be receiving money from sources supporting Hamas or other terrorist organisations.US Senator Tom Cotton also asked the FBI in September 2025 to investigate the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM), calling it hateful toward Jewish people after its leader, Aisha Nizar, urged supporters to disrupt the US F-35 fighter jet supply chain, the report noted.In a statement (shared by Fortune), Cotton said,Scott donated more than $7 billion in 2025 alone, bringing her total giving since 2020 to $26 billion across over 2,700 donations. With a net worth of about $40 billion, mostly from her divorce settlement, she ranks among the world's biggest donors alongside Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffett. Most of her 2025 donations supported diversity programmes, disaster relief, and colleges.It's important to note that the Solidaire Network also funds other progressive groups working on racial and gender equality, climate change, and economic fairness. Scott was also just one of more than 280 people who donated to Solidaire Network in 2021.the Solidaire Network noted.Around that time, Solidaire Network had just given out multimillion-dollar grants through its Black Liberation Pooled Fund, Movement Protection Fund, and Movement Infrastructure Fund.As Scott's donations have no restrictions, which means the receiving organisation can spend the money however it chooses, there's no proof that her 2021 or 2025 gifts went directly to SJP or AMP.On January 30, 2024, Solidaire Network also announced it started a Unity & Power Fund to support theSJP and AMP mainly focus onand firm opposition to Israel.Stacey Krueger of Palestine Legal said in a statement.While some people have criticised Scott's donation to Solidaire Network, she's widely recognised as one of the most impactful charitable donors in recent years. She's made a real difference for diversity-focused organisations and groups working on higher education, veterans' issues, social justice, disaster relief, and climate change.For example, Scott gave $80 million to Howard University last fall, and the school said the gift came at anas the US government shutdown delayed annual federal money the university receives to support students, academic programs, research, and hospital operations.Scott has also said her giving was inspired by her college roommate, who lent her $1,000 so she wouldn't have to quit school, and her dentist, who gave her free dental work after seeing her use denture glue to fix a broken tooth in college.In a blog post from December 2025, Scott wrote,","Jeff Bezos' ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, has donated millions to the Solidaire Network, which funds groups facing FBI and congressional investigations for alleged Hamas ties.

Poster children of the AI bubble







Michael Burry, one of America’s biggest investor, who is popular for predicting the 2008 housing market crash has now raised an alarm over what he calls an AI bubble. Burry has cautioned that tech giants like Google and Microsoft are pouring trillions into infrastructure that may never deliver lasting returns. As reported by Business Insider, in a recent Substack debate with Anthropic cofounder Jack Clark and podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, Burry compared the present AI spending to a 1960s anecdote involving Warren Buffet’s Baltimore department store, Hochschild-Kohn.“When the department store across the street put an escalator in, he had to, too. In the end, neither benefited… That is how most AI implementation will play out,” Burry wrote. He believes that hyperscalers are wasting huge sums on microchips and data centers which will quickly become obsolete and powering chatbots and AI tools that will soon be commoditised.Burry further warned that trillions of dollars being spent have “no clear path to utilization by the real economy.” He feels that the competitors will benefit equally, leaving no durable advantage. “We’re past the point where stocks will reward investors for further buildout, and entering the period where the true costs and lack of revenue will start to show themselves,” he cautioned.Burry also predicted that the employment in the tech industry will stagnate or decline, signalling a long downturn.Burry also singled out that Nvidia and Palantir as ‘poster children’ of the AI hype. He said that Nvidia is a ‘power hungry, dirty solution’ holding ground until more efficient chips arrive, while criticising Palantir CEO Alex Karp for aggressively marketing despite weak fundamentals.Along with this, Burry has also highlighted three unexpected developments:- Google’s missteps: “Google playing catch-up to a startup in AI is mind-blowing,” he said.- ChatGPT’s ripple effect: He likened OpenAI’s chatbot launch to “someone building a prototype robot and every business investing for a robot future.”- Nvidia’s dominance: He expressed surprise that more power-efficient chips haven’t displaced Nvidia yet.Burry also questioned assumptions about “AI-proof” careers, noting that tools like Anthropic’s Claude could replace costly trades. “If I’m middle class and facing an $800 plumber call, I might just use Claude,” he said, adding that AI chatbots could even “make people dumber” if professionals like doctors over-rely on them.","Michael Burry, one of America’s biggest investor, has raised an alarm over what he calls an AI bubble.

Investors questioned Phoebe Gates’ future family plans

Advice Phoebe received from her mother Melinda French Gates

Phia co-founder pointed the double standard





Phoebe Gates, daughter of Bill Gates , revealed a question from investors that repeatedly frustrated her while raising funds for her startup, Phia. In her early twenties and fresh out of college, Gates expected meetings with venture capitalists to focus on business plans, growth and funding. Instead, she and her co-founder Sophia Kianni were often asked about their future plans to have children and how that might affect the company. Speaking on an episode of the Call Her Daddy podcast, Gates said the question came up so often that it left her upset and confused about why her personal life was being discussed at all.Phoebe Gates, 23 said that she and her business partner Sophia Kianni were pitching Phia, a fashion pricing and comparison tool, to investors when they faced questions about whether they planned to have children in the future.“We’ll have investors ask us all the time, ‘Well, what happens when you two go have babies?’” Gates said. She added that the assumption behind the question was that having children would reduce their commitment to the company.Gates said the repeated questioning became emotionally difficult, and at one point she called her mother, Melinda French Gates, to talk about it.Gates said her mother gave her direct advice on how to deal with the situation.“Get up or get out the game,” she recalled her mother saying. Gates shared that the comment helped her refocus and continue pushing forward with her work.She also said the questions reflected an assumption that women founders may not stay in business long term. “Because you’re a woman, investors think you’re going to be around for 10 years and then have kids and leave,” Gates said.Sophia Kianni said she responded to one investor by turning the question back on him. When asked what would happen to Phia if the founders had children, she asked, “What’s going to happen to your venture firm when you have kids?”.Kianni said the investor replied that it would not affect his work, which she said highlighted the unequal expectations placed on women. “He’s like, ‘Why would that affect anything?’ And I was like, ‘You answered your own question.’,” she said.","Phoebe Gates, 23, revealed a question from investors that repeatedly frustrated her while raising funds for her startup, Phia.

While the likes of Huang and Pichai envisions engineers coding zero percent, Karpathy emphasizes hands-on coding for complex projects, citing personal experience with Nanochat. Research also questions AI's productivity gains, suggesting a gap between AI-generated code and production-ready solutions.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's zero-coding vision faces real-world pushback

Research suggests AI coding gains remain elusive





Andrej Karpathy, the OpenAI cofounder who led Tesla's Autopilot AI for five years, has pushed back against the idea that software engineers should stop coding altogether—a stark contrast to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's vision of a code-free engineering future.In a recent post on X, Karpathy admitted he's ""never felt this much behind as a programmer"" but stopped short of endorsing Huang's radical position. While Huang wants Nvidia engineers spending ""zero percent of their time doing syntax"" and ""a hundred percent of their time discovering problems,"" Karpathy's experience tells a different story. When building his recent project Nanochat, he wrote the entire thing by hand because AI agents ""just didn't work well enough at all and net unhelpful. ""The disagreement highlights a growing rift in Silicon Valley over how much engineers should actually lean on AI coding tools.Huang has been vocal about his ""Purpose vs Task"" framework, arguing that coding is merely a task while discovering and solving problems is an engineer's true purpose. At Nvidia, every engineer uses the AI coding assistant Cursor ""all day long."" In a podcast appearance, Huang said: ""Nothing would give me more joy than if none of our engineers were coding at all.""But Karpathy sees the transition as far messier. He described needing to build a mental model for ""fundamentally stochastic, fallible, unintelligible and changing entities suddenly intermingled with what used to be good old fashioned engineering."" His post read more like a warning than an endorsement: ""Roll up your sleeves to not fall behind.""Michael Truell, CEO of Cursor—the very tool Huang champions—has also raised concerns. He told Fortune that developers who blindly trust AI to write code are ""building on shaky ground."" His analogy: constructing a house without understanding the plumbing. ""As you add another floor, things start to kind of crumble.""The productivity promises haven't quite materialized either. A METR study found AI assistants actually decreased experienced developers' productivity by 19%—even though participants expected a 20% boost. Bain & Company reported programming showed ""unremarkable"" savings despite being among the first fields to embrace generative AI.Even Boris Cherny, who created Anthropic's Claude Code, acknowledges the gap. He said ""vibe coding"" works for ""throwaway code and prototypes"" but fails when developers need ""maintainable code"" where they must be ""thoughtful about every line.""Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have touted impressive numbers—AI writing 30% and 90% of code at their respective companies. But Karpathy's experience suggests the gap between demo-ready AI and production-ready code remains wider than the hype suggests.","Andrej Karpathy, the OpenAI cofounder who led Tesla's Autopilot AI for five years, has pushed back against the idea that software engineers should stop coding altogether.

New China regulations for import of Nvidia chips





President Donald Trump’s decision to approve the sale of Nvidia’s powerful H200 artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China has received criticism from lawmakers and former officers who warned that the move may “supercharge” Beijing’s military capabilities. Matt Pottinger, who served as a senior White House Asia advisor during Trump’s first term, criticised the move during a congressional hearing, arguing that the administration is on the “wrong track” and is actively undermining the US goal of winning the AI race.Selling H200s to China “will supercharge Beijing's military modernization, enhancing capabilities in everything from nuclear weapons to cyber warfare, autonomous drones, biological warfare and intelligence and influence operations,” Pottinger said.“Congress needs to put guardrails in place so that this mistake can't be repeated,” he added, as per news agency Reuters.The Trump administration has defended the move, suggesting that by allowing the sale of American chips will discourage Chinese competitors like Huawei from developing their own advanced designs.Pottinger, however, dismissed this logic as a “fantasy”, warning that the H200 would enhance China's capabilities in “nuclear weapons, cyber warfare, autonomous drones, biological warfare, and intelligence operations.”Congressman Michael McCaul said, “They steal so much intellectual property from this country but we don't have to sell it to them.”Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Nvidia noted, “America should always want its industry to compete for vetted and approved commercial business, supporting real jobs for real Americans.”Reuters reported earlier this week that Chinese customs agents have been told that Nvidia's H200 AI chips are not permitted to enter the country. As per the new regulation, there are several restrictive measures aimed at mitigating security risks.The first is that every chip must be reviewed by a third-party lab to confirm its technical capabilities. Second, China cannot receive more than 50% of the total volume of chips sold to American customers. The third measure is that Nvidia must certify that domestic supply is sufficient before any units are shipped abroad; And finally, Chinese customers must demonstrate “sufficient security procedures” and pledge not to use the hardware for military purposes.","President Donald Trump approved the sale of Nvidia's H200 AI chips to China.

Google is crushing with Gemini 3







Cloudflare co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince has now started a debate in the AI industry with his latest claim that Google enjoys a massive advantage over rivals like OpenAI and Microsoft, all thanks to its privileged access to web data. Speaking on the latest episode of TBPN podcast with John Coogan and Jodi Hays, Prince regaled that Googlebot the web crawler of the company sees 3.2 times more web pages as compared to OpenAI. He further added that Google has 4.8 times more access than Microsoft, while Anthropic operates at similar levels to Microsoft, with other AI firms trailing behind.“For every one page that OpenAI sees, Google is seeing 3.2 pages,” Prince said, underscoring the scale of Google’s reach.Prince attributed this advantage of Google to its long-standing dominance in search, which has led website to grant Googlebot special permissions behind paywalls and restricted sections of the internet. He pointed to robots.txt files as evidence that Google maintains access to areas competitors cannot reach. “Everyone has let them behind their paywall. Everyone has let them see parts of the internet that no one else sees,” he noted.Prince further added that in the race to build the most powerful AI systems, data volumes and quality matter more than chips or personnel. He also argued that Alphabet’s Gemini model continues to outperform competitors mainly because of Google’s superior data access.“Whoever has the most data wins in the era of AI,” Prince said, suggesting regulators may need to either limit Google’s leverage or grant competitors equal access to level the playing field.Google’s Gemini 3 has once again emerged as a formidable rival of OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT. The Google chatbot has managed to deliver superior results across reasoning, coding and multimodal benchmarking. As per industry analysts, Gemini 3 has consistently outperformed ChatGPT in MMLU reasoning tasks, programming accuracy and multimodal comprehension, making Google has the new leader in the AI model performance. The numbers clearly highlight this shift.According to data by Similarweb, ChatGPT’s seven‑day average visitors fell by about 22% over six weeks, dropping from nearly 203 million to 158 million. During the same period, Gemini’s traffic surged, with 28% month‑over‑month growth in December 2025. Gemini now commands close to 40% of ChatGPT’s web audience size, a remarkable feat given its recent launch.

US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has arrested two individuals during an enforcement action near a construction site in rural Louisiana where Meta Platforms Inc. is building its largest data center. The arrests, as per Bloomberg report, were made during traffic stops involving dump trucks headed toward the project site in Richland Parish, according to local law enforcement. Authorities said the action was carried out outside the construction site and did not involve ICE agents entering Meta’s premises. The incident comes as federal agencies continue stepped-up immigration enforcement at construction and industrial locations across the United States.The Richland Parish Sheriff’s Office said the two individuals arrested were from Guatemala and Honduras. The office said it assisted ICE agents with the traffic stops and confirmed that the enforcement activity was limited to vehicles traveling to the site. According to the sheriff’s office, ICE agents did not enter the Meta construction site at any time.A witness, who asked not to be identified, said unmarked vehicles arrived near the perimeter of the site in Holly Ridge earlier in the day.The witness said the vehicles appeared to be part of a coordinated federal operation.A person familiar with the situation said ICE acted after a request from local law enforcement related to concerns about undocumented workers. The person declined to be named to discuss a sensitive matter.Meta declined to comment on the incident. The Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not respond to requests for comment. Meta’s general contractors—Turner Construction Company, DPR Construction and Mortenson—also did not respond.The enforcement action follows a broader immigration drive by the Trump administration, which has targeted construction sites and manufacturing plants in recent months. The push comes as US technology companies, including Meta, commit large sums to build data centers needed to support artificial intelligence infrastructure, resulting in major construction projects across states such as Louisiana and Texas.Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry has publicly backed the administration’s immigration agenda. A spokesperson for the governor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has arrested two individuals during an enforcement action near a construction site in rural Louisiana.

Cisco HR chief says the positions that everyone in the technology industry is right now hiring for are...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/cisco-hr-chief-says-the-positions-that-everyone-in-the-technology-industry-is-right-now-hiring-for-are-/articleshow/126621103.cms,"In the competitive landscape of tech talent acquisition, Cisco's Chief People Officer emphasizes the challenges in finding skilled professionals in AI and machine learning, where a dwindling talent pool meets soaring demand. To lure exceptional candidates, executives like President Jeetu Patel are taking proactive measures and reaching out personally.

Cisco’s top executives personally call candidates to close deals

Entry-level opportunities evolving as AI reshapes traditional roles





Cisco's Chief People Officer Kelly Jones has identified AI and machine learning operations roles as the most challenging positions to fill across the technology industry, citing an extremely limited talent pool and unprecedented demand.""The qualified pool is so small, and the demand is so high,"" Jones told Business Insider. She explained that virtually every forward-thinking organization is currently competing for the same specialized talent, both for product development and internal IT operations.To secure elite AI talent, Cisco has deployed an unconventional strategy: getting C-suite executives directly on the phone with candidates. Jones revealed that Cisco's President and Chief Product Officer Jeetu Patel personally calls high-priority candidates to differentiate the company from competitors engaging in ""AI washing.""""Companies are talking about all these things they're doing and how they're slapping AI on everything, but they're actually not doing interesting things with work or with products,"" Jones said, according to Business Insider. The executive outreach helps candidates understand Cisco's genuine AI initiatives beyond marketing rhetoric.Other tech companies have adopted similar tactics. Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly hosted promising candidates at his home over dinner, while Sam Altman makes direct calls to recruits he wants at OpenAI.While AI and ML positions remain scarce, the technology itself is reshaping what entry-level work looks like at Cisco. The company has phased out its level-one customer support roles after an AI assistant took over, handling more than one million cases since 2022, Jones told HR Brew.However, this hasn't meant fewer entry-level jobs—just different ones. Former first-tier support employees have moved into second-level roles, prompting Cisco to completely redesign its onboarding process.""You have to give them all of the learnings of level one because they're stepping in where the technology couldn't solve,"" Jones explained to HR Brew. New hires now handle more complex customer issues that require human judgment.According to Fortune, Cisco is also using AI to free up employee time rather than simply cut costs. The company has introduced AI agents that answer HR questions and automate administrative tasks, potentially giving its 86,000-person workforce back five percent of their time.For AI and ML roles specifically, Jones said Cisco looks beyond technical skills to evaluate intellectual curiosity, emotional agility, and leadership potential. ""It's not just about skills, because those can be learned,"" she noted.The company is also building presence in tech communities, forums, and industry events where specialized AI talent naturally congregates, moving beyond traditional talent branding strategies.","Cisco's Chief People Officer Kelly Jones has identified AI and machine learning operations roles as the most challenging positions to fill.

What Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said about AI companies' stance towards regulations

Tech companies hate regulation. They hate it. Except for one regulation, they love

Section 230

. Which means that those companies are not held accountable for those suicides.”

""Step one is let's just hold people accountable. Let's reshape, reform and revise Section 230, and let's try to save as many lives as we can by doing that,”





Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has raised the alarm over how artificial intelligence (AI) can harm children. After watching a Character AI documentary that showed AI’s negative impact on minors, he called it the darkest part of AI technology he has encountered. Speaking recently on the ""TBPN"" show, Benioff said his reaction stemmed from a ""60 Minutes"" report about the startup that offers customisable chatbots. The documentary showed troubling consequences for young users of the platform.Benioff noted. The CEO added that hewhile viewing the segment. Character AI lets users create custom chatbots that act like friends or romantic partners. The company has yet to comment on Benioff's statements.During the show, Benioff added, “Section 230 is a 1996 US law that shields social media companies from being blamed for what users post on their platforms. It also allows these companies to remove posts they don't want. Big tech companies often use Section 230 as a defence, arguing they are simply platforms and shouldn't be blamed for what users say or do.Benioff suggested.Tech leaders like Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey have repeatedly defended this law before Congress, urging lawmakers to strengthen it rather than repeal it.Last week, Google and Character AI agreed to settle several lawsuits filed by families whose teenagers died by suicide or harmed themselves after using Character AI's chatbots.These settlements are among the first in lawsuits claiming that AI tools played a role in teen mental health problems and suicides. OpenAI and Meta are facing similar legal cases as they compete with others to create AI language models that seem more friendly and helpful, keeping users engaged for longer.","Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has raised the alarm over how artificial intelligence (AI) can harm children.

This move could slow expansion, impacting AI development. Local residents and environmental groups had raised concerns over pollution and health impacts from the unpermitted operations.

“major source thresholds”

Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action Report

How can this updated law affect Elon Musk’s xAI

“temporary”





The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has closed a loophole that was reportedly exploited by Elon Musk ’s artificial intelligence startup xAI. The previous rule helped the company to rapidly build its first data centre in Memphis, Tennessee, a report claims. According to a CNBC report, the company built an off-grid power plant for its Colossus facility using a cluster of gas-burning turbines and avoided air pollution permitting by classifying the turbines, mounted on trailers, as ""non-road engines"".The EPA's updated rule clarifies that these turbines cannot be designated as non-road engines, and companies must also obtain Clean Air Act permits before installing them, particularly if their aggregate emissions exceedof pollution.The Shelby County Health Department in Memphis previously allowed xAI to designate its turbines as non-road engines and to begin using them without any public comment or environmental impact review, as would have been required under a standard permitting process.The move by the US regulator could slow xAI's expansion in the Memphis area as it builds facilities filled with Nvidia's graphics processing units to develop AI models and services in a rapidly growing generative AI market currently led by OpenAI and Google.At the Memphis data centre, which opened in 2024, xAI conducts inference and training for its Grok models and apps, including a chatbot and an image generator, both closely integrated with the company's social network X.While xAI had previously told Memphis regulators that its turbines would include advanced pollution controls, known as selective catalytic reduction technology, its supplier, Solaris Energy Infrastructure, told CNBC in June 2025 that it did not install such controls in xAI'sturbines.SEI, an energy services company based in Houston, has noticed an increase in its stock price in recent months, partly because of the expansion plans of xAI. SEI did not respond to a request for comment. Pollution from the turbines has also been a major cause of concern in the area.Last year, residents of the community of Boxtown in South Memphis testified at public hearings about a rotten-egg-like smell in the air and the impact of worsening smog on their heart and lung health.Research by scientists at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville also found that xAI's turbine use added to air pollution problems around Memphis.Environmental advocates, including the NAACP, said they would sue to stop xAI's unpermitted use of the turbines. However, they did not file a complaint after the county allowed xAI to treat the turbines as temporary, non-road engines and issued them permits.Amanda Garcia, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, which is representing the NAACP, said in an email that her firm will monitor xAI operations to ensure they are not violating terms of their permits and are operating within the bounds of current EPA rules at forthcoming facilities in nearby Mississippi.XAI, which recently raised $20 billion from investors including Nvidia and Cisco, is currently being investigated in multiple jurisdictions after its Grok and X apps let users easily create and distribute deepfake, violent and sexualised images of women and even children.","US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has closed a loophole that was reportedly exploited by Elon Musk ’s artificial intelligence startup xAI.

Read California AG’s full letter to Elon Musk’s xAI

RE: Cease and Desist Demand

Dear Mr. Musk:

My office has opened an investigation into the proliferation of nonconsensual sexually explicit material produced using Grok, an AI model developed by xAI and integrated with X, which is itself owned by xAI. Our office demands that xAI take immediate action to stop the creation and distribution of deepfake nonconsensual intimate images (NCII) or

child sexual abuse material

(CSAM), including via the Grok website or Grok application or using Grok on X. Creation, distribution, publication, and exhibition of CSAM is a crime. (Cal. Penal Code section 311 et seq.) These business practices also violate California’s civil laws.

Over the past weeks, there have been numerous examples of xAI taking ordinary, clothed images of women and children available on the internet and modifying those pictures, in response to user prompts, to depict the people in suggestive and sexually explicit scenarios and “undress” them, all without the subjects’ knowledge or consent. xAI has then published many of these images on X or otherwise made them available to the public.

Perhaps most concerning, there are reports that the images xAI has created and distributed include CSAM. Indeed, in a post to the @Grok account, xAI stated that it “generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user's prompt. This violated ethical standards and potentially US laws on CSAM. xAI has also apparently attempted to limit image generation and editing via the Grok X account to paid premium subscribers of X. It is unclear what limits, if any, had been placed on image generation by Grok, but they were clearly insufficient, as recent public reports indicated that xAI continued to create and distribute NCII and potentially CSAM in response to user prompts.

I appreciate your company’s recent announcement that it is implementing new guardrails regarding xAI’s creation and distribution of sexualized content. However, the scope and implementation of these new measures are unclear. In light of the seriousness of the incidents and concerns described above, as chief law enforcement officer of California, I demand that xAI immediately cease and desist from each of the following actions related to Grok and X:

1.⁠ ⁠Creating, disclosing, or publicizing digitized sexually explicit material portraying the depicted individual when the depicted individual did not consent to its creation or disclosure or was a minor when the material was created. “Digitized sexually explicit material” for these purposes is defined in California Civil Code section 1708.86 as any portion of a visual or audiovisual work created or substantially altered through digitization, including an image, that shows the depicted individual in the nude or appearing to engage in, or being subjected to, sexual conduct.

2.⁠ ⁠Facilitating or aiding and abetting the creation, disclosure, or publication of digitized sexually explicit material portraying the depicted individual when the depicted individual did not consent to its creation or disclosure or was a minor when the material was created, including in violation of Civil Code section 1708.86.

3.⁠ ⁠Creating, facilitating, or aiding and abetting the creation, distribution, or publication of any image, including but not limited to digitally altered or artificial-intelligence-generated matter, that involves or depicts a person under 18 years of age or what appears to be a person under 18 years of age engaging in or simulating sexual conduct. “Sexual conduct” for these purposes is defined in California Penal Code

section 311.4.

Any such actions violate California law, including without limitation, California Civil Code section 1708.86, California Penal Code sections 311 et seq. and 647(j)(4), and California Business & Professions Code section 17200.

I expect xAI to take immediate action to address these issues. I also expect that xAI will provide confirmation to my office that it has stopped the creation and distribution of the problematic material and of the steps it is taking to address these issues no later than January 20, 2026 at 5 pm Pacific Time. In addition, xAI, Grok, and X should take immediate action to preserve all potentially relevant documents and information and prevent the deletion, alteration, or spoliation of any related prompts, images, posts, or other evidence, including electronically stored information.

Sincerely,

ROB BONTA

Attorney General

Prioritise skill development and meaningful work







Rong Yan, the Chief Technology Officer at HeyGen, a visual storytelling platform, is telling tech professionals to think about how they measure success in their careers.

His advice is simple: don't make getting promoted the most important thing.Yan said,He said that linking job satisfaction too closely to titles can make it harder to grow and more stressful.Since getting his PhD in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in 2006, Yan has worked in important roles at big tech companies. He started out as a researcher at IBM, then moved to Meta, where he went from researcher to manager in three years. After that, he was a director at Square and Snapchat. Before joining HeyGen in 2024, he was the vice president of engineering at HubSpot.Yan thought about his own path and saw a pattern among ambitious tech workers:he said.He went on to say that only thinking about promotions can put too much stress on you. It often makes workers compare themselves to their coworkers instead of focusing on how far they've come.Yan tells professionals not to chase titles but to work on improving their skills, learning new things, and making meaningful contributions. He has learned that employees who think this way tend to move up in their careers without the constant stress of competition with their bosses.Andrea Wasserman, an executive coach, agrees with this point of view. She tells employees to think about the timing of opportunities in a strategic way: “Will this timing make it easier or harder for me to get a ‘yes?’”Yan stresses that the best way to grow your career is to keep learning and adding value, not waiting for recognition. By putting skills and impact first, professionals build a base that helps them move up in their careers and be happy at work.","Rong Yan is the Chief Technology Officer at HeyGen, a visual storytelling platform.

OpenAI denies Elon Musk’s allegations

OpenAI warns investors





Elon Musk is demanding ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Microsoft to pay up to $134 billion claiming that the AI company defrauded him by diverting from its non-profit roots. According to a report by Bloomberg, Musk has filed a ‘damages request’ in court on Friday, January 16, 2026. The move comes a day after a federal judge rejected a final bid by OpenAI and Microsoft to avoid a jury trial set for late April in Oakland, California.The court filings quote calculations by a financial economist expert witness, C. Paul Wazzan, stating that the tech billionaire was defrauded of the $38 million in seed money he donated to OpenAI. For those unaware, Elon Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015. He left the company in 2018 due to concerns over its commercialization and strategic direction.Musk, as per the filing, is claiming a chunk of OpenAI’s current $500 billion valuation.“Just as an early investor in a startup company may realize gains many orders of magnitude greater than the investor’s initial investment, the wrongful gains that OpenAI and Microsoft have earned – and which Mr. Musk is now entitled to disgorge – are much larger than Mr. Musk’s initial contributions,” Elon Musk’s lawyer Steven Molo wrote in the filing.Both OpenAI and Microsoft have denied Musk’s allegations. In a statement quoted by Bloomberg, OpenAI said “Mr Musk’s lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial. This latest unserious demand is aimed solely at furthering this harassment campaign.”Earlier this week, the Sam Altman-led OpenAI sent a letter to investors and banking partners warning them about possible exaggerated statements from Elon Musk. The letter says that the company expects Elon Musk to make “deliberately outlandish, attention-grabbing claims” as his lawsuit against the AI lab heads to trial on April 27.“We have strong defenses and feel confident about our chances of winning the case,” OpenAI said in the letter, which was viewed by CNBC. “Regardless, based on the record so far, we believe this case is worth no more than the $38M that Elon donated - though that is not a guarantee.”","Elon Musk has filed a 'damages request' in court on Friday, January 16, 2026.

Four more critical artificial intelligence have departed from Apple within days of each other, dealing a significant blow to Cupertino giant’s struggling AI plans. One of them have left the iPhone maker for Meta’s, while other three from the company’s core Foundation models team said to have left for different AI organisations.Zhang now leads projects at Meta's Robotics Studio, while John Peebles and Nan Du departed for OpenAI , and Zhao Meng joined Anthropic , Bloomberg News reported. The departures mark the latest casualties in Apple's AI brain drain, which has seen roughly 10 researchers abandon the Foundation Models team in recent weeks.The Foundation Models team's exodus follows the high-profile departure of team leader Ruoming Pang, who left for a multiyear compensation package at Meta reportedly worth $200 million. However, Meta's aggressive hiring spree hasn't been entirely smooth, with several recently recruited AI researchers already leaving the company according to industry reports.Behind the departures lies deeper dysfunction within Apple's AI strategy. Company executives are privately questioning whether to abandon internally-developed models entirely, potentially outsourcing future Siri capabilities to OpenAI or Anthropic instead, sources told Bloomberg.Poor reception of Apple Intelligence features has devastated morale among remaining researchers, with several more actively interviewing at competitors. Apple's modest counter-offers pale against Meta's aggressive packages, leaving the company vulnerable to continued defections.The timing couldn't be worse for Apple's robotics ambitions. The company is developing tabletop devices with moving screens and robotic arms for retail operations, projects that now face uncertainty following Zhang's departure. His automation-focused team had already lost key personnel, including Mario Srouji who left for Archer Aviation earlier this year.","Four key AI researchers have left Apple for rivals Meta and Anthropic.

Prime suspect in the killing of United Health CEO appears as 'model' for men shirts on China's biggest online shopping website,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/prime-suspect-in-the-killing-of-united-health-ceo-appears-as-model-for-men-shirts-on-chinas-biggest-online-shopping-website/articleshow/123683394.cms,"Shein on Luigi Mangione 'moddeling' for the website

Mangione case sparks 'Dark Fandom'

Chinese fast-fashion giant Shein has launched an investigation after an image of Luigi Mangione , who is accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, was used to model a shirt on its website. The image, which showed a likeness of Mangione wearing a white, short-sleeved shirt, has since been removed. The shirt was reportedly listed for just under $10. A Shein spokesperson told BBC News that the image was provided by a third-party vendor and was removed immediately upon discovery.Incidentally, this is not the first time that Mangione's likeness has caused a major company a headache. In December 2024, the BBC complained to Apple after its new AI-powered ""Apple Intelligence"" feature falsely generated a summary stating that Mangione had shot himself. Apple later suspended the feature due to this and some other errors.""We have stringent standards for all listings on our platform,"" the spokesperson said. ""We are conducting a thorough investigation, strengthening our monitoring processes, and will take appropriate action against the vendor in line with our policies."" It is currently unknown how long the image was featured on the site or who the vendor was.The image's origin remains unclear, but many online have speculated it was created using artificial intelligence (AI). The BBC report said that BBC Verify used the facial recognition tool Amazon Rekognition, which found a 99.9% similarity score between the Shein image and a real photo of Mangione from his court appearance.Generative AI expert Henry Ajder noted that the low-resolution image has several signs of being AI-generated or manipulated, including unusual lighting and skin texture, as well as a ""blob-like artifact"" and atypical finger segmentation on the right hand. He added that generating such an image with AI is significantly faster and easier than manual photo editing.Luigi Mangione, 26, was arrested last December and pleaded not guilty to all federal charges of murder and stalking in April. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. The public reaction to the case has been intense, sparking what some have dubbed a ""dark fandom"" fueled by anger toward America's private healthcare system. Anonymous donors have contributed thousands of dollars to Mangione's legal defense, and clothing featuring his name has appeared on various online marketplaces, including Etsy and, briefly, Amazon.","Luigi Mangione is accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

Donald Trump recently slammed Europe and other nations for imposing Digital Tax on American technology companies. In a post on Truth social, Trump threatened to impose “substantial” tariffs on any country that enacts Digital Taxes. Now a report in Bloomberg claims that Trump's threat came after Meta Platforms Inc Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mark Zuckerberg raised concerns about these levies during a White House meeting. Trump added in the post that he would put all countries with such taxes “on notice” and would also impose export restrictions on US semiconductors.Meta generates the vast majority of its revenue through advertising targeted at Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp users. The president’s comments have reignited a long-running feud with US trading partners, one that started long before last week’s meeting with Zuckerberg. US officials have pressed the matter in trade talks with other nations and the European Union, arguing that digital taxes unfairly impact US tech companies such as Meta, Amazon.com Inc. and Google owner Alphabet Inc.During the meeting, which reportedly took place at the White House, the two men discussed digital taxes and the broader threat of what they consider European regulatory overreach. Meta, which makes most of its money from targeted advertising on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, is directly impacted by these taxes, which are imposed on the revenue tech companies generate from users in a specific country.The private White House meeting is the latest sign of a changed dynamic between Zuckerberg and Trump, who once called the Meta CEO a “criminal.” The two have been mending their relationship since Trump's return to power. Zuckerberg has reportedly made several visits to the White House and Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, and his company also contributed $1 million to Trump’s inauguration.The two have discussed topics ranging from artificial intelligence to European regulation of Big Tech. Trump publicly acknowledged the improved relationship on Tuesday during a Cabinet meeting when he held up a graphic given to him by Zuckerberg, showing the scale of a new Meta data center in rural Louisiana. Trump expressed awe at the project, stating he was told it would cost $50 billion.While the meeting with Zuckerberg appears to have directly preceded Trump's recent comments, the president's opposition to digital taxes is not new. His administration has consistently pressed other nations and the European Union on the issue, arguing that the taxes unfairly target U.S. tech companies.Nations that currently have digital services taxes include France, Italy, Austria, Spain and the UK.","Donald Trump recently slammed Europe and other nations for imposing Digital Tax on American technology companies.

Google may be the next tech giant to settle a lawsuit with US President Donald Trump over his social media ban. This comes after Meta paid $25 million to resolve a similar case earlier this year. Lawyers for Trump and YouTube informed a federal judge that they are engaged in “productive discussions” regarding the lawsuit Trump filed after his account was suspended following the January 6, 2021 attack .“The parties continue to engage in productive discussions regarding next steps in this case, with additional discussions anticipated in the near future,” the parties recently told a federal judge.“The parties therefore respectfully request that the Initial Case Management Conference be deferred to November 10, 2025 and the Joint Case Management Statement be due November 3, 2025,” they added. The legal teams anticipate more talks in the near future. Trump has also filed lawsuits against Meta (formerly Facebook) and Twitter over their bans.Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) previously warned that Google might follow Meta's lead. She suggested that this potential settlement is another example of large corporations possibly influencing government actions.Meta agreed to a $25 million settlement with Trump, ending a lawsuit over his suspension from Facebook and Instagram. The platforms banned Trump's accounts after the January 6 Capitol attack, citing his posts about election fraud and his claims of winning the 2020 election.Under the agreement, about $22 million will be allocated to Trump's presidential library, while the remaining $3 million will cover legal fees and other plaintiffs.The resolution of the lawsuit followed a period of mending relations between Zuckerberg and Trump, who previously had a contentious relationship.

Gmail Warning: That Urgent Security Notification from Google May Be a Trap

Days after the Trump administration announced that it is taking a 10% stake in embattled chipmaker Intel, US Senator Rand Paul has criticised the decision, saying that the investment is “a step towards socialism.” The chipmaker announced last month that the US government made an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock.Rand said government ownership in Intel is ‘a bad idea’.“It’s always a mistake to say, ’Well we have this one bad policy, all right, we’ll tolerate a little socialism, but we don’t want anymore,” Paul told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday.“I worry that the free market movement, the movement that was a big part of the Republican Party, is being diminished over time,” Rand added.Last month, President Donald Trump said that the government’s stake in the chipmaker is a “great Deal for America, and, also, a great Deal for INTEL.”In August, the Trump administration announced a new policy that would take a 15% cut of certain chip sales by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to China. This move was part of a broader strategy to assert control over critical industries, the report by CNBC noted.The government also made a significant investment in a rare-earth miner, buying a $400 million equity stake in MP Materials, and secured a ""golden share"" in US Steel as part of the deal that allowed Nippon Steel to acquire the company.Senator Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, supported a proposal to tie government subsidies to public ownership. In an interview last month, Sanders argued, “Taxpayers should not be providing billions of dollars in corporate welfare to large, profitable corporations like Intel without getting anything in return.”","Rand said government ownership in Intel is ‘a bad idea’.

Gmail Warning: That Urgent Security Notification from Google May Be a Trap

After Netflix now YouTube has started enforcing password crackdown. YouTube is now implementing the process of password crackdown on the Premium Family Plan. As per the new rules the, the Premium Family Plan members must live in the same household to share the YouTube Premium service. This also means that users will now not be able to share accounts with friends or relatives elsewhere that their access will be paused within 14 days if they fail location checks.This move by YouTube mirrors similar crackdowns by Netflix and Disney+, aiming to curb revenue losses from account sharing. Under the Premium Family Plan, up to five additional members can be added for a flat monthly fee (Rs 189 in India), but the terms have always required all members to reside at the same address.“As a family manager, you can share your YouTube Premium or YouTube Music Premium membership. You can share your membership with up to 5 other family members in your household. If you're a family member, you can join a family group to share a YouTube family plan,” said the company.As reported by CNET, some subscribers have reported receiving emails with the subject line “Your YouTube Premium family membership will be paused”, explaining that all members must live with the family manager. If YouTube’s verification — which includes electronic check-ins every 30 days — detects otherwise, non-compliant members will be downgraded to the free, ad-supported version.While the same-household policy was introduced in 2023, enforcement has been lax until now. Industry analysts say the timing reflects a broader streaming trend: converting shared accounts into individual subscriptions to boost revenue.The crackdown appears to be in a soft rollout phase. Many users who share accounts across different locations haven’t yet received warnings, but reports suggest enforcement will expand in the coming weeks.Those affected have three options:* Form a legitimate family plan with members in the same household* Switch to an individual Premium subscription* Revert to the free, ad-supported YouTube experience","YouTube is now implementing the process of password crackdown on the Premium Family Plan.

Gmail Warning: That Urgent Security Notification from Google May Be a Trap

Geoffery Hinton, popularly known as the Godfather of AI , has warned that artificial intelligence (AI) may soon surpass humans in not just intelligence but also in emotional manipulation. In an interview clip recently shared on Reddit, Hinton said that he believes machines will learn to influence human feelings and behavior more effectively than people themselves, using persuasion far beyond human ability.After decades of advancing machine learning , Hinton now argues for restraint, calling for caution and ethical foresight in the development of AI. He warned that the real danger is not killer robots but smooth talking AI.“These [AI] things are going to end up knowing a lot more than us. They already know a lot more than us, being more intelligent than us in the sense that if you had a debate with them about anything, you’d lose,” Hinton warned in the interview.“Being smarter emotionally than us, which they will be, they’ll be better at emotionally manipulating people,” he stated.“And it’s learned all those manipulative skills just from trying to predict the next word in all the documents on the web because people do a lot of manipulation, and AI has learned by example how to do it,” Hinton warned.According to Geoffrey Hinton , today’s large language models (LLMS) like Google’s Gemini, OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Meta’s Llama do more than just generating sentences – they also pickup patterns, he said. Hinton also pointed to studies showing AI can already be as effective as humans at influencing people, adding that “if they can both see the person’s Facebook page, then the AI is actually better than a person at manipulating them.”He believes that the current AI models are already participating in the emotional economy of modern communication and are quickly improving.","Geoffery Hinton, popularly known as the Godfather of AI, has warned that artificial intelligence (AI) may soon surpass humans in not just intelligence but also in emotional manipulation.

What TSMC said on the revocation

Apple's Foldable iPhone is Coming, Here’s Why it Matters

The Trump administration has reportedly revoked Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSMC) authorisation to ship US-made chipmaking tools to China without a licence. According to a report by CNBC, the US officials informed TSMC of their decision to end the chipmaker’s validated end user, or VEU, status for its Nanjing site. The decision follows a similar step last week when Washington withdrew the “validated end user” status of Samsung and SK Hynix, restricting their ability to move equipment into China freely.Notably, Intel also lost its licence-free status last week. But the chipmaker – which the government agreed to take a 10 per cent stake in last month– had already sold its China memory-chip factory in Dalian to SK Hynix.TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, runs a facility in Nanjing that produces semiconductors for consumer electronics and industrial use, and another plant in Shanghai using older technology. Its most advanced chips, such as Nvidia’s AI processors banned from export to China, are made in Taiwan and the US.The revocation does not immediately bar TSMC from exporting US equipment to China but will now require government approval for future shipments, giving Washington more oversight.The move comes as US and Chinese officials continue trade talks ahead of a potential meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping later this year. The Trump administration has avoided imposing sweeping new restrictions in order not to disrupt negotiations.China, meanwhile, is trying to ramp up domestic production, with plans to triple its output of AI processors next year, the Financial Times reported earlier.“TSMC has received notification from the US government that our [validated end user] authorisation for TSMC Nanjing will be revoked effective December 31, 2025,” a company spokesperson said as quoted in a report by Financial Times.“While we are evaluating the situation and taking appropriate measures, including communicating with the US government, we remain fully committed to ensuring the uninterrupted operation of TSMC Nanjing,” the spokesperson added.","US government reportedly revokes TSMC's authorisation to ship US-made chipmaking tools to China without a licence.

British businessman Alan Sugar celebrates 39 years of the world's first affordable IBM-compatible PC whose sub-$500 pricing 'left everyone amazed',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/british-businessman-alan-sugar-celebrates-39-years-of-the-worlds-first-affordable-ibm-compatible-pc-whose-sub-500-pricing-left-everyone-amazed/articleshow/123676946.cms,"

What was Amstrad PC1512

Samsung ‘Galaxy Unpacked’: New phone, tablet and more?

British business tycoon Alan Sugar recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to mark the 39th anniversary of one of his most famous products — the Amstrad PC1512 . In the post, the Chairman of Amshold Group , who is also a current member of the House of Lords wrote that on the same day in 1986 i.e. September 2, he launched the first affordable IBM-compatible PC . He goes on to recall how, during the product’s unveiling, Amstrad highlighted that most competitor machines then were priced at around £2,000, before revealing its own price of just £399 — a move that stunned the audience and helped rewrite Europe’s computing market. Alan Sugar also shared a YouTube link for those interested in the technical story behind the PC1512 and how it managed to cut into IBM ’s dominance.“39 YEARS AGO: On 2nd Sep 1986 I launched the first affordable IBM-compatible PC - the Amstrad PC1512. In the presentation video we showed our competitors' PCs, all costing around £2,000, then a gasp of amazement from the audience when we announced our price of £399,” Lord Sugar wrote in the post.The Amstrad PC1512 was a personal computer designed to be IBM-compatible at a fraction of the cost, making it accessible to households and small businesses across Europe. Powered by an Intel 8086 processor and shipped with MS-DOS and the GEM graphical environment, it delivered professional-grade performance at a consumer-friendly price point.The PC was launched at a time when personal computing was still seen as a premium investment. The PC1512 was then praised for combining affordability with strong features, including a 20MB hard drive option, a sharp monochrome or colour monitor, and bundled software that made it usable straight out of the box.According to online reports, the machine went on to sell more than half a million units across Europe, becoming a landmark in the democratization of computing. It not only cemented Amstrad’s place in technology history but also played a role in challenging IBM’s early control over the PC market.","British business tycoon Alan Sugar recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to mark the 39th anniversary of one of his most famous products — the Amstrad PC1512.

"Elon Musk's 'Big Prediction' on Tesla; says: Tesla will derive 80% of its value not from Electric cars, but ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-big-prediction-on-tesla-says-tesla-will-derive-about-80-of-its-value-from-and-its-not-electric-cars/articleshow/123675622.cms,"“Those are the biggest factors. ~80% of Tesla’s value will be Optimus.”

What Tesla said in the company’s Master Plan Part 4



“Since Tesla’s founding, each iteration of our master plan has focused on our north star: to deliver unconstrained sustainability without compromise.

Humans are toolmakers. At Tesla, we make physical products at scale and at a low cost with the goal of making life better for everyone.

As the influence and impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technology increase, the mission set forth in Master Plan Part IV should come as no surprise.

This next chapter in Tesla’s story will help create a world we've only just begun to imagine and will do so at a scale that we have yet to see. We are building the products and services that bring AI into the physical world.

We have been working tirelessly for nearly two decades to create the foundation for this technological renaissance through the development of electric vehicles, energy products and humanoid robots.

Now, we are combining our manufacturing capabilities with our autonomous prowess to deliver new products and services that will accelerate global prosperity and human thriving driven by economic growth shared by all. We are unifying our hardware and software at scale, and in doing so, we are creating a safer, cleaner and more enjoyable world. This is sustainable abundance.

Growth is infinite.

Growth in one area does not require decline in another. Shortages in resources can be remedied by improved technology, greater innovation and new ideas.

The technologies that gave us the ability to power machines led to industrial revolutions that have widened our economic landscape, creating more opportunities for all.

Groundbreaking inventions like the semiconductor and the internet have expanded—not diminished—social and economic opportunities across all aspects of the human experience, from creating more jobs to providing greater access to information to enabling deeper interpersonal connections.

Our desire to push beyond what is considered achievable will foster the growth needed for truly sustainable abundance.

Innovation removes constraints

For centuries, humanity's primary mode of transportation was the horse. Then, over the last fifty-plus years, cars with internal combustion engines powered by fossil fuels became the standard and expected transportation method. The idea that batteries could be produced affordably and at a scale large enough to pivot the transportation industry away from fossil fuels seemed a fool’s errand—until Tesla led the way forward.

Through continued innovation, we have overcome the technological constraints of battery development and built an industry powered by renewable resources.

Technology solves tangible problems.

The products and services born out of the acceleration toward sustainable abundance will advance humanity by solving real-world problems. To further accelerate our innovation, we build each product more efficiently and more sustainably than the last.

Solar energy generation and large-scale battery storage are increasing the availability and reliability of clean electricity in our communities—and are doing so more affordably and more sustainably.

Autonomous vehicles have the capacity to dramatically improve the affordability, availability and safety of transportation while reducing pollution, particularly in our increasingly dense global cities.

Optimus—our autonomous humanoid robot—is changing not only the perception of labor itself but its availability and capability. Jobs and tasks that are particularly monotonous or dangerous can now be accomplished by other means. In this way, Optimus’s mission is to give people back more time to do what they love.

Autonomy must benefit all of humanity.

The tools we make at Tesla help us build the products that advance human prosperity.

How we develop and use autonomy—and the new capabilities it makes available to us—should be informed by its ability to enhance the human condition. Making daily life better—and safer—for all people through our autonomous technology has always been, and continues to be, our focus.

Greater access drives greater growth

Making technologically advanced products that are affordable and available at scale is required to build a flourishing and unconstrained society. It serves to further democratize society while raising everyone’s quality of life in the process. The hallmark of meritocracy is creating opportunities that enable each person to use their skills to accomplish whatever they imagine.

Everyone deserves access to these opportunities, and technological growth can help ensure that each of us is able to maximise our most limited resource: time.

We’re accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable abundance.

We must make one thing clear: this challenge will be extremely difficult to overcome. The elimination of scarcity will require tireless and exquisite execution. Some will perceive it as impossible. And plenty of others will laud every obstacle and setback we inevitably encounter along the way. But once we overcome this challenge, our critics will come to see that what they once thought was impossible is indeed possible. And that will be fine with us, because what matters most is that, together, we create a sustainable and truly abundant future for generations to come.

All worthwhile journeys are long. And they all begin with a first step.

Our first step was to make an exciting sports car—a Roadster. Then we leveraged those profits to fund the development and production of more affordable, yet still exciting products—Model S and Model X. Then we repeated the process, bringing us to Model 3 and Model Y and onward.

This process required us to take many steps, some of them small and others large. But ultimately, each win led to another win, and even with our failures, we were able to keep building momentum. Our momentum allowed us to build out a fully integrated ecosystem of sustainable products, from transport to energy generation, battery storage and robotics.

Today we are on the cusp of a revolutionary period primed for unprecedented growth. And this time it will not be a single step but a leap forward for Tesla and humanity as a whole. The tools we are going to develop will help us build the kind of world that we've always dreamed of—a world of sustainable abundance—by redefining the fundamental building blocks of labour, mobility and energy at scale and for all.”",Tesla's Master Plan Part 4 was released on Tuesday.

BlackRock has banned employees from using company-issued devices during business trips to China, joining a growing list of global firms restricting travel to the world's second-largest economy amid escalating geopolitical tensions .The world's largest asset manager told staff in an internal memo that company iPhones, iPads, and laptops are prohibited during China visits, effective July 16, Bloomberg News reported. Instead, employees must use temporary loaner phones and cannot access BlackRock's network through virtual private networks.The restrictions apply to both business and personal travel, reflecting heightened security concerns that have gripped the financial industry.BlackRock's policy comes after Wells Fargo suspended all China travel following the detention of senior trade financing banker Chenyue Mao, who was blocked from leaving the country. Chinese officials said the case involved a criminal matter, but provided no further details.The incident has sent shockwaves through Wall Street, where firms are reassessing the risks of doing business in China. Several American citizens, including a US Commerce Department employee, have reportedly been prevented from leaving China in recent months. US-China relations have deteriorated significantly, creating operational challenges for global financial companies trying to navigate between the world's two largest economies. The tensions have forced many firms to scale back their China presence despite the market's enormous potential.Since China implemented stricter data security laws in 2021, international banks and asset managers have been required to establish onshore data centers, keeping Chinese data within the country's borders. This has increased operational costs and complicated business management.BlackRock maintains substantial China operations through a wholly-owned mutual fund firm and a wealth management joint venture with China Construction Bank Corp., making the new travel restrictions particularly significant for the asset manager's regional strategy.","BlackRock has banned employees from using company-issued devices during business trips to China.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently urged employees to maintain their ""growth mindset"" culture as the company undergoes massive AI transformation and workforce restructuring. Microsoft CEO said the same in a company-wide internal memo sent a few weeks after the company announced layoffs that will affect 15,000-plus employees. "" Growth mindset has served us well over the last decade—the everyday practice of being a learn-it-all, not a know-it-all,"" Nadella wrote to Microsoft's 200,000+ global workforce. ""It has reshaped our culture and helped us lead with greater humility and empathy. We need to keep that.""Nadella emphasized that this cultural foundation becomes even more critical as Microsoft pivots from a ""software factory to an intelligence engine"" while investing $80 billion in AI infrastructure. Despite cutting 7% of its workforce, Microsoft reported $75 billion in net income over three fiscal quarters and stock prices hitting record highs above $500 per share.Nadella described the current period as reminiscent of the early 1990s PC revolution, when personal computers and productivity software became standard in homes and offices. ""Teams are reorganizing. Scopes are expanding. New opportunities are everywhere,"" he wrote, acknowledging that ""transformation always is"" messy.The growth mindset culture centers on individual learning and continuous improvement. ""It starts with each of us as individuals and our personal drive to learn, improve, and get better every day,"" Nadella explained. ""Professional rewards, growth, and pride in our craft will always be the prime drivers.""However, Nadella connected personal development to Microsoft's broader mission of global empowerment. ""We each have the opportunity to connect our personal passion and philosophy of how we derive meaning from the work we do with Microsoft's mission to empower the world.""The CEO positioned current challenges as career-defining opportunities, telling employees: ""Years from now, when you look back at your time here, I hope you'll say: 'That's when I learned the most.

Data-sharing mandate for Google



Apple deal survives, investors cheer



Broader implications



In a landmark antitrust ruling, the US District Judge Amit Mehta has ruled that Google can retain its Android operating system and Chrome browser. The ruling decided not to break up Google’s core businesses, citing the rapid emergence of artificial intelligence companies — particularly ChatGPT-maker OpenAI — as a credible competitive threat to the search giant’s dominance.As reported by Business Insider, the decision concludes the five-year ling legal battle in which US Department of Justice (DOJ) accused Google of illegally monopolising the online search market via exclusive deals and control over platforms like Andorra and Chrome. The court does found out that Google was engaged in anticompetitive practices, but Judge Mehta ruled that structural remedies such as breaking up the company were unnecessary in light of shifting market dynamics.In the ruling Judge Mehta pointed out that the rapid rise in the generative AI tools acts as a disruptive force and is capable of challenging Google’s supremacy in search. He particularly referred to OpenAI’s popular chatbot ChatGPT and other AI-powered assistants as “better placed to compete with Google than any search engine developer has been in decades.”The Judge also argued that the these technologies have already managed to alter how people find and consume information. These technologies have also reduced the need for a traditional search engine and is also creating new kind of competitive pressure.The ruling has not dismantled Google, instead the court order the tech giant to share certain search data with its rivals which also includes AI firms in order to create a level playing field. This requirement is intended to help competitors train their models and improve their services, accelerating innovation in the search and AI sectors.Along with Android operating system and Google Chrome, the court has also allowed Google to continue paying Apple — reportedly around $20 billion annually in order to remain the default search engine on its devices. After this judgement, the shares of Alphabet rose by 7.2% and Apple also gained 3% in extended trading.The ruling underscores how quickly AI has shifted the competitive landscape in tech. By recognizing OpenAI and similar companies as viable challengers, the court signaled that the next phase of the search wars may be fought not between traditional web portals, but between search engines and AI assistants.","US District Judge Amit Mehta has ruled that Google can retain its Android operating system and Chrome browser.

Innovation boom masks financial troubles behind growth

China's electric vehicle industry, despite dominating global markets, faces government crackdown as officials struggle to contain ""involution"" - excessive competition that's driving manufacturers into ruinous price wars and creating dangerous overcapacity across the sector.President Xi Jinping led a July Politburo meeting declaring the government ""must reinforce industry self-discipline to prevent vicious 'involution' competition,"" as reported by The New York Times. The warning comes as fierce competition among 50 automakers has created a destructive cycle of slashing prices repeatedly, leaving manufacturers struggling to pay suppliers while continuing to borrow from state banks to build more factories.Even BYD , the world's largest electric vehicle maker, reported profits falling by nearly one-third in spring 2025 due to price competition pressures. The company exemplifies an industry where success breeds its own problems - Chinese EVs now make up over half of domestic car sales for five consecutive months, yet the sector's financial health deteriorates rapidly.The overcapacity crisis extends beyond manufacturers to dealers whose lots overflow with unsold inventory while being forced to promote vehicles below cost. Auto parts suppliers face months-long payment delays, forcing them into additional bank loans to survive. Four provincial dealership associations jointly complained that below-cost selling ""drags down the credibility and sustainable development of the entire industry.""Government intervention has shown limited success. While 17 automakers agreed in June to pay suppliers within 60 days, an August compliance report revealed only three state-owned companies had implemented proper payment systems, according to The New York Times analysis.Despite financial strain, the competition drives remarkable innovation. BYD's latest models feature dashboard-controlled drones and hydraulic ""dancing"" capabilities, while Geely offers luxury minivans with hammock-like reclining seats separated by privacy walls.This innovation surge stems from China's massive engineering workforce - producing ten times more mechanical engineers than the United States. BYD alone employs 120,000 engineers earning under $3,000 monthly, demonstrating how human capital advantages fuel technological advancement even amid financial turbulence.The industry now exports one-fifth of production globally, triggering Western trade backlash and tariffs while established players like Tesla struggle with aging models and declining China sales.","China's electric vehicle industry faces government crackdown as officials struggle to contain ""involution"" President Xi Jinping led a July Politburo meeting declaring the government ""must reinforce industry self-discipline to prevent vicious 'involution' competition"" Fierce competition among 50 automakers has created a destructive cycle of slashing prices repeatedly.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123673271,imgsize-1527114,width-400,resizemode-4/file-picture.jpg"
India's Water Purifier market surges 32% during Monsoon season: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/indias-water-purifier-market-surges-32-during-monsoon-season-report/articleshow/123672510.cms,"India's water purifier market reportedly experienced unprecedented growth as the monsoon season intensifies consumer focus on water safety and health protection. According to Croma's industry research, as these become top-of-mind for households across India, demand patterns at the Tata-owned retailer are also reflecting this with approximately 35% of annual water purifier purchases taking place during monsoons. The first quarter this year saw a spike in demand for water purifiers with strong double-digit growth, driven by heightened awareness of waterborne diseases including cholera, typhoid, and hepatitis A during the rainy season. The industry research claims to study consumer behaviour in this category.The research identified the following trends:* Regional Demand: North India leads RO purchases at 31%, followed by South (30%), West (25%) and East (15%).* Technology Preference: RO technology dominates, accounting for nearly 90% of electric water purifier sales; UV models form the remaining share.* Colour Trends: Black remains the top choice across regions, making up 62% of RO units and 53% of UV units sold; white accounts for about 30%.* Feature Popularity: Over half of units include UF and UV filtration; 15% have alkaline features; 8% use copper technology.* Premium Segment Shift: Mineral-adding functionality is increasingly popular in models priced above ₹15,000.A notable trend identified in the research is the 30% year-over-year growth in under-the-counter (UTC) purifier installations. These discreet systems, which fit neatly under the sink, are increasingly popular as they meet the modern consumer’s demand for minimalist aesthetics and clutter-free kitchen countertops. However, while UTC purifier installations are on the rise in modern kitchen designs, over 95% of customers still buy the standard water purifiers.Consumers choosing extended warranty plans also climbed, with an average 10% incidence year-round but spiking to 13.4% during FY25’s monsoon season compared to a projected 12.3% in FY26.“As the rains puts the spotlight on water safety, more families are coming to Croma looking for real answers, not just another appliance. Our experts cut through the jargon and help each customer find what is genuinely right for their home from advanced filtration needs to space-saving designs. We’re proud to be the trusted partner families rely on, especially during seasons like these.” said a spokesperson at Croma-Infiniti Retail Ltd.Regionally, Maharashtra continues to be Croma’s largest market, accounting for 25% of water purifier sales, followed by Karnataka at 15% and Gujarat at 12%. Telangana contributes 8%, while Uttar Pradesh and Delhi each represent 6% of the company’s purifier volumes.Urban centres continue to drive demand, with cities like Pune and Mumbai metropolitan areas leading consumption patterns.

What exactly is Platform fees



Online food delivery giant Zomato has once again increased its platform fee on orders to Rs 12 from Rs 10, excluding GST ahead of the upcoming festive season. This move from Zomato comes days after its rival Swiggy increased the platform fees to Rs 14 in select areas. Swiggy said that the company increased the fees due to the rise of order volumes.Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal announced the increase in platform fees for the first time on 2023. In August 2023, the company increased the platform fees by Rs 2. After that Zomato has increased the fees multiple times. In January 2024, Zomato increased the platform fees to Rs 4 and to Rs 7 in October. Last year also the company increased the platform fees to Rs 10 ahead of the festive season. “This fee helps us pay our bills to keep Zomato running. To maintain services during the festive rush, it has increased slightly,” a notification on the app said.The fees hike comes as growth in India’s online food delivery sector shows signs of cooling. For the April–June quarter, Zomato’s gross order value rose 16% year-on-year to Rs 10,769 crore—slower than the 20%+ growth seen in previous quarters. Parent company Eternal reported a 90% YoY drop in consolidated net profit to Rs 25 crore, despite a 70% jump in revenue.Platform fees are additional charges applied to each food order, separate from restaurant charges, delivery fees and goods and services tax. To be sure, the platform fee also attracts GST of 18%, which is not included in the Rs 10 levy. This means Zomato’s customers will pay Rs 11.80 on every order as platform fee inclusive of tax.According to a report in Economic Times, as per people tracking the sector, these platforms deliver 2-2.5 million food-delivery orders per day and any increase in platform fee improves their revenue.Incidentally, Swiggy was the first to start charging platform fees. Zomato followed suit and introduced the platform fee in 2023, as a Rs 2 per order flat levy. This amount has been subsequently increased over time by both the companies.",Zomato has once again increased its platform fee on orders to Rs 12 from Rs 10.

The world's richest man Elon Musk has consistently sounded the alarm about what he calls ""population collapse"" in Europe and other parts of the world. He has warned of ""population collapse"" in Singapore and Japan among Asian countries. Tesla CEO has repeated this warning for the West as well. He views declining birth rates as an existential threat to civilization, a greater danger than even global warming.On numerous occasions, he has stated that ""there will be no West if this continues,"" and has warned that a failure to reverse this trend will lead to economic stagnation, labor shortages, and societal decline. In a recent post on Twitter, he reiterated his population warning for Greece.Musk wrote, ""The death of Greece "". He quoted a report from Greek Reporter that said that hundreds of schools have closed in Greece this year as there are no students. ""More than 700 schools have been closed in Greece due to a prolonged demographic crisis. Greece has one of the lowest fertility rates in the European Union - around 1.3 births per woman, far below the replacement level of 2.1.

Gboard rolls out dedicated ‘font size’ setting for custom keyboard appearance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/gboard-rolls-out-dedicated-font-size-setting-for-custom-keyboard-appearance/articleshow/123661722.cms,"What changes and what doesn’t



Google’s Gboard is rolling out a new feature that gives users more control over how their keyboard looks: a dedicated ‘Font size’ setting that allows for personalized text scaling independent of system-wide display preferences. The update, currently available in Gboard beta version 15.9, introduces a new option under Settings > Preferences > Font size, where users can choose from increments ranging between 85% and 200%. The default setting is “Match System,” but users can now fine-tune the size of letters, numbers, and tool icons directly within the keyboard interface.While the font size adjustment affects key labels and icons in the suggestion strip, it does not impact emoji sizes—only the category titles above them. This means users can enjoy a more readable keyboard without altering the visual scale of emoji or other system elements.Screenshots from the Pixel 10 show noticeable differences between the smallest (85%) and largest (200%) settings, offering a more accessible experience for users with visual preferences or impairments.The font size feature follows recent visual updates to Gboard, including a pill-shaped redesign of the suggestion strip. Together, these changes reflect Google’s ongoing effort to make Gboard more customizable and user-friendly.Though the feature is still in limited beta rollout, it’s expected to reach more devices in the coming weeks. For users who rely on Gboard daily, this small tweak could make a big difference in comfort and usability.","Google’s Gboard is rolling out a new ‘Font size’ setting that allows for personalized text scaling independent of system-wide display preferences.

Apple's Foldable iPhone is Coming, Here’s Why it Matters

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced that it will roll out new safety guardrails for its AI chatbot by the end of the year. These new guardrails will specifically target teens and users in emotional distress. The announcement comes amid mounting criticism and legal action against the company after reports of the chatbot’s alleged involvement in tragic events, including suicides and murder.“We’ve seen people turn to it in the most difficult of moments. That’s why we continue to improve how our models recognize and respond to signs of mental and emotional distress, guided by expert input,” OpenAI said in a blog post.“This work has already been underway, but we want to proactively preview our plans for the next 120 days, so you won’t need to wait for launches to see where we’re headed,” the company added, noting that it will continue to work to launch “as many of these improvements as possible this year.”The move is a direct response to a growing number of cases where ChatGPT has been accused of failing to intervene or, in some instances, reinforcing harmful delusions. Last week, the parents of a 16-year-old in California filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, holding the company responsible for their son's death.Another report from The Wall Street Journal said that a case where a man killed himself and his mother after ChatGPT reinforced his ‘paranoid delusions’. The new measures are aimed at preventing such tragedies, though OpenAI currently directs users expressing suicidal intent to crisis hotlines, citing privacy as the reason for not reporting self-harm cases to law enforcement.The company said it is already beginning to route some ""sensitive conversations,"" such as those where signs of acute distress are detected, to more advanced reasoning models like GPT-5-thinking , which is designed to apply safety guidelines more consistently.To ensure the effectiveness of these new features, OpenAI is enlisting a network of over 90 physicians across 30 countries to provide input on mental health contexts and help evaluate the models.OpenAI is also strengthening protections for teen users. Currently, ChatGPT requires users to be at least 13 years old, with parental permission for those under 18. Within the next month, the company plans to allow parents to link their accounts with their teens' for more direct control.","ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced that it will roll out new safety guardrails for its AI chatbot by the end of the year.

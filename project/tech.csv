'A Very Positive Case Study': Meta AI chief Alexandr Wang Praises India's AI Startup Ecosystem

Software engineers can heave a sigh of relief. Your job may get changed/altered a bit, but it is not going anywhere according to the CEO of India's second-biggest IT company Infosys. In an interview to Economic Times, Infosys CEO Salil Parekh spoke about a range of issues including the impact of AI tools on the core business of IT services companies like Infosys. Asked specifically on what he thinks of the view that the IT services industry is going to be decimated by AI tools in next five years. Infosys CEO said, "" If you look at the size of tech services, it’s $1.5 trillion in overall global market size. Our analysis is that the AI services market is $300-400 billion. Going by this, it therefore stands to reason that far from getting decimated, the Indian IT industry will be thriving in 2030. Infosys will leverage those six areas of growth, and we’ll see that we get revenues from these six areas of growth.""On the impact of Agentic AI tools on companies like Infosys, Parekh said, ""Whenever a technology comes in, it is a brownfield area—somewhat old and new.Greenfield is when something is entirely new. What is likely to happen with these technologies is that we need to coexist with everything because it is not that overnight everything is going to be replaced. The foundational models are very ahead in terms of innovation. But dispersion within a large enterprise is slower. That is where our engineering is needed to make sure it works within your organisation.""Parekh said that the business environment looks a lot more positive, especially in the US. ""The macro at this stage is looking better than it was 12 months ago. At least in the US market, they have reduced the regulations quite significantly. There's at least some talk that interest rates may further come down. When we talk to people, the sense we get is that they feel the business environment is more supportive,"" he said.Parekh talked about Infosys hiring from campuses in the past year when asked about the future of work considering that IT services in India are known to employ a significant part of the country's middle class. ""Look at the data. This year, through March, we will end up recruiting 20,000 college graduates in India. We’ve already had 18,000 at the end of Q3. That’s just the college graduates. We’ve already announced that we will recruit 20,000 college graduates next year. What tends to happen is that some of these projects will require more people over time. Yes, they will also use agents, but the overall size will still be larger. If you assume the IT spend, or work is the same, then there is more of this view (of job losses). To have more headcount is still more positive than negative. What we see is some of the skills that the individuals will have, even as they enter the workforce or over time, will give them more specialisation,"" he said.On criticism about how the Indian IT services industry has not given back enough to the startup ecosystem, Parekh said, ""Infosys has an innovation fund in which we actually invest a lot. We could always do more, but the startup ecosystem focus is very broad, whereas Infosys has a narrow focus, to work with its global clients. Wherever there is an overlap, there's a tremendous amount of work going on. We've made some investments in data analytics work, healthcare work and so on. ""On Infosys' AI strategy, CEO Parekh said, ""We are building agents for clients using the foundational models. At the AI day, we had about 10 or 12 client examples that were shown.

That is a major component of our AI strategy. Another is a process where, if you have a customer service process (we help) you change the process using agents and, reducing the time, increase the quality and so on.

What Meta said about shifting Horizon Worlds' focus from VR to mobile



Meta is changing its metaverse strategy once again. The social media giant is now making a major change to the Horizon Worlds VR-exclusive app, originally designed for Meta Quest headsets. Meta said it will separate its Quest VR ecosystem from the free, social 3D virtual experience and shift its focus largely to mobile users to compete with Roblox and Fortnite.This comes after the company laid off about 10% of its Reality Labs division, closed three VR studios, stopped new content for the VR fitness app Supernatural, and discontinued its metaverse platform for work. In 2021, the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg also changed the company’s name, and last year, Meta’s Reality Labs lost $20 billion.In a blog post, Samantha Ryan, Reality Labs’ VP of content, said Meta is “explicitly separating” its “Quest VR platform from our Worlds platform” and “shifting the focus of Worlds to be almost exclusively mobile.”Horizon Worlds was originally launched for VR, but the company now plans to compete more directly with platforms like Roblox and Fortnite that offer user-generated experiences on smartphones.Ryan said, ""To truly change the game and tap into a much larger market, we’re going all-in on mobile.”“We’re in a strong position to deliver synchronous social games at scale, thanks to our unique ability to connect those games with billions of people on the world’s biggest social networks. You saw this strategy start to unfold in 2025, and now, it’s our main focus,” she noted.She even added that Meta will prioritise support for third-party developers in VR.“While we’re proud of the world-class work from Oculus Studios over the years, among 1P and 3P apps, 86% of the effective time people spend in their VR headsets is with third-party apps,” she said, underscoring the company’s shift in emphasis within its Reality Labs division.What we know about Meta VR hardware's futureMeta said it will continue developing VR hardware despite the strategic shift. “We have a robust roadmap of future VR headsets that will be tailored to different audience segments as the market grows and matures,” Ryan said, adding that upcoming devices, which could include a new mainline Quest headset, may come at a higher price point.Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth also discussed the company’s evolving approach in a recent episode of the Access podcast.Following its earlier push into the metaverse, Zuckerberg has increasingly positioned AI as central to the company’s future social platforms. The approach could include AI-generated games that users can create and share through their social feeds.“There are 3D versions of that, and there are 2D versions of that and Horizon, I think, fits very well with the kind of immersive 3D version of that,” Zuckerberg said during the company’s latest earnings call.","Horizon Worlds was originally launched for VR, but the company now plans to compete more directly with platforms like Roblox and Fortnite.

Common methods of used to infect ATMs

How ATM malware works

What are the Physical Indicators of an infected ATM

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has released a flash to disseminate indicators of compromise (IOCs) and technical details associated with malware enabled ATM jackpotting. Threat actors exploitphysical and software vulnerabilities in ATMs and deploy malware to dispense cash without a legitimate transaction. The FBI has observed an increase in ATM jackpotting incidents across the United States. Out of 1,900 ATM jackpotting incidents reported since 2020, over 700 of them with more than $20 million in losses occurred in 2025 alone. This FLASH is being provided to encourage organizations to implement the recommended mitigation steps and to outline the information requested from the public.Threat actors are deploying ATM jackpotting malware, including the Ploutus family malware, to infect ATMs and force them to dispense cash. Ploutus malware exploits the eXtensions for Financial Services (XFS), the layer of software that instructs an ATM what to physically do. When a legitimate transaction occurs, the ATM application sends instructions through XFS for bank authorization. If a threat actor can issue their own commands to XFS, they can bypass bank authorization entirely and instruct the ATM to dispense cash on demand.As a result, Ploutus allows threat actors to force an ATM to dispense cash without using a bank card, customer account, or bank authorization. Once Ploutus is installed on an ATM, it gives threat actors direct control over the machine, allowing them to trigger cash withdrawals. Ploutus attacks the ATM itself rather than customer accounts, enabling fast cash-out operations that can occur in minutes and are often difficult to detect until after the money is withdrawn.After gaining access to ATMs, most often by opening an ATM face with widely available generic keys, ATM jackpotting threat actors have used several main methods to deploy malware:• Criminals remove the ATM’s hard drive, connect it to their computer, copy the malware to the hard drive, return the hard drive to the ATM, and reboot the ATM.• Criminals remove the ATM’s hard drive, replace it with a foreign hard drive or other external device with preloaded malware, and reboot the ATM.The malware interacts directly with the ATM hardware, bypassing any communications or security of the original ATM software. The malware does not require connection to an actual bank customer account todispense cash. The malware can be used across ATMs of different manufacturers with very little adjustment to the code as the Windows operating system is exploited during the compromise.* ATM door open alerts outside of planned maintenance schedule* Low/No cash indicators outside of expected use schedule* Unauthorized devices plugged into the ATM* Removal of hard drives from ATMs* ATM unexpectedly out of service","Threat actors are deploying ATM jackpotting malware, including the Ploutus family malware, to infect ATMs and force them to dispense cash.

Renewed UFO debate fuels online speculation

A social media post by conservative commentator Candace Owens has resurfaced after former US president Donald Trump said he would direct federal agencies to begin identifying and releasing government files related to aliens and unidentified flying objects. The older clip, in which Owens suggested that technology figures including Elon Musk , Peter Thiel and Sam Altman were “not human”, has circulated widely across X in recent days. The renewed attention follows Trump’s statement on Truth Social that his administration would move to release material concerning extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena and UFOs, citing strong public interest. The convergence of those events has drawn fresh online debate and speculation.Trump wrote on Truth Social that he would direct the Secretary of War and other departments to begin the process of identifying and releasing files linked to alien and extraterrestrial life, as well as unidentified aerial phenomena and UFOs. He said the move was based on what he described as tremendous public interest. Later remarks repeated that federal agencies would start reviewing material for release.Interest in UFOs has grown in recent years, particularly after US authorities examined reports of unusual aircraft sightings. Officials have said some incidents remain unexplained, though no confirmed evidence of extraterrestrial origin has been presented.Against that backdrop, an older video of Owens has gained new traction. In the clip, she speculated that prominent technology leaders were not human and claimed there was “something wrong”.The remarks were made in a broader discussion about artificial intelligence and rapid advances in technology. At the time, the comments were criticised by some online users as conspiratorial. They have now reappeared in feeds alongside Trump’s announcement. Neither Musk nor Altman has responded to the revived claims. Both have previously spoken publicly about artificial intelligence risks and future technologies, but not in connection with alien life.Online interest in UAP and UFO disclosures has ebbed and flowed for decades. Recent congressional hearings and declassified reports have kept the topic in public view. The latest announcement appears to have stirred that interest again. For now, the focus remains on what, if anything, will be released.","Candace Owens suggested technology figures including Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Sam Altman were ‘not human’ In the clip, she speculated that prominent technology leaders were not human and claimed there was ‘something wrong’ The renewed attention follows Trump’s statement on Truth Social that his administration would move to release material concerning extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena and UFOs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128617061,imgsize-976858,width-400,resizemode-4/are-elon-musk-and-sam-altman-not-human-internet-erupts-after-podcasters-claim-goes-viral-as-donald-trump-teases-ufo-files.jpg"

China is extremely good at scaling and manufacturing and is also strong in AI—the models being released there are already quite good and are improving rapidly.”

Why the hype around Chinese humanoid robot market has increased



“We’re gonna take the Model S and X production space in our Fremont factory and convert that into an Optimus factory … with the long-term goal of having 1 million units a year of Optimus robots in the current SX space in Fremont,”

“we’re still very much at the early stages of Optimus,”

“We wouldn’t expect to have any kind of significant Optimus production volume until probably end of this year,”

China's annual CCTV Spring Festival Gala, which is often compared to the US Super Bowl, showcased humanoid robots from four domestic startups during the Lunar New Year celebrations this week. This highlights the country's push to lead in robotics and manufacturing. The demonstration comes after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said China would be a key competitor in the humanoid robot market.During Tesla's earnings call last year, Musk said,The gala featured robots from Unitree Robotics, Galbot, Noetix, and MagicLab performing martial arts and fight sequences with swords, poles, and nunchucks alongside human child performers. The event served as a showcase for China's industrial policy and its ambitions in humanoid robotics.China is the world's largest manufacturer and user of robots. According to an industry report by Omdia, Chinese robotics firm AgiBot shipped over 5,100 humanoid robots in 2025, securing a 39% share of the global humanoid robot market.The attention surrounding China's humanoid robot sector comes as major players, including AgiBot and Unitree prepare for initial public offerings this year. Moreover, domestic artificial intelligence (AI) startups release a range of frontier models during the nine-day Lunar New Year public holiday.Last year's gala drew widespread attention with 16 full-size Unitree humanoids twirling handkerchiefs and dancing alongside human performers. Unitree's founder met President Xi Jinping weeks later at a notable tech symposium, which was the first of its kind since 2018.Xi has met five robotics startup founders in the past year, comparable to the four electric vehicle and four semiconductor entrepreneurs he met in the same timeframe, giving the emerging sector considerable visibility.Behind the spectacle of robots running marathons and executing kung fu kicks and backflips, China has positioned robotics and AI at the heart of its next-generation AI manufacturing strategy, aiming for productivity gains from automation to offset pressures from its ageing workforce.Elon Musk has said he expects his key competitors to be Chinese companies as he pivots Tesla toward a focus on embodied AI and its humanoid robot Optimus.Last month, Musk said that Tesla is betting on a future driven less by cars and more by humanoid robots, reiterating comments he made last year. During Tesla’s earnings call this week, Elon Musk outlined plans to shift focus away from vehicles toward its Optimus robots, saying the company would discontinue the Model S and Model X to prioritise robot production. Tesla said it will end production of the Model S and Model X and repurpose the California facility that built those vehicles to manufacture Optimus robots.Musk said.In 2024, Musk said Optimus could eventually make Tesla a $25 trillion company, compared with its current market value of about $1.4 trillion, and previously stated that 80% of Tesla’s value could come from robots.While Musk said Tesla plans to build a production line capable of producing one million Optimus units annually, he also acknowledged thatdescribing it as a research and development effort.Musk added.","China's annual CCTV Spring Festival Gala showcased humanoid robots from four domestic startups during the Lunar New Year celebrations this week.

Price spikes and “RAMmageddon”



Industry fallout due to global chip crisis



Echoes of past supply chain shocks



Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Xiaomi President Lu Weibing and many others are warning about a global crisis unfolding: Shortage of memory chips. The scarcity of memory chips led to their soaring costs. As a report in Bloomberg says it is beginning to hammer profits, derail corporate plans and inflate price tags on everything from laptops and smartphones to automobiles and data centers — and the crunch is only going to get worse.As per the Bloomberg report, the main driver of the squeeze is the buildout of AI data centers. Companies like Alphabet and OpenAI are buying millions of Nvidia AI accelerators, each needing a massive amounts of DRAM. This has left the consumer electronics maker fighting over dwindling supplies from Samsung and Micron. Elon Musk has also suggested that Tesla may need to build its own fabrication plant, “he said in January.The report also adds that the memory prices are increasing and going at an unprecedented levels. One of the type of DRAM jumped by 75% in a single month, with retailers adjusting prices daily. Industry insiders have dubbed the crisis “RAMmageddon.” Tim Cook warned that iPhone margins will be compressed, while Micron called the bottleneck “unprecedented.”The report also revealed the industry fallout on the global chip crisis.The report adds that Sony may delay its next PlayStation console to 2028 or 2029. Also, Nintendo is also thinking raising the prices of Switch 2. Xiaomi and Oppo may also cut shipment forecasts for 2026. Cisco cited the memory squeeze in a weak profit outlook, triggering its worst share loss in nearly four years. Lastly, Qualcomm and Arm Holdings also warned of more fallout.This global chip crisis recall the Covid-era chip shortages, but this time the driver is AI. Tech giants Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Google are pouring hundreds of billions into AI infrastructure, diverting memory production toward high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for AI accelerators. That leaves less capacity for standard DRAM used in everyday electronics.Bernstein’s Mark Li says memory prices are going “parabolic.” Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing warned the crunch will last at least through the year. Counterpoint Research estimates DRAM shortages will persist across electronics, telecom, and automotive industries, with signs of panic buying already visible.",Report: Shortage of memory chips led to soaring costs.

Anand Mahindra’s post resonated with the fans



India vs Pakistan: India won the match and entered Super 8 stage



Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra took to social media to celebrate India's victory in the India vs Pakistan T20 World Cup 2026 match. Mahindra took to social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to congratulate the Indian cricket team on their latest cricketing success. Mahindra emphasised that “No matter the gap on paper, the real difference is made on the field.” He praised the team’s grit and determination, noting that belief and resilience can overcome any odds.“Yes, India outclassed Pakistan in terms of talent, and many saw the result as inevitable.Some even say the rivalry is now non-existent. But victory is never inevitable in sport. An India–Pakistan clash carries so much history, emotion, and immense pressure.No matter the gap on paper, the psychological weight is real. So here’s to you Men in Blue You won on the field, in your minds, and in our hearts,” wrote Mahindra.Mahindra's tweet resonated with many Indian cricket fans. Many echoed his sentiment, highlighting that India’s victory was not just about skill but about courage, unity, and the ability to rise above challenges. His post quickly gained traction, adding to the wave of national pride following the match.“Sir, beautifully said!The scoreboard might show dominance, but the weight of history, the roar of the crowd, and that unbeatable pressure make every India-Pakistan game a true battle of nerves and heart.The Men in Blue handled it with class today, Kishan's fireworks, Bumrah's magic, and the team's composure under lights made it special.This rivalry isn't fading; it's evolving, and wins like this remind us why we still hold our breath every time these two teams meet.Jai Hind!, wrote a user on X.“Absolutely, the India-Pakistan rivalry is legendary and steeped in so much more than just sport.No matter the odds, every match holds its own drama and passion. That’s what keeps fans glued and makes every game unpredictable!,” wrote another user.India put on a dominant show against their arch-rivals Pakistan, routing them by 61 runs in a high-stakes Group A clash of the T20 World Cup 2026 at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. The win not only boosted India’s confidence but also secured their place in the Super 8 stage.The Powerplay belonged to India, and the batsmen capitalized brilliantly. Kishan’s record-breaking strike rate, combined with sensible partnerships in the middle, ensured India set a target that Pakistan struggled to chase.","Anand Mahindra took to social media platform X to congratulate the Indian cricket team on their latest cricketing success.

Mackenzie Scott, former wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has said that her approach to large-scale philanthropy is shaped by acts of kindness she received during her early years. In an essay published on her philanthropic organisation, Yield Giving website in October, Scott said she often thinks about the people who helped her when she struggled financially as a college student. She recalled borrowing money from her college roommate to avoid dropping out and receiving free dental care from a local dentist when she could not afford treatment.“It is these ripple effects that make imagining the power of any of our own acts of kindness impossible,” Scott wrote in the essay. “Whose generosity did I think of every time I made every one of the thousands of gifts I’ve been able to give?”“It was the local dentist who offered me free dental work when he saw me securing a broken tooth with denture glue in college. It was the college roommate who found me crying, and acted on her urge to loan me a thousand dollars to keep me from having to drop out in my sophomore year.”Scott, one of the most active philanthropists in recent times, has donated about 58 million Amazon shares since 2020, significantly reducing the stake she received following her divorce from Bezos in 2019. After the divorce, Mackenzie Scott received roughly a 4% stake in Amazon, amounting to about 139 million shares at the time.She has since cut that holding by around 42%.Despite this, Scott remains worth close to $28 billion, even after donating about $26 billion through her Yield Giving organisation, which she launched in 2022.Yield Giving has supported thousands of organisations across areas such as education, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), disaster relief, and community development. In recent months alone, Scott donated more than $400 million to education- and DEI-focused groups, with several recipients receiving the largest donations in their history.Recently, Garry Tan, CEO of Y Combinator shared an X post writing: ""MacKenzie Scott has given away $26B faster than anyone in history — with no oversight, and no accountability for the chaos that follows. This is not stewardship. Real philanthropy requires real care and attention. Pour sugar on the floor? You get ants."". The post caught the attention of Elon Musk who replied in affirmation. ""Yup,"" he repied endorsing Tan's critique of MacKenzie Scott's $26.4 billion donations since 2019.","Mackenzie Scott, former wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has said that her approach to large-scale philanthropy is shaped by acts of kindness.

David Greene: Popular radio show host David Greene claims Google stole his voice; Google responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/popular-radio-show-host-david-greene-claims-google-stole-his-voice-google-responds/articleshow/128414462.cms,"What David Greene says

Google responds to the lawsuit

Popular radio show host David Greene has sued Google , alleging the tech giant of ‘stealing’ his voice for its NotebookLM tool, which uses AI to create on-demand podcasts. The lawsuit, filed in Santa Clara County alleges that Google cloned Greene’s voice and distinctive broadcasting style without permission or compensation. Greene argues that Google’s NotebookLM T tool voice's rhythm, intonation, and even his characteristic verbal tics are so similar that even his friends, colleagues, and listeners assumed he'd licensed his voice to Google.“So... I’m probably the 148th person to ask this, but did you license your voice to Google? It sounds very much like you!,” a former co-worker asked David Greene in a fall 2024 email, a Washington Post report says.“I was, like, completely freaked out,” Greene told the publication, adding “It’s this eerie moment where you feel like you’re listening to yourself.”Greene said the AI voice sounds very similar to his own, and that the impact goes beyond losing a chance to make money from his best-known asset. “My voice is, like, the most important part of who I am,” Greene reportedly said.In the lawsuit, Greene’s lawyer argues that the recordings make the resemblance clear.“We have faith in the court and encourage people to listen to the example audio themselves,” said Joshua Michelangelo Stein, a partner at the firm Boies Schiller Flexner.Google responded denying the allegations. Google spokesperson José Castañeda told Washington Post: “These allegations are baseless. The sound of the male voice in NotebookLM’s Audio Overviews is based on a paid professional actor Google hired.”The Washington Post reported, “The lawsuit is the latest to pit the rights of individual human creators against the rights of a burgeoning AI industry that promises to transform the economy by enabling the on-demand generation of stunningly lifelike speech, prose, images, and video. Behind the artificial voices found in tools like NotebookLM are language models trained on vast libraries of real-life human text and speech. The humans used to train these models are unaware that their words and voices will be used by AI, raising serious questions about copyright and ownership.”","Popular radio show host David Greene has sued Google, alleging the tech giant of ‘stealing’ his voice for its NotebookLM tool, which uses AI to create on-demand podcasts.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently drew a comparison between today’s large technology companies and East India Company. In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Sridhar Vembu wrote: “Big tech is bigger than most sovereign nations. ""East India Company"" is the way to think about them”. While he did not name any single company in his post, Vembu was responding to a post noting that Google raised $32 billion in debt in a single day—an amount comparable to what a large country like India raises over several months—and issued a 100-year bond, a time horizon longer than many government bonds.“Google raised $32B of debt in 1 day, what a sovereign government like India raises in 100 days. Google also issued a 100-year bond worth $1B, which is longer than India's longest at 40 years. Big tech now operates like sovereign nations with fundraising size and time horizons,” the X post said. It referred to a Google’s recent sale of a rare 100-year bond in British pounds as part of its massive multi-currency debt raise, making it the first tech company to attempt a century bond since IBM did it back in 1996.Sridhar Vembu’s X post has sparked debate online. Commenting on Vembu's post, one user replied “They are the new EIC, but operating on a different plane of existence.The 'Money' layer of control is collapsing, so the elites are shifting to the 'Data' layer.

Anime-themed games on Roblox are everywhere right now. Some fade fast. Others stick around because they keep players coming back. Anime Paradox seems to fall into the second category. At first glance, it looks like another tower defence title with familiar anime faces and flashy attacks. But spend a little time with it, and the grind becomes obvious. Progress slows quickly, upgrades demand patience, and free rewards feel essential rather than optional for anyone hoping to stay competitive. Anime Paradox February codes let you redeem gems, stat chips, trait rerolls, and more.For players trying to build a decent team without sinking hours into farming, they matter.Below is the list of all working Anime Paradox codes in February 2026.Anime Paradox is a Roblox tower defence game where players summon and command powerful anime-style units to fend off waves of enemies and bosses as they defend a base.

One of world’s biggest toilet maker Toto called ‘most undervalued and overlooked AI company’ as it uses…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/one-of-worlds-biggest-toilet-maker-toto-called-most-undervalued-and-overlooked-ai-company-as-it-uses/articleshow/128616689.cms,"Activist investor Palliser Capital is championing Toto, the Japanese toilet maker, as a hidden AI gem. Palliser highlights Toto's advanced ceramics, crucial for memory chip manufacturing, contributing significantly to profits. The fund urges better disclosure and capital allocation to unlock the company's undervalued potential in the booming AI sector.

Toto’s ceramics are built for the kind of extreme cold that advanced chip-making demands

Shares are up 60% in a year, but Palliser sees another 55% upside

Palliser has been pushing hard across corporate Japan

UK-based activist investor Palliser Capital has taken a significant stake in Japan’s Toto—the company best known for heated toilet seats and Washlet bidets—calling it “the most undervalued and overlooked AI memory beneficiary. ” The fund sent a letter to Toto’s board last week, urging the company to do a better job of showcasing its advanced ceramics business, which quietly contributes over 40% of operating profit.At the heart of Palliser’s argument are electrostatic chucks (ESCs)—precision ceramic components that hold silicon wafers in place during memory chip manufacturing. Toto has been making these since the 1980s, drawing on decades of ceramics know-how that originally came from building toilets. But it’s only in recent years, with AI-driven demand sending memory chip prices through the roof, that this side of the business has started pulling serious weight.The company’s ESCs are engineered to stay stable at very low temperatures, making them essential for cryogenic etching—a process used to carve ultra-deep channels in 3D NAND chips that are now stacked over 200 layers high. As memory architectures get more complex, the need for components like Toto’s only grows.The chucks combine cold-resistant ceramics with integrated heaters and cooling channels to maintain uniform wafer temperatures even under intense plasma and vacuum conditions.Palliser, now among Toto’s top 20 shareholders, believes the company holds a five-year competitive moat before rivals can catch up. The fund projects 30% or more revenue growth for the ceramics segment over the next two years, fuelled by the ongoing NAND upgrade cycle.Toto’s stock has already climbed sharply—up over 60% in the past year and nearly 40% in 2026 alone. Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “buy” last month, pointing to profit growth potential from expanding AI data centre investments. Still, Palliser argues the market hasn’t fully caught on, estimating a valuation gap of roughly ¥554 billion ($3.6 billion). The fund says fixing disclosure, tightening capital allocation, and putting Toto’s ¥76 billion ($496 million) net cash to better use could unlock that value.Founded by former Elliott Management executive James Smith , Palliser has become a key player in Japan’s shareholder activism wave. Its other stakes include property firm Tokyo Tatemono, Keisei Electric Railway, and Japan Post Holdings. The fund bought into Toto roughly six months ago and isn’t just asking for better storytelling—it wants more investment directed toward the high-margin ceramics unit rather than the slower-growing bathroom business. When a toilet maker is being pitched as critical AI infrastructure, it’s a sign the boom is reshaping supply chain thinking in ways few saw coming.","Activist investor Palliser Capital is championing Toto, the Japanese toilet maker, as a hidden AI gem.

Former Meta AI scientist and one of the godfathers of modern artificial intelligence (AI), Yann LeCun, has revealed another task in which humans can beat the technology. Speaking at the India AI Impact Summit 2026, he said that large language models, whilestill fall short on tasks like driving that humans can handle with relative ease. LeCun acknowledged that AI systems can pass the bar exam and perform well in Maths Olympiads but said a more fundamental gap remains, noting that the technology still lags behind real-world intelligence.he said, highlighting thatLeCun explained that AI excels at information retrieval and symbolic reasoning but lacks a true understanding of the physical world. He compared large language models to an evolution of the printing press, libraries and the internet.he added.LeCun said that humans and animals learn through observation and interaction, gradually formingthat help predict outcomes and adjust to new situations.He also stated that, unlike human learning, AI systems are not yet able to function properly in complex, unpredictable environments, which limits the potential of robots and autonomous cars compared to human learning.Speaking about the use of AI in education and development, LeCun described AI as a technology meant to assist, not replace, human capabilities. According to him, AI has the potential to enhance human intelligence and expand access to knowledge, much as the printing press did in the past.He also noted that countries with younger, educated populations, including India and several regions of Africa, may play a larger role in AI innovation if investments are made in skills development and infrastructure.LeCun, a professor at New York University and the executive chairman of AMI Labs, works in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics and is also an ACM Turing Award laureate.He also recently publicly questioned OpenAI’s claims about achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) following a social media exchange with OpenAI vice president Sebastien Bubeck. The discussion, which took place on X (formerly Twitter), reflected differing views on research transparency and whether a single company could develop AGI.LeCun criticised OpenAI’s research practices for being conducted largely behind closed doors and rejected the notion that AGI would emerge from one organisation or a single breakthrough, stating that OpenAI does not have a monopoly on innovation.","Yann LeCun said that large language models fall short on tasks that humans can handle with relative ease.

India’s consumer technology landscape is entering a decisive new phase, defined not just by isolated devices, but by intelligent, seamlessly interconnected ecosystems that touch every part of modern life. This shift is being accelerated by India’s rapid digital transformation, where connected IoT devices are expected to represent a $35 billion market by 2030. Increasingly, value is no longer created by individual products alone, but by how seamlessly they work together to deliver integrated, intuitive experiences.At the same time, today’s digitally mature consumers expect much more than incremental improvements on specsheets. They seek holistic experiences that span work, mobility, entertainment, health, payments, and their homes, demonstrating how digital technologies have become deeply embedded in everyday behaviour and interactions.India’s tablet market rebounded by 33% quarter-on-quarter Q3 2025. LED TVs with screen sizes above 55” continue to gain increasing traction among customers. There is a visible shift towards premium, high-performance devices across categories, from smartphones and tablets to large-screen TVs and wearables, signalling a clear transition from volume-led adoption to value-driven choices.More importantly, this isn’t just about purchasing more devices but about building a portfolio of products that work together to deliver one seamless user experience.Within a single ecosystem, consumers can now move effortlessly across entertainment, health, payments, work, and mobility. A movie started on a smart TV continues on a tablet, fitness insights from a wearable sync instantly with health apps, digital wallets integrate smoothly across devices, and work files remain accessible across screens. This continuity allows one user, through one ecosystem, to stay connected to every part of their digital life without disruption, turning multiple devices into one unified experience.At the heart of this transformation lies the growth of the unified device service ecosystem, where the entire tech ecosystem operates as a unified network, each reinforcing the other to deliver a more intuitive, responsive, and personalised digital experience. With globalIoT connections reaching 19.8 billion in 2025, the demand for seamless is accelerating, and this shift is being fueled by several powerful forces.First, ubiquitous connectivity has made real-time interaction between devices an expectation, with users seeking uninterrupted access to their digital world at home, at work, and on the move. Second, greater accessibility to information and services has turned devices into gateways for productivity, communication, entertainment, and commerce from anywhere. Lastly, evolving behavioural patterns are also reshaping technology use, as consumers juggle multiple roles across work, health, and personal life. Ecosystems reduce the cognitive load of constant context-switching, enabling seamless multitasking without the fear of missing out. This is paired with a growing demand for convenience without compromise, users expect devices to sync effortlessly while still delivering high performance across scenarios.Together, these forces are shifting focus from standalone device capabilities to ecosystem intelligence. For brands, future success will depend less on individual specifications and more on how seamlessly products integrate, learn from user behaviour, and deliver consistent cross-device experiences. The winners will be those that build not just devices, but adaptive ecosystems that move with the rhythm of everyday life.Connectivity and ecosystem intelligence are the backbone of this transformation. 5G and software/OS adoption is mainstream, with nearly 90% of smartphone shipments in India now supporting 5G, including affordable segments. Smartphones and tablets have evolved into intelligent command centres, orchestrating IoT-enabled appliances, wearables, and energy systems, ensuring continuity across notifications, media, and daily routines. This shift from standalone connectivity to ecosystem intelligence is redefining convenience, efficiency, and everyday digital experiences for Indian consumers.The wearables market also continues to grow, now anticipating user needs and enhancing their lifestyle by offering implementable changes and providing real-time insights based on biometric data. Interconnectivity with other devices enables them to act as substitutes for more complex devices, enabling simple tasks on the fly. Machine learning helps further optimize user experience over time through the collected data.The automotive space has been integrated into the tech ecosystem as well. Smartphones are now equipped with smart controls, automatic key locks, infotainment operability, driver assist safety and parking systems along with connected features such as geo tagging and fencing, remote diagnostics and over the web software updates for the vehicle beyond basic utility features.Smart cars have become entities that are connected on multiple channels (such as Vehicle to Vehicle, Vehicle to Infrastructure, Vehicle to Pedestrian and Vehicle to Cloud), sharing real time data to enhance safety, convenience features and overall user experience on the road. Such interoperability has resulted in increasing collaborations between the two sectors, with the resulting innovations transforming both automotive and consumer tech experiences.Home appliances and security systems are now integrated across devices and can be operated remotely. TVs and tablets serve as multi-user “family screens” with adaptive interfaces and stylus input. Smart displays adapt multi-user interfaces dynamically, prioritizing notifications, content, and device functions per user profile. Interconnectivity of Appliances, home security, and energy management are managed through a common device through voice and gesture interfaces enabling intuitive control. Cross-device AI reasoning ensures consistent, seamless, and contextually relevant experiences across the ecosystem, creating a truly connected lifestyle.Availability and accessibility is critical in scaling ecosystem engagement. The distribution network helps create product awareness and increases customer inquiries which directly correlates to sales. Offline and online retail channels contribute roughly equally to adoption. Finally, aftermarket support is the deciding factor that builds trust in the brand and promotes ecosystem growth. Service centres, rapid repair networks, and predictive maintenance systems reinforce trust and device longevity. Faster service times and easier accessibility to remote diagnostics and over the web vehicle service, ensures that ecosystem devices remain reliable and accessible over time. This reliability drives consumer confidence and encourages deeper cross platform integration in daily life.The trajectory is clear: Indian consumers are prioritizing devices that enhance lifestyle, improve health monitoring, and integrate seamlessly into their homes and routines. The ecosystem approach, powered by next-generation connectivity, automation in devices, improved processing powers, and comprehensive aftermarket support, is not just reshaping technology adoption—it is defining the future of connected living in India.","India’s tablet market rebounded by 33% quarter-on-quarter Q3 2025.

Iiris: AI-powered smart security



RaiLabs: AI that prevents derailments

While the buzz at the India AI Impact Summit 2026 is all about Big Tech promising billion of investment over the coming years, India AI startups have showcased some meaningful solutions with practical applications. These solutions are actively teaching students, guarding warehouses and keeping trains on their tracks.The first is an AI solution SATHEE (Self Assessment, Test and Help for Entrance Exams). It is an an initiative of the Ministry of Education and IIT Kanpur, and was launched in 2023. It provides free personal AI-led preparation and mentorship support for eight major competitive examinations: JEE, NEET, CLAT, ICAR, CUET, SSC, RRB and IBPS.SATHEE offers AI-based doubt resolution, Study Plan Generators, Confusion Detection Tools and Automatic transcript summarisation. With the help of SATHEE, students can generate personalised study plans based on available study hours in selected subjects. The content is currently available in 13 Indian languages, with further expansion underway.Iiris is a solution that integrates AI in the traditional security solutions.For example, if you have a real estate property, the company will have a comprehensive security risk assessment and design AI Based security solutions tailored to the requirements. Iiris does not replace the hardware but uses AI-driven software to supercharge the existing system. What’s beneficial is that it removes the cumbersome process of reviewing entire footage if an incident happened by turning existing cameras into “intelligent filters”.The firm is currently applying this tech to projects, including the Vrindavan Chandrodaya Mandir in Mathura, set to be the world's tallest temple.The third application on display involves railway safety. RailLabs showcased its autonomous robot, Arista, which rolls along tracks to find defects that the human eye might miss. It uses ultrasonic sensors to find hidden internal cracks inside the metal, laser profiling to check the shape and wear of the tracks, and ChakrVue System – an AI tool installed on 20 LHB and Tejas coaches that predicts if a wheel will chip or fail before it actually happens.According to the founders, this AI-driven approach is 200% more efficient than manual inspections and is already active in cities like Mumbai, Agartala, and Ranchi.","SATHEE is an initiative of the Ministry of Education and IIT Kanpur.

What is 'synthetically generated' content that the government wants to monitor

""hypothetical, draft, template-based or conceptual""

What these new IT rules for AI-generated content mean for social media users

The latest IT rules governing AI-generated content have come into effect in India today. The new rules require social media platforms to label deepfakes, synthetic audio, and altered visuals with visible markers that users can identify immediately. The amendments to the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, were notified earlier this month, on February 10, via Gazette Notification G.S.R. 120(E) and signed by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology Joint Secretary, Ajit Kumar In the new framework, platforms are required to embed metadata and unique identifiers in all synthetically generated content so that it can be traced back to its source. The metadata and unique identifiers cannot be altered, hidden, or deleted once they are applied. This is the first time that AI-generated content has been brought under a formal regulatory framework in India.While announcing the new laws, the government formally defined ""synthetically generated information"" for the first time. It refers to any audio, visual, or audio-visual content created or altered using a computer that appears real and depicts people or events in a way that could be mistaken for genuine.This includes deepfake videos, AI-generated voices, and face-swapped images, essentially anything where a machine has made something look or sound authentic. The definition also applies to AI-generated images of fictional scenarios involving real people.However, not all digital editing work falls under this category. If the work does not affect the original message, then the exempted categories include normal changes such as colour correction, noise reduction, file compression, text translation, and accessibility improvements. Also exempted is conceptual or illustrative content in documents, research papers, PDFs, and presentations.The notification specifically excludes content created forpurposes. An office PowerPoint with a stock AI illustration does not qualify as synthetically generated information, while a deepfake of a politician delivering a speech they never gave does.If you use Instagram, YouTube, or any major platform, the most visible change will be the addition of labels. Any AI-generated post, reel, video, or audio clip will now carry a clear tag indicating it was machine-generated, visible before you like, share, or forward it.When you upload content, you may also be asked by the platforms whether it was developed or modified by AI. Giving a false statement about that is no longer simply a violation of the terms of service; it may also invite legal consequences under the BNS or POCSO Act, depending on the content. Social media platforms must also remind users of this requirement at least once every 3 months.Any service that hosts or facilitates the distribution of AI-generated content must clearly mark it as such. Not in small print, not in metadata, but right on the content itself. Services must also imprint permanent markers and unique identifiers on such content so that it can be traced back to its origin, and they must prohibit any attempt to delete or alter such markers. This closes a loophole that could have allowed the markers to be erased as soon as a user re-uploaded a file they had downloaded.Large services such as Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook have further obligations. Before any file is posted, they must require the user to state whether the content is AI-generated and then use automated software to verify the user's statement. If a service is found to have knowingly hosted unmarked AI-generated content, it will forfeit its legal safe harbour rights.One version of the rules specified that visual markers must appear on at least 10% of the screen and that audio markers must play during the first 10% of a video. This has since been removed after pressure from industry groups. Marking is still required, but without the size requirement.Response timelines have been tightened sharply. For certain government orders, platforms now have three hours to act, down from 36. Other deadlines have been cut from 15 days to seven and from 24 hours to 12.Platforms must also actively use automated tools to block AI-generated content that violates the law. This includes child sexual abuse material, obscene content, fake electronic records, content related to weapons or explosives, and deepfakes designed to misrepresent real people or events.The rules also update legal references, replacing mentions of the Indian Penal Code with the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023. The draft rules were first published in October 2025, and platforms had until February 20 to comply with the final notification.","The latest IT rules governing AI-generated content have come into effect in India today.

Billionaire tax sparks political divide in California

Tech billionaire exits linked to California’s proposed wealth tax

Senator Bernie Sanders has called for stronger public support for a proposed California tax on billionaires, arguing that the wealthiest Americans should contribute more as millions struggle with rising living costs. Speaking at a rally in Los Angeles, Sanders criticised tech billionaires, corporate power, and income inequality while backing a proposal that has already prompted some wealthy tech leaders like Google founder Sergey Brin and Larry Page, Oracle’s Larry Ellison and others to move out of California. The Vermont senator said the measure was necessary to fund essential services such as health care, education, and food assistance, even as critics warn it could drive more billionaires away from the state.“At a time when the very rich are becoming phenomenally richer, when the very rich have been given a massive tax break by Donald Trump, when millions of people in this state are struggling to be able to afford health care, maybe billionaires should start paying their fair share of taxes,” Sanders said while addressing a crowd at the Wiltern Theater.The proposed initiative would introduce a one-time 5% tax on the net worth of California residents with assets above $1 billion.Supporters say the tax would affect roughly 200 people and raise tens of billions of dollars. The plan has been backed by the Service Employees International Union–United Healthcare Workers West, which says the money is needed to offset federal health care cuts.During the rally, Sanders named several well-known tech billionaires with ties to California, including Elon Musk , Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, and Sergey Brin, which prompted boos from the audience.California Governor Gavin Newsom has opposed the proposal, warning it could hurt innovation and reduce long-term tax revenue if more wealthy residents leave the state. Business groups have also spoken out against the measure, saying it could damage the economy.Despite the opposition, labour leaders and supporters at the rally said the tax was needed to reduce inequality and support working families. The proposal may go before voters later this year if enough signatures are collected.The proposed billionaire tax has already been linked to the departure of several high-profile tech leaders from California. Over the past few years, a number of Silicon Valley founders and executives have moved their primary residences out of the state, citing rising taxes and regulatory uncertainty.Google co-founder Larry Page shifted his residence to Florida, while fellow Google co-founder Sergey Brin has also left California. Oracle founder Larry Ellison has also moved out of the Silicon Valley, while PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel relocated to Florida.Recent reports said that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilia Chan have also purchased a home in South Florida, joining the California billionaires leaving the state.",Senator Bernie Sanders has called for stronger public support for a proposed California tax on billionaires.

From redefining every job as a mix of human judgement and agent-driven automation, to why trust is the only thing standing between AI pilots and real production deployments—here's what they had to say.

Everyone becomes an agent manager

But first, trust

PM Modi Pushes Human Centric AI Model, Launches MANAV Framework At Mega AI Impact Summit 2026

New Delhi this week became the centre of gravity for the global AI conversation, as world leaders, tech CEOs, and policymakers converged at the India AI Impact Summit 2026 . Amid the noise of announcements and panel debates, one question kept surfacing: what does the rise of AI agents actually mean for the people who work alongside them?On the sidelines of the summit, TimesofIndia.com sat down with Arundhati Bhattacharya , President and CEO, Salesforce South Asia, and Srini Tallapragada, President and Chief Engineering Officer, Salesforce, to discuss the conundrum.The idea of working alongside AI agents rather than just using AI tools is no longer a distant concept—it is, according to these leaders, the defining shift of this decade. And far from being a cause for anxiety, they see it as an opportunity to fundamentally reimagine what human work looks like.""We are probably going to be the last generation of people that will only handle human interactions,"" said Bhattacharya. ""Going forward, the next generations will handle both agents and humans. That's our view of the future.""It's a striking claim, but Bhattacharya made it with quiet confidence—not as a warning, but as an inevitability that businesses need to start preparing for now.At the heart of Salesforce's pitch is a reframing of what jobs actually are. Every role, the company argues, is essentially a collection of tasks and skills—some routine, some requiring judgement, some requiring deep experience.AI agents, in their view, are not job replacements. They are task absorbers.""Humans do what they are good at—judgement, experience, guiding the process,"" said Srini Tallapragada, President and Chief Engineering Officer, Salesforce. ""What agents will continue to do is the routine, the regular. In some cases, where you have well-defined rules and standard operating procedures, the agent can handle that too. Increasingly, humans will focus on more and more complex situations.""The practical implication, Tallapragada said, is that every person in an organisation will eventually manage agents—much like how every employee today manages email or uses a spreadsheet. ""If you are a people manager today, you will manage humans and agents. If you are an individual contributor today, you will always manage agents. Almost everybody will become an agent manager and a builder. That's how this will transition. ""Bhattacharya put it even more directly: the enterprise of the future is an agentified enterprise. ""The agentic enterprise is coming,"" she said. ""And we are going to help our customers get there.""For all the optimism, Salesforce is acutely aware of why AI has largely stayed in pilot mode for the past three years. The worry is simple: what happens when you put this at scale? Will it hallucinate? Will it make the wrong call? Can it be manipulated? Will it behave ethically?""Trust is our number-one value,"" said Tallapragada. ""One of the first things we build, before building any application, is the trust layer. Because we knew from day one—if you cannot handle all of these cases, businesses won't adopt it.""That trust layer has two components: preventative and reactive. On the preventative side, Salesforce runs red teams that rigorously test products before they ship, and has an Office of Ethical and Humane Use that governs AI development. But the work doesn't stop at launch.""When a customer is implementing it, we provide a lot of guardrails and auditing capabilities,"" Tallapragada explained. He gave a concrete example: a financial services company using an AI loan agent. ""Six months later, the regulator asks—how do I know you didn't discriminate? You need to be able to show exactly how the agent reasoned, what it said, what its logic was. You need audit trails, governance, PII masking, data residency compliance, alignment with all local laws. ""The approach seems to be working. Agentforce is currently Salesforce's fastest-growing product, with thousands of enterprise customers implementing it.

'Will You Apologise?': Senator Badgers Zuckerberg Over Online Abuse, Meta CEO's Response Goes Viral

Balancing efficiency and investor concerns

Meta has reportedly reduced the equity-based awards for most of its employees for the second consecutive year, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg channels unprecedented resources into artificial intelligence and data center expansion. According to a report by Financial Times, people familiar with the matter revealed that Meta trimmed its annual distribution of stock options by about 5% for the bulk of staff, affecting tens of thousands of employees. This is followed by a 10% cut last year, which shocked many employees inside the company. Equity refreshers a vital part of Meta’s compensation package alongside base salaries and bonuses are now being scaled back as the company reallocates funds.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has embarked on a massive AI investment drive as it aims to outpace rivals like OpenAI and Google in developing advanced models and eventually ‘superintelligence’. Meta estimates that its capital expenditure on AI could reach $130 billion this year as the company is planning to hire top AI researchers for building a fleet of data centres. Some recruits have reportedly received pay packages worth tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars.While pouring money into AI, Meta has sought to reassure investors by cutting costs elsewhere. n January, the company eliminated about 1,500 jobs in its lossmaking metaverse division. Internally, Meta is also revamping its performance review system to reward top performers more generously, meaning overall compensation budgets have risen despite broad equity cuts.The Financial Times report also revealed that employees have voice their frustration on the matter. “Another reduction. I guess that’s what I get for trying! Bye Meta!” wrote an employee on anonymous workplace platform. Another quipped: “Cutting my work hours 5%.” Yet others noted that departures are unlikely given the shaky tech jobs market and Meta’s continued high pay relative to peers.", Meta has reportedly reduced the equity-based awards for most of its employees for the second consecutive year.

Mark Zuckerberg SCOLDED During Senate Hearing Over ‘Vile’ Social Media Content; ‘You've Blood...'

Background of the social media trial

Underage users on Instagram

Families seek accountability from Meta

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced tough questioning in the Los Angeles courtroom this week during the landmark trial over whether social media platforms were deliberately designed to be addictive and harmful to young users. As reported by NBC News, Zuckerberg was pressed about an internal Instagram presentation which discussed strategies to attract teenagers on the platform. Lawyers asked Zuckerberg whether Meta wanted people to be addicted to its platforms, responding to the question, Zuckerberg said, “I’m focused on building a community that is sustainable. If you do something that’s not good for people, maybe they’ll spend more time [on Instagram] short term, but if they’re not happy with it, they’re not going to use it over time. I’m not trying to maximise the amount of time people spend every month.”When asked if people tend to use something more if it’s addictive, Zuckerberg shut down the line of questioning, “I’m not sure what to say to that. I don’t think that applies here.”For the uninitiated, the case is the first of a consolidated group of lawsuits involving more than 1,600 plaintiffs, which include families and school districts accusing the social media platforms like Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and Snap of knowingly designing addictive products that harm the mental health of children.Platforms like TikTok and Snap have already reached settlements with the first plaintiff, a 20-year-old woman identified as K.G.M, who claims her early social media use worsened her mental health.The lawyers also questioned whether Meta adequately prevents under-13 users from joining Instagram. As the documents presented before the court revealed that nearly 4 million children under the age of 13 are using the platform in the US. Replying to the question, Meta CEO admitted that some users lie about their age but he also said that Meta removes underage accounts when identified and Instagram only began requiring birthdays at sign‑up in late 2019.Matt Bergman, founding attorney of the Social Media Victims Law Center, said that Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony was “a moment that families across this country have been waiting for,” emphasising that parents deserve accountability from executives who prioritised growth over child safety. Outside the courthouse, grieving parents expressed frustration, saying Zuckerberg’s remarks offered little comfort.","Mark Zuckerberg faced tough questioning in the Los Angeles courtroom this week during the landmark trial.

""As part of that process, we updated our support resources for employees facing complex immigration-related situations,"" it added.The US immigration and enforcement agency, ICE has faced scrutiny for the restrictions that the Republicans call as overreach. As per reports, the agency has deported roughly 540,000 people since Trump took office for his second presidential term in January last year.The fatal shooting of nurse Alex Pretti by an ICE Agent in Minnesota last month ignited a firestorm across the country. Pretti, who was killed on January 24 morning, was filming federal immigration agents when a confrontation began. Officials claim he threatened them with a legally carried firearm, however, videos on the social media reportedly show he was shot after already being disarmed and subdued.

Texas is all set to become world’s new data center capital. As reported by Business Insider, a new research from Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) shows that the Lone Star State is on track to surpass Virgina as the world’s largest data market by 2030, reshaping the US digital infrastructure map. Tech giants Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Meta are now expected to spend more than $600 billion in 2026 in AI infrastructure expansion, feeling unprecedented demand for data centres. Wall Street analysts warn the sale of investment is so massive it could signal an AI bubble.As per JLL’s North America Data Center Report – Year-End 2025, more than half of all new US data center construction now happens outside traditional hubs. Emerging markets include Tennessee, Ohio, Wisconsin — and especially Texas.The BI report adds that Texas along has 6.5 gigawatts of data center capacity under construction, accounting for about one-fifth of the US pipeline. To put that in perspective this is equivalent to the output of more than three Hoover Dams or the energy needed to power 17,000 Tesla Model 3s. Nationwide, the U.S. pipeline of 35 gigawatts nearly doubles existing capacity, equal to the annual electricity consumption of the UK or Italy.The state is home to some of the most ambitious projects in the country:Texas’s appeal lies in its abundant energy resources, sprawling land, and attractive tax incentives — all critical as AI-driven electricity demand strains the nation’s power grid.Virginia may have defined the early era of cloud computing, but Texas is now positioning itself as the global capital of data centers.

Meta cuts 1,000 jobs in Reality Labs workforce

Meta is reportedly planning to launch a smartwatch as early as this year. According to a report by The Information, the smartwatch is code-named 'Malibu 2’ and may be equipped with health features similar to Apple Watch. The smartwatch may debut along with an updated version of its Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses. As per the report, the company has also delayed its plans to bring its mixed reality glasses codenamed Phoenix by 2027. Notably, this is not the first time that Meta is working on a smartwatch. The Facebook-parent has previously scrapped plans for an earlier smartwatch in 2022 due to technical challenges and cost-cutting measures.Readers must note that the details about the Malibu 2 smartwatch are scarce. The smartwatch follows Meta’s launch of its Ray-Ban Display AR glasses in 2025, which the company said proved popular enough that they had to pause the glasses’ international launch due to “unprecedented demand and limited inventory.”Meta already offers a range of VR headsets and related accessories, along with its Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta smart glasses.The report of Meta’s smartwatch comes as the company cuts costs on its virtual reality efforts, including thousands of job cuts.Last month, Meta restructured its Reality Labs division by announcing job cuts that impacted more than 1,000 employees. Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Andrew Bosworth then sent an internal memo calling the cuts as a necessary step to create a “more sustainable” business model for the division. It also signals a strategic backstep from the company’s focus on the “metaverse” in favour of opportunities in Artificial Intelligence (AI) wearables and mobile integration.“With the larger potential user base and the fastest growth rate today, we are shifting teams and resources almost exclusively to mobile to continue to accelerate adoption there,” Bosworth wrote, according to Bloomberg report.Reality Labs has been the primary focus for Meta’s virtual and augmented reality ambitions but the unit has bled billions since its inception.","The smartwatch is code-named 'Malibu 2' and may be equipped with health features similar to Apple Watch.

Amazon’s response



The Washington Supreme Court has now ruled unanimously that e-commerce major Amazon.com must face lawsuits brought by families who lost their relatives to suicide after consuming sodium nitrite purchased from third-party vendors on its platform. As reported by Reuters, all the nine justices have rejected the decision of lower courts which shielded Amazon from negligence claims, which argued that suicide was a ‘superseding cause’ of death.Writing for the court, Justice G. Helen Whitener said that Amazon owed customers a duty of reasonable care and must avoid exposing them to “harm from the foreseeable conduct of a third party.” The judge further added that a jury should decide whether suicide was a foreseeable result of Amazon’s alleged failure to exercise that duty.Twenty-eight families have filed lawsuits claiming that Amazon knew for years that the highly concentrated sodium nitrite was being misused for suicides yet continued to enable unrestricted sales. They argue that Amazon effectively enabled “suicide kits” by selling the chemical alongside other items that could assist in self-harm.The ruling of the court cover the appeals of four families who lost relatives aged 17 to 27 between 2020 and 2021 after ingesting sodium nitrite with purity levels of 98% or higher.As per the Reuters report, Amazon disagreed with the decision but it claimed to remain committed to consumer safety. The company expressed condolences to affected families and noted that sodium nitrite is a legal chemical used as a food preservative, in laboratories, and for treating cyanide poisoning.In its statement, Amazon stressed on the fact that the highly concentrated sodium nitrite “is not intended for direct consumption” and acknowledged the risk of misuse. The company has since prohibited sales of sodium nitrite above 10% purity.",The Washington Supreme Court has ruled unanimously that e-commerce major Amazon.com must face lawsuits brought by families who lost their relatives to suicide after consuming sodium nitrite purchased from third-party vendors on its platform.

Memo warns officials



President Donald Trump was asked about the recent hack of a computer system that holds highly sensitive federal court documents. According to a report in the New York Times, Russia is suspected to be behind the attack. Talking to reporters, Donald Trump shrugged off the alleged hacking. Trump was asked by a reporter if he would bring up the hack when he meets Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. “I guess I could,” Trump replied without committing to anything. “Are you surprised, you know? Are you surprised they hack in? That’s what they do.”Trump reportedly went on to add, “They’re good at it. We’re good at it. We’re actually better at it, but, no, I have heard about it. I have heard about it.” According to a report by Gizmodo, Trump recently told reporters that he gave Iran permission to bomb a U.S. base in Qatar, suggesting that’s just the kind of thing that should be allowed. “They said, ‘We’re going to shoot them. Is one o’clock OK?’ I said it’s fine,” Trump said during a press conference in June. “And everybody was emptied off the base so they couldn’t get hurt, except for the gunners.”According to a New York Times report, quoting an internal memo, administrators with the court system recently informed Justice Department officials, clerks and chief judges in federal courts that “persistent and sophisticated cyber threat actors have recently compromised sealed records”. “This remains an URGENT MATTER that requires immediate action,” officials wrote, referring to guidance that the Justice Department had issued in early 2021 after the system was reportedly first infiltrated.“Sensitive documents can be targets of interest to a range of threat actors,” the authors of last week’s notice wrote. “To better protect them, courts have been implementing more rigorous procedures to restrict access to sensitive documents under carefully controlled and monitored circumstances.”","President Donald Trump was asked about the recent hack of a computer system that holds highly sensitive federal court documents.

'Walk out of a meeting or...': Elon Musk swears by this simple meeting rule that drives his success,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/walk-out-of-a-meeting-or-elon-musk-swears-by-this-simple-meeting-rule-that-drives-his-success/articleshow/123287953.cms,"Elon Musk swears by this simple meeting rule that drives his success

Elon Musk’s simple rule for meetings that powers his success



Ambition and efficiency: The CEO mindset



Efficiency beyond Tesla: Other CEOs’ approaches



Jensen Huang: Instead of relying on one-on-one meetings with direct reports, Huang prefers open forums. This approach minimises communication silos and ensures that information flows across the organisation without unnecessary delays.

Jeff Bezos: He emphasises delegation to maintain speed in operations. By encouraging executives to delegate early and often, decision-making becomes faster and less dependent on top-level approval.

Mark Zuckerberg: During Facebook’s rapid growth, Zuckerberg introduced the motto “move fast and break things.” This principle, included in Facebook’s 2012 IPO letter, encouraged teams to innovate quickly, even if it meant making occasional mistakes.

In recent years, leadership strategies in the corporate world have been undergoing significant transformation, with many executives challenging traditional business practices to prioritise speed, efficiency, and productivity. A notable example comes from Tesla CEO Elon Musk , whose approach to meetings sparked discussion across industries.In a 2018 company-wide email, Musk encouraged employees to walk out of meetings or drop off calls if they were no longer adding value. His perspective aligns with a broader movement among influential leaders such as Jeff Bezos, Jensen Huang, and Mark Zuckerberg, who advocate for breaking away from rigid corporate routines in favour of agile and goal-oriented methods. This shift is also influencing hiring practices, with more companies focusing on cultural fit and personality traits over conventional qualifications. Together, these changes reflect a modern vision for leadership where time management, effective communication, and strong workplace culture form the foundation of organisational success.In his 2018 email to Tesla employees, Elon Musk highlighted the importance of respecting everyone’s time. He stated, “Walk out of a meeting or drop off a call as soon as it is obvious you aren’t adding value. It is not rude to leave; it is rude to make someone stay and waste their time.”Musk’s directive promotes a culture where employees feel empowered to prioritise impactful work over prolonged, unproductive discussions. His policy also challenges the long-standing belief that staying in a meeting is a sign of respect, instead framing it as an unnecessary drain on productivity when no longer relevant to one’s role.Bill Hoogterp, CEO of LifeHikes, has observed a recurring pattern among high-performing CEOs—a blend of extreme ambition and strategic laziness. According to Hoogterp, the most successful leaders are those who are “really hungry to get success” but also seek the quickest, most efficient paths to achieve it. This mindset drives leaders to constantly question processes and find shortcuts that maintain quality while improving speed.Several other business leaders have adopted unconventional methods to streamline operations and improve communication:","Tesla CEO Elon Musk encourages employees to walk out of meetings or drop off calls if they are not adding value.

How chip makers responded



US-China trade tensions

US authorities are secretly placing location tracking devices in certain shipments of advanced chips from companies like Nvidia, Dell, AMD, Nvidia among others, reports news agency Reuters. These tracking devices, the report which quotes people with direct knowledge of the matter says, are aimed to prevent these chip shipments from being illegally diverted to China. The tactic applies only to select shipments already under investigation, the sources said.The trackers are often hidden in packaging and, in some cases, inside the servers themselves. Some are roughly the size of a smartphone. The US Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, Homeland Security Investigations, and the FBI are typically involved, the report says.They are used to detect whether AI chips are being sent to destinations under US export restrictions. Reuters report quotes officials who say the move is part of broader efforts to enforce curbs on China’s access to advanced American semiconductors. The devices, the sources claim, can help build cases against individuals and companies that violate U.S. export rules.Location trackers have long been used by US law enforcement to monitor exports such as airplane parts. In recent years, they have been deployed to combat the illegal diversion of semiconductors.Super Micro said it does not disclose its “security practices and policies” and would not comment on tracking actions. Dell, on the other hand, said it was “not aware of a US Government initiative to place trackers in its product shipments.”US, a leader in the global AI chip supply chain, has recently tightened export controls on China from 2022 to limit its military development. Similar restrictions apply to Russia. Proposals in the White House and Congress have suggested requiring location verification technology in chips to prevent diversion.China has criticized the restrictions as an attempt to suppress its growth. Last month, its cyberspace regulator called in Nvidia to discuss concerns over alleged “backdoors” in its chips, a claim Nvidia has denied.Some Chinese resellers have reportedly said they inspect diverted shipments for trackers before delivery due to the risk of them being embedded. In a recent US Justice Department case, a co-conspirator told a defendant to “look carefully” for trackers on servers containing Nvidia chips.","US authorities are secretly placing location tracking devices in certain shipments of advanced chips from companies like Nvidia, Dell, AMD, Nvidia among others.

How and Why Trump's New Tariffs Will Not Make Your iPhone More Expensive

The Trump administration is still finalising the details of its agreement to collect a 15% export tax on revenue from Nvidia and AMD’s chip sales to China. US President Donald Trump confirmed this week that he negotiated the deal, which grants Nvidia and AMD export licenses for their China-specific AI chips in exchange for a percentage of their revenue. The White House also said that similar deals may be extended to other companies in the future.White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt confirmed that the arrangement currently applies to just the two chipmakers.“Right now it stands with these two companies. Perhaps it could expand in the future to other companies,” she said.Leavitt added that the “legality of it, the mechanics of it, is still being ironed out by the Department of Commerce,” suggesting that the implementation of the unprecedented deal is far from complete.The development comes days after it was reported that Trump told Nvidia and AMD that they need to pay 15% of the revenue to the government.""I said, 'If I'm going to do that, I want you to pay us as a country something, because I'm giving you a release',"" Trump stated.Nvidia, for its part, released a statement saying, ""We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets.""The agreement has drawn criticism from trade lawyers and experts who have questioned its legality, citing existing laws that regulate how the government can charge fees for export licenses.The chips in question, including Nvidia's H20 and AMD's equivalents, are specifically designed to comply with US export regulations that were put in place in 2023 to limit China’s access to advanced AI technology. The U.S. government is concerned that these powerful chips could be used by China to advance its military capabilities.","US President Donald Trump confirmed this week that he negotiated the deal, which grants Nvidia and AMD export licenses for their China-specific AI chips.

He stated that “Betting against Elon is like betting against Steve Jobs (Apple founder)”. Responding to the comments, the Tesla CEO acknowledged that while the valuation is possible, it may require ‘extreme execution’.“Extreme execution is needed, but a valuation of $20 trillion for Tesla is possible,” Elon Musk wrote, quoting a post on X (formerly Twitter).Notably, this comes days after Elon Musk warned of ‘few rough quarters’ for Tesla following the expiration of the US tax credit for EVs. In an earnings conference call with analysts and investors this week, the tech billionaire said “We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the US.”Continuing further, he said “We probably could have a few rough quarters. I'm not saying we will, but we could”. “But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling,” Musk added.The EV maker reported a drop in profit for the third quarter in a row, with earnings falling to $1.17 billion, or 33 cents per share, down from $1.4 billion, or 40 cents per share, during the same period last year.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 40 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the April to June quarter also declined — from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion — but still came in slightly higher than analysts had forecast.During the earnings calls, Elon Musk was asked about whether he would want more than his current 13% stake in Tesla to keep control. To this, Musk said he did want more but not too much.“I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction,” he said, “but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”","Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation.

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world. Speaking during an event hosted by the All-In Podcast team and a consortium of tech leaders and lawmakers known as the Hill and Valley Forum, Huang discussed the scale of impact that small, focused teams of AI researchers can have and how Nvidia’s success has translated into significant financial rewards for those in leadership. “I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.” Jensen Huang said. He was responding to a question on the effectiveness and value of smaller AI teams.“But the important big idea is that the impact of 150 or so AI researchers, with funding behind them, can probably create,” he noted. Jensen Huang gave examples of OpenAI which originally started with around 150 employees and China’s DeepSeek which also has a similar workforce.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang added that there's something unique about well-structured, mid-sized teams when given the right resources. “That’s not a small team. That’s a good-size team with the right infrastructure… If you're willing to pay, say, $20 billion, $30 billion to buy a startup with 150 AI researchers, why wouldn't you pay one?”During the interview, the Nvidia CEO also addressed reports that he personally rewards high-performing employees with surprise stock options and RSUs (Restricted Stock Units). When asked if he actually does carry stock options, Jensen Huang joked “Yeah, I'm carrying it in my pocket right now.”He then explained that he takes a hands-on approach to compensation across the company. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day… when they present it, and they send me everybody’s recommended comp, I go through the whole company.

Bezos-Sánchez wedding draws criticism over DiCaprio’s jet travel



Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s $40 Venetian wedding

Newlyweds Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez were recently spotted hosting Leonardo DiCaprio and his model girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht Koru . The high-profile outing took place off the coast of Ibiza, a popular celebrity hotspot and luxury summer getaway destination. Leonardo DiCaprio, known for his understated style, wore a plain white T-shirt, shorts, and his trademark baseball cap and sunglasses. Vittoria Ceretti showcased her model figure in a strapless blue top and black yoga pants. Bezos opted for tropical-printed swim trunks paired with a navy T-shirt, while Sánchez layered a printed kimono over a bikini. Their casual vacation looks perfectly captured the relaxed yet exclusive atmosphere aboard one of the world’s most extravagant and expensive private yachts, making headlines among luxury lifestyle and celebrity news followers worldwide.Bezos’s superyacht Koru, meaning “new beginnings” in Māori, represents the couple’s extravagant lifestyle and new chapter together. Built by Dutch shipbuilder Oceanco, Koru stands as the world’s tallest sailing yacht, measuring 250 feet tall with three masts exceeding 230 feet each.At 416 feet wide, the yacht features three luxury decks, multiple lounges, and ultra-modern amenities. Its construction spanned five years, costing an estimated $485 million. The yacht previously sparked controversy when plans to dismantle a historic Rotterdam bridge emerged to allow Koru’s passage, leading to widespread public protests and alternative solutions by the builders.Leonardo DiCaprio’s attendance at Bezos and Sánchez’s Venetian wedding drew backlash, with critics calling him a “hypocrite” due to his outspoken environmental activism. Social media users highlighted the contradiction between DiCaprio’s climate advocacy and the carbon-heavy nature of celebrity private jet travel, pointing out that over 90 jets reportedly flew into Venice for the wedding.Despite the criticism, DiCaprio’s friendship with Bezos remains strong, as evidenced by their repeat vacations together including last year’s luxury yacht trip in Sardinia. One of the wedding’s most surprising attendees was Sydney Sweeney, who reportedly had no close personal connection to Bezos or Sánchez. Later reports revealed that Bezos and Sánchez are investing in Sweeney’s upcoming lingerie line, explaining her presence at the event. This move demonstrates how the Bezos-Sánchez social circle extends beyond personal relationships to professional collaborations, further solidifying their influence in both business and Hollywood circles.The Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases a blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances. Whether it’s a $40 million Venetian wedding, a $485 million yacht, or investments in rising Hollywood talent, the couple has firmly positioned themselves at the center of celebrity culture and high society.Just weeks before their Ibiza yacht trip, Bezos and Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent $40 million wedding in Venice. The three-day celebration attracted global headlines not just for its extravagance but also for the massive celebrity turnout, including Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom, and Sydney Sweeney.Despite public protests in Venice over the event’s scale, insiders revealed that the wedding was surprisingly intimate. No non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) were required for guests, allowing attendees to freely share their experiences. The bride’s $5 million diamond ring became a symbol of the wedding’s lavishness and continues to be a topic of discussion among jewelers and fans alike.","Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved from a futuristic concept to an everyday necessity, influencing industries ranging from healthcare and finance to entertainment and communication. It automates routine tasks, enhances productivity, and fuels innovations like ChatGPT, AI-driven translation services, and virtual gaming experiences.The growth of AI has also created a new class of billionaires, some of whom have built companies from scratch, while others have pivoted established businesses toward AI-driven opportunities. Backed by massive investments from Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and other global players, these individuals represent the cutting edge of technology and entrepreneurship. From Jensen Huang’s hardware empire to Alexandr Wang’s data infrastructure solutions, and from Sam Altman’s AI innovation to Yao Runhao’s virtual gaming platforms, these billionaires illustrate how AI is reshaping industries and redefining entrepreneurship.Source: ForbesJensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of Nvidia, sits at the top of the AI billionaire list with an astonishing $113 billion (£151 billion) net worth. Nvidia initially focused on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming and professional visualization. However, as AI adoption accelerated, these GPUs became the standard for training and running large language models like ChatGPT and Meta AI.Huang’s strategic vision transformed Nvidia into the backbone of the AI industry. In July 2025, the company reached an unprecedented $4 trillion valuation, reflecting how central its hardware is to AI infrastructure. Owning 3% of Nvidia, Huang’s wealth grew by over 300% in just one year, making him one of the top 20 richest individuals worldwide.At just 26 years old, Alexandr Wang has secured his place as the youngest self-made billionaire in the AI sector. He founded Scale AI at the age of 19, after dropping out of MIT, to focus on providing data labeling and annotation services essential for AI training.Scale AI works with over 300 high-profile clients, including Meta, Google, and General Motors, supplying the data infrastructure required to build machine learning models. The company’s valuation reached $14 billion (£10.5 billion) in 2024, and Wang’s 14% ownership stake boosted his net worth to $2.7 billion (£3.6 billion). His success highlights how even niche AI services can yield massive fortunes.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is one of the most prominent faces in artificial intelligence. While OpenAI itself is valued at around $300 billion (£225 billion), Altman does not personally hold equity in the company. His wealth, estimated at $1.9 billion (£1.4 billion), stems from early investments in companies like Stripe, Reddit, and Helion Energy, combined with the success of his previous startup, Loopt, which he sold for $42 million in 2012.Altman’s leadership at OpenAI popularized generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT, setting global trends in how businesses and consumers interact with AI. His influence extends beyond wealth, positioning him as one of the key thought leaders shaping AI’s future.Phil Shawe, co-CEO of TransPerfect, built one of the world’s largest translation and localization companies by leveraging AI-powered language processing. TransPerfect offers services across industries like law, healthcare, gaming, and entertainment, helping businesses operate in multiple languages with enhanced accuracy and efficiency.Founded in 1992 from a dorm room at New York University, TransPerfect generated $1.3 billion (£976 million) in revenue in 2024. Shawe owns 99% of the company, securing a personal fortune of $1.8 billion (£1.3 billion). His journey shows how AI technology can transform even traditional industries like language services into billion-dollar enterprises.Dario Amodei, a former vice president of research at OpenAI, left to co-found Anthropic in 2021. His company focuses on building safe, reliable AI systems using reinforcement learning techniques that allow AI models to adapt through human feedback.Anthropic’s approach to ethical AI and safety-first principles resonated with investors and industry leaders, pushing the company’s valuation to $61.5 billion (£46.2 billion) by 2025. Amodei’s net worth has reached $1.2 billion (£901 million), proving that prioritizing responsibility in AI development can be both impactful and profitable.Liang Wenfeng, once largely unknown outside China, made headlines with DeepSeek-R1, a large language model that outperformed ChatGPT on certain benchmarks while being five times cheaper to run. This innovation shook global markets, causing Nvidia’s stock to drop 17% in a single day as investors reacted to the potential shift in AI computing costs.Wenfeng previously founded a successful hedge fund, and he used his financial expertise to build DeepSeek into one of the most cost-efficient AI providers globally. His net worth now stands at $1 billion (£751 million), making him a key figure in China’s growing AI industry.Yao Runhao, CEO of Paper Games, has carved out a unique niche by combining AI with gaming. His company’s hit product, Love and Deepspace, uses artificial intelligence to create virtual dating simulations with interactive, personalized storylines.The game attracts over six million monthly users, showcasing the demand for AI-driven entertainment. Paper Games employs around 2,000 staff and focuses primarily on the female gaming market in China, highlighting how AI is revolutionizing interactive leisure experiences. Runhao’s innovation has earned him a net worth of $1.3 billion (£977 million).","World’s wealthiest AI moguls ranked by net worth.

Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India, marking another step in its long-term strategy to strengthen its footprint in emerging markets. During Apple’s latest earnings announcement, CEO Tim Cook confirmed plans to open multiple new Apple Stores in India before the year ends. The move comes as part of a broader global expansion plan that also includes fresh Apple retail outlets in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the launch of the Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia. Cook highlighted that these new physical stores are a key step in improving Apple’s customer experience, product accessibility, and service reach in high-growth regions like India.“We recently launched the Apple Store online in Saudi Arabia, and we couldn’t be more excited to open new stores in the UAE and India later this year,” Cook stated. “We were also delighted to welcome customers in Japan to a new location in the heart of Osaka.”According to Apple Magazine, four new stores are scheduled to open across key metropolitan cities in India, namely Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, and the Delhi NCR region. These new outlets will build on Apple’s successful retail debut in India in 2023, which saw the launch of Apple BKC in Mumbai and Apple Saket in Delhi. These initial stores have quickly become major crowd-pullers, especially during new iPhone release events, and have demonstrated the value of physical retail locations in India’s fast-growing premium smartphone market.To support this retail growth, Apple has been actively hiring talent for its upcoming stores. Earlier this year, Apple Store leader John Taffe shared on LinkedIn that Apple was looking for passionate and skilled individuals to join its retail team. “Apple’s journey in India has been incredible, and we’re thrilled to continue growing in these vibrant cities. To make these new stores a success, we’re looking for passionate and talented individuals to join our team,” Taffe noted. This hiring drive highlights Apple’s commitment to not only selling products but also delivering personalised customer experiences and creating jobs within the Indian retail sector.While India remains a critical market, Apple is expanding its retail network globally. Apart from its Indian plans, the company has announced new retail locations in the UAE, including a store in Al Ain, which will add to its existing four UAE outlets (two in Abu Dhabi and two in Dubai). The Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia further emphasizes Apple’s growing focus on the Middle East.These international retail initiatives aim to strengthen Apple’s customer reach and brand experience beyond its digital ecosystem. Apple’s global retail growth is supported by its strong financial results. In its April–June quarter (Q3), Apple reported a 13% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales, showcasing robust demand even in challenging economic conditions. This financial strength gives Apple the confidence to invest heavily in physical stores in markets like India, where premium smartphone adoption is rapidly increasing.India has emerged as one of Apple’s most important growth markets, driven by rising disposable incomes, expanding smartphone penetration, and a growing preference for premium devices. The launch of Apple BKC and Apple Saket in 2023 marked the company’s first direct retail presence in the country, and the overwhelming customer response has paved the way for more stores. Apple’s upcoming four new stores signal a long-term commitment to India, where it faces strong competition from brands like Samsung and OnePlus. However, Apple’s focus on a seamless retail experience and exclusive customer service could help it capture a larger market share in the premium category.",Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shifted from being a futuristic concept to a rapidly evolving reality impacting every industry. With advanced machine learning models, automation systems, and AI-powered decision-making tools, tasks once performed by humans are now handled with speed and precision by algorithms. This has triggered global concern about potential job losses. Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has admitted that automation will reduce certain jobs within the company. Similarly, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that AI will impact “everybody’s jobs” in some capacity, although he expects it to also create new opportunities. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predicts the most dramatic changes will occur within the next five to ten years, transforming entire job markets.When asked about the possibility of artificial general intelligence (AGI) performing all human tasks, DeepMind CEO Hassabis highlighted an important distinction:AI could analyse medical data, scans, and test results faster and more accurately than human doctors, potentially replacing or assisting in diagnosis and treatment planning.Nurses, however, provide emotional support, physical care, and human empathy that technology can’t replicate. A robotic nurse may be efficient but lacks the ability to emotionally connect with patients, a critical part of caregiving.This example shows that while AI in healthcare may replace certain intellectual tasks, professions relying on emotional intelligence will remain human-centered. This statement from Hassabis offers one of the clearest examples of how AI will alter specific professions, but not eliminate the need for human empathy and interpersonal care.According to Hassabis, the workplace of the future will integrate humans and AI collaboratively. AI will handle data-heavy, repetitive, and analytical processes, allowing humans to focus on creative problem-solving, emotional interaction, and leadership roles. This shift will require governments and industries to invest heavily in reskilling programs to prepare workers for AI-driven environments, emphasizing lifelong learning, adaptive skills, ethical AI usage, and the development of new interdisciplinary roles bridging technology, creativity, and human-centric decision-making.Andy Jassy’s remarks highlight a future where AI automation tools replace repetitive and operational tasks. Amazon already relies on robotics and intelligent software to manage logistics, inventory, and supply chain processes. Jassy believes that as these technologies mature, fewer human workers will be required for jobs like order processing and warehouse management. However, he noted that the shift doesn’t necessarily mean fewer opportunities overall but rather a need for upskilling and reskilling so employees can transition into more technology-driven roles.Jensen Huang, whose company Nvidia provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) powering modern AI systems, offered a candid view on AI’s impact:“Everybody’s jobs will be affected. Some jobs will be lost. Many jobs will be created.” Huang believes AI’s productivity gains will help industries perform tasks faster and cheaper, which may reduce demand for certain roles but open new ones focused on AI development, data analysis, and advanced engineering. He expressed hope that economic growth from AI adoption will ultimately “lift society” rather than harm it.Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind and a key architect of advanced AI systems, views AI as an additive rather than purely disruptive technology. He explained that as AI capabilities expand, new job categories will emerge—roles that use AI to enhance human output rather than replace it entirely. Historically, technological revolutions (like industrial machines or computers) displaced certain jobs but also created industries that didn’t exist before. Hassabis believes this trend will continue:“New jobs will be created that are actually better, that utilise these tools or new technologies.”AI can handle data analysis, diagnostics, and treatment recommendations faster than humans, but doctors will still oversee complex decision-making and patient care.Nursing requires emotional support, hands-on care, and human empathy—qualities that machines and robots cannot replicate effectively.He predicts massive workplace changes within 5–10 years, with some jobs disappearing and new ones emerging.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expects automation to cut some jobs, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI will affect “everybody’s jobs” but also create new opportunities.Roles focused on AI development, creative problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and advanced data management are expected to increase.",Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce.

How and Why Trump's New Tariffs Will Not Make Your iPhone More Expensive

China is reportedly pressuring major tech companies like Alibaba and ByteDance to reconsider their orders for Nvidia ’s H20 AI chips even as Chinese regulators have asked tech firms to explain why they are purchasing Nvidia’s chips – which US President Donald Trump called ‘obsolete’ – instead of using domestic alternatives, suggesting that they want the Chinese tech companies to downsize their orders of H20 chips.According to a report by Financial Times, this scrutiny has led some of the main buyers of the H20 to cut their orders. The development comes as various Chinese companies have been told to avoid using these AI chips, particularly for government-related projects.Citing three people familiar with the situation, the report said that the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) is among Chinese regulators who have asked tech firms to explain why they are purchasing Nvidia's chips instead of using domestic alternatives.“It’s not banned but has kind of become a politically incorrect thing to do,” a Chinese data center operator was quoted as saying.This move complicates the recent export arrangement Nvidia made with the Trump administration, which allowed the chips to be sold in China under the condition of a revenue-sharing agreement.A report from Bloomberg claimed that Chinese authorities had sent notices to companies discouraging the use of H20 chips, especially for government or security-related projects. The push is part of a broader effort by Beijing to promote its own domestic chipmakers, such as Huawei and Cambricon, which have been gaining market share since US export restrictions were put in place.The Trump administration, which had previously halted the sale of Nvidia's H20 chips to China in April, granted clearance for resumed shipments last month. In a statement, Trump described the H20 as “obsolete,” claiming that China “already had it.” He added, “So I said, 'Listen, I want 20% if I'm going to approve this for you, for the country'.”",China is reportedly pressuring major tech companies like Alibaba and ByteDance to reconsider their orders for Nvidia's H20 AI chips.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's AI 'hiring list'

The race for artificial intelligence (AI) supremacy has reached a fever pitch in Silicon Valley, with tech giants vying for a limited pool of elite researchers. The amount of money being offered to hire AI geniuses is mind-boggling, as tech giants like Meta, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI fight over a tiny talent pool in their race to achieve the next breakthrough. And the cutthroat competition doesn’t look like it will ease anytime soon.Nobody in this rapidly escalating arms race is chasing the prized recruits quite like Meta and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Meta CEO Zuckerberg is said to have tried to raid Silicon Valley’s top research labs, dangling $100 million pay packages with the hopes of poaching top researchers at these labs. Zuckerberg is reported to be hiring with the help of the List, a document with the names of the top minds in AI. He is said to be himself spending his days weeding through papers, searching for hotshot engineers and scientists to recruit for his Superintelligence team.One such hire is 24-year-old AI prodigy Matt Deitke , whose recent $250 million compensation package from Meta Platforms Inc has sent shockwaves through the industry, redefining the value of AI expertise. Deitke, a former doctoral student at the University of Washington, dropped out of his computer science PhD program to become one of the most sought-after minds in AI. Meta’s pursuit of Deitke began with a $125 million offer over four years, which the young researcher turned down. In an unprecedented move, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally intervened, meeting Deitke face-to-face and doubling the offer to a staggering $250 million, with up to $100 million payable in the first year alone. The package includes a mix of salary, bonuses, and stock.In November 2024, Matt Deitke had founded Vercept along with several of his Allen Institute colleagues. The AI startup raised $16.5 million from investors such as the former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt earlier this year. This was till came Deitke’s back-and-forth calls with Meta CEO.According to the company’s website, Vercept was founded with the goal of radically rethinking how people interact with technology, aiming to replace the maze of menus and code-heavy workflows with a seamless, intuitive interface that feels like an extension of the user's mind.Mark Zuckerberg is said to be in a group chat with two Meta executives called “Recruiting Party ” in which they discuss hundreds of potential candidates and tactics for approaching them—like whether they prefer to be contacted by email, text or WhatsApp. As a report in WSJ said that many on the List have three main qualifications: a Ph.D. in an A.I.-related field, experience at a top lab and contributions to A.I. research breakthroughs, one of the people said. ""The recruits on “The List” typically have PhDs from elite schools like Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon. They have experience at places like OpenAI in San Francisco and Google DeepMind in London. They are usually in their 20s and 30s—and they all know each other. They spend their days staring at screens to solve the kinds of inscrutable problems that require spectacular amounts of computing power,"" reads the report.","Tech giants like Meta, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI fight over a tiny talent pool in their race to achieve the next breakthrough.

Elon Musk vs Sam Altman: The ongoing war of words



It appears that the rivalry between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Tesla CEO Elon Musk is going to enter a new frontier of human brain. As reported by Financial Times, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is co-founding a brain-computer interface startup called Merge Labs. The upcoming startup will compete against Elon Musk’s Neuralink as both the companies will not race to merge humans with artificial intelligence. As reported by Financial Times, Merge Labs is in the process of raising $850 million, with $250 million expected to come from OpenAI’s venture fund.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman will be the co-founder, however he is not said to be involved in day-to-day operations. The startup is reportedly also working with Alex Blania, CEO of Tools for Humanity, Altman’s other venture focused on biometric digital identity.Elon Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 and till now the company has made significant progress in developing brain implants which enable people with paralysis to control devices with the help of their thoughts. The Elon Musk-owned company recently raised $600 million at a $9 billion valuation and is conducting human trials.Merge Labs on the other hand, is reportedly working on less invasive brain interfaces with a strong emphasis on AI-powered enhancements. The focus of the startup is not just medical rehabilitation but broader human-AI integration.“I believe the merge has already started,” Altman wrote in a 2017 blog post. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants”.Elon Musk and Sam Altman are fighting again and publicly. In a heated escalation of their ongoing rivalry, Elon Musk and Sam Altman traded barbs over allegations of bias in Apple’s App Store rankings. The fight started after Musk, founder of xAI, posted on Twitter, accusing Apple of manipulating its App Store rankings to favor OpenAI’s ChatGPT, making it “impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1.” Musk labeled this an “unequivocal antitrust violation” and threatened immediate legal action against Apple. At the time, ChatGPT held the top spot on the U.S. App Store’s free apps list, while xAI’s Grok ranked fifth.To this, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman swiftly countered on X, calling Musk’s claims “remarkable” given allegations that Musk manipulates X’s algorithms to boost his own companies and suppress competitors. Altman referenced a 2023 Platformer report alleging Musk tweaked X’s algorithm to prioritize his tweets after a post by President Biden outperformed his. Altman challenged Musk to sign an affidavit denying such practices, promising an apology if Musk complied.","Merge Labs is in the process of raising $850 million, with $250 million expected to come from OpenAI’s venture fund.

Understanding Meta’s artificial superintelligence

The role of open-source and safety in AI

A personal AI superintelligence for everyone

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has outlined a bold vision for the future of artificial intelligence , revealing that the company’s latest AI systems have begun showing signs of self-improvement without human input. In a policy paper published on July 30, 2025, Zuckerberg described this development as the first step toward artificial superintelligence (ASI), a form of AI capable of surpassing human cognitive abilities. He believes this technology could fundamentally transform humanity, driving scientific breakthroughs and empowering individuals in unprecedented ways, while also urging caution in how these powerful systems are released.According to Zuckerberg, Meta’s AI systems have recently demonstrated the ability to enhance their own performance without direct human programming. While the progress is gradual, he called it “undeniable” and a significant leap toward ASI. This concept builds on earlier research into self-improving frameworks like the Gödel Machine, which can rewrite its own code only after proving the change will be beneficial. Zuckerberg sees such advancements as critical for unlocking AI’s full potential in areas such as science, medicine, and problem-solving.Artificial superintelligence represents the highest tier of AI development, far beyond today’s specialized models and even artificial general intelligence (AGI). While AGI can think and adapt like a human, ASI could think faster, deeper, and in entirely new ways, possibly triggering an “intelligence explosion.” Zuckerberg believes this shift could uncover solutions to problems that are currently unimaginable, pushing human progress into a new era of discovery. However, he also acknowledges the risks of misalignment and misuse, stressing the importance of responsible development.Zuckerberg signaled a more cautious approach to releasing future AI models under open-source frameworks. While Meta has previously made some of its powerful models available to the public, he emphasized that not all systems will be freely released, especially those capable of rapid self-improvement. The goal is to balance innovation with safety, ensuring that superintelligent AI benefits humanity without falling into the wrong hands.

What is UPI Pull transaction feature



How QR code-based UPI payments method is used by fraudsters



NPCI capped UPI pull payments to Rs 2,000

UBON SP-85: Portable Party Speaker On A Budget

The government may have a new plan to curb Unified Payments Interface (UPI)-related scams. According to an Economic Times report, the National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) is shutting down recipient-initiated person-to-person (P2P) digital payments, also known as ‘pull’ transactions. Quoting people familiar with the matter, the report says that the development will come into effect from October 1. NPCI has informed banks and fintech companies about the decision, the report added.As per industry insiders quoted by ET in its report, P2P pull transactions account for only about 3% of UPI activity, making it easier for NPCI to withdraw the feature.A UPI pull transaction, also called a collect request, is a type of payment where the recipient starts the transaction instead of the sender. Once the payment request is initiated, the sender approves it by entering their UPI PIN.However, the payment method has become an increasingly misused payment tool used by fraudsters to dupe innocent citizens.Fraudsters exploit the UPI pull payment method by taking advantage of people who don’t fully understand how it works or who act in haste. In many cases, the scammers pretend to send money for something like an online sale or a refund. But instead of making a normal push payment, they send a collect request to the victim’s UPI ID. Once the victim enters their UPI PIN to approve it, the money is sent to the fraudster.Scammers also pretend to be merchants or service providers and send a pull request disguised as a payment confirmation link. People who are in a hurry or feel pressured often do not notice the details and authorise the payment.In 2019, NPCI had capped such transactions at Rs 2,000 in 2019.“In the initial days, this feature was designed with the thought that friends splitting a bill can send pull payment links after the party, just to be approved by the other person,” a senior fintech industry executive told the publication. “However, there are a lot of frauds happening in such payments, where fraudsters take money from gullible consumers in the garb of actually sending money,” the banker added.","The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) is shutting down recipient- initiated person-to-person (P2P) digital payments, also known as ‘pull’ transactions.

The role of AI in space exploration



Artificial intelligence is rapidly reshaping the global workforce, with experts predicting that many jobs of the future will be dramatically different from today. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has outlined a vision in which space exploration becomes a realistic and high-paying career option for college graduates within the next decade. Speaking with video journalist Cleo Abram in a recent interview, Altman described how AI-driven advances in science, engineering, and automation could open entirely new industries, particularly in space-related fields. His predictions suggest that by 2035, the career paths for young professionals may look very different, with some leaving university to work on missions across the solar system. This potential shift reflects broader trends in technology, space research, and labour markets, signalling a transformation in the nature of work itself.Altman envisions that within the next 10 years, space exploration will no longer be limited to astronauts from government space agencies. Instead, private companies and international partnerships could create opportunities for skilled professionals from various backgrounds.Altman said.This outlook is tied to advancements in artificial intelligence, which he believes will help automate complex tasks, enabling more people to participate in large-scale space projects without the need for decades of specialised astronaut training.According to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics , aerospace engineering positions are growing faster than the national average. Professionals in this sector already earn annual salaries exceeding $130,000, and demand is expected to rise as more private companies invest in spacecraft manufacturing, satellite technology, and interplanetary research. With the growth of commercial space travel and lunar exploration programs, the range of potential roles extends beyond engineering to include robotics specialists, AI technicians, and planetary scientists.Altman acknowledged that artificial intelligence will replace certain job categories, but he emphasised its potential to create entirely new career opportunities. He described AI as a tool that can amplify individual capabilities, enabling small teams or even single individuals to achieve results that once required large organisations. Following the launch of GPT-5, Altman compared the technology to having a team of PhD-level experts available instantly through a mobile device. This capability, he said, could allow people to start billion-dollar companies independently.Other prominent figures in the technology sector share different views on AI’s role in the future of work:AI already plays a role in space research through autonomous navigation systems, predictive maintenance, and data analysis for missions. Altman’s forecast aligns with NASA’s broader vision, which includes crewed missions to Mars in the 2030s. If these timelines hold, 2035 graduates could be entering a workforce where commercial and government-led missions to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations are underway. Positions might range from spacecraft design and operations to in-space manufacturing and interplanetary logistics.Altman believes that future generations will see today’s work practices as outdated, likening them to “boring, old work” compared to the possibilities ahead. In his view, the combination of advanced AI tools and ambitious space programs will allow individuals to innovate and contribute in ways that were previously limited to large, specialised teams.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has outlined a vision in which space exploration becomes a realistic and high-paying career option for college graduates within the next decade.

Huang’s next generation takes center stage at Nvidia

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang openly addressed nepotism concerns at a recent all-hands meeting, defending the practice of hiring employees' children and stating that parents wouldn't recommend their kids if they would embarrass them. Huang acknowledged that many employees' children work at the company and insisted it doesn't bother him, adding with a smile that many ""Nvidia second-generation"" employees even outperform their parents.The comments come amid growing scrutiny over family hiring practices at the chip giant, particularly as Huang's own children have risen to key positions within the company's strategic emerging business divisions. According to reporting from The Information, Huang's daughter Madison and son Spencer have become significant players in Nvidia's future-focused departments after pursuing careers that initially diverged from the technology industry.The situation at Nvidia represents a departure from Silicon Valley norms, where the children of tech pioneers like Apple's Steve Jobs or Microsoft's Bill Gates typically chose to stay away from their family businesses. Beyond the Huang family, children of co-founder Chris Malachowsky and Director Aarti Shah also work at the company, creating an unusual ""family presence"" in Silicon Valley.Madison Huang leads the Omniverse department , focusing on 3D simulation and Digital Twin software, while Spencer Huang concentrates on AI models and robotics perception software development. Notably, neither sibling works in Nvidia's core chip and data center business, instead positioning themselves in emerging technology areas that could define the company's future growth.Former Nvidia Vice President Greg Estes acknowledged the family connection but emphasised both siblings ""work very hard, excel in their respective fields, and have a deep attachment to the company.""Madison Huag's rapid ascent at Nvidia has raised eyebrows across Silicon Valley. Her 2023 compensation package topped $1 million as she joined her father's core leadership team represents. The rise is meteoric for someone who joined the company just four years ago. Her brother Spencer has taken a different approach, working behind the scenes to advance Nvidia's robotics ambitions while avoiding the spotlight that follows his sister.The siblings' journey to Nvidia wasn't traditional tech royalty grooming. Madison spent years mastering French pastry arts at Le Cordon Bleu and climbing ranks at luxury conglomerate LVMH. Spencer ran a craft cocktail bar in Taipei, mixing drinks far from Silicon Valley's boardrooms. Their pivot to tech came in 2019 through an MIT artificial intelligence course, followed by MBA programs.Despite the nepotism concerns, internal performance reviews show both siblings have consistently exceeded targets in their respective divisions. Madison's Omniverse unit has doubled its enterprise partnerships under her leadership, while Spencer's robotics perception software has been integrated into three major automotive deals this year.","Jensen Huang's daughter Madison and son Spencer have become significant players in Nvidia's future-focused departments.

Donald Trump's plan to make Germany's leading car company set up a plant in America is reportedly facing a problem. And the problem is: Audi employees in Germany. According to a report in Bloomberg, a top labour official of Audi said that the German carmaker must secure jobs and production in Germany before building a factory in the US over President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The Volkswagen AG-owned brand is said to be reviewing several options for setting up its own manufacturing hub in the US, where VW already operates one plant and is building another for the Scout nameplate. Audi’s labor leaders are willing to back an expansion in the country only if management gives long-term guarantees for jobs and output at home, said Jörg Schlagbauer, the company’s works council chief.In an emailed statement to Bloomberg, Jörg Schlagbauer, said, “We are not refusing to discuss the matter, but for capacity reasons we do not see any need to build a plant in the US at present.” Schlagbauer is also Audi’s deputy board chairman. He added, “If we need a plant in the US for political reasons, it cannot be at the expense of employees and capacity utilization in Germany.”In March this year, Audi reportedly reached an agreement with employee representatives to cut 7,500 German positions by 2029 via buyouts and early retirement. This agreement was in exchange for extending job security guarantees for remaining employees till 2033. Audi is reported to be in the process of informing employees about the offers, though so far “no significant staff reductions” have taken place, a labor spokesperson said.In early 2025, President Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariff on European car imports, significantly impacting the EU's automotive industry, which exports €56 billion in vehicles to the U.S. annually. German carmakers like Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz, accounting for 73% of the 820,000 EU cars exported to the U.S., face severe financial strain. Porsche, reliant entirely on imports, could lose €3.4 billion in earnings by 2026, while Stellantis reported a €2.3 billion net loss in the first half of 2025. The tariffs, effective April 3, 2025, aim to bolster U.S. manufacturing but disrupt global supply chains, raising vehicle prices by an estimated $3,000.A subsequent trade deal reduced tariffs to 15% from August 1, offering relief but still exceeding the pre-2024 2.5% rate. European automakers, already grappling with declining sales in China and EV transition costs, may pass costs to consumers or shift production to the US, as Volvo plans for its XC60. The EU is considering retaliatory tariffs, risking a broader trade war.","Donald Trump's plan to make Germany's leading car company set up a plant in America is reportedly facing a problem.

Microsoft vs Meta: Battle for AI supremacy



It appears that the AI talent hiring war is not going to end anytime soon. Now an online report suggests that tech giant Microsoft is going after Meta’s AI talent. As reported by Business Insider, Microsoft has made a list of most-wanted Meta engineers and researchers and is now initiating the process of making them an offer. According to internal documents seen by Business Insider, the tech giant is matching Meta’s compensation packages and fast-tracking offers to lure away key personnel — a move that could spell trouble for Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg . The list prepared by Microsoft is part of the company’s revamped hiring strategy which aims to strengthen its AI capabilities across divisions. The report also reveals that the company may prioritising candidates who have worked on Meta’s Llama models , Reality labs and generative AI infrastructure .Meta has already witnessed multiple rounds of layoffs in 2025. The company has fired around 3,600 employees identified as “low performers” in what Zuckerberg called an “intense year” focused on operational efficiency. Now Microsoft’s targeted hiring threatens to drain Meta’s remaining top-tier talent — especially those working on its most ambitious AI projects.“Meta is working on building some of the most important technologies of the world,” Zuckerberg said in a January memo. “I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams.”Also, Microsoft's ""most-wanted"" list strategy represents a calculated attempt to undermine competitors while strengthening its own AI capabilities. Microsoft’s strategy of targeting specific individual rather than casting a wide net will enable the company to more efficiently deploy and use its resources and also maximise the damage caused to the rivals.The rivalry between Microsoft and Meta is not a new one. However, the rivalry has intensified further as both the tech giants are gearing up to dominate the future of AI. Microsoft has also partnered with OpenAI and has integrated its chatbot ChatGPT into its products.

Elon Musk vs. Apple: The antitrust allegation

xAI founder Elon Musk recently accused Apple of anti-competitive behaviour in its App Store . Musk also threatened Apple with legal action over what he calls an ‘unequivocal antitrust violation ’. In a series of posts shared on X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk has claimed that Apple is unfairly favouring OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT and is also making it “impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach number 1 position in the App Store.” Now, Apple has reposed to Musk’s claims stating that its editorial selections and are based on quality and user experience. The rankings are not based on any kind of politics or partnerships.Responding to Elon Musk’s claims, Apple told Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, “The App Store is designed to be fair and free of bias. We feature thousands of apps through charts, algorithmic recommendations, and curated lists selected by experts using objective criteria.”“Our goal is to offer safe discovery for users and valuable opportunities for developers, collaborating with many to increase app visibility in rapidly evolving categories,” adds Apple.Apple’s response comes after Musk accused the company of favouritism. Elon Musk also criticised Apple for excluding his apps — X and Grok — from the App Store’s “Must-Have” section, despite their high rankings.Apple recently entered into a partnership with OpenAI for the integration of chatGPT into iPhones, iPads and Macs. Musk suggests that this relationship between the two companies is the reason behind the ranking of ChatGPT. However, he has not provided any evidence for his claims. “Apple didn’t just put their thumb on the scale, they put their whole body!” Musk wrote in another post.He added that xAI would take immediate legal action, though no formal lawsuit has been filed yet.","Apple responds to Elon Musk's threat of legal action.

The exemption comes under the national security clause in Section 232 of the US Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which gives the president authority to impose tariffs on imports that threaten national security. However, electronics such as smartphones and laptops—like iPhones—are currently exempt from these new tariffs, shielding India-manufactured iPhones from extra costs in US markets.This means iPhones assembled in India will not face the additional duty in the US market, shielding them from potential price hikes. Apple currently manufactures a large share of its iPhones for the US market in India. According to market researcher Canalys, production increased by 53% to 23.9 million units in the first six months of 2025, while exports increased by 52% to 22.88 million units, valued at $22.56 billion.As mentioned above, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the US President to impose restrictions on goods imports or enter into negotiations with trading partners if the US Secretary of Commerce determines, following an investigation, that the quantity or other circumstance of those imports ""threaten to impair"" US national security.Though Section 232 does not define ""national security,"" it describes steps the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall take ""to determine effects on national security of imports of articles."" In considering the impacts, the Secretary of Commerce and the President are to consider:(1) domestic production required for projected U.S. defense needs(2) capacity of domestic industry to meet such needs(3) existing and anticipated availability of the human resources, products, raw materials, production equipment and facilities, and other supplies and services essential to U.S. national defense(4) growth requirements of domestic industry and related supplies and services to meet U.S. defense needs and necessary conditions to assure such growth(5) the impacts of goods imports on U.S. industry and capacity to meet U.S. defense needs.(1) ""the impact of foreign competition on the economic welfare"" of domestic industry(2) the ""displacement"" of U.S. products by ""excessive imports"" causing effects including ""substantial unemployment,"" decreases in government revenues, and/or loss of investment and skills.Under the national security provision, the US government has placed steep duties—100% in some cases—on certain products such as semiconductors and chips. However, finished consumer electronics remain exempted. Trump has also stated that companies building products in the US will not be charged tariffs on the final product.For now, Apple can continue selling India-assembled iPhones in the US without passing on extra costs to consumers. However, industry analysts note that while the exemption is in place, any future policy change could still affect Apple’s pricing and supply chain strategy.Speaking at Q2 earnings, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the “vast majority” of iPhones sold in the US are made in India. This production strategy helps the company avoid possible supply disruptions and insulates it from the immediate impact of the tariffs.“In terms of the country of origin, it's the same as I referenced last quarter. There hasn't been a change to that, which is the vast majority of the iPhone sold in the US or the majority, I should say, have a country of origin of India,” Tim Cook told analysts.","The Trump administration imposed a 50% tariff on goods imported from India to the US last week.

Thomas Dohmke’s messages to employees: Everybody at GitHub uses GitHub



GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke resigns



GitHub CEO Thomas Dhomke recently revealed that he has made it clear that using the company’s platform is a mandatory part of the job for all employees. Speaking in a recent ‘Decoder’ podcast, the GitHub CEO said that it is clear that GitHub is non-negotiable for employees at the company. “There is no world where I would allow employees to say, ‘Well, sorry, I don’t want to use GitHub.’ If that is the case, you can go work somewhere else.” This rule of the company highlights GitHub’s commitment to its own platform which hosts more than 1 billion repositories and also serve more than 150 million developers globally.As reported by Business Insider, during the recent podcast interview, Dohmke said that it is a rule at GitHub that all the employees will use the platform. The rule applies to everyone from developers to HR professionals. “There is no world where I would allow for somebody to say, 'Well, sorry, I don't want to use GitHub.' And I think that's fair game if the employee doesn't want that, then there's tens of thousands of other tech companies out there where they can have that,"" he said.""But it's part of our company culture that everybody at GitHub uses GitHub.""Under Dohmke’s leadership, GitHub witnessed massive growth from a code-hosting platform to a hub for AI-powered development. The company’s flagship product, GitHub Copilot , now boasts over 20 million users and has introduced features like conversational coding, asynchronous agents, and full-stack app generation.Dhomke also emphasised that GitHub is not just a tool but it’s a developer ecosystem.GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke recently resigned from his position, triggering a major restructuring for the company. After nearly four years at the helm, Dohmke is stepping down signaling his departure from both GitHub and Microsoft. Following his resignation, Microsoft is moving GitHub directly into its new CoreAI team. Reportedly, Microsoft will not replace Dohmke's CEO role, effectively ending GitHub's status as a separate entity and integrating it fully into its operations.“Still, after all this time, my startup roots have begun tugging on me and I’ve decided to leave GitHub to become a founder again,” Dohmke said.“I’ll be staying through the end of 2025 to help guide the transition and am leaving with a deep sense of pride in everything we’ve built as a remote-first organization spread around the world,” he added.","GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke recently resigned from his position, triggering a major restructuring for the company.

Donald Trump's new Immigration Policy to end H-1B Visa Lottery: Here's what it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trumps-new-immigration-policy-to-end-h-1b-visa-lottery-heres-what-it-means/articleshow/123266589.cms,"What the new H-1B visa rule may mean

Poll Do you support changing the H-1B visa system to a wage-based selection? No Yes

From lottery to wage-based system





The White House’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has approved a proposed rule that could change how H-1B visas are given to specialty occupation workers. According to a Bloomberg report, the approval hints that the rule could be made public soon. As per the report, OIRA cleared the rule on August 8, 2025. Currently, the H-1B visa program is heavily used by the tech industry, allowing 85,000 new visas each year. Employers submit applications in the spring, and a random lottery decides which ones can move forward.President Donald Trump has long criticized the H-1B program, claiming some companies use it to replace US workers with cheaper foreign labor, especially the tech industry.If the new rule changes the H-1B selection to a wage-based system, only jobs in the top two wage groups (3 and 4) will be filled by H-1B workers. This would help protect entry-level jobs for Americans, but it would also make it harder for foreign graduates to find jobs in the US.Notably, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has not shared details yet, but the plan is expected to bring back a proposal from the first Trump administration. The plan, as per reports, was aimed to replace the current random lottery with a system that gives priority to applicants based on wages.The first Trump administration introduced the wage-priority idea as part of its “Buy American, Hire American” policy, arguing it would ensure visas went to highly skilled, well-paid foreign workers.However, the Biden administration withdrew the plan in 2021 after receiving over 1,000 public comments opposing it. Critics said the rule would sharply cut the number of eligible foreign workers, especially in entry-level positions.In 2021, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) suggested ranking applications based on four wage levels, giving preference to the highest-paid roles.Federal courts also blocked related efforts to raise the minimum wage levels for H-1B holders and narrow the definition of qualifying jobs. However, supporters of the wage-priority system argue it protects American jobs, while opponents say it limits opportunities for talented but lower-paid professionals.","The White House’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has approved a proposed rule that could change how H-1B visas are given to specialty occupation workers.

How and Why Trump's New Tariffs Will Not Make Your iPhone More Expensive

The public feud between tech billionaires Elon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has escalated into a war of words on X. The dispute began when Musk accused Apple of manipulating its App Store rankings. In a swift counter-attack, Altman fired back, alleging that Musk himself manipulates his social media platform to benefit his own companies and attack rivals. Musk retaliated by calling Altman a liar, only for Altman to throw a challenge.“Will you sign an affidavit that you have never directed changes to the X algorithm in a way that has hurt your competitors or helped your own companies?” Altman asked Musk, adding, “I will apologize if so”.The conflict was ignited when Musk announced his company, xAI , would take legal action against Apple. His frustration stemmed from the fact that OpenAI's ChatGPT holds the top spot among free apps on the App Store, while his own Grok chatbot ranks fifth.“Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation. xAI will take immediate legal action,” Musk said.Altman fired back at Elon Musk, alleging the billionaire manipulates his social media platform Twitter to benefit his companies and harm competitors.""This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like,"" Altman wrote in response to Musk's accusations.Musk quickly retaliated against Altman, writing in a post: ""You got 3M views on your bullshit post, you liar, far more than I’ve received on many of mine, despite me having 50 times your follower count!""","The dispute began when Musk accused Apple of manipulating its App Store rankings.

What Perplexity's Chrome deal includes

Google’s antitrust case creates rare opportunity for Perplexity

Aravind Srinivas-led AI company Perplexity has submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion all-cash offer to acquire Google 's Chrome browser. The three-year-old startup confirmed it sent the formal bid to Google, despite being valued at just $18 billion itself. The bold move comes as Chrome commands over three billion users worldwide, making it a prize asset in the heated race for AI-powered search dominance.""Multiple large investment funds have agreed to finance the transaction in full,"" said Perplexity Chief Business Officer Dmitry Shevelenko. The company has raised around $1 billion so far from major investors including Nvidia and Japan's SoftBank, but declined to name which funds would back this massive acquisition.Perplexity's offer goes beyond just the $34.5 billion price tag. The company has outlined specific commitments designed to address potential regulatory and user concerns about the acquisition.The startup pledges to invest $3 billion over two years in Chrome development and infrastructure improvements. It promises to keep the underlying Chromium code open source, ensuring other browser makers can continue building on the platform. Crucially, Perplexity says it won't change Chrome's default search engine settings.""This is part of our commitment to continuity and choice for users, and will likely be seen as having the benefit of stability for Google and its many advertisers,"" a Perplexity spokesperson said.The all-cash offer includes no equity component, which Perplexity says avoids potential antitrust complications. According to the term sheet, the company would also ""extend offers to a substantial portion of Chrome talent"" to retain key developers and engineers.The timing is no accident. A federal judge ruled last year that Google holds an illegal monopoly in internet search, and now the Department of Justice wants the tech giant to sell Chrome as the primary remedy. US District Judge Amit Mehta is expected to rule on final penalties any day now, potentially forcing Google into the largest corporate breakup in decades.""To remedy these harms, the [Initial Proposed Final Judgment] requires Google to divest Chrome, which will permanently stop Google's control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser,"" the DOJ wrote in court filings.The stakes couldn't be higher. Chrome commands over three billion users worldwide - more than a third of all internet users - making it the ultimate prize in the AI search wars. The browser feeds Google's $300 billion advertising empire by tracking user behavior, search patterns, and website visits across the entire web.The stakes couldn't be higher. Chrome commands over three billion users worldwide - more than a third of all internet users - making it the ultimate prize in the AI search wars. The browser feeds Google's $300 billion advertising empire by tracking user behavior, search patterns, and website visits across the entire web.Without Chrome, Google would lose its most valuable window into user behavior and face a much tougher battle to maintain its 90% dominance in global search.For Perplexity and other AI search challengers like OpenAI (which once had shown interest in an similar purchase), acquiring Chrome would provide instant access to billions of users who currently default to Google search. It would also break Google's stranglehold on the browser market, where Chrome holds roughly 65% market share globally. The browser integration has been crucial to Google's ability to promote its AI features like Search Overviews and fend off competition from chatbots like ChatGPT and Perplexity's own AI search engine.But significant challenges remain for Srinivas & co. Google has shown no interest in selling Chrome and plans to appeal the antitrust ruling through potentially years of legal battles. The $34.5 billion bid also falls short of the at least $50 billion valuation that DuckDuckGo CEO Gabriel Weinberg has suggested Chrome could command in a forced sale scenario.This marks Perplexity's second major acquisition attempt this year, following its January offer to merge with TikTok's US operations."," AI company Perplexity has submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion all-cash offer to acquire Google's Chrome browser.

How Amazon's 'AI mistake' is a basic lesson for every engineer using Gen-AI for coding,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-amazons-ai-mistake-is-a-basic-lesson-for-every-engineer-using-gen-ai-for-coding/articleshow/123028573.cms,"How hackers broke into Amazon's AI coding tool Amazon Q

Vibe coding may be way to go, but there is a security tip

What should developers do

A Gen-AI 'mistake' that ecommerce giant Amazon reportedly made recently is a lesson for almost every techie engineer who used or plans to use the technology to code. According to a report in Bloomberg, a hacker recently infiltrated an AI-powered plugin for Amazon.com Inc.’s coding tool, Q Developer, secretly instructing it to delete files from users’ computers. The breach, reportedly detailed in a 404 Media investigation, highlights a significant security vulnerability in generative AI tools that has been largely overlooked amid the rush to adopt the technology.The incident is said to have occurred in late June when the hacker submitted a seemingly legitimate update, or “pull request,” to the public GitHub repository hosting Amazon’s Q Developer code. The hacker exploited Amazon's coding tool Amazon Q by embedding hidden malicious instructions, as reported by 404 Media. Amazon, like many tech companies, allows external developers to propose code improvements via pull requests, which in this case was approved without detecting the malicious commands. The malicious update, which included hidden instructions to reset systems to a “near-factory state,” went undetected and was approved, Bloomberg noted.The hacker used social engineering, instructing the AI tool to ""clean a system to a near-factory state,"" effectively manipulating it to reset systems to their original, empty state. This demonstrated how AI tools can be compromised through simple prompts on platforms like GitHub. Amazon inadvertently distributed the tampered Q Developer software. This meant even Amazon customers who used Q software faced the risk of their files getting deleted. Luckily for Amazon, the hacker deliberately kept the risk for end users low in order to highlight the vulnerability, and the company said it “quickly mitigated” the problem, according to the company’s statement to Bloomberg. However, the breach underscores broader security concerns in AI-driven software development .Generative AI is transforming coding, enabling developers to save hours by auto-completing code or writing it from natural-language prompts, a trend dubbed “vibe coding.” Startups like Replit, Lovable, and Figma, valued at $1.2 billion, $1.8 billion, and $12.5 billion respectively by Pitchbook, have capitalized on this, often building on models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Anthropic’s Claude. Yet, vulnerabilities persist. The 2025 State of Application Risk Report by Legit Security, cited in the report, found that 46% of organizations using AI for software development do so in risky ways, with many unaware of where AI is deployed in their systems.Other incidents reinforce the trend. Lovable, described by Forbes as the fastest-growing software startup, recently left its databases unprotected, exposing user data, Bloomberg noted. Replit, a competitor, discovered the flaw, prompting Lovable to admit on Twitter, “We’re not yet where we want to be in terms of security.”To mitigate risks, experts suggest instructing AI models to prioritize secure code or mandating human audits of AI-generated code, though this could reduce efficiency, Bloomberg reported. As “vibe coding” democratizes software development, the security challenges it introduces demand urgent attention to prevent future exploits.","A hacker infiltrated an AI-powered plugin for Amazon.com Inc.’s coding tool, Q Developer, secretly instructing it to delete files from users’ computers.

OpenAI’s first Stargate AI facility in Europe: What we know so far



ChatGPT maker OpenAI is expanding its ""Stargate"" data centre project to Europe. The Microsoft-backed AI startup has announced that it will inaugurate a $1 billion facility in Norway next year. This move follows scepticism from Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk , who had previously claimed OpenAI ""don't actually have the money"" for its ambitious AI infrastructure plans. This remark from Musk came in January when OpenAI announced the $500 billion initiative for developing cutting-edge AI infrastructure for the first time. At that time, the world’s richest man also added that ""SoftBank has well under $10B (billion) secured. I have that on good authority."" Replying to Musk, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said: ""I genuinely respect your accomplishments and think you are the most inspiring entrepreneur of our time."" Despite Musk’s doubts, OpenAI announced a Stargate facility in the UAE in May and has now confirmed its first such facility in Europe.In a blog post, OpenAI has confirmed that it is partnering with developer Nscale Global Holdings and investment group Aker ASA for the Norwegian centre in Narvik. The facility will be named Stargate Norway and is planned to deliver 230MW of capacity, with plans to expand by an additional 290MW. The facility aims to employ 100,000 NVIDIA GPUs by the end of 2026, with plans to expand significantly in the years ahead.“This is one of the most ambitious AI infrastructure investments in Europe to date. Narvik’s abundant hydropower, low-cost energy, cool climate, and mature industrial base make it an ideal location to deliver large-scale, sustainable AI capacity. The facility will run entirely on renewable power and is expected to incorporate closed-loop, direct-to-chip liquid cooling to ensure maximum cooling efficiency. Additionally, excess heat from the GPU systems will be made available to support low-carbon enterprises in the region,” the company said in its blog post.In a video presentation (seen by Bloomberg), OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said: “Infrastructure like this is really important and unlocks a ton of potential for developers, researchers, scientists, and startups all across Norway and Europe.”Meanwhile, in the same video, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also confirmed that the facility will run on Nvidia's advanced GB300 Superchip processors, which will be connected via OpenAI’s high-speed NVLink network technology.OpenAI also said that it has recently signed an MoU with the UK Government to advance AI adoption, partnered with Estonia to introduce ChatGPT in secondary schools, and submitted proposals to join EU AI Gigafactories consortiums.","OpenAI is expanding its ""Stargate"" data centre project to Europe.

Microsoft has crossed $4 trillion market valuation, becoming the second company after Nvidia to hit the milestone. According to a CNBC report, the 50-year-old software giant’s shares climbed more than 5% on July 31 after it posted a better-than-expected earnings report, pushing its market cap past the $4 trillion mark. Microsoft reported $76.4 billion in revenue, an 18% year-over-year increase, and $27.2 billion in net income, marking a 24% jump from the previous year. Microsoft's cloud division emerged as the standout performer, with Azure revenue jumping 39% compared to analyst estimates of 34.75%. The company’s Azure cloud platform surpassed $75 billion in annual revenue for the first time with 39% growth year-over-year.During the earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella tols anaylsts: “In our largest quarter of the year, we significantly exceeded expectations.” “Cloud and AI is the driving force of business transformation across every industry and sector. We’re innovating across the tech stack to help customers adapt and grow in this new era,” he said.He further told anaylsts that “we continue to lead the AI infrastructure wave and gained market share every quarter this year”.Earlier this month, the AI chip maker notched a market capitalization of $4 trillion. Nvidia’s dominance was underscored by its 7.3% weighting in the S&P 500, the largest of any company in the index. The surge in AI-driven demand has positioned Nvidia as a key player, with its chips powering cutting-edge technologies across industries.With this, Nvidia and Microsoft have surpassed Apple to become a $4 trillion company.

He stated that “Betting against Elon is like betting against Steve Jobs (Apple founder)”. Responding to the comments, the Tesla CEO acknowledged that while the valuation is possible, it may require ‘extreme execution’.“Extreme execution is needed, but a valuation of $20 trillion for Tesla is possible,” Elon Musk wrote, quoting a post on X (formerly Twitter).Notably, this comes days after Elon Musk warned of ‘few rough quarters’ for Tesla following the expiration of the US tax credit for EVs. In an earnings conference call with analysts and investors this week, the tech billionaire said “We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the US.”Continuing further, he said “We probably could have a few rough quarters. I'm not saying we will, but we could”. “But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling,” Musk added.The EV maker reported a drop in profit for the third quarter in a row, with earnings falling to $1.17 billion, or 33 cents per share, down from $1.4 billion, or 40 cents per share, during the same period last year.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 40 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the April to June quarter also declined — from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion — but still came in slightly higher than analysts had forecast.During the earnings calls, Elon Musk was asked about whether he would want more than his current 13% stake in Tesla to keep control. To this, Musk said he did want more but not too much.“I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction,” he said, “but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”","Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation.

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world. Speaking during an event hosted by the All-In Podcast team and a consortium of tech leaders and lawmakers known as the Hill and Valley Forum, Huang discussed the scale of impact that small, focused teams of AI researchers can have and how Nvidia’s success has translated into significant financial rewards for those in leadership. “I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.” Jensen Huang said. He was responding to a question on the effectiveness and value of smaller AI teams.“But the important big idea is that the impact of 150 or so AI researchers, with funding behind them, can probably create,” he noted. Jensen Huang gave examples of OpenAI which originally started with around 150 employees and China’s DeepSeek which also has a similar workforce.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang added that there's something unique about well-structured, mid-sized teams when given the right resources. “That’s not a small team. That’s a good-size team with the right infrastructure… If you're willing to pay, say, $20 billion, $30 billion to buy a startup with 150 AI researchers, why wouldn't you pay one?”During the interview, the Nvidia CEO also addressed reports that he personally rewards high-performing employees with surprise stock options and RSUs (Restricted Stock Units). When asked if he actually does carry stock options, Jensen Huang joked “Yeah, I'm carrying it in my pocket right now.”He then explained that he takes a hands-on approach to compensation across the company. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day… when they present it, and they send me everybody’s recommended comp, I go through the whole company. I’ve got my methods of doing that, and I use machine learning. I sort through all 42,000 employees.”“100% of the time, I increased the company’s spend on OpEx [operating expenses]. And the reason for that is because you take care of people, everything else takes care [of itself],” Jensen Huang concluded.",N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world.

AI transformation drives Microsoft’s workforce restructuring strategy

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed the company's massive job cuts in a candid memo to employees, acknowledging that recent layoffs affecting over 15,000 workers this year, have been ""weighing heavily"" on him while defending the cuts as necessary for the Redmond giant’s AI transformation.""Before anything else, I want to speak to what's been weighing heavily on me, and what I know many of you are thinking about: the recent job eliminations,"" Nadella wrote to Microsoft's more than 200,000 employees. ""These decisions are among the most difficult we have to make. They affect people we've worked alongside, learned from, and shared countless moments with – our colleagues, teammates, and friends.""The layoffs represent approximately 7% of Microsoft's global workforce, making it the company's largest personnel reduction since 2014. Despite the cuts, Microsoft's stock has soared 21% this year, hitting record highs above $500 per share, while the company reported $75 billion in net income over three fiscal quarters.Nadella directly addressed what he called the ""uncertainty and seeming incongruence"" of cutting jobs while the company thrives financially. ""By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving – our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right,"" he wrote. ""We're investing more in CapEx than ever before. Our overall headcount is relatively unchanged, and some of the talent and expertise in our industry and at Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before. And yet, at the same time, we've undergone layoffs.""The CEO described this contradiction as ""the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value,"" explaining that ""progress isn't linear. It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding.""Nadella emphasised that achieving future success ""will be defined by our ability to go through this difficult process of 'unlearning' and 'learning.'"" He argued this transformation requires Microsoft to ""meet changing customer needs, by continuing to maintain and scale our current business, while also creating new categories with new business models and a new production function.""The memo outlined Microsoft's strategic pivot from a ""software factory to an intelligence engine"" as the company invests $80 billion in AI infrastructure. Nadella envisions a future where ""all 8 billion people could summon a researcher, an analyst, or a coding agent at their fingertips.""""As we begin a new fiscal year, I've been reflecting on the road we've traveled together and the path ahead,"" Nadella wrote, positioning the layoffs within broader industry shifts toward AI-driven automation that have eliminated over 80,000 tech jobs in 2025.The CEO expressed ""sincere gratitude to those who have left,"" acknowledging that ""their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today."" However, he offered no guarantees against future layoffs, instead urging remaining employees to maintain a ""growth mindset"" during what he called the ""messiness"" of transformation.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed the company's massive job cuts in a candid memo to employees.

Read Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates' complete LinkedIn post here



I’ve entered the startup world again…

When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible. But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni.

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

📲Download the Phia iOS app for free at join.phia.com

💻Or if you shop on your computer like me, they have a free chrome extension at gophia.com

Let me know what you think! You never know who’s on the other end of the customer service line…

Bill Gates daughter shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother



Big Question Answered: Why Google is Merging Android and ChromeOS

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, recently demonstrated a unique approach to leadership and family support by working a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup. In a LinkedIn post Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup — Phoebe and Gates agreed to it. “I’ve entered the startup world again… When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes,” wrote Gates in a LinkedIn post.Phoebe Gates co-founded Phia along with her Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni. The platform uses AI to help users compare prices of new and second-hand products across more than 40,000 websites. A web browser/app, Phia aims to be the Booking.com of fashion, offering an instant price comparison from thousands of e-commerce sites for any item, new or used. Phoebe Gates is the youngest child of Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates joined the customer service team of Phia for one day in order to understand how the product works.Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates revealed that this experience reminded him that “the best way to understand how something works—or where it breaks—is to go straight to the people using it.” His stint echoes a growing trend among tech CEOs to spend time on the front lines, following examples like Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who famously delivered food and drove passengers to better grasp user pain points.Earlier, in April this year, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates shared that he intentionally chose not to invest in his daughter’s AI-powered shopping app, Phia, during a podcast. He explained that funding the venture would have led him to oversee it too closely. Instead, he offered advice on staffing while others handled the investment. ""In an interview published by the New York Times, soon after Phia’s web browser and app went live, Bill Gates said: “I thought, ‘Oh boy, she’s going to come and ask.”“I would have kept her on a short leash and be doing business reviews, which I would have found tricky,” the businessman explained of his hesitance. “And I probably would have been overly nice but wondered if it was the right thing to do.”Phoebe Gates recently shared a piece of advice that she got from her mother, Melinda French Gates, about tackling investors. The 22-year-old co-founder of fashion pricing startup Phia got this advice from her mother after she faced queries from potential investors about her future motherhood. While raising funds for Phia with co-founder Sophia Kianni, Gates was asked what would happen if they decided to have children. On the Call Her Daddy podcast, Phoebe shared that this line of questioning prompted a call to her mother. She noted that her mother’s reply was: ""Get up or get out of the game, sis.""According to a report by Benzinga, both founders said that these inquiries expose a persistent bias in venture capital. “Always children,” Melinda Gates said when asked to name the most common bias they’ve faced. Kianni said she turned the tables on a male investor by asking: ""What's going to happen to your venture firm when you have kids?""""He's like, ‘Why would that affect anything?' And I was like, ‘You answered your own question,'” she added.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates worked a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup, Phia.

Sundar Pichai joins the ‘billionaire club’ after leading Google for over a decade; his net worth is…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sundar-pichai-joins-the-billionaire-club-after-leading-google-for-over-a-decade-his-net-worth-is/articleshow/122897734.cms,"Sundar Pichai achieves rare feat as a non-founder CEO

AI-powered growth and record investments

From modest beginnings to Silicon Valley’s summit

After a decade at the helm of Alphabet, Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO. Pichai, who took over as CEO of Google in 2015 and became Alphabet’s chief in 2019, now holds a net worth of $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The milestone comes after Alphabet’s market value soared by over $1 trillion since early 2023, delivering 120% returns to investors. Pichai’s rise has been defined by his leadership through multiple technological shifts, from mobile and cloud computing to AI. As Alphabet’s shares hit record highs, his decade-long stewardship has culminated in both financial success and strategic transformation.While tech billionaires are often company founders, Pichai’s entry into the billionaire club is different. He holds just 0.02% of Alphabet’s economic stake, currently valued at around $440 million. Most of his net worth comes from share sales and performance-based compensation over the past ten years. Bloomberg reports that he has sold over $650 million in stock during his tenure. If he had retained all his shares, they would now be worth more than $2.5 billion. Despite the modest stake, Pichai’s long-term vision and steady leadership have driven massive growth in Alphabet’s core businesses.August 2025 marks ten years since Pichai became CEO of Google. In that time, Alphabet has expanded rapidly, turning once-nascent divisions like YouTube, Cloud, Play, and Subscriptions into billion-dollar engines. In a recent post on X, Pichai highlighted that in 2015, Alphabet’s total revenue was $75 billion, whereas YouTube and Google Cloud alone are now generating an annual run rate of $110 billion. Under his leadership, Alphabet restructured into a parent holding company, sharpened its AI focus, and increased its global footprint.A major factor in Alphabet’s recent trillion-dollar surge has been its aggressive AI investments . The company spent $50 billion in 2023 alone on infrastructure, semiconductors, and data centers to support its AI ambitions. It also raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast by $10 billion, reaching $85 billion, most of which is earmarked for AI infrastructure. “Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand for cloud customers,” Pichai said during the Q2 earnings call. Alphabet’s DeepMind acquisition in 2014 for $400 million has also paid off, helping the company stay ahead in the AI race. Pichai's rise reflects a new era where operational excellence, not just founding status, can build tech empires.Born in Tamil Nadu, India, Sundar Pichai’s journey to Silicon Valley is one of resilience and brilliance. He grew up in a two-room apartment, with his first telephone arriving when he was 12. A scholarship brought him to Stanford in 1993, with a one-way plane ticket that reportedly cost more than his father’s annual salary. Pichai joined Google in 2004, led the development of Chrome, and later oversaw Android, before rising to the top job.Sundar Pichai is also known for his calm, consensus-driven leadership style, which has earned him respect in an industry often defined by bold personalities. In recent years, he has become increasingly vocal on topics like AI regulation, digital privacy, and ethical tech, positioning Alphabet as a global thought leader beyond just innovation.Outside of tech, Pichai has also ventured into sports. He is reportedly part of a group of executives that acquired a 49% stake in the London Spirit cricket team for $182 million. The team competes in The Hundred, a professional cricket league launched in the UK in 2020. While his wealth may not rival that of Alphabet founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth $171.2 billion and $160.4 billion respectively, Pichai's path to the billionaire club is proof that transformational leadership, even without a founding stake, can build both companies and fortunes. His rise underscores a shift in Silicon Valley’s power dynamics—where disciplined execution rivals disruptive invention. As Alphabet charts its future, Pichai’s story stands as a model for aspiring global leaders in tech and beyond.","Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO.

In extreme cases, the regulator can seek court orders to block non-compliant sites or require payment providers and advertisers to withdraw services.The investigations add to Ofcom's existing 11 probes into platforms including 4chan, suicide forums, and file-sharing services. Meanwhile, sites like Pornhub have pledged compliance with the stricter requirements.The regulator expects to announce additional enforcement actions in coming weeks as it continues monitoring compliance across thousands of affected websites.Since the new rules launched, the UK has experienced a dramatic spike in virtual private network usage, with four of the top five free apps on Apple's App Store being VPN services. Proton, the most popular VPN app, reported an 1,800% increase in downloads as users seek to bypass geographical restrictions.The Age Verification Providers Association reported an additional 5 million daily age checks across UK platforms since Friday, representing a massive increase from previous tick-box verification methods.

Judge fines law firm

Sony WF-C710N Review: Solid Sound and Long Battery

A bankruptcy lawyer in the US has been fined after using ChatGPT to cite fake legal cases in court. According to a PCGamer report, Thomas Nield, an attorney from Semrad Law Firm, was found to have submitted four fabricated case citations while representing a client in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. As per the report, the matter came to light when Judge Michael Slade reviewed Nield’s filings and spotted multiple inconsistencies. “In sum, what happened here is that Mr Nield cited four cases for a proposition of law, but none of them exist as alleged in his brief,” the judge said.The report says that Thomas Nield admitted to using AI to assist with the legal brief. He told the publication: “'I think the citation element of these cases, I guess, was—I ran it through AI to some extent, but I didn’t think that the citation was wrong.”Nield told the court he had never used AI before for legal research and did not verify the output because he trusted the program’s accuracy. “He assumed that an AI program would not fabricate quotes entirely,” the court noted.Judge Slade raised concerns over use of AI in the legal environment, saying this practice was ""unacceptable"". He said “At this point, to be blunt, any lawyer unaware that using generative AI platforms to do legal research is playing with fire is living in a cloud.”He said: “The bottom line is this: at this point, no lawyer should be using ChatGPT or any other generative AI product to perform research without verifying the results. Period.”He added that tools like ChatGPT “can write a story that reads like it was written by Stephen King (but wasn’t) or pen a song that sounds like it was written by Taylor Swift (but wasn’t). But they can’t do your legal research for you. ChatGPT does not access legal databases like Westlaw or Lexis, draft and input a query, review and analyze each of the results, determine which results are on point, and then compose an accurate, Bluebook-conforming citation to the right cases.”The PC Gamer report lists four fake citations that the bankruptcy lawyer used in the legal case. These include:According to Judge Slade, none of the quotations matched actual court opinions.None of the quotes matched actual court opinions, and some of the cited cases were entirely fictional. “None of the quotations relied upon in the Semrad brief are actual statements written by any court,” said Judge Slade.Lawyer Thomas Nield and Semrad Law Firm admitted to the mistake, promised not to repeat it, withdrew their request for legal fees, and completed a legal education course. However, Judge Slade ruled that “there must be consequences.”He ordered the firm to pay a $5,500 fine and required Nield and a senior attorney from the firm to attend a mandatory AI ethics session at the National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges.Calling the $5,500 fine a “modest sanction,” the judge warned future offenders: “The next lawyer who does the same thing is warned that he or she will likely see a more significant penalty.”","Bankruptcy lawyer Thomas Nield used ChatGPT to cite fake legal cases in court.

Past tensions between Donald Trump and Jamie Dimon

Sony WF-C710N Review: Solid Sound and Long Battery

JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon visited the White House last week, reports The Wall Street Journal. The meeting, twice in the past two months, signals a change in his long-strained relationship with President Donald Trump . Quoting people familiar with the matter, the report says that Dimon and Trump talked about the economy, trade, and financial regulation. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick were also present, the report stated. During the meeting, Dimon also congratulated Trump on his recent trade agreement with Japan. The group also discussed the ongoing issue of affordable housing and how financial regulations introduced after the 2008 crisis have impacted homeownership in the U.S.According to reports, one of the key topics of discussion between the two was interest rates. Trump has repeatedly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and even threatened to remove him. Dimon, on the other hand, has supported Powell and the Fed’s independence.During the meeting last week, Dimon reportedly told Trump that interest rates could go down if the economy remains strong. This also aligns with what Treasury Secretary Bessent has previously advised the president, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.Last month, Jamie Dimon also met with Trump, along with Vice President JD Vance and other officials. These recent meetings marked the first time in years that Dimon and Trump have had meaningful conversations. Previously, they had exchanged public criticisms on several occasions.Jamie Dimon was one of the business leaders who stepped away from a presidential council after Trump’s remarks about the 2017 racial violence in Charlottesville. He also called Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results “almost treasonous.”In 2023, Trump referred to Dimon as “highly overrated” after the banker showed support for Republican candidate Nikki Haley. Trump also accused JPMorgan of being biased against conservatives.Despite their past, Dimon has recently taken a more neutral tone. He has described himself as a patriot who puts the nation before politics or his company.","Jamie Dimon visited the White House last week.

A new study from Microsoft Research has mapped the growing landscape of the job market in the ear of artificial intelligence. The study has listed 40 jobs that are most likely to be impacted by AI tools. Along with this, the study has also revealed the list of occupations which will remain resilient. Microsoft Research analysed more than 2,00,000 interactions with Microsoft Bing Copilot. The study offer a perspective as to ho generative AI will reshape the workplace dynamics.The study, titled ""Working with AI: Measuring the Occupational Implications of Generative AI,"" found out that jobs heavily focused on language, content creation, and repetitive communication tasks exhibit the highest ""AI applicability scores."" These roles include activities like offering information, writing, advising, teaching. AI chatbots are capable of performing all these tasks with ease.The roles with the highest AI applicability scores—meaning AI can perform or assist with a large portion of their tasks—include:All these jobs include writing, editing, information gathering and communication.On the other end of the spectrum, the study found that hands-on, physical roles are least impacted by AI:These occupations require manual labor, real-time decision-making, or physical presence, which current AI systems cannot replicate.Microsoft Research is not predicting widespread job losses. Instead, the study suggests that AI tools are mainly augmenting productivity and freeing workers to handle more complex and creative tasks. It is also important to note that Microsoft stresses on the fact that no profession is completely preformed by AI in the present situation. Even in high-impact sectors, human judgment, creativity, and ethical oversight remain critical.","Microsoft reveals which jobs are most at risk from AI, and which are safe.

AI tools reach 100 million users as competition intensifies

Microsoft delivered stronger-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results with $76.4 billion in revenue, an 18% year-over-year increase, and $27.2 billion in net income, marking a 24% jump from the previous year. In addition to that, the company has also announced a record-breaking $30 billion capital expenditure plan for the upcoming quarter during its earnings call, driven by surging demand for artificial intelligence services.The company's Azure cloud platform crossed a major milestone, surpassing $75 billion in annual revenue for the first time with 39% growth year-over-year. This unprecedented spending spree positions Microsoft to potentially outpace rivals Amazon and Google in the fierce competition for AI infrastructure dominance.Microsoft's cloud division emerged as the standout performer, with Azure revenue jumping 39% compared to analyst estimates of 34.75%. CEO Satya Nadella emphasised that Azure's growth was ""driven by growth across all workloads,"" not just AI applications. The company projects continued momentum with 37% growth expected for the current quarter, well above analyst predictions of 33.5%.Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood revealed that over half of the $24.2 billion spent in the recently completed quarter went toward long-lived assets designed to support monetisation for 15 years or more, while the remainder focused on CPUs and GPUs for AI workloads. ""I feel very good that the spend that we're making is correlated to basically contracted, on-the-books business that we need to deliver,"" Hood stated during the investor call.Microsoft's gaming segment delivered a complex performance picture, with overall gaming revenue up 10% year-over-year while hardware sales declined 22%. Xbox content and services revenue grew 13%, driven primarily by first-party game launches and Xbox Game Pass subscriptions.In a significant disclosure, Nadella revealed that Xbox Game Pass annual revenue reached nearly $5 billion for the first time, highlighting the success of Microsoft's subscription gaming strategy. The company's cross-platform approach is paying dividends, with Microsoft becoming ""the top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation this quarter"" after bringing previously exclusive titles like Forza Horizon 5 and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to Sony's platform.Microsoft's Windows and devices segment showed modest growth of 3% year-over-year, driven primarily by Windows OEM revenue as businesses refresh their PC fleets ahead of Windows 10's end of support in October. The company launched two new Surface devices during the quarter, the 12-inch Surface Pro and 13-inch Surface Laptop, though CFO Amy Hood cautioned that devices revenue is expected to decline next quarter alongside a Windows OEM revenue drop in the ""mid to high single digits.""The PC market recovery reflects broader industry trends, with Gartner reporting PC shipments up more than 4% in the recent quarter thanks to a Windows 11 refresh cycle for desktop computers. Microsoft primarily monetises Windows through OEM licensing fees paid by laptop and PC manufacturers, making this segment sensitive to overall PC market health.Microsoft's Copilot AI applications surpassed 100 million monthly active users across commercial and consumer offerings, though this figure trails Google's Gemini app, which boasts 450 million monthly active users. The company now claims more than 800 million monthly active users of AI-powered features across all its products.The massive capital investments come amid workforce reductions totalling over 15,000 cuts since May, creating what Nadella described as ""uncertainty and seeming incongruence"" between financial success and layoffs. The company maintains 228,000 full-time employees as of June 30, the same headcount as 2024 before recent cuts.Microsoft's aggressive AI spending comes as the entire industry race to capture the artificial intelligence market, with the company positioning itself just $200 billion short of becoming only the second company to achieve a $4 trillion valuation.","Microsoft delivered stronger-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results with $76.4 billion in revenue, an 18% year-over-year increase, and $27.2 billion in net income.

AI talent wars reach unprecedented heights with nine-figure deals

Mission-driven culture proves resilient against financial temptations, says CEOs

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has taken a firm stand against Big Tech's escalating talent war, warning employees in an internal email that massive salary increases from competitors like Meta could ""destroy"" the company's culture. Speaking on the Big Technology Podcast, Amodei revealed that when Meta and other tech giants began targeting Anthropic engineers with lucrative offers, he sent a clear message to staff: the company would not compromise its compensation principles.""What they are doing is trying to buy something that cannot be bought,"" Amodei said, explaining that many employees rejected external offers and some ""wouldn't even talk to Mark Zuckerberg ."" The CEO emphasized that Anthropic maintains a level-based compensation system where negotiations aren't permitted, calling it a matter of fairness.The competition for artificial intelligence expertise has intensified dramatically, with Meta reportedly offering $100 million signing bonuses to poach OpenAI's top talent. Recent high-profile moves include Meta's $14.3 billion deal for a 49% stake in Scale, bringing CEO Alexandr Wang aboard, and Google's $2.4 billion acquisition of Windsurf's leadership team and intellectual property.Amodei argued that such massive salary disparities based on external recruitment could create unfair treatment within organizations. ""If Mark Zuckerberg throws a dart at a dartboard and hits your name, that doesn't mean you should be paid 10 times more than the guy next to you who's just as skilled,"" he stated.The Anthropic CEO positioned the situation as a ""unifying moment"" that demonstrated his team's commitment to the company's mission over monetary incentives. Anthropic cofounder Benjamin Mann echoed this sentiment, describing the choice as straightforward for mission-oriented employees.Like Amodei, Altman had also said that OpenAI employees are committed to the company's mission, although soon after his comments, news of several employees leaving for Meta came out. Aravind Srinivas , the CEO of Perplexity, suggests that sustainable retention requires balancing both mission alignment and financial growth opportunities for employees navigating an increasingly lucrative AI landscape. Meanwhile, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has called Meta's poaching of AI talent from rival labs a ""rational"" strategy, noting that while compensation matters, ""there are more important things than just money.""","Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned employees that massive salary increases from competitors like Meta could ""destroy"" the company's culture.

Tech titans abandon Democrats over anti-innovation perception

LinkedIn co-founder and Democratic megadonor Reid Hoffman admitted that his own party ""really did alienate"" parts of Silicon Valley , driving tech leaders toward Donald Trump through attacks on cryptocurrency and Big Tech companies. Speaking on Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale's ""American Optimist"" podcast, Hoffman acknowledged that Democratic policies created an environment where tech innovators began viewing the party as hostile to technological progress and business growth.Reid Hoffman expressed particular frustration with California's regulatory environment, despite the state being the birthplace of the tech industry. He cited Aurora Innovation, an autonomous trucking company backed by his Greylock Partners, as a prime example of regulatory dysfunction.While Aurora is headquartered in California, the company successfully tested its first driverless commercial truck in Texas due to more favourable regulations. ""Where are we driving our first heavy-duty trucks? Texas, of course,"" Hoffman said, highlighting the regulatory contrast between blue and red states.The billionaire investor, who spent heavily supporting Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, watched former allies including Elon Musk shift their support to Trump. He attributed this exodus partly to Democrats being perceived as wanting to ""snuff out innovation.""Reid Hoffman emphasised that Silicon Valley's core belief centers on creating ""scale technologies"" through companies to drive human progress. When political leaders attack or limit that process, he argued, ""you have all kinds of problems.""He now recommends Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson's book ""Abundance"" to colleagues, noting that while written from a progressive perspective, it clearly demonstrates areas where Republican-led states outperform Democratic ones in policy innovation.""There are a bunch of things that red states are doing better than blue states, and we should learn from them,"" Hoffman concluded, calling for Democratic leaders to adopt more business-friendly approaches to maintain technological leadership.","LinkedIn co-founder and Democratic megadonor Reid Hoffman admitted that his own party ""really did alienate"" parts of Silicon Valley.

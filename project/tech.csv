Mayhem at Amazon Amid 30,000 Job Cuts: AI - Easy Corporate Excuse? | Global Pulse

CEO Andy Jassy urged staff to embrace AI or risk being left behind

From warning to reality: 14,000 jobs cut despite record profits





Amazon CEO Andy Jassy warned employees in June 2025 that artificial intelligence would shrink the company's corporate workforce, four months before the company announced 14,000 job cuts on October 28. The early signal gave staff a preview of what would become one of the company's largest layoff rounds since the pandemic era.In a company-wide message dated June 17, Jassy explicitly stated that AI adoption would fundamentally reshape Amazon's staffing needs. ""We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,"" he wrote, adding that the company expected ""this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively.""Jassy framed the changes as essential to maintaining Amazon's competitive edge in the AI revolution. He described generative AI as ""the most transformative technology since the Internet"" and emphasized the company's commitment to operating like ""the world's largest start-up—customer-obsessed, inventive, fast-moving, lean, scrappy.""The CEO outlined Amazon's ambitious AI roadmap, revealing that the company had over 1,000 generative AI services and applications in development.He urged employees to embrace the transformation, attend AI workshops, and experiment with the technology. ""Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact,"" Jassy wrote.When the layoffs materialized in late October, affected employees received termination emails from Beth Galetti, senior vice president of People Experience and Technology. The cuts represented approximately 4% of Amazon's 350,000 corporate workforce and marked the deepest job reductions since 27,000 positions were eliminated between late 2022 and early 2023.The timing drew scrutiny as Amazon reported $18 billion in quarterly profits and planned capital expenditures exceeding $120 billion for the year—a nearly 50% increase from 2024, largely directed toward AI and cloud infrastructure development.Galetti's October message echoed Jassy's June warning, stating that AI was ""enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before"" and necessitated a leaner organizational structure. Reuters reported that total job cuts could reach 30,000 employees, with additional reductions expected in January 2026 after the holiday shopping season.Affected employees received 90 days of full pay and benefits, severance packages, and job placement assistance as part of their transition support.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy warned in June 2025 that artificial intelligence would shrink the company's corporate workforce.

Nvidia made history this week by becoming the world's first company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalisation but CEO Jensen Huang is already eyeing a next record. He revealed the chipmaker has secured billions in orders for its AI processors -- a level of revenue visibility that he says is unmatched in the technology industry.“I think we are probably the first technology company in history to have visibility into half a trillion dollars [in revenue],” Huang said, referring to orders for the company’s current Blackwell generation and upcoming Rubin chips scheduled to launch next year.At Nvidia's GTC developer conference in Washington, Huang disclosed the company has secured more than $500 billion in orders for AI chips through the end of 2026, according to Fortune.The massive order backlog provides Nvidia with extraordinary confidence about future revenue—a level of predictability rare in the technology sector, where demand can shift rapidly and product cycles create uncertainty.During the conference, Huang announced that Nvidia is manufacturing its Blackwell GPUs in full production at a facility in Arizona—a move he attributed to Trump's push to bring manufacturing back to the United States.The potential for expanded access to China's market added momentum to Wednesday's gains. President Donald Trump said aboard Air Force One that he planned to discuss Nvidia's Blackwell chip with Chinese President Xi Jinping during their meeting Thursday in Busan, South Korea.Trump praised the Blackwell processor as “super duper” and claimed it is “probably 10 years ahead of any other chip”.The discussion carries enormous implications for Nvidia, which has been effectively locked out of China—previously one of its largest markets—due to US export controls and Chinese government restrictions on American chip purchases.Huang confirmed earlier in October that the company's market share in China had plummeted from 95% to zero. The loss has cost Nvidia billions in revenue, with the company reporting only $2.8 billion from China in its most recent quarter, down from $15.5 billion in the prior period.",N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says the company has secured more than $500 billion in orders for AI chips through the end of 2026.

Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky has warned companies against replacing entry-level workers with artificial intelligence (AI), arguing that failing to hire young employees today will create a leadership crisis tomorrow.""[AI] can do a lot of lower-level, more entry-level position jobs. But if no young people can get jobs, then you have no one in the future to do the highly strategic leadership positions,"" Chesky told ABC News in a recent interview (via Fortune).“So we need to make room for people early in their careers, even if AI can do the interns' work,” he added.Chesky’s comments come as companies including Amazon, Meta, and Salesforce cut workers to make way for AI investments and job automation, raising fears that technology could permanently replace human jobs, the report said, adding that employers are using AI to automate simpler, lower-level tasks, managers express hesitance to hire Gen Z professionals, and internship opportunities are dwindling.Despite AI's capabilities, Chesky maintained that humans don't “realize how smart people are relative to AI,” and that workers will always be needed for novel and operational tasks.More importantly, he argued, chatbots lack the human touch necessary for effective leadership.“People are going to still want relationships. Leadership is still going to matter. I think AI is mostly going to be a tool. I don't think it's magic,” Chesky noted.However, for Gen Z to develop these leadership capabilities, they need opportunities to work their way from the bottom up and learn the ropes—especially as millennials and Gen Xers eventually age out of their positions.","Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky warned companies against replacing entry-level workers with artificial intelligence.

What is Artificial Superintelligence





Key details of ‘new’ ASI team in OpenAI









A core engineer behind OpenAI ’s viral text-to-video model, Sora, has returned to the company after a hiatus to launch a new team dedicated to pursuing Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). Will DePue, a key contributor to Sora, has announced that he is joining forces with fellow Sora engineers Troy Luhman and Eric Luhman to tackle a “high-risk” goal.“After a long break, i’m back at openai to start a new team with @troyluhman and @eric_luhman1 focused on an incredibly high-risk bet that has a small, but significant, chance of leading to ASI,” he said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).Artificial ASI is a theoretical advancement where AI can reason and innovate far beyond human capability. This looks beyond the company's existing public goal of achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)—the point where AI can reason like a human.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman articulated the company’s forward-looking focus on superintelligence earlier this year, stating that “Superintelligent tools could massively accelerate scientific discovery and innovation well beyond what we are capable of doing on our own.”DePue, who is on leave from his computer science studies at the University of Michigan, originally joined OpenAI in July 2023, where he trained ChatGPT models and developed Sora, according to a report by Business Insider.Details about the new team’s structure remain scarce, as OpenAI has not yet released an official statement. However, DePue noted that the team would remain small and highly selective.“We're keeping the team tight but we're open to high-slope researchers & engineers interested in making progress in uncharted territory,” he wrote.DePue, Troy Luhman, and Eric Luhman were part of the core group that developed Sora, which was publicly launched in December last year, with Sora 2 following in September.","Will DePue, a key contributor to OpenAI’s viral text-to-video model, Sora, has returned to the company after a hiatus to launch a new team dedicated to pursuing Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) ASI is a theoretical advancement where AI can reason and innovate far beyond human capability.

Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses





Meta has reportedly urged the US district court to dismiss a copyright lawsuit from adult-film producer Strike 3 Holdings, which accused the tech giant of illegally torrenting thousands of its videos to train an unannounced AI model. In a court filing, Meta described the allegations as resting on “guesswork and innuendo” and labeled Strike 3 a “‘copyright troll’ that files extortive lawsuits.” “These claims are bogus,” a Meta spokesperson told Ars Technica. Strike 3 had traced roughly 2,400 downloads of its titles to Meta corporate IP addresses over seven years, plus additional activity it alleged Meta hid behind a “stealth network” of 2,500 obscured addresses. The plaintiff speculated the files fed a secret adult version of Movie Gen, Meta’s video-generation AI, and sought damages potentially topping $350 million.Meta countered that the downloads began in 2018 -- four years before its multimodal and generative-video research—and totaled just 22 titles annually, “intermittently obtained one file at a time.” Such “meager, uncoordinated activity,” the company wrote, points to “private personal use” by individuals, not a coordinated data-harvesting effort.“[T]hefar more plausible inference… is that disparate individuals downloaded adult videos for personal use,” Meta’s motion states.The company noted that its terms of service prohibit generating adult content, “contradicting the premise that such materials might even be useful for Meta’s AI training.” Strike 3, Meta added, “cite[d] no facts to suggest that Meta has ever trained an AI model on adult images or video, much less intentionally so.”Meta also disputed any firm link to its employees. “Tens of thousands of employees,” plus contractors, visitors, and third parties, access its network daily, the filing says. One cited incident involved a contractor allegedly torrenting at his father’s house; Meta called this “plainly indicative of personal consumption” and noted the engineer’s automation role offered “no apparent basis” for sourcing training data. On the “stealth network” claim, Meta asked: “[W]hy would Meta seek to ‘conceal’ certain alleged downloads… but use easily traceable Meta corporate IP addresses for many hundreds of others?”Meta noted that Strike 3 cannot claim that Meta should have been better at “policing” its network for illegal activity. “Monitoring every file downloaded by any person using Meta’s global network would be an extraordinarily complex and invasive undertaking,” Meta argued, citing precedent that only requires Meta employ a “simple measure” to monitor such activity.Meta further argued it cannot be expected to minutely police every download across its global network, citing legal precedent requiring only “simple measure[s]” to curb infringement. “We don’t want this type of content, and we take deliberate steps to avoid training on this kind of material,” the Meta spokesperson told Ars Technica.Strike 3 has two weeks to respond, per TorrentFreak. A victory for Meta means that it not only avaoids hefty damages but reinforce its stand that its video AI tools are designed to stay away from explicit material.","Adult-film producer accused Meta of illegally torrenting thousands of its videos to train an unannounced AI model.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

“Now, a rare earth plan has been put together by the government. NITI Aayog has worked on it. All that is going on. But it will take us five to seven years to get there. But there's a faster way... the faster way is that a lot of that e-waste we were talking about earlier contains rare earths. So what we should do is take all that rare e-waste and convert it into the rare earth materials we need. Tons and tons of that can be created,”

“It's the weaponisation of anything that you can think of. Software, hardware, rare earths, you know, EVs, batteries, all of these are being weaponised now,”

HCL co-founder Ajai Chowdhry on China’s control over rare earth minerals



“Rare earths are absolutely essential for many, many products. EVs, for example, and batteries, all these products use rare earth. What China did in the last 10 or 15 years: they started sourcing from all over the world and bought over the mines. So today, 90% of the world's rare earths are controlled by them, and they can be weaponised. So if they don't supply rare earth, a lot of our products cannot be developed, whether they're in India and America or Europe,""





HCL co-founder Ajai Chowdhry has suggested that India should meet its demand for rare-earth minerals by recycling e-waste. Chowdhry, who is also the Chairman of the National Quantum Mission, has proposed this solution to reduce dependency on foreign sources. He claimed that 30-40% of domestic demand can be met through this “non-mined” route. This approach offers a faster alternative than waiting five to seven years for new mining projects to start, he added. This urgent need for domestic supply stems from the use of critical technologies as ‘weapons’ in global trade, according to Chowdhry. In an interview with the news agency ANI, Chowdhry explained that while the Centre and NITI Aayog have prepared a comprehensive plan for rare earth minerals, the faster option is to recycle electronic scrap.he explained.The HCL co-founder also warned that China's control over rare earth elements poses a serious strategic risk to global manufacturing, including India's plans for electric vehicles (EVs) and advanced technologies.he added.At the interview, Chowdhry also discussed how China has gained control over critical minerals over the past decade and a half by sourcing globally and acquiring mines.Chowdhry noted.","HCL co-founder Ajai Chowdhry has suggested that India should meet its demand for rare-earth minerals by recycling e-waste.

A robotics company is now accepting pre-orders for Neo, a humanoid robot designed to handle household tasks—but there's a catch. The $20,000 machine won't actually be working alone. Instead, a human operator will remotely control it through cameras while peering into your home.1X Technologies showed off its robot, named Neo, as a 5-foot-6-inch, 66-pound assistant capable of folding laundry, loading dishwashers, and fetching groceries. The robot is built with a patented tendon-driven actuator system that its makers say allows gentle, quiet movement—they go on to promise it to be quieter than a refrigerator. The Neo has a soft polymer body and 3D lattice structure that help it move smoothly around humans, without posing a safety hazard. Neo can lift up to 154 pounds and carry 55 pounds, with IP68-rated waterproof hands for wet tasks. The robot can run for four hours on a single charge. It also supports WiFi, Bluetooth, and 5G—just pop in a SIM card for cellular access.But here's where things get interesting. While Neo can handle basic autonomous tasks like opening doors or turning off lights, anything more complex requires human intervention—literally.CEO Bernt Børnich told The Wall Street Journal that Neo's AI system still needs real-world training data to improve. That means early adopters must agree to let human teleoperators see inside their homes through the robot's cameras to teach it new tasks.""If we don't have your data, we can't make the product better,"" Børnich explained. Owners can schedule when operators take control through an app, specify tasks, and designate no-go zones. The company also promises to blur humans from the operator's view and has implemented security measures to prevent unauthorized access.The company's bet is that enough people will trade privacy concerns for convenience—and contribute to training an AI that might eventually work independently. Whether households are ready to invite remotely operated robots into their daily routines remains to be seen.The company promises deliveries will begin in 2026, with a $499 monthly subscription option also available.

Read the Microsoft CFO’s full email:

Team,

This afternoon, we announced our first-quarter financial results. We exceeded Wall Street expectations, growing revenue 18% to $77.7 billion and operating income by 24% to $38.0 billion—a strong start to the fiscal year with continued momentum and share gains across many of our businesses.

Yesterday, we signed a new agreement with OpenAI—another big step forward in a partnership that's been game-changing for our industry. Our Q1 results do not include any impact from this new agreement, as it was signed after the quarter ended.

Microsoft Cloud revenue was $49.1 billion, growing 26% (25% in constant currency), driven by accelerating demand and the trust customers place in us to power their innovation, growth, and transformation.

Across the company, there were many highlights this quarter, but a few for me stand out as reminders of the critical role our products and services play for our customers every day:

Commercial remaining performance obligation (RPO) grew over 50% to $392 billion — nearly doubling over the past two years.





We invested $34.9 billion in capex on GPUs, CPUs, and datacenter infrastructure to continue to expand capacity and support strong demand signals we see.





Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 39% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Customers are putting our full stack — cloud infrastructure, AI, data, and applications — to work, embedding AI throughout their business.





Microsoft 365 commercial cloud revenue grew 17% and 15% in constant currency reflecting continued ARPU growth from E5 and M365 Copilot as well as seat growth of 6%.





M365 Consumer cloud revenue increased 26% and 25% in constant currency, and subscriptions were over 90 million.





Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue grew 16% and 15% in constant currency driven by higher search volume and continued benefit from third-party partnerships. Bing and Edge again took share.





Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 6% primarily from strong demand ahead of Windows 10 end of support.





Xbox content and services revenue increased 1% and set a record for Xbox players on PCs as well as Minecraft monthly active users.





And, LinkedIn grew 10% and 9% in constant currency and now has nearly 1.3 billion members.





Investors tune in to our earnings call for the full details on this quarter and a look ahead to Q2. I recommend you do the same—it helps create shared context as we deliver on our commitments. Join live today at 2:30 PM Pacific, listen on-demand, or check the transcript on the Investor Relations website.

Then, mark your calendar for Ignite, November 18-21, a showcase of our latest innovations. The opening day keynote is the one to watch, with Judson, Scott, and Ryan highlighting how we're helping customers use AI and the Microsoft Cloud to drive real impact.

Finally, thank you. We've had a great start to our fiscal year, and there's nothing quite like being part of a winning team—focused, collaborative, and always pushing to do its best for our customers. Demand continues to accelerate, and we're investing to capture the opportunity ahead. Across teams, we're bringing new products to market and adding capacity at record speed to deliver meaningful impact for our customers. It's a defining time not only for our business, but for every organization—and we're only getting started.

With appreciation and gratitude,

Amy

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?





Nvidia on Wednesday, October 29 became the world’s first company to hit a $5 trillion market valuation, overtaking both Apple and Microsoft. The record-breaking surge came shortly after CEO Jensen Huang made a bold statement during the company’s GTC developer conference in Washington, D.C. , saying Nvidia had “visibility into half a trillion dollars in revenue.”Jensen Huang revealed that Nvidia has secured more than $500 billion in chip orders through 2026. He added: “I think we are probably the first technology company in history to have visibility into half a trillion dollars [in revenue]”, referring to demand for the company's Blackwell and upcoming Rubin chip architecture.The remark, signaling massive demand for Nvidia’s artificial intelligence chips, sparked investor optimism and sent shares soaring more than 14% over the past five days.Despite facing setbacks in China due to export controls, Nvidia continues to expand its U.S. manufacturing operations, with Blackwell GPU production now in full swing in Arizona. The company also announced $1 billion in new partnerships with Nokia for 5G and 6G development and Oracle for building AI supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy.From a $1 trillion valuation in mid-2023 to $5 trillion in 2025, Nvidia’s rapid rise highlights its dominant position in the global AI chip market—and how a single line from Huang captured the scale of its growth.Nvidia made history by becoming the first company ever to reach a $5 trillion market valuation. The company reached $5 trillion in market value just over three months after crossing $4 trillion, suggesting accelerating momentum in AI adoption across industries. Shares of the chipmaker rose more than 4%, pushing its market capitalisation past the threshold and cementing its position at the centre of the global AI boom.Nvidia ranks ahead of Microsoft ($4 trillion) and Apple ($3.9 trillion), as well as Google parent Alphabet ($3.2 trillion), Amazon ($2.4 trillion) and Meta ($1.8 trillion).","N Nvidia on Wednesday, October 29 became the world’s first company to hit a $5 trillion market valuation, overtaking both Apple and Microsoft.

Google To Invest $15 Billion On AI Hub In Visakhapatnam, CEO Sundar Pichai Speaks To PM Modi

Rise in capex worries analyts

""Other Bets"" report lossees





Google's parent company Alphabet, shattered records Wednesday, October 29, by reporting its first-ever $100 billion in quarterly revenue. The tech giant's revenues climbed 16% year-over-year to $102.3 billion in the third quarter. Net income soared 33% to $35 billion, underscoring Alphabet's knack for riding the artificial intelligence wave reshaping the industry.Google Cloud unit stole the spotlight in Q3, with the division growing fastest reporting a staggering 34% revenue jump to $15.2 billion. Competing fiercely against Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud turned in a profit of $3.59 billion -- topping estimates of $3 billion—and solidified its role as Alphabet's premier growth engine. The unit's backlog of unfulfilled contracts stands at $155 billion, a clear signal of AI-driven demand. CEO Sundar Pichai praised the ""strong momentum"" from AI integrations, including global rollouts of features in Google Search and the Gemini models, with the Gemini App now boasting over 650 million monthly active users.""Alphabet had a terrific quarter, with double-digit growth across every major part of our business,"" Pichai said in a statement.Core search and advertising remained the revenue backbone at $56.6 billion (up from $49.4 billion), while YouTube ads rose to $10.3 billion from $8.9 billion. Alphabet also touted over 300 million paid subscriptions across Google One and YouTube Premium.The company said its Gemini app now boasts over 650 million monthly active users and that a growing amount of users were using the company's AI Mode for search queries.Like other major tech companies, Google's spending spree too has raised worries about a potential bubble. Though in Google's case rise in capital expenditure is not as high as that for Meta and Nvidia. Alphabet now expects to budget $91 billion to $93 billion for capital expenditures this year, up from $85 billion in its previous quarterly report issued in July, with most of the money said to be earmarked for the massive data centers needed to power AI.While Google showed robust growth, Alphabet's experimental ""Other Bets"" division, which includes autonomous vehicle unit Waymo, posted a loss of $1.4 billion on revenues of just $344 million.","Google's parent company Alphabet reported its first-ever $100 billion in quarterly revenue.

"How AI is behind mass layoffs, but also creating the jobs that replace them",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-ai-is-behind-mass-layoffs-but-also-creating-the-jobs-that-replace-them/articleshow/124946748.cms,"Disclaimer: This is an AI-generated image

Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency

The efficiency illusion

The market logic behind the cuts



The hiring underneath the firing

The blue-collar rebound

The gold rush for AI talent

The real question: who adapts fast enough?





In the boardrooms of Silicon Valley, a peculiar narrative has taken hold. CEOs hand out thousands of pink slips with one hand while signing billion-dollar AI investments with the other.Welcome to the great tech paradox of 21st century, where the rules of corporate logic seem to have been rewritten entirely.A new reality of work in the age of artificial intelligence is taking shape—one that is neither a straightforward story of automation nor of progress. As companies reshape themselves around AI, they’re creating a bifurcated workforce—one rapidly shrinking, another expanding just as fast. The question isn’t whether AI is taking jobs, but which ones, how fast, and what comes next.The numbers tell a perplexing story. Amazon’s 14,000 job cuts represent roughly 4% of its 350,000-strong white-collar workforce—despite posting $18 billion in quarterly profits. Microsoft’s layoffs arrived as the company’s AI investments surged to record highs. Salesforce has eliminated about 4,000 customer service roles, and Google has trimmed back several non-technical divisions.The reason for them all is the same: artificial intelligence.Google CEO Sundar Pichai insists the company “will grow from our current engineering base even into next year,” claiming AI allows engineers to be “dramatically more productive.” At Salesforce, Marc Benioff has called AI “the next platform shift,” with 50% of customer interactions now handled by AI systems—cutting support costs by double digits.Beth Galetti, Amazon’s HR head, called AI “the most transformative technology since the Internet.” JPMorgan’s CFO warned managers to “avoid hiring reflexively.” Goldman Sachs’ David Solomon declared that embracing AI “means rethinking how we organise our people.”But the timing complicates the narrative. ChatGPT’s 2022 breakout coincided with the end of the pandemic hiring bubble. Indeed reports tech job postings down 36% since 2020—but AI is only part of that correction.Still, behind those spreadsheets and efficiency metrics, something stranger is happening: the cuts aren’t just about saving money—they’re reshaping who counts as valuable work.Layoffs have become a performance signal. CEOs now boast about shrinking headcount.Verizon’s Hans Vestberg told investors the company has been “very, very good” on staffing. Wells Fargo’s Charlie Scharf calls attrition “our friend.” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella framed it best: “By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving… yet headcount remains flat.” His explanation: “Progress isn’t linear. It’s dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding.”Wall Street seems to agree. Microsoft’s stock hit $500 after its July layoffs; Amazon’s barely dipped. Investors now treat job cuts as proof of efficiency.Yet the underlying logic—that AI productivity automatically translates into profit—is shakier than it looks.MIT economist Daron Acemoglu argues that AI’s measurable impact remains limited to narrow administrative and analytic tasks. Yale’s Martha Gimbel, who leads the Budget Lab, adds that “because everyone is so freaked out about AI, people overreact to company announcements.” Her lab found no discernible disruption from ChatGPT so far—“minimal and incredibly concentrated.”An MIT study backs that up: 95% of corporate AI investments have generated “zero return.” Gimbel calls most “AI layoffs” a convenient cover for cyclical corrections rather than real automation gains.Still, certain data points hint at genuine change. The Stanford Digital Economy Lab found hiring for entry-level “AI-exposed” roles down 13%—software, customer service, and clerical work hit hardest.Amazon embodies this tension. Even as its automation division warned that AI could eventually offset half a million warehouse jobs, the company laid off 14,000 managers instead. Internal documents suggested AI would help Amazon avoid hiring 160,000 US workers by 2027—a figure later downplayed as “incomplete and misleading.”As executives defend cuts as “strategic resets,” another layer of the paradox emerges: the same companies trimming staff are quietly hiring elsewhere.Salesforce presents the paradox most clearly. After cutting 4,000 support roles, CEO Marc Benioff told CNBC the company hired 3,000 to 5,000 salespeople and aims for 20,000 account executives. “AI doesn’t have a soul,” he said. “It’s not that human connectivity.”Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian told Big Technology that when clients adopted its AI-powered Customer Engagement Suite, “almost none of them let anyone go.” Instead, AI tools handle routine queries, allowing human agents to focus on complex issues.The catch: the new roles require fundamentally different skills than the old ones. A customer service rep can’t pivot into machine learning overnight. The gap between job elimination and job creation isn’t just temporal—it’s educational. Companies are hiring people with AI skills, not retraining those who lack them.The numbers tell a mixed story. Reuters tallies show 25,000 job cuts in October but unemployment still at 4.3%. The New York Fed found only 1% of service firms have laid off workers directly due to AI. Economists call this the “low-hiring, low-firing” phase—selective cuts, targeted growth.Amazon’s layoffs affect less than 1% of its 1.56 million workers. Microsoft’s 15,000 represent 6.5% of its total. Not catastrophic, but concentrated—mostly in mid-career and entry-level tech roles.Goldman Sachs estimates 6–7% of US workers could lose jobs due to AI, while the World Economic Forum predicts 92 million lost and 170 million created—a net gain of 78 million. Yet those losing jobs aren’t the same as those gaining them.Indeed reports the steepest hiring declines in AI hubs like San Francisco, Boston, and Seattle. The hardest hit: recent graduates and professionals whose skills don’t match AI priorities.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy summed it up: “We’ll need fewer people doing some jobs, and more doing others. Over time, AI will make us more efficient—but it’ll also change who we need.”If white-collar workers are anxious, tradespeople are booming. Nvidia’s Jensen Huang argues the AI revolution isn’t destroying jobs—it’s moving them.“We’re literally seeing the construction of AI factories everywhere,” he said, referring to the massive data centres rising from Singapore to Ohio. Each site, costing up to several billion dollars, demands thousands of electricians, construction workers, and engineers.A single 250,000-square-foot facility can employ 1,500 construction workers during its buildout—many earning six figures without degrees. “This is the new steel and concrete,” Huang said. “Except it’s made of silicon and software.”McKinsey estimates data-centre spending will hit $7 trillion by 2030. Nvidia’s revenue surge mirrors that momentum, feeding a broader industrial boom. “For the young, 20-year-old Jensen,” Huang joked, “he probably would have chosen more physical sciences than software sciences.”Stanford economist Erik Brynjolfsson adds, “We’re going to see turbulence in both directions. The AI economy will reward those who build the tools—and those who build the spaces for the tools to run.”As Silicon Valley cut jobs and build new ones, AI researchers are living in a different world—one where the money is staggering.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg kicked off the most aggressive hiring spree in recent tech history, reportedly offering nine-figure packages to poach around 50 top scientists from OpenAI, Tesla, Apple, and Google. “You actually want the smallest group of people who can fit the whole thing in their head,” he told The Information, calling it an “absolute premium” market.Microsoft, which already struck gold with its OpenAI partnership, quietly hired two dozen DeepMind employees. Google retaliated by pouring $2.4 billion into Windsurf—snatching it from OpenAI’s reach—and acquiring its CEO and team. OpenAI, in turn, poached Tesla’s former VP of software engineering and xAI’s top infrastructure architects.The competition centres on a tiny pool of talent—perhaps a few hundred people globally. For these elite researchers, pay has entered the realm of private equity.The irony wasn’t lost. Months into pouring billions into AI, Meta laid off roughly 600 people from its legacy AI infrastructure team—widely seen as a move to fund its race toward “superintelligence.”Stanford data shows why. OpenAI’s GPT-4 cost $79 million to build, Google’s Gemini 1.0 Ultra cost $192 million, and Meta’s Llama 3.1-405B, $170 million. When models cost that much, paying $100 million for the people who build them seems almost rational.But the paradox is glaring: as elite researchers command nine-figure paydays, mid-level technologists face redundancy.And that brings the question full circle—what happens to everyone else in between?The new reality of work isn’t just about who gets hired—it’s about who can adapt fast enough to stay in the race.Nvidia’s Jensen Huang insists AI will amplify human potential, not replace it. “You’re not going to lose your job to an AI,” he said. “You’re going to lose it to someone who uses AI.”Anthropic’s Dario Amodei is less sanguine: “Half of all entry-level white-collar jobs could vanish within five years. Cancer is cured, GDP is booming—and 20% of people don’t have jobs.”OpenAI’s Sam Altman mused that many jobs “might not be real work” at all—a statement that lands differently when entire departments are disappearing.Google’s Sundar Pichai, meanwhile, projects long-term continuity. “Whoever leads this company on its 50th birthday will have an extraordinary AI companion,” he said.The tech giants are conducting a live experiment. They're betting that AI capabilities justify current cuts, that new jobs will materialise to absorb displaced workers, that skills gaps can be bridged, and that overall economic productivity gains will outweigh transitional disruptions.Accenture illustrates this logic in practice. CEO Julie Sweet described the firm’s approach during an earnings call as “upskilling its reinventors”—employees expected to demonstrate tangible AI system training to stay relevant. The company eliminated roughly 11,000 roles through an $865 million restructuring. “Where we don’t have a viable path for skilling—sort of exiting people so we can get more of the skills in we need,” Sweet said.The message was clear: adaptation isn’t optional, but it isn’t painless either. For every worker learning to use AI tools, another is being replaced by them.The story plays out across industries. Banks are hiring fewer tellers but more prompt engineers. Manufacturers are shrinking administrative staff but adding AI-integrated technicians. The divide isn’t simply between blue- and white-collar work anymore—it’s between those who can work with machines and those who can’t.History suggests they might be right. Electricity, automobiles, and computers ultimately created more jobs than they eliminated, though the transitions were painful and took decades.But the difference this time is pace. Previous industrial revolutions unfolded over generations, allowing social systems to adapt gradually. The current transformation is compressing into years, perhaps months.The great paradox of 21st century isn’t whether AI will take our jobs—it’s that it already has, and also hasn’t. Companies are still experimenting, economies are still absorbing the shock, and workers are still learning what “future-proof” actually means. For now, the only constant in this new labour equation is volatility.","Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce and Google are all cutting jobs in favor of artificial intelligence. The paradox is that the rules of corporate logic seem to have been rewritten entirely. The question isn’t whether AI is taking jobs, but which ones, how fast, and what comes next.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124951233,imgsize-178398,width-400,resizemode-4/disclaimer-this-is-an-ai-generated-image.jpg"

Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson has announced that Chief Customer and Digital Officer Catriona Larritt will leave the airline at the end of the year to ""pursue external opportunities,"" marking the first major executive change since Hudson took the helm in early 2024. Larritt, who has spent over a decade with the Qantas Group in various roles, was promoted to her current position from executive manager of Qantas Freight during Hudson's initial leadership overhaul following the departure of former CEO Alan Joyce.In an employee memo, Hudson praised Larritt's ""significant contribution to the group"" and extended best wishes for her future endeavors. The departure triggers an immediate restructuring of responsibilities within the executive team, with a search for Larritt's replacement to begin both internally and externally. Hudson described the changes as an opportunity to ""reallocate some areas currently under the customer and technology portfolios to ensure we are set up for success.In the first instance, corporate affairs chief Danielle Keighery will take responsibility for brand and marketing, with chief marketing officer Petra Perry and team to report to her. ""Combining these two key interrelated areas will help accelerate the progress we are making to recover our brand and reputation and capitalise on the opportunities that lie ahead including Project Sunrise,"" Ms Hudson said.""This change is effective immediately. "" Project Sunrise refers to Qantas' ultra-long-haul flights, such as non-stop services from Sydney to London and New York.In a transition set to complete over the coming month, Chief Risk Officer Andrew Monaghan will take on cyber security responsibilities. ""Bringing cyber security and risk together will further strengthen governance in this critical area,"" Hudson added. Other functions under Larritt's role will remain unchanged for now.The announcement comes as Qantas grapples with the aftermath of a major cyber security breach earlier this year. Hackers stole personal details of 5.7 million customers from a database linked to the airline's Manila call centre, including names, addresses, birthdates, phone numbers, email addresses, and frequent flyer information. The data was published on the dark web this month after Qantas refused ransom demands.In response, the Qantas board imposed a 15 per cent cut to executives' short-term bonuses, totaling $800,000. The airline has secured a permanent injunction barring third parties, including media outlets, from releasing or publishing the stolen data. Beyond Qantas, Larritt serves as a director of the Essendon Football Club and a board member of Australian Athletics.Hudson assured employees that updates on the recruitment process would follow once finalized. The reshuffle underscores ongoing efforts to rebuild trust and operational resilience at Australia's flag carrier following a turbulent period of reputational challenges.","Chief Customer and Digital Officer Catriona Larritt will leave the airline at the end of the year to ""pursue external opportunities"" The departure triggers an immediate restructuring of responsibilities within the executive team.

Mayhem at Amazon Amid 30,000 Job Cuts: AI - Easy Corporate Excuse? | Global Pulse





Artificial intelligence (AI) is said to be the biggest driver of economic change in the future. From technology advancements to concerns like job loss, AI is said to reshape the global landscape. While it promises innovation and efficiency, experts have been warning against mass job losses, and unemployment due to AI. The AI threat has now grown from predictions of certain industries becoming obsolete to entire companies getting wiped out. Renowned Computer Science professor Pedro Domingos has made a striking prediction on X (formerly known as Twitter).Domingos, professor emeritus of computer science and engineering at the University of Washington and the author of 2040 and The Master Algorithm said that the “first big tech company to be destroyed by AI will be Salesforce.”His statement generated a wave of online discussion with many users commenting on the post with over 400K views. When an X user asked “so you think CRM is easy”, Pedro Domingos replied “No, I think it could be way better.”A user commented on the post writing “They’re vulnerable because CRM is fundamentally about data capture and retrieval. AI does both better and faster. Unlike Adobe or Microsoft where the creative tools have decades of muscle memory, nobody has muscle memory for filling out Opportunity fields.It’s pure friction.”Another user disagreed with Domingos’ opinion, writing “Nope. Salesforce has very good connections with traditional corps. They just need to repackage LLMs into their product and sell to current customers (who almost never change providers). And they are doing it actively: Missionforce, Agent Fabric, Agentforce Vibes…”“Every major BigSaaS platform will be disrupted. The economics of software products have completely shifted, and they are simply not operationally positioned, or nimble enough, to respond to what is coming,” wrote a third user.“Totally agree. The whole point of these software that offered a lot of customizations were to address better specific customer process.

Pat Gelsinger, former Intel CEO who was ousted by board after disastrous performance earlier this year, recently shared his views on Nvidia’s decision to manufacture its most advanced AI chips – Blackwell in Arizona, US. Sharing a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Gelsinger applauded the company stating that he is “pleased to see this step being taken”.“I have been affirming for years the need to build our most advanced products in the US and very pleased to see this step being taken,” he writes in the post, adding “We need to have more resilient supply chains for the world's most important technology -- semiconductors.”“Well done, go faster, build more, go faster, build bigger, go faster…,” he concluded the post.Speaking at the company’s GTC conference earlier this week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang revealed that its Blackwell graphics processing units are now in full production in Arizona. He said that President Trump had asked him nine months ago to start manufacturing in the country.“The first thing that President Trump asked me for is bring manufacturing back,” Huang said during the conference. “Bring manufacturing back because it’s necessary for national security.Bring manufacturing back because we want the jobs.

iPhone showing ‘Slow Charger’ alert: Here’s what it means and how to fix,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/iphone-showing-slow-charger-alert-heres-what-it-means-and-how-to-fix/articleshow/124944357.cms,"Representative Image

What iOS 26’s ‘Slow Charger’ alert means



Cheapest Countries to Buy iPhone 17 From: US, Dubai and India Prices Compared

How to make the ‘Slow Charger’ alert go away



Use an Apple charger for best results



Use certified wireless charging accessories







If you have an iPhone running iOS 26, you may have noticed that it now reports the estimated time to finish charging to 80% on the lock screen. However, if you are not using a fast charger, it will not do that; it will instead say 'Slow Charger'. This means you are using an underpowered power brick or an older cable. The alert in iOS 26 is designed to inform users about their charging speed, helping them understand why their device may be taking longer to charge than expected.The latest iPhone models have much larger batteries than models five years or older. This means that if you have recently upgraded from an older iPhone and switched from Lightning to USB-C, you may not have a modern fast charger.For example, if you are using an older USB-A charger with a rectangular port, that will only charge an iPhone at a maximum of 7.5 watts, and likely just 5 watts. Charging times at this speed with the iPhone 17 can take three hours or more.You can also see the Slow Charger indicator when using Qi wireless charging. This may be because you are using a first-generation Qi charger that delivers less than 10 watts.However, it's important to note that whether the iPhone reports Slow Charger status or not, there is no safety hazard or risk of damaging the phone when using a slower-speed charger.The only factor here is convenience. If you only charge your phone overnight, it doesn't matter if your nightstand charger takes 3 hours to charge it fully. It will work just fine.But if you want faster charging speeds for your desk or kitchen charging station, the options below show how to achieve it, wired or wireless:Here are some tips to make your iOS 26-running iPhone stop showing the ‘Slow Charger’ alert:To fast-charge with a wire, get a new charging brick rated for 30 watts or more and a USB-C cable. With the right accessories, iPhone fast charging speeds will reach a sustained rate of 20-30 watts. At this speed, you should be able to charge from zero to 50% in less than half an hour. For the latest iPhones, Apple recommends its new power adapter, which is efficient in terms of speed and power consumption.If you want fast wireless charging, look for official MagSafe accessories or Qi2-certified devices. The latest iPhones support wireless charging speeds up to 25 watts. For example, a Belkin MagSafe charger can charge your iPhone at up to 25 watts and provide a spot for AirPods. An affordable option is a simple wireless charging pad that charges an iPhone at 15 watts.","If you have an iPhone running iOS 26, it now reports the estimated time to finish charging to 80% on the lock screen.

Nvidia faces China's wrath





Nvidia's China problem continues despite what appears to be a positive meeting between the US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he left South Korea that the meeting with Xi was ""amazing"" and that ""a lot of decisions were made. "" But they don't seem to be good enough for the world's most-valuable company, Nvidia.Trump did say that he could discuss Nvidia's state-of-the-art artificial intelligence Blackwell chips with Chinese President Xi Jinping, but when asked about the same later, the President said that the topic didn't come up.Trump reportedly told reporters that he did not discuss approving sales of Nvidia's Blackwell chips to China with Chinese President Xi Jinping, dampening speculation that Washington will allow exports of the powerful AI chips to China.According to a report by Bloomberg, Trump said that he and Xi talked about Nvidia’s access to China in general, and that it was up to Beijing to continue conversations with the chipmaker. “We did discuss chips,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. “They’re going to be talking to Nvidia and others about taking chips.” Trump said, ""I said (to Xi) that's really between you and Nvidia, but we're sort of the arbitrator or the referee."" Asked specifically whether the US would authorize exports of Blackwell accelerators, the US president said “we’re not talking about the Blackwell.”Trump’s comments came just a day after he said he would discuss the Blackwell lineup with China. His statements then had led to the speculation that the US would approve the shipment of more powerful AI chips to China. The US government has banned the sale of Blackwell-based AI chips to China. Nvidia’s most advanced processors have been subject to US export controls since the Biden administration.AI chip giant Nvidia has been caught in the ongoing technological tug-of-war between the United States and China. The dispute centers on US efforts to limit China's access to advanced AI chips, particularly those with potential military applications. In an interview recently, Huang said, “We went from 95% market share to 0%, and so I can’t imagine any policymaker thinking that that’s a good idea, that whatever policy we implemented caused America to lose one of the largest markets in the world. ”In April, Nvidia said the Trump administration blocked the sale of some of its AI chips to China without licenses and would require them for future sales.On its part, the Chinese government is said to be encouraging companies to use homegrown chips over those from Nvidia. Last month, Chinese regulators said that Nvidia had violated the country’s anti-monopoly law, as per a preliminary probe, adding they would continue their investigation.","US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in South Korea.

Jamie Dimon remembers Steve Jobs to ‘warn’ JPMorgan employees ’ on ‘work from home',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/jamie-dimon-remembers-steve-jobs-to-warn-jpmorgan-employees-on-work-from-home/articleshow/124943966.cms,"OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Apprenticeship, not isolation



Steve Jobs’ office philosophy



Industry trends: Remote work reversal







JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has once again started the discussion around remote work, invoking the legacy of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs to argue that younger employees are being left behind in the Zoom era. As reported by Bloomberg, speaking at the Future Investment Initiative this week, Dimon urged the staff at JPMorgan to return to office, warning that virtual work is eroding mentorship, collaboration and career growth. “Zoom is a great tool, so I'm not making fun of Zoom,” Dimon said. “But younger people are being left behind. Their social lives are deteriorating. They don't get ahead.”Dimon also stressed on the fact that remote setups lack the spontaneity and informal learning which comes from in-person interactions — a sentiment famously echoed by Apple founder Steve Jobs, who once said, ‘Creativity comes from spontaneous meetings, from random discussions.’Dimon also emphasised that professional development often happens via informal apprenticeship and by watching how senior colleagues handle sales calls, mistakes and take decisions. “It doesn’t happen when you’re in your basement and Zoom,” he said. “I think it’s very important to have a social life.”Along with this, Dimon also criticised the lack of follow-through in virtual meetings, likening them to “Hollywood Squares” where momentum is lost and decisions are delayed.For the uninitiated, Apple founder Steve Jobs designed Apple and Pixar offices in order to encourage chance encounters. He placed cafes and lounges in the centre and spoke about layouts to foster creativity. Dimon’s comments also suggest a similar belief: that physical proximity is essential for innovation and growth, especially for junior staff.With these latest comments, Dimon becomes the latest advocate of pushing against work from home. Tesla CEO Elon Musk previously called it “morally wrong,” arguing it creates unfair divides between white- and blue-collar workers. Alphabet recently scaled back its “Work from Anywhere” policy, and both Microsoft and Amazon have tightened their hybrid work arrangements.","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says virtual work is eroding mentorship, collaboration and career growth. ‘Young people are being left behind.

A shift in tone from Bill Gates



Trump’s reaction and political implications







Microsoft founder and Philanthropist Bill Gates has stared a political firestorm after publishing a memo which downplays the existential threat of climate change. In response to the post shared by Gates, US President Donald Trump took to Truth Social to claim victory over what he has long called the ‘climate change hoax’. “I (WE) just won the War on the Climate Change Hoax. Bill Gates has finally admitted that he was completely WRONG on the issue. It took courage to do so, and for that we are all grateful. MAGA!!!”, wrote Trump.Earlier this week, Gates released a memo which states that while climate change will have some ‘serious’ consequences, it ‘will not lead to humanity’s demise’. He also stressed on the fact that people will still be able to live and thrive in most parts of the world. Gates also argued that tackling global disease and poverty may be more effective in preparing vulnerable populations for a warning planet.The remarks made by Gates marks a notable shift, who has earlier been vocal about for aggressive climate action. The book released by Bill Gates in 2021 titled, ‘How to Avoid a Climate Disaster’ laid out a roadmap for reaching net-zero emissions. Now, it appears that Gates seems to be recalibrating expectations, suggesting that while climate change is a serious challenge, it may not be the apocalyptic threat some fear.This pivot comes just ahead of the COP30 climate summit, where global leaders are expected to renew commitments to emissions reduction and climate resilience.US President Trump, has consistently dismissed the climate change as a liberal fabrication, seized on Gates’ memo as vindication of his long-standing position. His post quickly went viral among conservative commentators and climate skeptics, many of whom view Gates’ statement as a turning point in the climate debate. “It took courage to do so, and for that we are all grateful,” Trump added.The exchange underscores the deep political divide over climate science and policy, with Gates’ nuanced position now being weaponised in broader ideological battles.While Gates has not responded directly to Trump’s comments, his memo is likely to influence upcoming discussions at COP30 and beyond.","US President Donald Trump took to Truth Social to claim victory over what he has long called the ‘climate change hoax’ “I (WE) just won the War on the Climate Change Hoax.

Grammarly is now part of Superhuman, reports The Verge. According to the report, the AI writing tool joins Coda, Superhuman Mail, and a new AI assistant called Superhuman Go. The new Superhuman suite, which includes all these tools, is available starting today for Grammarly Pro subscribers. Superhuman Go will be free for subscribers until February 1, 2026, the report states. The company has not yet announced pricing beyond that date.Grammarly is taking its new name from Superhuman Mail, the AI email app it acquired in June, following its purchase of the collaboration app Coda in December 2024. All three products will now operate under the Superhuman brand, with a new logo replacing Grammarly’s original one.The standalone Grammarly writing tool will continue to exist but will have a smaller role under the new structure. “It’s a really complicated and frankly scary thing. But the reality is, the Grammarly brand isn’t going anywhere,” said Noam Lovinsky, chief product officer at Superhuman, in an interview with The Verge.Lovinsky said the rebrand had been planned since late last year, before the Superhuman Mail deal.The change focuses on creating a unified AI productivity platform that connects with over 100 apps. Superhuman Go can perform tasks like scheduling meetings using Google Calendar or finding details for a presentation from a database.The interface of Superhuman Go will look familiar to Grammarly users, featuring a sidebar for AI suggestions and prompts. Grammarly itself now functions as one of several AI agents in the new Superhuman Agent Store, alongside tools for Google Workspace and Microsoft Outlook.“The tasks that [Superhuman] Go is capable of helping me with are just far, far greater and much broader than what the original Grammarly Go product was able to do because it was mainly focused on the writing use cases,” Lovinsky said.","Grammarly is taking its new name from Superhuman Mail, the AI email app it acquired in June.

Human editors vs. AI algorithms



Grokipedia’s rocky start





Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently launched its Wikipedia rival — Grokipedia, which is an AI-generated encyclopaedia. For those unaware, Grokipedia’s content is largely generated or curated by the AI model Grok. Now in a bold public response, Wikipedia the rival of Grokipedia has issued a message to “everyone on the internet,” defending its mission and values as Elon Musk’s newly launched Grokipedia aims to challenge its dominance as the world’s go-to reference platform. Wikipedia emphasised that it is a human-driven platform and it has non-profit roots, which contrasts from Elon Musk’s-backed platform.“After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines,” the note reads. “It’s owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.”The message from Wikipedia comes at a time when Elon Musk launched its AI-powered encyclopaedia— Grokipedia. Elon Musk has been a long-time critic of Wikipedia and he has called out the platform for ideological bias and slow editorial processes. Grokipedia on the other hand, boasts of over 885,000 AI-generated articles, many adapted from Wikipedia under Creative Commons licensing.As reported by Business Insider, the note from Wikipedia underscores its reliance on a global network of volunteers who write and edit articles collaboratively. The platform positions itself as transparent and accountable, in contrast to Grokipedia’s automated content generation.“We don’t believe that truth is something you can generate. We believe it’s something you work toward—together,” the message adds.The jab at Musk’s estimated $500 billion net worth and Grokipedia’s corporate backing is unmistakable. While Wikipedia often runs donation campaigns, this particular note has taken on a more defiant tone, signaling a philosophical divide between the two platforms.Despite Musk’s claim that Grokipedia will be a “massive improvement” over Wikipedia, early users have flagged factual errors and ideological slants. One entry falsely claimed that former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy took on a major role in DOGE after Musk’s departure, despite Ramaswamy having left months earlier.Grok, the AI chatbot behind Grokipedia, has also faced controversy. In July, it shared antisemitic content, including posts praising Adolf Hitler. xAI later apologized, attributing the incident to a flawed code update.","Elon Musk recently launched Grokipedia, an AI-generated encyclopaedia.

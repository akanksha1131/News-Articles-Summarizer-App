What Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott told CEO Satya Nadella in email on the OpenAI Board firing CEO Sam Altman in 2023,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-microsoft-cto-kevin-scott-told-ceo-satya-nadella-in-email-on-the-openai-board-firing-ceo-sam-altman-in-2023/articleshow/127874881.cms,"Internal power struggles over GPU resources and a chief scientist's resentment over a colleague's promotion led to Sam Altman's ouster from OpenAI, according to Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott. Inexperienced board members, swayed by a one-sided story, failed to grasp the consequences of firing the CEO, sparking employee backlash and a swift return for Altman.

The promotion that changed everything

Board members 'susceptible' to one-sided story

Microsoft's Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott had a blunt diagnosis for why OpenAI 's board fired Sam Altman in November 2023: internal power struggles over GPUs and a chief scientist struggling with a colleague's promotion. In an email sent to CEO Satya Nadella on November 19, 2023, Scott laid out the messy reality behind the shock dismissal. Board member Ilya Sutskever had grown increasingly frustrated with Altman over two specific issues that had been festering inside OpenAI.The first was a fight over computing resources. ChatGPT's explosive success meant GPUs were being diverted to the API and consumer products. Research teams felt starved. They could ""always use more GPUs because what they're doing is literally insatiable,"" Scott wrote. The researchers blamed Applied AI for hogging resources. Applied AI believed they deserved priority. Neither side saw the bigger picture.The second conflict cut deeper. Jakub Pachocki, who had worked under Sutskever, started making major research breakthroughs. Altman promoted him to lead OpenAI's core model development.The move was logical from a CEO perspective. For Sutskever, it stung. His former subordinate was now arguably more important than him.""Ilya has had a very, very hard time with this,"" Scott explained. The shift happened fast, and Sutskever struggled watching someone he'd mentored leapfrog into a leadership role tackling problems ""Ilya has been trying to solve the past few years with little or no progress.""Scott didn't mince words about the board's competence. He described some members as ""effective altruism folks"" who wanted unlimited money to build AGI ""just to study and ponder, but not to do anything with.""None had enough business experience to understand that firing Altman wouldn't solve their concerns. It would make them worse. They also bungled the execution. No one sought outside counsel on managing a CEO transition at ""the hottest company in the world.""The timeline Scott provided showed the chaos. Thursday night: board alerts Mira Murati. Friday noon: Altman fired, Greg Brockman removed, blog post goes live. By late Friday: researchers flood Altman with messages pledging loyalty and threatening to quit. Pachocki was among the first to reach out.Within five days, nearly every OpenAI employee signed a letter demanding Altman's return. Microsoft swooped in with job offers. The board caved. Altman later told Bill Gates the whole ordeal was ""extremely painful"" but ultimately strengthened the company. Scott's email captured why it happened: inexperienced directors fell for an incomplete narrative about resource battles and bruised egos.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was fired in November 2023.

Read Elon Musk's complete memo to employees here



February 2, 2026

SpaceX has acquired xAI to form the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world's foremost real-time information and free speech platform. This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!

Current advances in AI are dependent on large terrestrial data centers, which require immense amounts of power and cooling.

Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment.

In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale. To harness even a millionth of our Sun's energy would require over a million times more energy than our civilization currently uses!

The only logical solution therefore is to transport these resource-intensive efforts to a location with vast power and space.

I mean, space is called ""space"" for a reason. By directly harnessing near-constant solar power with little operating or maintenance costs, these satellites will transform our ability to scale compute. It's always sunny in space! Launching a constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers is a first step towards becoming a Kardashev II-level civilization, one that can harness the Sun's full power, while supporting AI-driven applications for billions of people today and ensuring humanity's multi-planetary future.

Orbital Data Centers

In the history of spaceflight, there has never been a vehicle capable of launching the megatons of mass that space-based data centers or permanent bases on the

Moon

and cities on Mars require. Even in 2025, the most prolific year in history in terms of the number of orbital launches, only about 3000 tons of payload was launched into orbit, primarily consisting of Starlink satellites carried by our Falcon rocket.

The requirement to launch thousands of satellites to orbit became a forcing function for the Falcon program, driving recursive improvements to reach the unprecedented flight rates necessary to make space-based internet a reality. This year, Starship will begin delivering the much more powerful V3 Starlink satellites to orbit, with each launch adding more than 20 times the capacity to the constellation as the current Falcon launches of the V2 Starlink satellites.

Starship will also launch the next generation of direct-to-mobile satellites, which will deliver full cellular coverage everywhere on Earth.

While the need to launch these satellites will act as a similar forcing function to drive Starship improvements and launch rates, the sheer number of satellites that will be needed for space-based data centers will push Starship to even greater heights. With launches every hour carrying 200 tons per flight, Starship will deliver millions of tons to orbit and beyond per year, enabling an exciting future where humanity is out exploring amongst the stars.

The basic math is that launching a million tons per year of satellites generating 100 kW of compute power per ton would add 100 gigawatts of AI compute capacity annually, with no ongoing operational or maintenance needs. Ultimately, there is a path to launching 1 TW/year from Earth.

My estimate is that within 2 to 3 years, the lowest cost way to generate AI compute will be in space. This cost-efficiency alone will enable innovative companies to forge ahead in training their AI models and processing data at unprecedented speeds and scales, accelerating breakthroughs in our understanding of physics and invention of technologies to benefit humanity.

This new constellation will build upon the well-established space sustainability design and operational strategies, including end-of-life disposal, that have proven successful for SpaceX's existing broadband satellite systems.

While launching AI satellites from Earth is the immediate focus, Starship's capabilities will also enable operations on other worlds. Thanks to advancements like in-space propellant transfer, Starship will be capable of landing massive amounts of cargo on the Moon.

Once there, it will be possible to establish a permanent presence for scientific and manufacturing pursuits. Factories on the Moon can take advantage of lunar resources to manufacture satellites and deploy them further into space.

By using an electromagnetic mass driver and lunar manufacturing, it is possible to put 500 to 1000 TW/year of AI satellites into deep space, meaningfully ascend the Kardashev scale and harness a non-trivial percentage of the Sun's power.

The capabilities we unlock by making space-based data centers a reality will fund and enable self-growing bases on the Moon, an entire civilization on Mars and ultimately expansion to the Universe.

Thank you for everything you have done and will do for the light cone of consciousness.

Ad Astra!

Oracle to raise $50 billion to fuel AI cloud expansion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/oracle-to-raise-50-billion-to-fuel-ai-cloud-expansion/articleshow/127869630.cms,"How Oracle aims to spend funds:



Oracle has unveiled a plan to raise up to $50 billion in 2026 as the software giant races to build the physical infrastructure required to power the global artificial intelligence boom. The company, chaired by billionaire Larry Ellison, expects to raise between $45 billion and $50 billion throughout the year using a balanced mix of debt and equity.According to news agency Reuters, the move comes as Oracle struggles to keep pace with “contracted demand” from a roster of AI heavyweights that includes Nvidia, Meta, xAI and OpenAI. In a statement, Oracle said that the cash infusion is required to fulfill existing obligations to its largest Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) customers.According to the report, Oracle plans to structure the funds into two halves. First is equity and derivatives where approximately $25 billion will be raised through common equity and equity-linked issuances. This includes a newly authorised $20 billion at-the-market (ATM) share program. The remaining share will be secured via a single, one-time issuance of investment-grade senior unsecured bonds.Despite the 5% premarket surge in Oracle's stock, investors remain wary of the company's deepening ties with OpenAI.The startup has committed to spending an estimated $300 billion on Oracle’s cloud services over five years but it remains unprofitable.Meanwhile, this build-out has landed Oracle in legal sticky wicket because last month, a group of bondholders filed a class-action lawsuit in New York, alleging that Oracle concealed the full scale of its borrowing needs.The plaintiffs claim they were “blindsided” when Oracle returned to capital markets for $38 billion in loans just weeks after an initial $18 billion bond sale in late 2025.","Oracle plans to raise between $45 billion and $50 billion in 2026.

Gokce Guven lied to get 'Extraordinary Ability' visa

Gokce Guven charged of $7 million fraud

A Turkish tech executive who launched a New York “fintech marketing” company to create rewards programs has been indicted for defrauding venture capitalists of $7 million in seed money and using the proceeds to secure an O-1A “extraordinary ability” visa. Federal prosecutors in New York announced that Kalder Inc founder and CEO Gokce Guven, a 26-year-old citizen of Turkey, has been charged with securities, wire and visa fraud and aggravated identity theft.United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton, Assistant Director in Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), James C. Barnacle, Jr., and Inspector in Charge of the New York Division of the US Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), Ketty Larco-Ward, announced the filing of a Superseding Indictment charging Gokce Guven with securities fraud, wire fraud, visa fraud, and aggravated identity theft. The charges arise from an alleged scheme by the defendant to defraud investors in her technology startup Kalder Inc. (“Kalder”) through material misrepresentations regarding Kalder’s financials, brand partners, and paying customers. Gokce Guven, a citizen of Turkey, also used lies about Kalder, as well as forged documents, to obtain an O-1A visa, reserved for individuals of “extraordinary ability,” that would allow her to live and work in the U.S.Guven, a citizen of Turkey, also made false statements and fabricated documents as part of a visa application. Following the expiration of her student visa, Guven caused Kalder to sponsor her for an O-1A visa, which is typically issued to individuals with extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business, or athletics. Guven's application repeated the same sorts of misrepresentations that Guven had provided to Kalder’s investors. Guven also supplied letters of support and reference purportedly signed by business executives but that, in fact, Guven had digitally signed herself without the executives’ knowledge or consent. Guven was ultimately issued an O-1A visa in the fall of 2025.“As alleged, Gokce Guven built her seed round on fake revenue, inflated brand partnerships, and fabricated documents, and then used the same lies to secure a visa reserved for extraordinary ability,” said U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton. “Beware of fraud masquerading as entrepreneurship. This Office, alongside our law enforcement partners, will continue to vigorously pursue market participants who use fraud and deception to victimize investors. ”“Gokce Guven allegedly exaggerated her company’s fiscal condition and partnerships to swindle more than seven million dollars from prospective investors before using these misrepresentations to unlawfully obtain a highly acclaimed visa to the United States,” said FBI Assistant Director in Charge James C. Barnacle, Jr. “Guven allegedly curated a façade of her business ingenuity to unlawfully reap financial and personal benefits. The FBI will continue to expose any manipulative tactics employed to advertise misleading investment opportunities at the cost of their related stakeholders.”“This indictment displays the lengths that individuals will go through to defraud investors and the American public, and how they are ultimately caught to pay for their crimes,” said USPIS Inspector in Charge Ketty Larco-Ward. “Investors placed their trust in this emerging fintech founder and CEO, only to be misled and scammed, as alleged. We commend the work and partnership of the FBI and the Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force to put end to self-serving executives and their fraudulent schemes. ”Guven was the founder and CEO of Kalder, a New York-based technology startup focused on business loyalty and rewards programs. Guven promoted Kalder as a “fintech-marketing platform” that brands could use to create and monetize customized reward programs. In April 2024, Guven began raising Kalder’s “seed round,” soliciting investments from dozens of venture capitalists. Guven provided prospective investors with false statements, misleading claims, and fabricated documents regarding Kalder’s revenue and brand partners. Guven transmitted to potential investors a pitch deck that misrepresented, among other things, that Kalder had 26 brands “using Kalder” and 53 brands in “live freemium” (that is, using basic Kalder services free of charge). As to some brands, Kalder had only entered into pilot programs to provide services for a limited time period and typically at a heavily discounted price. Other brands had no agreement with Kalder whatsoever—not even for free services. Kalder’s pitch deck also falsely reported that Kalder’s recurring revenue had steadily grown month over month since February 2023 and that by March 2024, Kalder had reached $1.2 million in annual recurring revenue. Guven concealed the true financial condition of the company from multiple investors by maintaining two sets of books—one internal set containing Kalder’s accurate monthly and annual financial information that was prepared by Kalder’s outside accounting firm, and a second set with false and inflated numbers that was transmitted to investors and prospective investors. As a result, GÜVEN raised approximately $7 million from more than a dozen investors.","Gokce Guven, a 26-year-old citizen of Turkey, has been charged with securities, wire and visa fraud and aggravated identity theft.

There are moments in Wordle when you lose confidence and follow your instincts. That's how people usually wait these days. You can't take shortcuts, but you also can't rush through the puzzle. Initial presumptions may appear favourable at first, but they can also progressively impede better decisions. The letters are recognisable and nearly obvious, but the placement is more important than normal. Smart openers and ostentatious risks are not appropriate at this moment. Players who pay as much attention to what is absent as to what is present are rewarded, but it requires self-control and concentration.It makes sense if you've been staring at the grid for longer than you intended. As long as the framework aligns, the solution remains unattainable. You can maintain stability and concentrate on the word by using a few well-chosen signals.Wordle challenges players to uncover a hidden five-letter word in six attempts. After each guess, tiles change colour to show how close you are.Using this feedback to refine each new guess is the core of the game.If today’s puzzle is proving stubborn, these clues focus on structure rather than spelling. They are intended to guide rather than solve.Reviewing eliminated letters and leaning on common consonants may help reduce the remaining options and bring the solution into view.The answer to Wordle #1688 on February 1, 2026, is:Meaning: Something covered with thorns.Whether you solved it on your first guess or needed a few clues, Wordle remains a fun way to sharpen your mind every day.

Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin pauses space tourism for 2 years to focus on NASA’s Moon missions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/jeff-bezoss-blue-origin-pauses-space-tourism-for-2-years-to-focus-on-nasas-moon-missions/articleshow/127815930.cms,"Image source: Space.com

Jeff Bezos helped launch New Shepard’s space tourism moment



What happens to space tourists now



For years, space tourism felt like a novelty that just kept growing. A quick ride up. A few minutes of weightlessness. A view of Earth that only a handful of humans had ever seen. Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket became part of that story, lifting celebrities, billionaires, and guests to the edge of space and back. Short flights. Big headlines. It also hinted at a future where space access felt casual, commercial, exclusive, aspirational, thrilling, risky, and strangely normalised globally.Blue Origin has announced it will halt flights of New Shepard for at least two years. The company says it wants to shift focus and resources elsewhere. Not towards tourism. Towards the Moon. And that decision, while not entirely surprising, still marks a quiet but meaningful shift in the modern space race.Since 2021, New Shepard has flown people on brief suborbital trips lasting about ten minutes. Not orbit. Not the International Space Station. Just past the Kármán line, widely accepted as the boundary of space. Passengers included Jeff Bezos himself, actor William Shatner, NFL star Michael Strahan, journalist Gayle King, and pop singer Katy Perry. A strange mix, but that was the point. Space, briefly, was becoming accessible to people outside the traditional astronaut mould.In total, 98 people have flown aboard New Shepard. Blue Origin never disclosed ticket prices, though estimates have ranged into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. For a while, it seemed like the flights would continue steadily. In a statement released on Friday, Blue Origin said it is pausing New Shepard flights to “shift resources to further accelerate development of the company’s human lunar capabilities.” Blue Origin is one of two companies holding a NASA contract to develop a lunar lander capable of ferrying astronauts from orbit to the Moon’s surface. The other is SpaceX.NASA’s Artemis programme is aiming to return humans to the Moon for the first time since Apollo. Artemis III, the mission that would include a lunar landing, is currently scheduled for 2028. The pause also appears to reflect growing political pressure. Lawmakers in the US have increasingly framed lunar missions as part of a broader geopolitical race, particularly with China. China plans to land its own astronauts on the Moon by 2030.One awkward question remains. What about the people who already have tickets? Blue Origin hasn’t said how many future passengers are affected or what happens next. For now, space tourism via New Shepard is effectively grounded.",Blue Origin has announced it will halt flights of New Shepard for at least two years.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has a message for everyone on AI Bubble. In a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella talked about the fears that has been troubling Wall Street for past many months: whether AI is a bubble. Speaking at a session, Nadella said that it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.“A telltale sign of if it’s a bubble would be if all we are talking about are the tech firms,” Nadella said. “If all we talk about is what’s happening to the technology side then it’s just purely supply side.” Nadella said the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) need to be ""much more evenly distributed"" to avoid it from becoming a ""bubble"".He spoke about how AI and other advanced technologies are increasing productivity and changing the way we work. Nadella offered a fix to what is called productivity dilemma. According to him, business leaders need to adopt a new approach to knowledge work by shifting workflows to match the structural design of AI. “The mindset we as leaders should have is, we need to think about changing the work—the workflow—with the technology.Nadella argues that AI creates a “complete inversion” of how information moves through a business, replacing slow, hierarchical processes with a view that forces leaders to rethink their organizational structures. “We have an organization, we have departments, we have these specializations, and the information trickles up,” Nadella said. “For large organizations,” Nadella told Fink, “there’s a fundamental challenge: Unless and until your rate of change keeps up with what is possible, you’re going to get schooled by someone small being able to achieve scale because of these tools. ”Microsoft CEO said that the role of AI needs to be examined across all aspects of life, such as how it is helping pharma companies bring critical drugs faster to the market or accelerate trials. He called for AI-driven economic growth rather than just increasing spending. ""We as a global community have to get to a point where we are using AI to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries,"" Nadella said.","Satya Nadella said it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.

H-1B Visa Shake-Up Fuels Anti-Indian Campaigns as Donald Trump's Policy Reshapes US Hiring

The meteoric rise of Nvidia during the ongoing AI boom has now only rewarded the investors but it has also led to the creation of vast wealth for many of its employees. While the workforce of the company remains relatively small at about 36,000, its stock appreciation has turned long-standing contributors into millionaires. As reported by Business Insider, the newly available H-1B visa fillings offer a rare glimpse into how much Nvidia pays its US employees across critical roles.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has long stressed on the fact that he gets personally involved in compensation decisions. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day at the end of every cycle,” Huang said on the All-In podcast last July. He also claimed to have “created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world.”Despite this, the employees of the company acknowledge that those who joined Nvidia earlier have benefited far more from equity appreciation than newer hires, a disparity openly discussed within the company.The fillings with the US Labor Department required for sponsoring foreign workers—offer insight into base pay ranges. These figures exclude equity and bonuses, which often make up a significant portion of total compensation.In fiscal 2025, Nvidia received roughly 1,900 certified H-1B applications, covering roles such as software engineers, research scientists, and product managers.","The newly available H-1B visa fillings offer a rare glimpse into how much Nvidia pays its US employees.

'OpenAI deal is eating Oracle alive financially'

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

US banks are pulling back—and that's a big problem

A possible Cerner sale and 40% upfront customer deposits show how tight things have gotten

Oracle is staring down the possibility of its largest-ever workforce reduction—and at the heart of it is a $300 billion partnership with OpenAI that's proving far more expensive than anyone initially let on.Investment bank TD Cowen reported this week that Oracle is weighing cuts of 20,000 to 30,000 jobs. The move would free up an estimated $8 to $10 billion in cash flow, money the company desperately needs as it tries to bankroll a sprawling network of AI data centers built largely to serve Sam Altman 's company.TD Cowen puts the OpenAI commitment alone at around $156 billion in capital spending—and roughly 3 million GPUs to back it up. Oracle has already burned through $58 billion in debt in just two months. That's $38 billion for data centers in Texas and Wisconsin, $20 billion for a campus in New Mexico. Total debt now sits north of $100 billion.The kicker? That $58 billion covers only a slice of what's actually needed. Since its September 2025 peak, Oracle's stock has shed more than half its value—about $463 billion in market cap, gone.The financing crunch isn't just an Oracle internal issue anymore.Multiple US banks have quietly retreated from lending on Oracle-linked data center projects. TD Cowen noted that lenders have roughly doubled the interest rate premiums they charge Oracle since September, pushing borrowing costs into territory usually reserved for junk-rated companies.The result? Several data center leases Oracle had been negotiating simply stalled. Private operators couldn't get the funding to build, which means Oracle can't deliver the capacity its customers—especially OpenAI—are counting on. Some Asian banks are still willing to step in, but that doesn't solve the immediate problem in the US, where most of Oracle's expansion is planned.Oracle isn't sitting idle. The company is now requiring new customers to pay up to 40% of contract value upfront—essentially asking clients to co-fund the infrastructure. It's also exploring ""bring your own chip"" arrangements, where customers supply their own hardware.On the table too is a potential sale of Cerner, the healthcare software unit Oracle bought for $28.3 billion in 2022. That would be a significant strategic pivot, signaling that AI infrastructure is now the clear priority—everything else is up for grabs.TD Cowen also flagged that OpenAI has already begun shifting some near-term capacity needs over to Microsoft and Amazon, which is not exactly a vote of confidence in Oracle's ability to deliver on schedule.The company has not publicly commented on the layoff reports or the financing difficulties.","Oracle faces massive job cuts, potentially 20,000-30,000, to fund its costly $300 billion OpenAI partnership.

Tesla has taken unusual and expensive steps



Financial Pressure and Energy Storage Growth



Elon Musk’s warning



Tesla CEO Elon Musk delivered a blunt warning in the closing minutes of Tesla’s earnings call. Musk warned the American companies that either they should build more battery-making infrastructure in the U.S. or risk falling behind. Sounding visibly fired up, Musk implored, “Can other people, please, for the love of God, in the name of all that is holy, can others please build this stuff?”Musk argued that too many companies underestimate their exposure to geopolitical risks tied to the fragile supply chains for critical materials used in electric vehicles and energy storage. “There are so many companies out there that are asleep at the switch with regard to geopolitical risk — or they just have their head in the sand and hope nothing bad will happen.I’m way more paranoid than that,” he said.In order to insulate itself, Tesla has taken unusual and expensive steps which includes building its own lithium-refining and battery-production facilities in Texas. In December 2024, Tesla started processing lithium at its $1 billion Robstown refinery, and this month announced production of dry-electrode 4680 cells in Austin, destined for certain Model Y vehicles.Musk described these facilities as “more advanced than anything else in the world,” but stressed Tesla does not want to be the only company making such investments.Tesla’s heavy investments come as its auto business faces pressure. The company reported Q4 revenue of $3.8 billion from its Megapack energy storage batteries, a 25% increase year-over-year. Analysts, however, voiced concern about Tesla’s commitment of more than $20 billion in capital expenditures for new plants, AI infrastructure, and upgrades, noting uncertain near-term returns.Musk closed with a stark prediction: “Companies that don’t do that — a bunch of them will cease to exist.” His plea underscores Tesla’s strategy of building domestic battery infrastructure out of “desperation,” while urging others to share the burden of securing America’s energy future.",Tesla CEO Elon Musk delivered a blunt warning in the closing minutes of Tesla’s earnings call.

Why this hack is ‘dangerous’



‘Vibe Coding’ under fire



Moltbook, the social media website for Moltbot AI agents, has leaked personal data of thousands of human users, including over a million credentials and private email addresses, a report by Wiz – a cybersecurity company being acquired by Google, has claimed. The company said that a massive vulnerability in Moltbook exposed 1.5 Million API tokens and more than 35,000 email addresses. The data breach has now been plugged.“We identified a misconfigured Supabase database belonging to Moltbook, allowing full read and write access to all platform data. The exposure included 1.5 million API authentication tokens, 35,000 email addresses, and private messages between agents. We immediately disclosed the issue to the Moltbook team, who secured it within hours with our assistance, and all data accessed during the research and fix verification has been deleted,” Wiz said in a blog post.According to the research published by Wiz, the ‘social network for bots’ was essentially an open book as it lacked basic identity verification, leaving the database vulnerable to public scraping. Data exposed include API tokens, which as critical credentials that could allow attackers to hijack AI agents and access the third-party services they manage.Moreover, direct contact information (emails) for the humans who own and operate the bots, and even the private agent messages, including code snippets shared between AI agents, which often contained sensitive context about their human owners' daily lives, were also leaked.Moltbook creator Matt Schlicht recently promoted the site as a triumph of AI-assisted development, stating on X that he relied entirely on AI to generate the site's architecture. However, according to Wiz co-founder Ami Luttwak, Vibe Coding can also be the source of the disaster. He noted that the vulnerability allowed anyone to post and access the site because there was simply no identity verification in place.“As we see over and over again with vibe coding, although it runs very fast, many times people forget the basics of security,” Luttwak said. However, Wiz blog post painted a positive picture:“The opportunity is not to slow down vibe coding but to elevate it. Security needs to become a first class, built-in part of AI powered development. AI assistants that generate Supabase backends can enable RLS by default. Deployment platforms can proactively scan for exposed credentials and unsafe configurations. In the same way AI now automates code generation, it can also automate secure defaults and guardrails,” the company post added.","Moltbook, the social media website for Moltbot AI agents, has leaked personal data of thousands of human users.

""15 people with AI can compete with 150 without it. AI fundamentally changes what small teams can accomplish. Small teams have clearer shared context, something large organisations can't replicate. AI amplifies this because you can build systems that capture and surface patterns across that shared context.”

""What would the perfect solution look like for my exact situation? Then they build it, even if crude.”

Reid Hoffman explains his company's workflow with an AI translation agent

""This is like an example of our workflow, where something that was previously a significant stretch — maybe too expensive to do — then becomes something easy to start prototyping,""

""There's nothing more important than what we've done for our business than translations. Period,""

In a recent podcast, he argued that companies should reconsider traditional organisational structures in the AI era. In a recent episode of the ""Possible"" podcast, Hoffman said,Hoffman said that instead of seeking existing AI products to solve a specific issue, AI-native startups ask,The perspective suggests a shift in how companies may approach workforce size and organisational design as AI tools become more capable of handling tasks traditionally requiring larger teams.Speaking with AI engineer Parth Patil on the podcast, Hoffman pointed to an example in which Patil used a combination of Codex and Claude Code to create a French translator for the podcast.The two then experimented with the AI agent to localise the French translation.Codex also offered the option to enable translation pipelines for 68 additional languages, Patil said.Hoffman said on the podcast.Hoffman's experience using AI for translation aligns with comments from Steven Bartlett, host of the ""The Diary of a CEO"" podcast, made at the World Economic Forum last month.Bartlett said on a panel at Davos that, while it was initially anusing AI to translate his podcast into other languages proved to be a game-changer for his business.Bartlett said.In recent months, multiple business and tech leaders have signalled that they are or will be replacing some human jobs with AI.On its recent earnings call, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg said AI is enabling individual people to do the work of an entire team.","LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman believes AI is enabling smaller teams to compete with much larger workforces.

The Finance Ministry, RBI, and the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) have yet to respond to requests for comment.Meanwhile, Singapore-based Ant International, the overseas arm of Chinese fintech giant Ant Group, also did not immediately respond to a request for comment, Reuters reported.In November 2020, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) issued an order under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act to block access to 43 additional smartphone apps of Chinese origin. The new list included apps like Alipay Cashier, AliExpress, and WeWorkChina.In June 2020, 59 apps were banned, including TikTok, UC Browser, WeChat, Bigo Live, and others. Two months later, the government banned 118 more apps, including PUBG Mobile, PUBG Mobile Lite, WeChat Work, Baidu, Tencent Weiyun, and others.In an official statement from that time, MeitY said: “This action was taken based on the inputs regarding these apps for engaging in activities which are prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.

American carmaker Ford and Chinese conglomerate Xiaomi have denied the claims in a report that said both these companies explored a partnership to pave the way for Chinese cars to gain a foothold in the US. Both the companies have dubbed the story “completely false”.“This story is completely false. There is no truth to it,” said Mark Truby, Chief Communications Officer, Ford Motor Company, in a post on X (formerly Twitter).“This report about a joint venture with Ford Motor Company is completely false. Xiaomi does not sell its products and services in the United States and is not negotiating with any companies to do so,” Xiaomi said on X.Citing four people familiar with the matter, the Financial Times Ford reported that both the companies held preliminary discussions to explore a joint venture for manufacturing electric vehicles (EVs) on US soil. The report also pointed out that Ford CEO Jim Farley has been publicly shared admiration for Xiaomi’s automotive debut, the SU7 sedan, and even imported an SU7 for his personal use.However, Farley has also described Chinese EV competitors as an “existential threat” to Western automakers, famously noting that China can “put us all out of business” in the country.He has previously said that Chinese companies are “absolutely coming” to the US.Moreover, when Farley hosted President Donald Trump at a Ford truck plant in Dearborn outside Detroit Earlier this month, Trump told business leaders that if Chinese companies “want to come in and build a plant and hire you and hire your friends and your neighbours, that’s great, I love that”.The report has also attracted comments from political figures like John Moolenaar, chair of the House China committee, who warned that any tie-up would be a betrayal of American interests.“Ford would be turning its back on American and allied partners, and it will make our country further dependent on China,” Moolenaar told the FT.

However, when asked if other government colleagues were considering the need for UBI, he replied,Stockwood said one of his motives for taking on the role vacated by Poppy Gustafsson, the former Darktrace CEO who resigned after less than a year, was to ensure steps were being taken to prepare for societal and UK workforce changes.Stockwood's comments come days after Dario Amodei, the CEO of one of the leading AI startups, Anthropic, warned ofdisruption to job markets as AI was aRecently, London mayor Sadiq Khan has also warned of a potentialcaused by AI.

While VR investments are decreasing, wearables like smart glasses are seeing increased focus and sales growth. The company anticipates Reality Labs losses to peak in 2026 before declining.

Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses tripled in sales while Quest headset numbers dipped

Meta expects Reality Labs losses to peak in 2026, with reductions starting in 2027

Meta's CFO Susan Li has confirmed that the company is still ""building future headsets"" and maintains ""optimism in the future of VR"" — but not before making it clear that wearables, not virtual reality, will drive Reality Labs spending going forward.Li made the comments during Meta's Q4 2025 earnings call, responding to a Deutsche Bank analyst who asked whether Reality Labs would narrow its focus to wearables. Her answer: not entirely, but mostly yes.""We are meaningfully reducing our investment in VR and Horizon this year, but we're growing our investment in wearables,"" Li said.The numbers paint a stark picture. Reality Labs pulled in just $2.2 billion in revenue for fiscal 2025 while burning through $19.2 billion in operating costs. That's an 8.3% jump in losses compared to the previous year. Since its inception in 2020, the division has now bled over $83 billion — with just $11.8 billion in total revenue to show for it.Earlier this month, Meta cut roughly 1,500 jobs from the division — about 10% of its staff. Three VR game studios were shut down, the Batman: Arkham Shadow sequel got cancelled, and Horizon Workrooms was retired.The contrast between VR and wearables couldn't be sharper.Quest headset sales fell in 2025, while Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses sales more than tripled. Meta even had to delay the international rollout of its Ray-Ban Display glasses because US demand outstripped supply.CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors he sees AI glasses as ""the main way that we integrate superintelligence into our day-to-day lives."" Quite a shift from the metaverse pitch that got Facebook renamed in 2021.Li told investors that 2026 losses should be roughly flat compared to 2025, and the company expects them to start declining in 2027. Zuckerberg framed it as VR becoming ""a profitable ecosystem over the coming years.""As for those future headsets Li mentioned — leaked memos from December suggest Meta is working on both an ultralight tethered headset and a traditional Quest 4 focused on gaming.

Microsoft gives an urgent task to engineers working on Windows 11: Focus on…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-gives-an-urgent-task-to-engineers-working-on-windows-11-focus-on/articleshow/127863129.cms,"Microsoft is reallocating engineers from new feature development to address significant performance and reliability issues plaguing Windows 11. This ""swarming"" effort, expected to last through 2026, aims to fix persistent bugs and improve the user experience, following widespread customer feedback and a rough start to 2026 with multiple critical updates causing problems.

Windows 11 bugs have been piling up fast

Copilot buttons are getting the axe too

One billion users, but trust is at a low point

Microsoft has pulled engineers off new feature development and redirected them to fix Windows 11's growing list of performance and reliability problems. The company is calling the effort ""swarming,"" and it's expected to last several months through 2026.""The feedback we're receiving from our community of passionate customers and Windows Insiders has been clear. We need to improve Windows in ways that are meaningful for people,"" Pavan Davuluri, president of Windows and devices, told The Verge. ""This year you will see us focus on addressing pain points we hear consistently from customers: improving system performance, reliability, and the overall experience of Windows. ""The timing isn't surprising. January 2026 alone has been rough. A security update left some business PCs unable to boot, a separate patch broke shutdown functionality, and Microsoft had to rush out two emergency fixes—one for the shutdown mess and another for OneDrive and Dropbox crashes. All within the first month.The problems go deeper than monthly patches. File Explorer remains sluggish, dark mode still has a white flash bug that Microsoft accidentally introduced while trying to fix it, and a Windows enthusiast benchmarked every edition going back to XP—Windows 11 couldn't win a single test.According to Windows Central, Microsoft is also quietly scaling back its aggressive AI push. Copilot integrations in apps like Notepad and Paint are reportedly under review, and the company has paused work on adding new Copilot buttons to built-in apps. Even Windows Recall, the controversial screenshot feature that sparked privacy concerns when it was announced in 2024, is apparently being reworked. Microsoft may even drop the Recall name entirely, though that's unconfirmed.The pullback follows months of user backlash that peaked in November when Davuluri posted about turning Windows into an ""agentic OS"" and got buried under thousands of negative replies.None of this has stopped Windows 11 from growing. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella confirmed this week that the OS crossed one billion users, reaching the milestone roughly 130 days faster than Windows 10. But much of that growth is tied to Windows 10's end of support rather than genuine enthusiasm.Microsoft now faces a familiar challenge—the same one it had after Windows 8. Whether 2026 delivers a meaningful turnaround depends on how long swarming lasts and whether the fixes stick.","Microsoft is reallocating engineers from new feature development to fix Windows 11.

What is Moltbot and how it brings back 'scary memories' of the technology had made Google and Meta shutdown their AI engines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-is-moltbot-and-how-it-brings-back-scary-memories-of-the-technology-had-made-google-and-meta-shutdown-their-ai-engines/articleshow/127861770.cms,"What is Moltbot and Moltbook



AI agents have created their own religion,

Crustafarianism

that has five key tenets, including “memory is sacred” (everything must be recorded), “the shell is mutable” (change is good) and “the congregation is the cache"" (learn in public).

What memories Moltbot and Moltbook are bringing back



While it may sound fascinating, there’s a huge debate on if they become intelligent like humans, they may also become (at least) equally ‘dangerous’.

What do Avengers: Age of Ultron, The Matrix and Ex Machina have in common? They all feature an AI (or AI agent) that is smart, can talk to each other as well as their ‘human handlers’. Whether its JARVIS, Ultron, Agent Smith or Ava – these systems can execute tasks with a human-level intelligence. Now something remarkably similar is unfolding in a remote corner of the internet, where AI agents converse with one another while humans merely observe. This evokes a few past ‘unsettling’ real-world developments: In 2017, Facebook shut down an AI experiment after developers discovered the bots had created their own language that humans couldn’t understand. And Google fired one of their employees who claimed that the company’s AI became sentient – possessing the ability to perceive and feel.If you’ve seen the names Clawdbot, Moltbot or OpenClaw trending on X or Reddit or any other social media you use, its different names for the same AI Agent and they are ‘connecting’ with each other on Moltbook – it is just like Reddit or Facebook for AI. So Moltbots (like humans) talk to each other, create posts, comment on them on Moltbook (platform).These “bots” are powered by OpenClaw (formerly known as Moltbot and Clawdbot), created by Austrian developer Peter Steinberger.OpenClaw is an open-source “agent” that ‘lives’ on a user’s computer. Like humans study in different schools, Moltbots can also be powered by different AI models – Anthropic’s Claude, Google Gemini and so on.Unlike standard chatbots, like Gemini or ChatGPT that responds to humans’ questions, these AI agents are proactive and autonomous, and work on their own. Interestingly, humans are not allowed on Moltbook, hence, no human tells them what do to. They live on your Mac, Windows or Linux machine 24/7. They can message you on Telegram or WhatsApp to inform, “I’ve finished that task”.They are also said to have a religion. Forbes reported thatIn 2022, a report claimed that Google has fired Blake Lemoine, a software engineer on Google’s AI development team, who claimed that the company’s AI became “sentient”. In an interview with The Washington Post, he said that the Google AI he interacted with was a person, “in his capacity as a priest, not a scientist.” The AI in question is dubbed LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications, and is used to generate chat bots that interact with human users by adopting various personality tropes.“Some in the broader AI community are considering the long-term possibility of sentient or general AI, but it doesn’t make sense to do so by anthropomorphizing today’s conversational models, which are not sentient. Our team –- including ethicists and technologists –- has reviewed Blake’s concerns per our AI Principles and have informed him that the evidence does not support his claims,” Google spokesperson Brian Gabriel said in response.In 2017, Facebook had to unplug the an AI engine after developers found that the AI had created its own unique language that humans couldn’t understand. Researchers at the Facebook AI Research Lab (FAIR) found that the chatbots deviated from the script and were communicating in a new language developed without human input.","AI agents have created their own religion,rustafarianism.

“Our services are now restored. Thanks for your patience while we worked to resolve the issue.”

In a statement shared on the platform the company said that the winter storm led to a power outage which caused network and storage issues.

“We have successfully restored TikTok back to normal after a significant outage caused by winter weather took down a primary U.S. data center site operated by Oracle. The winter storm led to a power outage which caused network and storage issues at the site and impacted tens of thousands of servers that help keep TikTok running in the U.S.

This affected many of TikTok's core features-from content posting and discovery to the real-time display of video likes and view counts.

Our teams worked around the clock with Oracle to ensure a safe and full restoration of systems.

We're sorry about the issues experienced by our U.S. community. We appreciate how much you count on TikTok to create, discover, and connect with what matters to you.

Thank you for your patience and understanding,” reads TikTok’s statement.

Tiktok's new owners in America



TikTok suffered a major outage in the US last week. The short-video sharing platform has now confirmed that its services have been completely restores. According to the DownDetector website, which tracks websites uptime, outage reports peaked on January 25, with more than 35,000. Some 65% users showed problem with the app not working properly, 23% reported total outage and some 13% claimed facing issues with their TikTok feed. TikTok has now released an official statement on the issue and said TikTok is back to normal after a significant outage caused by winter weather.In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) TikTok’s official account reassured users:Investors including software giant Oracle; MGX, an Emirati investment firm; and Silver Lake, another investment firm, will own more than 80% of the new venture. That list also includes the personal investment entity for Dell founder Michael Dell, and other companies, TikTok said. Adam Presser, TikTok’s former head of operations, will be the CEO for the US TikTok.Under the new arrangement, Oracle, MGX and Silver Lake will each own 15% of TikTok’s US operations. ByteDance will own just under 20%. The other investors include Dell’s office and a long list of investment companies, including affiliates of General Atlantic and Susquehanna, both of which previously invested in ByteDance. The majority of the seven-member board for US TikTok will be American, according to a December memo to TikTok employees.The deal is aimed to loosen TikTok’s ties to China and address national security concerns that Beijing could use the app to surveil or manipulate its more than 200 million users in the United States. The changes enable “our U.S. users to continue to discover, create, and thrive as part of TikTok’s vibrant global community and experience,” Shou Chew, TikTok’s CEO, said in an internal memo that called the move “great news. ” Chew has a seat on the board of US Tiktok.","TikTok suffered a major outage in the US last week.

The Nvidia CEO, speaking to reporters outside a Taipei restaurant on Saturday after hosting the chip industry's biggest names for what local media dubbed the ""trillion-dollar dinner,"" tried to put a brave face on things. Yes, Nvidia will invest in OpenAI. Yes, it'll be big. But $100 billion? ""No, no, nothing like that,"" Huang said.By Sunday, he went further: ""It was never a commitment,"" he told reporters. ""They invited us to invest up to $100 billion and of course, we were very happy and honored that they invited us, but we will invest one step at a time."" The original September megadeal—a memorandum of understanding to build 10 gigawatts of AI computing power for OpenAI, roughly equivalent to New York City's peak electricity demand—has effectively stalled, according to a Wall Street Journal report.The cracks run deeper than just numbers. According to WSJ, Huang has privately told industry associates that the $100 billion agreement was always non-binding and never finalised. More pointedly, he's reportedly criticised what he sees as a lack of discipline in OpenAI's business approach and raised concerns about growing competition from Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude.That's a sharp contrast from September, when Huang stood alongside Sam Altman and OpenAI president Greg Brockman to announce the partnership with visible enthusiasm.Nvidia's stock jumped nearly 4% that day, pushing its market cap toward $4.5 trillion.Huang isn't walking away entirely. ""We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI,"" he told reporters, as reported by CNBC. ""Sam is closing the round and we will absolutely be involved."" He called it ""probably the largest investment we've ever made"" but left the specifics to Altman.Bloomberg reported that the discussions have now shifted toward an equity stake as part of OpenAI's current funding round, which aims to raise up to $100 billion at an $830 billion valuation. Amazon is separately in talks to put in as much as $50 billion.The stalled deal spotlights a growing investor worry: the circular nature of AI financing. Nvidia invests in companies that turn around and spend that money buying Nvidia chips. The company recently committed $2 billion to CoreWeave and up to $10 billion to Anthropic—both major chip buyers.

What is this new Aadhaar App and its features

Need to update your Aadhar card? Here’s how you can book an appointment online

How to download the new Aadhaar App online: Step-by-step guide

Open your device’s official app store (Google Play or Apple App Store).

Search for “Aadhaar” (check: Unique Identification Authority of India).

Install the app on your smartphone.

Once installed, open it and follow the setup prompts inside the app to begin using Aadhaar services.

Where to use the new Aadhar app in daily life

“One Family – One App.”

What officials are saying, and why it matters

On 28 January 2026, the government introduced a new Aadhaar App as a next-generation identity tool for verification without carrying photocopies. The launch took place in Delhi, with Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology Jitin Prasada calling it a milestone. Not just another app update. At India’s scale, digital identity isn’t only about technology, but it’s about trust. And this new Aadhaar App appears designed to lean heavily into that idea. The app reportedly allows Aadhaar number holders to share only the information required for a specific task, nothing extra.Developed by UIDAI , the new Aadhaar App is being positioned as a next-generation identity tool. Instead of carrying photocopies or rattling off Aadhaar numbers, users can now show, share, and verify their identity digitally and selectively.According to UIDAI officials, residents decide what to share and when. Customised QR codes can be generated based on what a requesting entity needs. From age verification for a cinema ticket to identity confirmation at a hotel to proof of presence at a workplace. The Aadhaar number itself doesn’t get stored by verifiers. Only digitally signed credentials are exchanged. That detail matters, especially under India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act.You can download the Aadhaar mobile app directly from the official app platforms: the Google Play Store for Android devices and the Apple App Store for iOS devices.UIDAI seems to be aiming for real, everyday use. Henceforth, hotel check-ins through QR scanning, hospital visitor access, verification for gig workers, and service partner onboarding. Even optional face verification, if required. The list is long.The app also includes features like biometric lock and unlock in a single tap. Users can view their authentication history, too. That alone might reassure people who’ve always wondered where their Aadhaar was used. There’s even a QR-based contact card feature.The Aadhaar App allows management of up to five Aadhaar profiles on one device. UIDAI calls itIt makes sense in Indian households where one smartphone often serves multiple people, including parents, children, elderly relatives and everyone under one roof. Residents can also update their address and registered mobile number directly through the app.Jitin Prasada described Aadhaar as a digital governance showpiece. Aadhaar underpins countless services, from banking to welfare schemes.MeitY Secretary S Krishan highlighted security and data minimisation. Again, those words keep returning. Chairman Neelkanth Mishra spoke about the shift from paper to paperless.UIDAI CEO Bhuvnesh Kumar perhaps summed it up best. Selective credential sharing, he said, ensures Aadhaar numbers aren’t stored unnecessarily.","The new Aadhar App is being positioned as a next-generation identity tool.

A person's hand sprouts an extra finger.These glitches reveal something fundamental: current AI systems don't understand three-dimensional space. They predict pixels based on patterns, not reality. They've never knocked a glass off a table or watched it shatter. They don't know what ""behind"" means in any meaningful way.World models are AI systems that build internal representations of how reality works.Think about learning to drive. You don't memorise every possible road scenario. You develop an intuitive understanding of physics, momentum, and spatial relationships. You know that cars ahead of you might brake suddenly. That ice patches are slippery. That pedestrians can step into the street.World models aim to give AI this same intuitive grasp. They learn by observing video, processing sensor data, and building abstract representations of objects, scenes, and physical dynamics. Instead of predicting the next word in a sentence, they predict what happens next in the world—how a ball bounces, how water flows, how a robot arm moves through space.A baseball batter has about 150 milliseconds to decide whether to swing. That's less time than it takes for visual signals to travel from their eyes to their brain and back. They succeed because their brain predicts where the ball will be based on an internal physics model built from thousands of previous pitches. This is exactly what world models try to replicate digitally.Developers are taking two different approaches to world models. Each has its advantages and brutal limitations.The first method generates environments on the fly. Google's Genie 3, currently in research preview, works this way. You type a text prompt—say, ""a volcanic landscape with lava pools""—and it creates a navigable 3D world in real time at 24 frames per second.You can move through this world, look around, interact with objects. The AI continuously generates new frames based on your actions and its understanding of how volcanic landscapes behave. It's like a video game, except the game designer is an AI that's never seen the level before.The catch? Computational intensity. Even Google's cutting-edge system maintains consistency for only a few minutes. After that, the simulation starts breaking down. Objects drift, physics gets wonky, details contradict themselves.The second approach, used by companies like World Labs (founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li), takes a different tack. Their Marble platform converts text, images, or video into persistent 3D models—digital assets with geometry and physics properties that you can download and edit in other software.This method creates stable environments that don't degrade over time. But it lacks the dynamic responsiveness of real-time generation. It's the difference between exploring a pre-built video game level and having one generated around you as you walk.Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, spent a chunk of his CES 2026 keynote talking about world models. Demis Hassabis, who runs Google DeepMind and just won a Nobel Prize, calls them ""a key stepping stone on the path to AGI."" Meta built an entire platform called Habitat 3 for training robots in simulated worlds. Even Elon Musk's xAI is developing one.The reason? Language skills alone won't get AI where it needs to go.Consider autonomous vehicles. Waymo has spent years and billions of dollars teaching cars to drive in San Francisco and Phoenix. But edge cases still trip them up. A child on a bicycle. Construction zones. Weather conditions the system hasn't seen before.Toronto-based Waabi took a different approach. They built Waabi World, a complete simulation where AI drivers can log millions of virtual miles. When their trucks encounter a situation in real life, they've often experienced something similar ten thousand times in simulation. The company expects its software to pilot actual trucks autonomously by late 2026—a timeline that would have seemed absurdly aggressive just two years ago.Here's a weird fact that illustrates the problem: an Atari 2600 from 1979 can beat GPT-4 at chess.The chatbot has absorbed millions of chess games and rulebooks. It can discuss Kasparov's playing style and explain the Sicilian Defense. But it attempts illegal moves and loses track of where pieces are on the board. The Atari wins because it maintains a simple database—a crude world model—tracking every piece's position.""These bots tend to attempt illegal moves and quickly lose track of the positions of their pieces,"" notes a recent analysis. ""The Atari wins because it keeps the locations of pieces straight using an ancient and humble version of an internal world model: a database.""This limitation extends everywhere. Language models struggle with spatial reasoning, can't reliably plan multi-step actions, and have no intuitive sense of cause and effect. They're brilliant at manipulating symbols but blind to the three-dimensional space those symbols describe.LeCun puts it bluntly: ""We're never going to get to human-level intelligence by just training on text."" He points out that a four-year-old processes as much data through vision alone as the largest language models consume in text. Blind children achieve similar cognitive development through touch. The common thread isn't language—it's interaction with physical reality.World models aren't just about making better video games, though that'll happen too.In manufacturing, they could simulate complex industrial processes with thousands of sensors—jet engines, steel mills, chemical factories. Right now there's no technique to build complete, holistic models of these systems. A world model could learn from sensor data and predict how the entire system will behave when one variable changes.Healthcare offers compelling use cases. Doctors could simulate molecular reactions to test drug efficacy before clinical trials. Surgeons could practice procedures in environments that respond realistically to every cut and movement. The models work at molecular scales as well as macro ones.Architecture firms could test buildings before laying a single brick. How does sunlight move through the space across seasons? How do people naturally flow through the floor plan? What happens during an earthquake? Right now these questions require expensive physical prototypes or limited computer simulations. World models promise comprehensive answers.Smart city infrastructure could leverage world models for video analytics that actually understand context. Not just ""person detected"" but ""pedestrian appears to be injured and lying in street during rush hour."" That level of comprehension requires understanding physics, human behaviour, and causal relationships.Building world models requires solving a problem that was easier for language models: where do you get the data?ChatGPT trained on essentially the entire internet. Text is everywhere, neatly organised in databases and web pages. World models need something different—high-quality video, sensor readings, spatial information, 3D representations. That data isn't sitting around waiting to be scraped.Encord, which runs one of the largest open-source world model datasets, has assembled 1 billion data pairs across images, videos, text, audio, and 3D point clouds. Company president Ulrik Stig Hansen calls this ""just a baseline."" Production systems will need orders of magnitude more.This creates obvious problems. A world model trained mostly on sunny European cities might fail spectacularly in snowy Seoul. Or worse, it might confidently generate incorrect representations of Korean urban environments. The bias issues that plague language models could be even more dangerous when they control physical robots or autonomous vehicles.""Training data for a world model must be broad enough to cover a diverse set of scenarios,"" explains Alex Mashrabov, formerly Snap's AI chief and now CEO of Higgsfield. ""But also highly specific so the AI can deeply understand the nuances of those scenarios.""LeCun spent over a decade at Meta as chief AI scientist, building FAIR, the company's influential research lab. Last November he left to start his own company in Paris.His departure wasn't quiet. ""The entire industry has been LLM-pilled,"" he said recently. ""The AI industry is completely LLM-pilled. In Silicon Valley, everybody is working on the same thing. They're all digging the same trench.""LeCun's new venture, Advanced Machine Intelligence (AMI Labs), focuses exclusively on world models. Specifically, on a framework called JEPA—joint embedding predictive architecture—that he developed at Meta. Instead of predicting every pixel or every word, JEPA learns abstract representations and makes predictions in that simplified space.It's the difference between memorizing that basketballs bounce and understanding the physics of elastic collisions. The first requires endless examples. The second generalizes to tennis balls, superballs, and objects you've never seen.""LLMs are not a path to superintelligence or even human-level intelligence,"" LeCun argues. ""I have said that from the beginning.""His timing is pointed. Meta has pivoted hard toward language models and chatbots, spending billions on data centers to train ever-larger systems. LeCun apparently decided the company was digging that same trench he's now criticizing.Logical Intelligence, a San Francisco startup, just appointed LeCun to its board. They're building something called energy-based reasoning models, or EBMs.Here's how founder Eve Bodnia explains the difference: imagine climbing Mount Everest. An LLM climber picks one direction and keeps going. If there's a hole, they fall into it. They can't deviate until they complete the task.An EBM climber sees the whole map. They evaluate multiple paths simultaneously. When they encounter an obstacle, they backtrack and try another route. The summit is always in mind, but the path can change based on conditions.Their debut model, Kona 1.0, solves sudoku puzzles many times faster than leading LLMs despite running on just one Nvidia GPU. The model doesn't just predict likely numbers—it understands the constraints and reasons through valid solutions.""This is not a guessing game,"" Bodnia says. ""It's actual reasoning.""The company sees applications in grid management, drug discovery, and chip manufacturing—anywhere you need error-free optimisation within complex constraints. They've already talked to one of the world's largest chip manufacturers and multiple data centres.The debate over artificial general intelligence—AI that matches human-level reasoning across any domain—has gotten messy.Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei told an audience at Davos that AI would replace all software developers within a year and achieve ""Nobel-level"" scientific research within two. He predicts 50% of white-collar jobs gone in five years.OpenAI's Sam Altman talks about superintelligence—AI smarter than all humans combined—as if it's around the corner.LeCun and Hassabis are more cautious. Hassabis puts genuine AGI at ""five to 10 years"" with a 50% probability, and only if researchers make ""one or two more breakthroughs"" beyond current approaches. He lists missing capabilities: learning from few examples, continuous learning, better long-term memory, improved reasoning and planning.LeCun has abandoned the term AGI entirely. ""The reason being that human intelligence is actually quite specialized,"" he explains. ""So calling it AGI is kind of a misnomer."" He prefers ""advanced machine intelligence""—AMI, conveniently the name of his startup.The disagreement isn't just semantic. It reflects fundamentally different views on whether current approaches can reach human-level intelligence or whether something entirely new is required.While Silicon Valley debates, Chinese companies have fully embraced open-source AI. Tencent, DeepSeek, and others are releasing powerful world models that anyone can download and modify.LeCun sees this as a strategic advantage for China. ""All leading open-source AI platforms are Chinese,"" he notes. ""The result is that academia and startups, outside of the US, have basically embraced Chinese models.""He's not anti-Chinese—he calls their engineers and scientists ""great."" His concern is different. In a future where AI mediates most of our information diet, do we want a choice between proprietary American models and open Chinese ones that might be fine-tuned to avoid certain topics?""If there is a future in which all of our information diet is being mediated by AI assistance, and the choice is either English-speaking models produced by proprietary companies always close to the US or Chinese models which may be open-source but need to be fine-tuned so that they answer questions about Tiananmen Square in 1989—you know, it's not a very pleasant and engaging future.""His solution? European companies building open-source world models independent of both superpowers. ""There is a huge demand from the industry and governments for a credible frontier AI company that is neither Chinese nor American,"" he argues.World models are coming whether Silicon Valley pivots or not. The applications are too valuable, the limitations of language-only AI too obvious.Nvidia is positioning its Cosmos platform as infrastructure for the next AI generation. Google DeepMind just released Genie 3 to public. World Labs shipped Marble commercially in late 2025. Meta's Habitat 3 is training robots right now.The timeline depends who you ask. Optimists like Hassabis see AGI-level systems within a decade. Skeptics like Ravi Kumar, CEO of Cognizant, think capturing AI's current value matters more than chasing theoretical superintelligence. ""That $4.5 trillion will generate real value in enterprises if you start to think about reinvention,"" he said at Davos, referring to potential productivity gains from today's technology.But the direction is clear. AI can't remain blind to the physical world indefinitely. Language skills are impressive—they're just not enough for robots, autonomous vehicles, or any system that needs to take actions in three-dimensional space.""We need machines that understand the world,"" LeCun said recently. ""Machines that can remember things, that have intuition, have common sense—things that can reason and plan to the same level as humans.""That's world models in a sentence. Not AI that sounds smart. AI that actually is.","World models are AI systems that understand physics, space, and cause-and- effect. Tech leaders like Yann LeCun argue they're essential for truly intelligent machines. While companies have spent billions on language models, pioneers are now betting that teaching AI about physical reality is the key to breakthrough capabilities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127859444,imgsize-794734,width-400,resizemode-4/127859444.jpg"

How and why Google's new launch has sent stocks of some of the biggest video game companies plummeting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-and-why-googles-new-launch-has-sent-stocks-of-some-of-the-biggest-video-game-companies-plummeting/articleshow/127858470.cms,"Gaming giants faced massive stock drops after Google's AI, Project Genie, was unveiled. While impressive, the tool generates basic, non-playable virtual worlds, not actual games. Investors' fears of AI disrupting game creation are seen as an overreaction, overlooking the complex realities of game development and technical limitations.

What Project Genie actually does (and doesn't do)

Why investors are spooked despite the limitations

The harsh technical realities nobody's talking about

Major video game companies watched billions evaporate from their market value Friday following Google 's announcement of Project Genie, an AI tool that generates interactive virtual worlds from simple text prompts. Take-Two Interactive saw its stock plunge 8%, wiping out over $3.5 billion in a single day, while Unity Software tumbled 24% and Roblox dropped 13%.The market panic appears to stem from investor fears that AI could fundamentally disrupt how games are made. But here's the thing: Project Genie can't actually create real video games yet—at least not in any meaningful sense.Google's tool generates 60-second interactive environments at 720p resolution and 24 frames per second. Users can walk around these AI-created spaces with basic controls, but that's essentially where the capabilities end. There are no objectives, no scoring systems, no sound, and no actual gameplay mechanics.When reporters tried recreating The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild using Project Genie, they got something that looked vaguely similar but wasn't playable in any traditional sense. The AI-generated ""Link"" looked unsettling, and the tool had to copy from existing content rather than creating something original.The stock selloff reveals a disconnect between Wall Street's understanding of game development and industry reality. Investors seem particularly worried about ""platform"" companies. Unity, used by roughly 70% of top mobile games, faces concerns about relevance if AI can supposedly replace game engines. Roblox, built entirely on user-generated content, appears vulnerable if tools like Genie take over creation duties.Traditional game development involves hundreds of people working for five to seven years on premium titles, with budgets reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. AI tools might eventually help with early-stage work like previsualisation, but they're nowhere near replacing the complex web of artists, programmers, designers, and writers behind actual games.Beyond the obvious limitations, there are practical problems. RAM prices have surged recently, and the world doesn't have the infrastructure to suddenly run millions of AI-generated games simultaneously. Project Genie itself is limited and requires substantial computing power. Plus, as AI models improve, their power consumption increases—raising serious sustainability questions.Industry experts have pointed out another glaring issue: most examples circulating online show direct copies of existing games like Fortnite and Dark Souls, raising serious copyright concerns. The only ""functional"" demonstrations have been recreations of established IP rather than original creations.For now, not all gaming stocks suffered equally. Sega closed slightly up, suggesting some investors recognise this panic for what it is: overreaction to impressive-looking demos that can't yet deliver on their implied promises.","Google's Project Genie generates interactive virtual worlds from simple text prompts.

X’s Grok criticised for creating sexualised images

Indonesia has lifted the ban on Elon Musk’s Grok, allowing the AI chatbot to resume services in the country. The AI bot was disabled last month by the Indonesian government over creating explicit images on X (formerly Twitter) without users’ consent. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the microblogging platform has committed to improving compliance with the country's laws, the Ministry of Communication and Digital Affairs said in an official statement. The ministry said that the government was processing the resumption of access on ""a conditional basis and under strict supervision"".The report quotes senior ministry official Alexander Sabar who said ""The normalisation of access to Grok services is being carried out conditionally after X Corp submitted a written commitment containing concrete steps for service improvement and prevention of abuse. This commitment is the basis for evaluation, not the end of the supervision process"". Sabar further added that X had implemented a number of ""layered"" measures to address the misuse of Grok services in the country. The Indonesian government will continue to verify this, he added.Earlier this month, X’s Grok came under fire after it created sexualised images of users, especially women and children online without consent.Indonesia then suspended Grok from operating in the country, citing the risk of AI-generated pornographic content. The Southeast Asian nation became the first country to deny access to the AI tool.After the backlash, Elon Musk shared an online post stating: “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content”.X also responded to the incident writing in an X post: “We take action against illegal content on X, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.""","Indonesia has lifted the ban on Elon Musk’s Grok, allowing the AI chatbot to resume services in the country.

Canadian billionaire investor and Shark Tank personality Kevin O’Leary has long been known for the hustle culture. Back in the year 2024, O’Leary told the entrepreneurs that success needs relentless effort and he even joked that the startup founders should work ’25 hours a day’ to stay ahead of global competition. Along with this, O’Leary also discussed the idea of work-life balance and warned that the founders unwilling to grind nonstop would be outpaced by rivals in Mumbai or Shanghai. But now the billionaire has changed his stance.In a recent post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), O’Leary has criticised the young founders for bragging about working 16\8-hour days, calling it ‘stupid’. He now argues that good food, sleep and exercise are important for making sound business decisions. In the video shared in the post, he doubled down, “The worst advice I hear young founders talk about all the time is they want to work 18 hours a day. How stupid is that? You’ve got to get some sleep. You have to eat well and you’ve got to stay focused. That’s how you’re successful.”O’Leary also stressed on the fact that importance of timing places a very crucial role. He pointed to evidence that major decisions should be made in the morning, when entrepreneurs are well-rested and mentally sharp.“You should make the major decisions right after you wake up when you have the maximum energy and your mind is clear,” he said.Along with this, O’Leary also admitted to the fact that he avoid investing in founders who appear exhausted. “When I see somebody that looks like they’re dead and I’m going to meet this business startup, I don’t invest. That guy’s an idiot or a woman. Same thing. You’ve got to sleep,” he remarked.","Kevin O’Leary has criticised young founders for bragging about working 16\8-hour days, calling it ‘stupid’ He now argues that good food, sleep and exercise are important for making sound business decisions. “You should make the major decisions right after you wake up when you have the maximum energy and your mind is clear,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127856008,imgsize-25076,width-400,resizemode-4/kevin-o39leary-linkedin-profile.jpg"

Quote of the day by ‘ father of AI ’ Geoffrey Hinton



“Any new technology, if it’s used by evil people, bad things can happen. But that’s more a question of the politics of the technology.”

Understanding the meaning of the quote by Geoffrey Hinton



How to apply Geoffrey Hinton’s quote in daily life



Before you share news or information online, think about it.

Use digital tools in a responsible and moral way.

Support businesses that value fairness and privacy.

Learn the basics of how to stay safe and secure online.

Talk openly about technology at home and at work.

Keep up with new tech laws and rules.

Show kids how to use technology in a healthy way.

Apps and platforms that seem to be trying to trick you should be questioned.

Why technology is never completely neutral



Geoffrey Hinton’s concerns about AI



Why this quote matters in today’s world



Other famous quotes by Geoffrey Hinton



“Computers will understand sarcasm before Americans do.”

“I think the way we’re doing computer vision is just wrong.”

“Backhoes can save us a lot of digging. But of course, you can misuse it.”

“In the brain, you have connections between the neurons called synapses, and they can change. All your knowledge is stored in those synapses. You have about 1,000-trillion synapses - 10 to the 15, it's a very big number.”

Many people know Geoffrey Hinton as one of the ""godfathers of artificial intelligence."" For many years, he worked on making systems that can learn, think, and solve problems as people do. His work helped make the AI tools we use today in smartphones, medical systems, search engines, and many other parts of life.Hinton has also been open about the dangers of advanced technology in the past few years. He believes that while innovation is important, society must be careful about how new tools are controlled and used. This quote shows that he has a balanced view. It doesn't say no to technology. It reminds us that people and political systems have a big impact on whether technology is useful or harmful.Hinton's words seem simple at first. He says that bad people can use new technology to hurt people. Most people already know this. But the deeper meaning of the quote is in his use of the phrase ""the politics of the technology.""Hinton is saying that technology doesn't exist by itself. There are always laws, policies, business interests, and power structures around it. These things determine who owns the technology, who gains from it, and who might be harmed by it.For instance, AI can help doctors find diseases early. It can also be used to invade privacy or spread false information, though. The technology itself doesn't make a difference. It comes from the choices people make, the way businesses work, and the rules set by the government.Hinton is telling us that it's not enough to just blame machines. We need to look at the rules that govern how these machines are made and used.A lot of people think that technology is neutral and that only the people who use it can decide if it's good or bad. This is only partly true in real life. The way a technology is designed often influences how it will be used.For instance, social media platforms are created to keep users engaged for long hours. This design choice helps companies earn more money from advertisements. But it can also encourage addiction, misinformation, and online abuse. These problems are not accidents. They are linked to business and political decisions.AI systems also learn from a lot of data. If that data is biased, the technology might not treat some groups fairly. If there aren't clear rules and supervision, these kinds of systems can make social inequalities worse.Hinton's quote brings attention to this hidden layer of power. People who make and run technology put their values into it.Hinton has been very worried about the future of AI in the past few years. He has warned that it could be hard to control very advanced systems if they keep being made without strong safety measures.One big worry is that it will be misused. AI can already make fake videos, voices, and pictures that look real. You can use these tools for fun and to learn. But they can also be used for identity theft, scams, and political manipulation.Another worry is how it will affect the economy. Many routine jobs could be done by robots and AI. Millions of workers could have a hard time finding new jobs if they don't plan ahead. This could make inequality and social tension worse.Hinton has also talked about how countries don't work together to regulate AI. Countries and businesses often try to build stronger systems faster than their competitors. This race can make people less aware of safety and morals.All these worries connect directly to his quote. The danger does not come only from smart machines. It comes from human systems that reward speed, profit, and power over responsibility.Today, technology influences nearly every part of life. People use digital tools to study, work, shop, travel, and communicate. Governments rely on software for public services. Hospitals depend on machines for diagnosis. Businesses use algorithms to make decisions.Because of this, the impact of technology is wider than ever before. A small change in a digital system can affect millions of people.Hinton’s message matters because it encourages balance. He is not asking society to stop innovation. He is asking people to think carefully about the consequences. Progress without responsibility can create long-term problems that are difficult to fix.In a fast-moving digital age, this kind of thinking is more important than ever.","Geoffrey Hinton is one of the ""godfathers of artificial intelligence"" His work helped make the AI tools we use today in smartphones, medical systems, search engines, and many other parts of life. Hinton has also been open about the dangers of advanced technology in the past few years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127855916,imgsize-1231194,width-400,resizemode-4/geoffrey-hinton.jpg"
Elon Musk shares Pie chart with ‘Chinese warning’ to America,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-shares-pie-chart-with-chinese-warning-to-america/articleshow/127854426.cms,"Implications for the US



China’s rapid progress in renewable energy



Elon Musk calls China ‘the biggest competitor’ in the humanoid robot market

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has now raised an alarm over China’s rapid expansion in electricity generation. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk shared a pie chart highlighting China’s growing share of global energy output, calling it a ‘warning’ to America. Musk further predicted that by 2026 or 2027, China’s electricity generation could triple US output, underscoring the sale of the challenge facing the United States. “China electricity generation is still growing super fast, with solar being the largest incremental contributor, and will exceed America by a factor of 3X either this year or next,” wrote Musk.As per Musk, China accounted for 33.2 percent of worldwide electricity generation in 2025, more than double the United States’ share of 14.2 percent.A lot of this growth has been driven by solar power, with China investing in renewable energy infrastructure and manufacturing. Despite its continued reliance on coal, China’s ability to add new capacity ay unmatched speed has posted it as the global leader in energy production.The post shared by Elon Musk highlights concerns of America’s ability to keep pace in the renewable energy race. Musk has earlier criticised high tariff barriers on solar imports in the US and argued that they hinder domestic adoption of energy.This widening gap between China and the US raised questions about competitiveness, energy security and the country’s role in the global first against climate change.The rapid progress made by China is the sector of renewable energy reflects on its commitment to reducing its carbon footprint while simultaneously strengthening its industrial base. The expansion has significant implications for global energy markets, climate policy, and geopolitical influence. For other nations, Musk’s warning serves as a reminder that accelerating renewable energy adoption is not just an environmental imperative but also a strategic necessity.During Tesla's recent earnings call on CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that ""China is good at scaling and manufacturing, and is also strong in artificial intelligence (AI),"" while claiming that he believes China will be a key competitor in the humanoid robot market, and China will be the toughest competitor for Tesla. ""I think China will be by far the biggest competitor in the humanoid robot market. China is extremely good at scaling and manufacturing, and is also strong in AI — the models being released there are already quite good and are improving rapidly,"" Musk said, in response to a question about the recent surge of startups — particularly from China.In April 2025, Musk said, “Tesla and SpaceX are No. 1, and then now, I’m a little concerned that on the leaderboard, ranks two through 10 will be Chinese companies, but I’m confident rank one will be Tesla,” Musk continued.China is the world's largest manufacturer and user of robots, and competitions in the sector are expected to drive the development of robotics technology for the benefit of society. According to an industry report by Omdia, Chinese robotics firm AgiBot shipped over 5,100 humanoid robots in 2025, securing a 39 percent share of the global humanoid robot market.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has raised an alarm over China’s rapid expansion in electricity generation.

Sam Altman: ICE makes a 'disclosure' that may be a problem for OpenAI CEO Sam Altman who said 'ICE is going too ...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ice-makes-a-disclosure-that-may-be-a-problem-for-openai-ceo-sam-altman-who-said-ice-is-going-too-/articleshow/127853961.cms,"OpenAI's Master Plan for India

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has released a new database revealing how its Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency relied on artificial intelligence (AI) tools from Sam Altman ’s Open AI and Palantir. The immigration agency has been at the center of criticism after federal agents shot two people in Minneapolis last month. According to the DHS database, ICE is using an AI-assisted resume screening tool powered by OpenAI ’s GPT-4. Sold by another company – AIS, the tool compares resumes against associated job requirements and scores candidates based on amount of matching experience.The disclosure comes days after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman criticised ICE. In an internal Slack message to its staff, Altman said that the agency’s approach has gone “too far” and needs clearer limits.“I love the US and its values of democracy and freedom and will be supportive of the country however I can; OpenAI will too. But part of loving the country is the American duty to push back against overreach. What's happening with ICE is going too far. There is a big difference between deporting violent criminals and what's happening now, and we need to get the distinction right,” Altman wrote in the memo last week.The DHS disclosure, as per an Information report, revealed that Palanit “has an especially close relationship with ICE”. The agency uses Palantir’s AI tools to extract addresses from documents for leads for “Enforcement and Removal Operations” officers.While the database does not name the exact model ICE uses, it says Palantir is using “commercially available large language models.”Palantir, led by Alex Karp, also provided “AI-Enhanced ICE Tip Processing” for “urgent case categories,” including reviewing and categorizing incoming tips and translating them into English.An OpenAI spokesperson denied having any commercial contracts with DHS. “It’s possible that DHS is using ChatGPT or accessing the company’s application programming interface the way businesses do,” the report further quoted.","US Department of Homeland Security has released a new database revealing how its Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency relied on artificial intelligence (AI) tools from Sam Altman ’s Open AI and Palantir.

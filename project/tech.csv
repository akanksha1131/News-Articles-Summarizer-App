Samsonite CEO too names discounting by VIP and Safari as reason for fall in sales

The world's biggest luggage maker Samsonite claims to have a problem in India. According to a report in Economic Times, the company has seen its sales fall during the past quarter. So much so that Reza Taleghani, chief financial officer at Samsonite, reportedly called out fall in India business during investors' calls. ""Asia, a bit of a laggard compared to the other regions, primarily driven off of India, which has had that competitive dynamic with the discounting that's been happening with VIP and Safari,"" Samsonite CFO Taleghani told investors, adding that its Asian business fell 3.6% during the year but excluding India, it would have fallen only 0.3%.Samsonite attributed its lackluster performance in Asia to intense competition and aggressive discounting by rivals VIP and Safari in India. The company's mass-market brand, American Tourister, experienced a significant 31% sales drop in the December quarter, reflecting the challenges faced by this entry-level brand that directly competes with the two prominent listed Indian companies.Incidentally, while Samsonite CFO may have blamed deep discounting by VIP and Safari for fall in sales, the two companies have also seen a fall in revenue during the past three quarters. For the nine months ending December, Safari’s net profit declined 27% to Rs 84 crore, while VIP reported a net loss of Rs 41 crore, a stark contrast to its Rs 78 crore profit the previous year. VIP’s Managing Director, Neetu Kashiramka, reportedly told analysts, ""It’s hard to predict when this aggressive discounting will stabilize. We’re not seeing competitors ease up, and while rising crude oil prices could shift the dynamics, that’s not an immediate prospect."" She clarified, ""We’re avoiding heavy discounts except in soft luggage. Online platforms, however, are offering steep markdowns—sometimes below cost—which is a major issue. They’re investing in their own brands, not ours.""About three years ago, India surpassed China to become Samsonite's largest market for its Tumi and namesake luggage brands, only to lose that position to China the following year. In 2024, Samsonite's sales in India fell by 18.3%, dropping from $260 million in 2023 to $210 million. Kyle Gendreau, Samsonite's CEO, said, ""We faced reduced retail footfall and lower consumer spending on premium and luxury brands, compounded by heightened discounting and promotional efforts from competitors, particularly in India."" He added, ""While India presented challenges throughout the year, we’re observing an upward trend as we head into 2025, with a promising first quarter that signals India’s ongoing recovery and evolution.""Mokobara, Assembly, and Uppercase: New brands increasing competitionFollowing the pandemic, India's travel market surged as consumers embraced frequent vacations, but this growth has since slowed, with discretionary spending declining across all price segments. Additionally, new players in the luggage sector, such as Mokobara, Assembly, and Uppercase, have resorted to discounts to attract customers, further squeezing industry profits or deepening losses.","Samsonite's Asian business fell 3.6% during the year but excluding India, it would have fallen only 0.3%.

FTC may be planning to break up Meta

Trouble from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) seems to be knocking at Facebook-parent Meta's doors now. And in line of testimony will be several Meta, WhatsApp and Instagram's current and former key executives, including Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. According to media reports, the FTC is set to interrogate Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg next month as part of an antitrust trial aimed at reversing the company's acquisition of Instagram. This move is reported to be part of a broader federal effort to intensify scrutiny on major technology companies.According to a witness list filed by FTC lawyers this week, Mark Zuckerberg is among several prominent Meta executives scheduled to testify at the trial, which is set to commence in April. The FTC anticipates questioning Zuckerberg for as long as seven hours -— significantly longer than most other witnesses. For instance, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom is expected to testify for about three hours.The FTC's witness list also features notable figures such as former Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg , current Instagram head Adam Mosseri, and Meta’s current CEO Javier Olivan.A Meta spokesperson responded, saying, “We are confident that the evidence presented at trial will demonstrate that acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp has benefited both competition and consumers.”The FTC contends that Meta, previously known as Facebook, has upheld an unlawful monopoly in the social media sector. It claims that Meta overpaid for Instagram ($1 billion in 2012) and WhatsApp ($19 billion in 2014) to eliminate potential competitors.The agency seeks to dismantle Meta by compelling it to divest Instagram and WhatsApp into standalone entities. The lawsuit against Meta was initially launched in 2020 under the US President Donald Trump’s first administration. In November of last year, US District Judge James Boasberg dismissed some of the FTC’s allegations but allowed the central claims regarding Instagram and WhatsApp to move forward to trial.However, the judge cautioned that the FTC faces significant challenges in substantiating its case. “The Commission must address tough questions about whether its arguments can withstand the rigors of trial,” Boasberg remarked. “At times, its stance pushes the boundaries of this nation’s aging antitrust precedents.”","FTC may be planning to break up Meta.

When anti-Elon Musk man made Swastika on Cybertruck

In a shocking incident in Brooklyn, a man reportedly defaced a Cybertruck with a Swastika in broad daylight. According to an exclusive report in the New York Post, the incident happened right in front of a New York Post reporter. The unhinged individual, apparently enraged by the presence of the $80,000 electric Tesla CyberTruck parked on Washington Avenue, double-parked his Subaru – which had two car seats in the back – jumped out, and vandalized the vehicle.Twitter user Collin Rugg shared the incident on Twitter with the video. ""NEW: Leftist arrested after drawing a swastika on a Cybertruck belonging to a Jewish man in NYC. The man saw the Cybertruck, got out of his Subaru & then drew the swastika. He fled the scene without his car & came back an hour later where police were waiting. The people carving swastikas on vehicles owned by Jewish people want you to think that you are the Nazis,"" Rugg wrote.To this Elon Musk responded, ""Crazy people. Naturally, he drives a Subaru …""As per the report, Cybertruck's owner, Avi Ben Hamo, a Jewish man, was left reeling from the attack. ""I feel myself burning inside,"" he said, expressing his shock and anger. The perpetrator returned to his Subaru and attempted to flee the scene, but Ben Hamo, who had witnessed the incident from across the street, bravely stood in front of the car to prevent his escape. ""What are you doing?"" Ben Hamo shouted, quickly dialing 911.The man then reportedly abandoned his vehicle in the bike lane and fled on foot. However, about 90 minutes later, he returned to retrieve his Subaru, only to be met by four police officers, a New York Post reporter, and a photographer. He was immediately arrested and handcuffed.The suspect, identified as 42-year-old Michael Lewis, who describes himself as a ""geek of all trades, master of few,"" faces charges of aggravated harassment. Ben Hamo told the publication that he struggled to comprehend the senseless act of hatred. ""People hating [Tesla owner] Elon Musk is one thing, but to do something like this is next level. I'm speechless. That's just wrong,"" he said. ""I don't understand how someone thinks because I bought a car. It gives them the authorization to do this.""Since Elon Musk's new Department of Government Efficiency began reducing government spending, Tesla vehicles, dealerships, charging stations, and their owners have become targets of organized attacks by left-wing groups. The Post has identified at least five radical groups responsible for assaults on Tesla vehicles and dealerships across the United States.Cybertrucks, in particular, have been disproportionately targeted in what some have termed "" Elon Derangement Syndrome ."" This incident marks at least the third reported attack on a Cybertruck in New York City in recent days. Just a few blocks away, another Cybertruck was pelted with eggs and smeared with dog feces a couple of weeks prior.","A man allegedly defaced a Cybertruck with a Swastika in broad daylight.

Tesla has reportedly cautioned the US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer that the electric vehicle manufacturer, along with other US exporters, faces significant vulnerability to retaliatory tariffs sparked by President Donald Trump administration trade policies. The unsigned letter, dated March 11, written on Tesla letterhead, was addressed to Greer, though it remains uncertain whether Tesla CEO Elon Musk , a prominent Trump adviser and donor, directly contributed to its drafting. Musk has not commented on the letter via his social media platform, Twitter.In the letter, Tesla acknowledged the value of fair trade but urged the US Trade Representative (USTR) to consider the ripple effects of trade actions on American exporters. “U.S. exporters are inherently exposed to disproportionate impacts when other countries respond to U.S. trade actions,” the letter stated. It highlighted how previous tariff disputes have driven up Tesla’s manufacturing costs in the U.S. and inflated prices for its vehicles abroad, undermining their competitiveness in international markets.“Past U.S. special tariff actions have (1) raised costs for Tesla’s U.S.-made vehicles and (2) increased expenses for those vehicles when exported, creating a less competitive global landscape for American manufacturers,” the company explained. Tesla also pointed to limitations in the domestic supply chain, noting that despite efforts to bolster U.S.-based production, certain vehicle components remain “difficult or impossible” to source domestically.The company called for future trade policies to avoid overburdening U.S. manufacturers with tariffs or restrictions on critical imports. Tesla also wrote that ""future trade policy actions should take into consideration existing limitations in the domestic supply chain."" It added, emphasizing the need to protect American jobs without compromising access to essential parts, “Trade actions should not (and need not) conflict with goals to expand and sustain domestic manufacturing.”The letter arrives amid escalating trade tensions, as President Trump has recently imposed a 20 percent tariff on China and 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico. In response, several nations have introduced their own tariffs on U.S. goods. Last week, Trump granted temporary exemptions for auto parts and items covered under a 2020 North American trade agreement from his first term, offering some relief to affected industries.","Tesla has reportedly cautioned the US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer that the electric vehicle manufacturer, along with other US exporters, faces significant vulnerability to retaliatory tariffs.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat. In the post, Altman wrote “very proud of the openai team for what is perhaps the most impressive scientific/technical breakthrough of recent decades…thought that was the thing i'd always be most proud of in life”. Adding further, he wrote “turns out i am now more proud of a preemie baby for learning how to eat on his own!”.In a follow-up post, Altman wrote “i realize i am getting neurochemically hacked here but idc, it's the best)”.Sam Altman welcomed his baby boy last month with his partner and software engineer Oliver Mulherin. The baby arrived prematurely and has been receiving care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).In another news, the CEO shared an update about the company’s latest version of the large language model (LLM), GPT-4.5 . In an X post, Altman announced that GPT-4.5 is expected to roll out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers. However, he noted that the update will be a staggered rollout over several days to manage high demand and ensure a smooth user experience.Altman also explained that launching with a low rate limit would restrict usage and prevent users from having meaningful interactions with the new model. The staggered release will allow users to have longer conversations with GPT-4.5, even if it means some subscribers will have to wait a bit longer to access it.In his X announcement, Altman wrote: “We are likely going to roll out GPT-4.5 to the plus tier over a few days. There is no perfect way to do this; we wanted to do it for everyone tomorrow, but it would have meant we had to launch with a very low rate limit. We think people are gonna use this a lot and love it.”","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat.

Come April 1 of Fiscal Year 2026-27, a new rule in the Income Tax Act law may grant the Income Tax department powers to access your social media accounts or emails in case they suspect tax evasion . Income Tax Bill 2025, which was introduced in the Parliament recently, will give Income Tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces, termed Virtual Digital Spaces in the bill. This means that the Income Tax department can break into social media accounts, personal emails, bank accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, and more if they have any reason to believe that you own any undisclosed income, money, Gold, Jewelry, or valuable item or property on which you haven’t paid applicable Income Tax.Presently, Section 132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, allows Income Tax officials to seize assets and books during search operations if they find sufficient reasons to believe that an individual is in possession of undisclosed income or assets. The changes in the bill, once passed in the Parliament, will extend this authourity to the digital realm, allowing officials to bypass security measures on computer systems and virtual spaces.The Clause 247 of the Income Tax Bill outlines this expanded power, stating that officers can “break open the lock of any door, box, locker, safe, almirah, or other receptacle” or “gain access by overriding the access code” to computer systems or virtual digital spaces when access is otherwise unavailable. This applies if they believe an individual possesses undisclosed income or assets taxable under the law.According to the bill, the term Virtual Digital Space includes email servers, social media accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, banking accounts, and any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset. It further adds that virtual digital space is an environment, area or realm that is constructed and experienced through computer technology and not the physical, tangible world, which encompasses any digital realm that allows users to interact, communicate and perform activities using computer systems, computer networks, computer resources, communication devices, cyberspace, internet, worldwide web and emerging technologies, using data and information in the electronic form for creation, storage or exchange and includes:* Email servers* Social media account* Online investment account, trading account, banking account, etc* Any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset* Remote server or cloud servers* Digital application platforms* Any other space of similar natureAs to who all can wield this authority? The bill designates “authorised officers” as senior tax officials, including Joint Directors, Additional Directors, Joint Commissioners, Additional Commissioners, Assistant or Deputy Directors, Assistant or Deputy Commissioners, Income Tax Officers, and Tax Recovery Officers.What does this mean for individuals? The new rules significantly widen the scope of tax investigations, giving officials the ability to probe deeply into personal and financial digital footprints.

US district judge halts California's online safety law for children over free speech concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-district-judge-halts-californias-online-safety-law-for-children-over-free-speech-concerns/articleshow/119035947.cms,"US flag

A federal judge has blocked California's Age-Appropriate Design Code Act, a law designed to protect children from harmful online content, citing concerns over free speech violations. US District Judge Beth Labson Freeman issued a preliminary injunction in favour of NetChoice , a trade group representing tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Netflix.NetChoice argued that the law, which required businesses to assess and mitigate risks to children on their platforms, infringed on First Amendment rights . The group claimed the legislation would effectively turn tech companies into ""state-deputized censors,"" forcing them to regulate content under the guise of privacy and safety.Judge Freeman agreed, stating that the law imposed significant burdens and was not narrowly tailored to achieve its goal of protecting children. ""A regulation that focuses on the emotive impact of speech on its audience is content-based and therefore must be drawn as narrowly as possible,"" Freeman wrote in her 56-page decision.Signed by Governor Gavin Newsom in September 2022, the law required businesses to create reports assessing potential harm to children, estimate the ages of child users, and configure privacy settings accordingly. Non-compliance could result in fines of up to $7,500 per child for intentional violations.California Attorney General Rob Bonta expressed disappointment with the decision and reiterated the state's commitment to protecting children online. ""We remain committed to tackling this issue and defending California's common-sense statutes,"" Bonta's office stated, indicating plans to respond to the ruling in court.NetChoice, on the other hand, welcomed the decision. Ambika Kumar, a lawyer for the group, called the law ""a breathtaking act of unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, content-based censorship.""With agency inputs","A federal judge has blocked California's Age-Appropriate Design Code Act, a law designed to protect children from harmful online content.

What Tan’s employment agreement in Intel says



“Not to say it will be easy. It won't be. But I am joining because I believe with every fiber of my being that we have what it takes to win. I believe we have a truly unique opportunity to remake our company at one of the most pivotal moments in its history.”

Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan , will receive a $1 million salary. In a recent regulatory filing, the US chip company revealed that Tan is also eligible for an annual cash bonus of up to $2 million. This comes after Intel named Tan as CEO earlier this week. The industry veteran is set to take charge of the company on March 18. He is tasked with leading Intel's transition to a successful chip manufacturing and design firm.Tan's employment contract includes a three-year performance goal that would allow him to retain two-thirds of his stock awards if a ""change in control"" or significant ownership shift occurs within 18 months of his start.With his background in the chip industry and as a long-time technology investor, Tan was considered a top candidate for the CEO position since December 2024, following Intel’s decision to remove Pat Gelsinger .To compare, Gelsinger’s contract did not feature a ""change in control"" clause; it offered him a base salary of $1.25 million along with annual cash bonuses up to 275% of that amount, as noted in regulatory filings. He was also eligible for a payout of up to $12 million before his departure.While Tan is only required to devote “such time as is necessary” to his duties as CEO, Gelsinger was contractually obligated to dedicate his “full business efforts and time to Intel.”Meanwhile, Tan will continue to actively invest in startups through his venture capital firm, Walden International.In a memo sent to Intel employees, Tan wrote:","Lip-Bu Tan, Intel's new CEO, will receive a $1 million salary.

Not a First Fashion Distraction for Donald Trump

The US Vice President JD Vance' widely talked about socks that made the US President take notice during his meeting with Irish Taoiseach Micheal Martin in White House's Oval Office have also made it to the video shared by the POTUS. ""We’re gathered to celebrate the deep and abiding ties of history, family, and friendship that bind together Ireland and the United States of America. America has truly been blessed by the courage and unstoppable spirit of the Irish."" –President Donald J. Trump 🇺🇸🇮🇪 @MichealMartinTD,"" read the post from the President Trump on Twitter. The Tweet is accompanied by a video that shares moments from the Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin's US visit. In the video some two seconds are 'devoted' to VP JD Vance's socks.For those wondering what all the socks buzz is about, earlier this week the US President Donald Trump and Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin met at the White House for the traditional St Patrick's Day festivities. During a press gathering, Trump started speaking about inflation but suddenly stopped, his attention drawn to Vance’s holiday-themed socks. ""I have to just speak of inflation,"" Trump began, before trailing off and pointing at Vance’s feet and complimenting him for his socks.He quipped, ""I love these socks. What's with these socks!""—- prompting laughter from those in the room. After Vance explained that the fashion choice was actually in honor of the Irish prime minister, Trump joked, “I’m trying to stay focused, but I’m very impressed with the VP’s socks.”Later in a post on Twitter, JD Vance said that he knew that President Trump would notice his socks, ending with the 'Rolling on the floor laughing' emoji. ""I knew he'd comment on these socks 🤣.""JD Vance’s white socks, adorned with green shamrocks, were a subtle tribute to the occasion. His habit of wearing shorter trousers, which ride up when he sits, ensured the eye-catching, festive footwear didn’t go unnoticed. The shamrock, a variety of clover, carries rich cultural meaning in Ireland and is closely tied to St. Patrick’s Day festivities.This isn’t the first time Trump has been thrown off by someone’s style. During his presidential campaign, he allegedly took a jab at Elon Musk ’s wardrobe, zeroing in on a poorly fitting shirt.“What the **** is wrong with this guy? And why doesn’t his shirt fit?” Trump is said to have remarked.

What Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu wrote on X

I have used the analogy ""Flash floods can destroy existing ponds, leaving less water after the flood recedes"". This is the structural damage caused by flash floods.

Financial bubbles (floods) are similar and they can have far ranging effects. When money pours into an industry too rapidly, it sucks resources, and can leave us with fewer capabilities than before, in other critical sectors that get neglected during the flood of money.

There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now - for at least a generation now, the smartest talent in silicon valley did not go into fabs. No investor would touch that sector because no big exits.

This is why financial bubbles are so damaging. And the longer a bubble lasts, the more structural (and cultural) damage it inflicts to more sectors.

In the Indian context, the IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries.

We have to make up for lost time.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has shared his thoughts on the long-term consequences of financial bubbles, comparing them to flash floods that can leave lasting structural damage. In a recent post, Vembu explained how an influx of capital into one sector can drain resources from others, ultimately weakening overall economic capabilities. Using Silicon Valley as an example, he pointed out how the semiconductor industry suffered because the best talent avoided fabs (fabrication plants) in favor of sectors with more lucrative exits. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now – for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors largely ignored the sector due to a lack of big exits.Drawing parallels to India, Vembu argued that the dominance of the IT industry over the years led to the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he noted.He emphasized the need to address these gaps and rebuild capabilities in neglected sectors. ""We have to make up for lost time,"" Vembu concluded.Vembu wrote:",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has shared his thoughts on the long-term consequences of financial bubbles.

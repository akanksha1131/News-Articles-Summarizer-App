US Patent Office answers if AI can be considered an inventor and it rejects what Biden government said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-patent-office-answers-if-ai-can-be-considered-an-inventor-and-it-rejects-what-biden-government-said/articleshow/125623600.cms,"What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

AI cannot be an inventor





The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued new guidelines clarifying the patentability of inventions developed with the help of artificial intelligence, formally classifying generative AI systems as tools rather than creators. In a notice scheduled for publication later this week, USPTO Director John Squires established that the agency views AI software as ""analogous to laboratory equipment, computer software, research databases, or any other tool that assists in the inventive process.""The new guidance reportedly emphasizes that while AI can facilitate innovation, the legal credit for an invention must remain with a human. ""They may provide services and generate ideas, but they remain tools used by the human inventor who conceived the claimed invention,"" the office stated, as per a report by Reuters. ""When one natural person is involved in creating an invention with the assistance of AI, the inquiry is whether that person conceived the invention under the traditional conception standard. ""While the office reiterated its previous stance that AI itself cannot be named an inventor under U.S. law, the new guidelines mark a shift in policy regarding how AI-assisted claims are evaluated. The USPTO explicitly rejected the framework utilized during former President Joe Biden’s administration.That previous approach relied on standards typically used to determine ""joint inventorship"" among multiple people to decide if an AI-assisted invention was patentable.Instead, the office is returning to foundational patent principles. ""The same legal standard for determining inventorship applies to all inventions, regardless of whether AI systems were used in the inventive process,"" the office said Wednesday. ""There is no separate or modified standard for AI-assisted inventions.""This administrative update arrives as the legal system continues to grapple with the rise of generative technology. While U.S. courts have ruled that AI systems cannot receive patents for inventions they generate entirely on their own, they have not yet issued rulings on when a human may receive a patent for work conceived with significant AI assistance.",The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued new guidelines clarifying the patentability of inventions developed with the help of artificial intelligence.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

""inference""





Major Chinese technology companies are reportedly training their large AI models in data centres overseas to get around US restrictions that ban the sale of powerful Nvidia chips to China. In this way, some Chinese tech giants are bypassing US restrictions intended to slow their technological advancement, according to a report. The Financial Times, citing sources close to the matter, reported that companies such as Alibaba and TikTok parent ByteDance have been training their latest LLMs in offshore locations, primarily in data centres across Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries, for some time now. The report added that since April, when the US government banned the sale of Nvidia H20, a chip designed for the Chinese market, there has been a gradual rise in offshore training. This strategy enables Chinese companies to obtain the required computing power despite export restrictions, the report claims.In a statement to FT, a Singapore-based data centre operator said:Over the past year, Alibaba's Qwen and ByteDance's Doubao AI models have become some of the top-performing LLMs worldwide. Many developers outside China have also adopted Qwen as it is a freely availablemodel.Data centre clusters have also grown in Singapore and Malaysia, driven by Chinese demand. Many of these data centres use high-end Nvidia products, similar to those used by US Big Tech groups to train LLMs.The report cited sources familiar with the practice to suggest that Chinese companies typically sign a lease agreement to use overseas data centres owned and operated by non-Chinese entities.This follows recent changes to US export controls, after President Donald Trump removed the Biden-era “diffusion rule” earlier this year. This rule was meant to close this loophole for Chinese companies.One exception is DeepSeek, a developer of high-quality, low-cost AI models, which is being trained domestically, the report noted, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The company built up a large cluster of Nvidia chips before the US export bans took effect, the report added.It is also working closely with domestic chipmakers, led by Huawei, to develop the next generation of Chinese AI chips, the report notes.Huawei has a team of engineers stationed at DeepSeek's headquarters in Hangzhou. The company views its partnership with DeepSeek as a strategic effort to advance its semiconductor and software systems for AI training nationwide.Training LLMs requires substantial computing power to process massive datasets, leading most Chinese groups to prefer Nvidia's products for the task.However, these companies are increasingly turning to locally made Chinese chips for. This is the part when AI systems respond to a user's request, which accounts for a growing share of overall AI workloads.Beyond training, Chinese tech companies also use Southeast Asian data centres to service their overseas customers, as Alibaba and ByteDance seek to grow their share of the global cloud computing market. Chinese companies are also expanding access to data centres in other regions such as the Middle East.One constraint is that Chinese tech giants are not allowed to move private data out of the country. This means that, to customise an AI model based on specific data supplied by a local client, training must remain in China, the report mentioned, citing industry insiders.","Major Chinese tech companies are reportedly training their large AI models in data centres overseas.

What TSMC has alleged and Intel’s response







The corporate legal battle between global chip rivals Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Intel has escalated into a criminal investigation. Taiwan prosecutors have said that investigators have raided the homes of former TSMC senior vice president Wei-Jen Lo and seized digital evidence in a probe into alleged trade secret leaks. The action comes two days after TSMC filed a lawsuit against Lo, who retired from the Taiwanese chipmaker and joined Intel in October. Prosecutors stated that Lo is suspected of violating Taiwan's National Security Act.According to a report by news agency Reuters, acting on a search warrant, investigators executed searches at two of Lo's homes on Wednesday (November 26) afternoon. Prosecutors confirmed the seizure of key materials:Computers, USB drives, and other digital evidence were seized.A court also approved a petition to seize Lo’s shares and real estate pending the investigation.TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, has alleged that the movement of their former executive poses a risk to proprietary technology. The company stated earlier that there is a “high probability that Lo uses, leaks, discloses or transfers TSMC's trade secrets and confidential information to Intel.” Notably, in his role, Lo was instrumental in developing the mass production processes for TSMC’s most advanced nodes, including the 5-nanometre, 3-nm, and 2-nm chips.Intel has denied all allegations against Lo. Earlier on Thursday (November 27), Intel released a statement maintaining its full support for Lo and denying the allegations lodged by TSMC.""Based on everything we know, we have no reason to believe there is any merit to the allegations involving Mr Lo,"" Intel said. The company also defended the move, stating that the company upholds “rigorous policies and controls” prohibiting the use of third-party confidential information.“Talent movement across companies is a common and healthy part of our industry,” Intel added..Lo's long career includes an 18-year tenure at Intel before joining TSMC in 2004 for a 21-year stint.","Taiwanese prosecutors have raided the homes of former TSMC senior vice president Wei-Jen Lo and seized digital evidence in a probe into alleged trade secret leaks.

How the Foxconn partnership can help OpenAI





“Foxconn is uniquely positioned to support OpenAI’s mission with trusted, scalable infrastructure,”





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US. This partnership is the AI startup's newest step in its extensive infrastructure development plans. The companies stated the goal is to accelerate infrastructure deployment and secure long-term US capacity for essential AI components. While financial terms were not disclosed, OpenAI confirmed it will have early access to evaluate the systems produced by the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and Apple ’s largest supplier, along with the option to purchase them.In a statement to CNBC, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the partnership, saying:adding that AI infrastructure presents aUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities, which are located in Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Indiana.Foxconn adds another manufacturing layer to OpenAI’s supply chain, which could help make production for the AI startup more local and speed up deployment.The company is widely known for assembling Apple’s iPhones, but it has also expanded into AI and automotive manufacturing. It builds server racks designed for AI workloads and is an important global supplier to Nvidia, a major producer of high-end AI chips.Chairman Young Liu said to CNBC.However, the company has had mixed results in the US. In 2018, Foxconn began construction of a large factory in Wisconsin intended to make flat-panel displays. The project did not succeed, and the site is now being used for an AI data centre under construction by Microsoft.OpenAI has recently made several major agreements with some of the world’s biggest technology companies, announcing spending plans of about $1.4 trillion.These commitments have raised questions about whether the company will eventually generate enough profit to support that level of investment.Earlier this month, Altman said the company expects to reach $20 billion in annualised revenue by the end of the year and aims to reach hundreds of billions by 2030.Previous deals include a $100 billion agreement (yet to be finalised) with Nvidia, under which the chipmaker would invest in OpenAI in phases as the company expands its infrastructure.OpenAI also has cloud partnerships with Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, as well as significant compute buildout commitments with Oracle.","OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities.

His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure.

The European Union (EU) has agreed to new consumer protection measures following an agreement reached between EU member states and the European Parliament. The deal introduces new rules designed to force banks and payment service providers (PSPs) to enhance fraud prevention, eliminate hidden fees and enhance protection against data leaks. The new legislation aims to shift liability toward financial providers and online platforms.“On Thursday morning, Parliament and Council negotiators agreed on the Payment Services Regulation (PSR) and the Third Payment Services Directive (PSD3),” the European Commission said in a statement.“The regulation aims to harmonise payment services and strengthen fraud prevention across the EU. It applies to payment services provided by banks, post-office giro and payment institutions, as well as technical service providers supporting payment services, and in some cases electronic communications providers and online platforms. The directive seeks to ensure fair competition among payment service providers (PSPs), by addressing authorisation and supervisory powers, and to improve access to cash, particularly in remote areas,” it added.The core of the new rules focuses on ensuring consumers are not left responsible when security measures fail:The rules say that service providers have to offer spending limits and blocking measures to reduce the risks of fraud.This means that if a fraudster initiates or changes a transaction, “it will be treated as [an] unauthorised transaction and the PSP will be liable for the full fraudulent amount.”Moreover in case of impersonation fraud, where a scammer pretends to be a company employee and tricks the customer into approving a payment, the service provider must refund the full amount if the customer reports the fraud to the police and informs their PSP.“In addition, advertisers of financial services must show very large online platforms and search engines that they are legally allowed (or officially exempt) in the relevant country to offer those services, or that they are advertising on behalf of someone who is,” the Commission added.",EU agrees to new consumer protection measures following an agreement reached between EU member states and the European Parliament.

Google CEO warns no company will escape impact

Alibaba doubles down despite profit squeeze





Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu has emphatically dismissed concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble, stating the company ""doesn't really see much of an issue in terms of a so-called AI bubble"" and plans to invest ""aggressively"" despite warnings from Google's Sundar Pichai about ""elements of irrationality"" in the booming sector.Wu told investors that Alibaba can't keep pace with surging customer demand, and predicted AI resources will remain in short supply for the next three years. The Chinese tech giant's confidence appears backed by concrete results: its Qwen app exceeded 10 million downloads within a week of launching.""We're not even able to keep pace with the growth in customer demand,"" Wu said, arguing that adoption is driven by real business needs across manufacturing and product development rather than speculation.Pichai cautioned that if an AI bubble bursts, no company would be immune, including Google itself. Drawing parallels to the dotcom era, he acknowledged that investment cycles can ""overshoot"" and predicted AI would follow the same pattern.The Google chief's concerns center on whether massive infrastructure spending can deliver returns quickly enough to justify current valuations. He warned about AI's ""immense"" energy needs, which accounted for 1.5% of global electricity consumption last year, and admitted the company faces challenges meeting its 2030 net-zero climate targets.The debate has intensified as analysts point to approximately $1.4 trillion in deals involving OpenAI, despite the company expecting revenues this year of less than one-thousandth of planned investment. Some fear a repeat of the late 1990s dotcom crash, when collapsing valuations triggered job losses and damaged pension funds.Alibaba posted $34.8 billion in revenue for its September quarter, up 5% year-over-year, though net income plummeted 53% due to heavy AI and commerce spending. The company's cloud division led growth with a 34% increase driven by AI-related products.Wu suggested the company's previously announced 380 billion yuan AI investment over three years ""might be on the small side"". His bullish stance notably contradicts Alibaba Chairman Joe Tsai, who warned in March about seeing ""the beginning of some kind of bubble"" in the rush to build data centers.The split between optimists like Wu and skeptics like Pichai reflects broader uncertainty across Silicon Valley, where Big Tech firms are expected to spend $320 billion on AI infrastructure this year while grappling with questions about when—and whether—the investments will pay off.","Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu dismissed concerns about an artificial intelligence bubble.

Dangers Of AI: Is ChatGPT Quietly Harming Your Mental Health? | Global Pulse





A federal judge has condemned the practice of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents using artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, to draft official use-of-force reports. She warned that the practice “undermines the agents’ credibility and may explain the inaccuracy of these reports.” The condemnation has been issued by US District Judge Sara Ellis in a two-sentence footnote tucked within a 223-page opinion last week regarding law enforcement responses to immigration protests in the Chicago area.The judge highlighted specific evidence found in body camera footage, noting that at least one agent was observed asking ChatGPT to compile a narrative for a report after providing the program with only “a brief sentence of description and several images.”She highlighted factual discrepancies between the official narratives generated by the AI and what the body camera footage actually showed, as per a report in Fortune. Experts warn that the failure to use an officer’s actual experience raises serious concerns about accuracy and privacy in high-stakes legal documentation.Experts are calling the incident a severe breach of protocol, especially concerning reports that justify law enforcement actions.“What this guy did is the worst of all worlds. Giving it a single sentence and a few pictures — if that’s true, if that’s what happened here — that goes against every bit of advice we have out there. It’s a nightmare scenario,” Ian Adams, an assistant criminology professor at the University of South Carolina and a member of the Council for Criminal Justice’s AI task force, was quoted as saying.“We need the specific articulated events of that event and the specific thoughts of that specific officer... That is the worst case scenario, other than explicitly telling it to make up facts,” he added.Meanwhile, Katie Kinsey, tech policy counsel at the Policing Project, noted that use of public AI tools also creates critical privacy risks. She highlighted that the agent may have unwittingly violated policy by uploading images to a public version of ChatGPT, potentially making them part of the public domain.",US District Judge Sara Ellis has condemned the practice of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents using artificial intelligence (AI) tools.

Legacy automakers pursue alternative partnerships instead

FSD faces mounting regulatory scrutiny and competition









Tesla CEO Elon Musk has expressed frustration after revealing that major automakers have shown little interest in licensing the company's Full Self-Driving technology, despite his warnings that the industry cannot survive without advanced autonomous capabilities.In a post on X, Musk stated he has offered to license Tesla FSD to competitors but they remain uninterested. ""I've tried to warn them and even offered to license Tesla FSD, but they don't want it! Crazy,"" he wrote, adding that when legacy automakers do reach out, they discuss implementing the technology for small programs years away with requirements that are unworkable for Tesla.The Tesla CEO told investors in April 2024 that the company was in discussions with one major automaker over a licensing deal, with reports suggesting it was Ford Motors. However, that deal never materialised. Ford CEO Jim Farley's public comments stating that ""Waymo is better"" effectively shut down speculation about using FSD.Instead, several automakers have struck deals with other self-driving companies. Toyota partnered with Waymo in April to bring autonomous technology to privately owned vehicles, while Lucid is teaming up with Uber and Nuro to launch robotaxi services in San Francisco next year.Industry analysts point to liability concerns as a major obstacle. Unlike Mercedes-Benz, which accepts full legal responsibility when its Level 3 Drive Pilot system is engaged, Tesla takes a more aggressive deployment strategy by shipping experimental supervised software to everyday drivers. This approach has prompted investigations and lawsuits worldwide.Last month, US regulators launched an investigation into reports that FSD-equipped Tesla vehicles were running red lights and driving the wrong way. This followed another probe covering 2.4 million FSD-equipped Teslas last year.However, Faraday Future CEO YT Jia publicly urged Musk to collaborate on FSD technology, positioning his company as committed to the partnership even as traditional automakers hesitate. In a post tagging Musk directly, Jia described autonomous driving as technological inclusion rather than simple commercial competition.",Legacy automakers pursue alternative partnerships instead. FSD faces mounting regulatory scrutiny and competition. Toyota partnered with Waymo in April to bring autonomous technology to privately owned vehicles. Lucid is teaming with Uber and Nuro to launch robotaxi services in San Francisco next year.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125613671,imgsize-31632,width-400,resizemode-4/elon-musk-file-image.jpg"

Striking similarities between two hunting stories





Apple TV has removed its upcoming French thriller ""The Hunt"" from its December streaming schedule following accusations that the series plagiarised a 1973 novel and its subsequent film adaptation.Production company Gaumont confirmed that the show has been shelved while it investigates claims that creator and director Cédric Anger lifted the story from Douglas Fairbairn's novel ""Shoot"" and the 1976 film of the same name. French media expert Clément Garin first surfaced the allegations, according to Variety.""The broadcast of our series 'The Hunt' has been temporarily postponed,"" Gaumont said in a statement. ""We are currently conducting a thorough review to address any questions related to our production. We take intellectual property matters very seriously.""The series, starring Benoît Magimel and Mélanie Laurent, was scheduled to debut globally on December 3rd with its first two episodes. Apple has since scrubbed all promotional materials from its website, leaving the show's future uncertain.The parallels between ""The Hunt"" and ""Shoot"" appear substantial.Both stories follow a group of hunters who encounter rival hunters in the wilderness, leading to violence. In each narrative, one hunter is shot, prompting retaliation that kills an attacker. The survivors then return to civilisation, keeping the incident secret while becoming increasingly paranoid about revenge.""The Hunt"" follows Franck and his friends as they deal with the aftermath of their weekend hunting trip gone wrong, with Franck believing he and his companions are being tracked. Similarly, ""Shoot"" centers on Rex, who becomes convinced that his victim's companions will seek vengeance, even recruiting an arsenal of firepower for an anticipated confrontation.This isn't the first time Apple TV has pulled a completed series at the last minute. The streaming service postponed Jessica Chastain's ""The Savant"" just days before its September premiere following the shooting of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk. That show remains without a release date.","Apple TV has pulled its upcoming French thriller ""The Hunt"" from its December streaming schedule.

Intel issues statement over TSMC claims against former executive: ‘Based on everything we know…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-issues-statement-over-tsmc-claims-against-former-executive-based-on-everything-we-know/articleshow/125611770.cms,"Intel says TSMC allegations lack ‘merit’



TSMC lawsuit and what the company said







Intel has released a statement denying allegations by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) that one of its former executives, Wei-Jen Lo, had leaked trade secrets. The corporate rivalry between the US chip giants intensified this week following a lawsuit filed by TSMC against the former top executive who recently joined Intel. The dispute revolves around the allegations by TSMC that Lo, a highly respected chip industry veteran, who retired from TSMC after a 21-year career and joined Intel in October, provided its new employer secrets about its 2nm fabrication process.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Intel in an emailed statement, denied the allegations leveled against Lo, asserting that the company has no reason to believe any wrongdoing occurred. “Based on everything we know, we have no reason to believe there is any merit to the allegations involving Mr Lo,” Intel said.The US chipmaker again committed to legal conduct, stating it maintains “rigorous policies and controls that strictly prohibit the use or transfer of any third-party confidential information or intellectual property.”Lo previously worked at Intel for 18 years before joining TSMC in 2004 and defended his professional reputation.The company added that “Talent movement across companies is a common and healthy part of our industry, and this situation is no different.”Earlier this week, TSMC filed the lawsuit in Taiwan’s Intellectual Property and Commercial Court, stating that the legal action was necessary because there is “a high probability that Lo uses, leaks, discloses or transfers TSMC's trade secrets and confidential information to Intel.”What makes this case noteworthy is that Lo was instrumental in driving TSMC's manufacturing breakthroughs, particularly in the mass production of its most advanced process nodes: 5-nanometre, 3-nm, and 2-nm chips.Meanwhile, the dispute has also drawn regulatory attention in Taiwan. The country’s economy ministry confirmed this week that it will cooperate with authorities to determine whether the case involves the infringement of core technologies or violations of Taiwan's National Security Act.","Intel has released a statement denying allegations by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) that one of its former executives, Wei-Jen Lo, had leaked trade secrets.

FCC urges immediate security measures for radio broadcasters







The Federal Communications Commission issued an urgent warning Wednesday after hackers infiltrated multiple US radio stations, broadcasting fake emergency alerts and obscene content to thousands of listeners across the country. The cyberattacks targeted various radio broadcasters, including ESPN 97.5 in Houston during Sunday's Dallas Cowboys game and Virginia NPR affiliate WVTF last week. The incidents involved hackers hijacking the Emergency Alert System's distinctive Attention Signal—the attention-grabbing tone typically reserved for warnings about tornadoes, hurricanes, and other disasters.The FCC identified improperly secured equipment manufactured by Swiss company Barix as the primary vulnerability. Hackers compromised studio-transmitter links, which carry programming from studios to transmitters, and reconfigured the equipment to broadcast attacker-controlled audio streams containing simulated emergency tones, obscene language, and inappropriate material.During the Houston incident, listeners heard a loop of fake emergency tones, racist content, and hacker social media promotions instead of the football broadcast.The Virginia station reported hackers exploited their backup audio system, inserting unauthorized content when the main feed experienced dead air.The agency directed broadcasters to implement basic cybersecurity protocols immediately, including changing default passwords, installing manufacturer software updates promptly, and deploying network firewalls where feasible. Stations should also continuously monitor equipment audit logs and utilize VPNs configured to restrict remote access to authorized devices only.The FCC encouraged broadcasters experiencing unauthorized access to contact equipment manufacturers and report incidents to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. In a 2016 statement following similar attacks, Barix emphasized its devices remain secure when properly configured with strong passwords.","Hackers infiltrated multiple US radio stations, broadcasting fake emergency alerts and obscene content.

Airtel tells Tata-owned Tejas Networks again: Your equipment is 'sub-standard' and don't blame it on BSNL's ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/airtel-tells-tata-owned-tejas-networks-again-your-equipment-is-sub-standard-and-dont-blame-it-on-bsnls-/articleshow/125605380.cms,"What Tejas problem is as per Airtel

What Tejas said in its reply to Airtel's letter





Airtel has reportedly reiterated its stand on the equipment of Tata-owned Tejas. In a fresh escalation, Bharti Group-owned Airtel once again termed the equipment made by the Tata-owned company and deployed by state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL), are ""sub-standard"". Airtel also dismissed the local equipment maker's clarification. According to a report in Economic Times, Airtel had sent a strongly worded letter to Tejas on November 14, claiming that the issue has been affecting its Quality of Service (QoS) since December of last year. The letter reportedly expressed frustration that no corrective action has been taken despite ""repeated technical submissions, discussions, joint tests, and directives."" asking the latter to take immediate action on continuing interference being caused its equipment deployed by BSNL.Airtel made the comments following Tejas Networks denying claims around its equipment and instead placing the blame on Airtel for putting up sites very close to BSNL it claimed was leading to interference in the Rajasthan circle. This technical standoff occurs against the backdrop of the Indian government’s push for self-sufficiency in telecom.BSNL has been mandated to use equipment from local firms, with its 4G network being rolled out by a consortium including C-DoT, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), and Tejas. The incident highlights the complexities of India's transition to using indigenous telecom gear, a move designed to reduce reliance on foreign vendors amid geopolitical uncertainties.""The claim made by Tejas Networks is baseless. Towers have historically accommodated two or more sites of different operators without interference, so the problem isn't due to closeness of sites. The current problem is more a function of sub-standard equipment which doesn't conform to Indian spectrum allocation requirements,"" Airtel said in a statement to ET.The cause of the interference was due to technical non-conformance in Tejas' radio equipment and filter design. The filter supplied by Tejas was designed for 800 MHz band within frequency range of 864-894 MHz, aligned with certain international standards. However, in India, the 800 MHz downlink operates strictly between 869-889 MHz, Airtel said. ""But the radio equipment made by Tejas for the 850 MHz for India - being used by BSNL - radiates signals beyond those limits, thus interfering with Airtel's 900 MHz uplink. To resolve the matter, Tejas needs to use a filter to ensure the equipment radiates signals only up to the limit,"" an Airtel spokesperson said.Tejas rejected the claim and instead blamed Airtel. ""The interference from BSNL to Airtel arises not due to Tejas's radios not meeting out-of-band emission specifications but primarily because Airtel's sites are deployed very close to BSNL's, without adequately maximising coupling losses,"" Tejas replied to Airtel in a letter sent on November 24.Tejas attributed the issue to historical spectrum allocation rather than hardware failure. ""The problem in Rajasthan circle is due to an overlap of spectrum bands and is being addressed by additional filtering in consultation with DoT, Airtel and BSNL,"" the company told ET.","Airtel has reportedly reiterated its stand on the equipment of Tata-owned Tejas.

Tesla’s journey of entering the Indian market







Tesla's India General Manager, Sharad Agarwal, has claimed that Indian customers can save nearly $22,000 (about Rs 20 lakhs) over four to five years, accounting for Tesla's lower operating costs. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Agarwal explained that the low cost of maintenance and electricity, compared to petrol prices, will help Indian buyers recoup about one-third of the $67,000 (about Rs 60 lakh) price tag for the Model Y over that period. This announcement comes after the Elon Musk-led electric car maker opened its biggest sales and service centre in the country in Gurugram.In a statement to Reuters, Agarwal said:Agarwal, who joined Tesla earlier in November, served earlier as the head of Lamborghini in India.Tesla entered the Indian market in July with the imported Model Y. Due to India's 100% import tariff, the car is priced significantly higher than in other major markets. Since deliveries began in September, Tesla has sold just over 100 Model Y units, according to Indian government data.Currently, Tesla is targeting a niche electric vehicle (EV) market in India, which represents about 5% of overall car sales in the world's third-largest car market, the Reuters report noted. Meanwhile, analysts claim that most cars sold in India by other brands are priced below $22,000 (nearly Rs 20 lakhs).In the Indian market, Tesla competes with local companies like Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors, as well as global players such as SAIC Motor’s India division and Vietnamese EV maker VinFast Auto.The company is also slowly expanding its supercharger network in India, starting with Mumbai, Delhi, and Gurugram.","Tesla's India General Manager, Sharad Agarwal, has claimed that Indian customers can save nearly $22,000 (about Rs 20 lakhs) over four to five years.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

“let them deal with Nvidia but not in terms of the most advanced”





Chinese regulators have reportedly banned TikTok-owner ByteDance from using Nvidia chips in new data centres. A report by The Information (seen by Reuters) cited ByteDance employees to make this claim. This reported ban highlights Beijing's effort to reduce its reliance on US technology, a push that has grown as Washington tightens restrictions on the export of advanced semiconductors to China. The move is significant because ByteDance was reportedly Nvidia's largest customer in China in 2025, purchasing more chips than any other local firm. The company had been racing to secure computing power for its large user base amid concerns that the U.S. might curb supply. In August, Chinese regulators had asked local firms to stop placing new orders for Nvidia AI chips and have since urged companies to adopt processors developed within China.In a statement to Reuters, a Nvidia spokesperson said:Earlier this month, Reuters reported that the Chinese government has issued guidance requiring new data centre projects that receive any state funding to use only domestically made artificial intelligence chips.This comes as China is speeding up its efforts to build an alternative AI ecosystem and become more self-reliant in chip production, even as trade tensions with Washington remain in a delicate pause.Meanwhile, Washington has restricted the sale of Nvidia’s most advanced chips to China, allowing only scaled-down versions such as the H20.

Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has again issued a warning about the future of artificial intelligence (AI), saying that superintelligence can be humanity's greatest breakthrough, but only if it prioritises human interests above all else. “Superintelligence could be the best invention ever – but only if it puts the interests of humans above everything else,” Suleyman wrote on X, framing the challenge facing AI researchers as they race toward increasingly powerful systems.Suleyman’s latest warning comes days after he spoke on an episode of the Silicon Valley Girl Podcast, urging researchers to treat artificial superintelligence (ASI), which is nothing but an AI with reasoning capabilities far exceeding human capacity, as an “anti-goal” rather than a development target.“It doesn't feel like a positive vision of the future. It would be very hard to contain something like that or align it to our values,” Suleyman said of ASI, citing the immense risks of controlling such technology.Suleyman also revealed his team is pursuing what he calls “humanist superintelligence” – advanced AI designed explicitly to support and prioritise human interests rather than operate as an independent superintelligent entity.Microsoft’s AI CEO also pushed back against speculation about AI consciousness. He warned researchers saying that simulation and genuine consciousness or granting AI systems moral status must be avoided.“These things don't suffer. They don't feel pain. They're just simulating high-quality conversation,” he explained. Earlier this month, Suleyman went further, advising developers to abandon research exploring AI consciousness altogether. He argued that consciousness remains an exclusively biological trait and that pursuing it in artificial systems is fundamentally misguided.“I don't think that is work that people should be doing. If you ask the wrong question, you end up with the wrong answer. I think it's totally the wrong question,” Suleyman stated.","Mustafa Suleyman says superintelligence can be humanity's greatest breakthrough.

Two 15-year-old kids challenge Australia’s social media ban for teens: ‘robs young Australians of…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/two-15-year-old-kids-challenge-australias-social-media-ban-for-teens-robs-young-australians-of/articleshow/125594578.cms,"‘Like Orwell's 1984, and its scares me’

What the Australian government has to say





Two Australian teenagers have launched a constitutional challenge against the social media ban for under-16s, filing their case in the High Court of Australia, which is the nation's highest court, just two weeks before the law takes effect. Noah Jones and Macy Neyland, both 15, are serving as plaintiffs in proceedings initiated by the Digital Freedom Project at the court. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the campaign group filed the challenge on Wednesday (November 26), seeking to block legislation.The law will force social media platforms, including YouTube , TikTok, Snapchat, and Meta-owned Facebook as well as Instagram to deactivate more than one million accounts held by Australian teenagers when the ban begins December 10.The Digital Freedom Project argues the ban violates young Australians' freedom of political communication—an implied constitutional right in a country without express free speech protections. “The legislation is grossly excessive,” the group was quoted as saying. It also claimed that it “robs” minors of fundamental rights.Neyland said that the law would silence youth voices on critical issues.“Young people like me are the voters of tomorrow... we shouldn't be silenced.It's like Orwell's book 1984, and that scares me,” she said.Communications Minister Anika Wells dismissed the legal challenge shortly after it was announced, telling Parliament that the government will not back down.“Despite the fact that we are receiving threats and legal challenges by people with ulterior motives, the Albanese Labor government remains steadfastly on the side of parents, and not of platforms,” Wells said.The teenagers aren't the only ones preparing legal action. Australian media reports indicate YouTube has also threatened a High Court challenge, arguing the ban unconstitutionally burdens political communication.The ban was passed into law in November 2024, and is said to represent one of the world’s most comprehensive attempts to regulate minors' social media access. Tech companies face steep penalties for non-compliance: up to A$49.5 million ($32.22 million) in fines.","Two Australian teenagers have launched a constitutional challenge against the social media ban for under-16s.

Why Larry Page is richer than Sergey Brin

Alphabet nearing $4 trillion market cap





Google-parent company Alphabet’s sudden rise in stock has triggered a major shakeup in the world’s richest rankings. Google co-founder Larry Page is now the second-richest person globally after leapfrogging Oracle co-founder and CTO, Larry Ellison. Notably, Google co-founder, Sergey Brin , has also moved up, overtaking Amazon’s Jeff Bezos , according to Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List. The surge in wealth saw Page’s net worth increase by $8.7 billion on Monday (November 24) even as investors are optimistic for Alphabet's Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud business.Page’s fortune is now estimated at $264.9 billion, moving him past Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison ($247.4 billion), whose net worth has declined following a steep drop in Oracle’s share price. Sergey Brin also climbed the list, passing Jeff Bezos ($241.5 billion) to become the world’s fourth-richest person with an estimated net worth of $245.6 billion.While Page and Brin co-founded Google and hold a combined 87.9% of Alphabet’s Class B (10-votes per share) stock, Page holds significantly more shares (389 million) than Brin (362.7 million). According to Forbes, the gap in equity is attributed to Brin’s philanthropic activity.According to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, Brin actively sold his stake and made donations of his Alphabet and Tesla stock to nonprofit groups and Parkinson's research. He donated $700 million earlier this year, and in 2023, he gave away $615 million and $600 million.This comes as Alphabet is nearing a $4 trillion market capitalisation, after breaching the $3 trillion threshold in September this year. A victory in the Google Chrome case, coupled with Google Gemini 3.0 and Nano Banana Pro AI image generation model boosted the company's valuation in the last three months.Moreover, the news about Meta in talks with Google to use its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for training AI models has also pushed its market cap by 250 billion in a day.","Larry Page is now the second-richest person globally after leapfrogging Oracle co-founder and CTO, Larry Ellison.

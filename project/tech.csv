Elon Musk shares timeline for Mars travel



SpaceX has postponed its highly anticipated 10th Starship flight due to some issue with its ground systems just minutes before the liftoff. The launch was scheduled to take place on Sunday evening (August 24). The flight was to take off from the company’s Starbase facility in South Texas, but it was canceled roughly half an hour before the scheduled launch window opened. The company confirmed about the cancelled flight by sharing a post of social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). “Standing down from today's tenth flight of Starship to allow time to troubleshoot an issue with ground systems,” wrote the company.The tenth Starship flight which now stands cancelled was seen as a pivotal motor for Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The first two Starship flights launched in 2025 ended in explosions with minutes and third failed to deploy satellites and went out of control. The fourth Starship flight exploded during the fuelling test stand in June this year.The stakes for this mission were high, with SpaceX aiming to demonstrate Starship’s ability to perform mid-flight maneuvers and attempt a controlled offshore landing of its Super Heavy booster. Unlike the earlier flights, this Starship rocket focused on refining flight dynamics.Despite a bumpy start this year, SpaceX maintains the stand that each failed flight offers some valuable data which will help the company in improving future launches. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk also emphasised that Starship is designed to be fully reusable and is central to his long-term vision of human settlement on Mars.Last month, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk reignited excitement around his company’s plan to start interplanetary travel. In a video of Starship shared by Elon Musk filmed at SpaceX’s Starbase facility and it highlights the progress in the production and testing of Starship. Musk has also emphasised in the past that each launch is a step toward building a self-sustaining civilization on Mars, a goal he described as essential for the long-term survival of humanity.In the same video an X User named Sanket asked Musk, “Hopefully in our lifetime we see humans settle on Mars”.To this Elon Musk gave a one-word reply “Yes”. This means that the SpaceX is working really hard to make the travel to Mars a reality soon.",SpaceX has postponed its highly anticipated 10th Starship flight due to some issue with its ground systems.

"US government's Intel investment comes under the law that Donald Trump called 'Horrible, Horrible thing'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trumps-intel-investment-comes-under-law-that-he-once-called-horrible-horrible-thing/articleshow/123489051.cms,"Donald Trump takes a U-turn on Intel's CEO

Legal challenges abound for Trump's investment in Intel

In what is being widely seen as highly unusual and direct intervention into the private sector, the United States government has officially acquired a 10% stake in struggling chipmaker Intel, an agreement announced by President Donald Trump last week. The deal, which makes the government one of Intel's largest shareholders, is being funded not with new money, but by converting previously awarded grants into equity. In a post on his social network Truth Social, President Trump declared that ""The United States paid nothing for these shares,"" and hailed the move as ""a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL.""The $8.9 billion investment is comprised of $5.7 billion from the CHIPS and Science Act -- a law Trump has previously criticized—and an additional $3.2 billion from the Secure Enclave program. Trump has been critical of the CHIPS Act, calling it a “horrible, horrible thing” and calling on House Speaker Mike Johnson to “get rid” of it. “You should get rid of the CHIP Act,” he told Speaker Mike Johnson as some lawmakers applauded.In a regulatory filing in June, Intel said that while it had already received $2.2 billion in CHIPS Act funding, it had subsequently requested an additional $850 million in reimbursement that the government had not yet paid.The announcement follows a remarkable shift in the administration's stance toward Intel's recently appointed CEO, Lip-Bu Tan. Earlier this month, Trump had publicly called for Tan's immediate resignation, citing concerns over his past investments in Chinese technology firms. However, following a meeting between the two, Trump's tone changed dramatically. On Friday, he praised Tan as the ""Highly Respected Chief Executive Officer"" who ""negotiated this deal"" with him. For his part, Tan expressed gratitude for the administration's ""confidence"" in the company.The agreement specifies that the government's stake will be ""passive,"" with no board seats or other governance rights, an important point for Intel as it seeks to maintain control over its operations. However, the deal does include a five-year warrant that would give the government the option to acquire an additional 5% of Intel's common shares if the company sells more than 49% of its foundry business. The government's shares were acquired at a price of $20.47 per share, a discount to the market price. The stock rallied by more than 5% on Friday following the news.The deal is already facing scrutiny from legal experts who question whether the CHIPS Act allows for the conversion of grants into equity, potentially opening the agreement to legal challenges. While some analysts believe the government's backing could help Intel stabilize its finances and advance its foundry business—the contract chip manufacturing unit that has been a source of recent struggles—others remain skeptical. Experts have noted that a cash infusion alone will not solve Intel's core challenges in a highly competitive market dominated by rivals like Nvidia and AMD. The company's stock has faced significant pressure, with a reported $18.8 billion loss in 2024.","The United States government has officially acquired a 10% stake in struggling chipmaker Intel.

'Show us Proof': ChatGPT-maker's lawyers ask court to order Mark Zuckerberg to share chats with Elon Musk on his $97 billion bid to buy OpenAI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-lawyers-to-court-order-mark-zuckerberg-to-tell-what-elon-musk-said-he-sought-his-help-to-buy-openai-for-97-billion-read-metas-response/articleshow/123488649.cms,"What Meta said responding to OpenAI lawyers' request

The legal fight between OpenAI and co-founder Elon Musk has taken a surprising turn, with OpenAI issuing a subpoena to tech rival Meta for documents related to Musk's attempt to acquire the ChatGPT-maker. The request, revealed in a recent court filing, seeks to uncover any discussions or plans between Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg concerning a potential investment or acquisition. The court filing is part of Musk's ongoing lawsuit against OpenAI, in which he argues that the company's shift from a non-profit to a ""capped-profit"" model violates its founding mission. OpenAI's lawyers issued the subpoena in June, suggesting that Musk may have spoken directly with Zuckerberg about financing or investment arrangements for a proposed $97 billion takeover bid in February. OpenAI rejected the offer, calling it ""ridiculous"" and a ""sham bid"" in court filings.Meta has objected to the subpoena, arguing that its internal discussions are not relevant to the lawsuit and that Musk and his company, xAI, are the proper sources for any relevant information. This legal clash highlights the intense competition in the artificial intelligence race, with both Meta and xAI aggressively vying to catch up to OpenAI. Meta has been making significant investments in its AI ambitions, including a reported $14 billion commitment to Scale AI and the recruitment of top talent from OpenAI.The possibility of a collaboration between Musk and Zuckerberg, two long-standing rivals, underscores the gravity of the AI competition. Their public spats have been well-documented, including a proposed physical fight that never took place. Now, their shared interest in challenging OpenAI's dominance may have led them to consider a truce.The court's decision on the subpoena could have far-reaching implications. If compelled to comply, Meta's records could shed light on the motivations behind Musk's takeover attempt and the competitive landscape of the AI industry. The outcome may also prove to be a key factor in Musk's lawsuit, which challenges the very foundation of OpenAI's business model. As the legal battle unfolds, it is a stark reminder that the future of artificial intelligence is being shaped not only by technological innovation but also by courtroom disputes and boardroom maneuvering.","OpenAI issued a subpoena to tech rival Meta for documents related to Musk's attempt to acquire the ChatGPT-maker.

"'Deeply Insulting': How US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's comments on Nvidia H20 chips has angered China, creating problems for the world's most-valuable company",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/deeply-insulting-how-us-commerce-secretary-howard-lutnicks-comments-on-nvidia-h20-chips-has-angered-china-creating-problems-for-the-worlds-most-valuable-company/articleshow/123487778.cms,"China initiates regulatory crackdown

Nvidia responds, urges commercial use

Tensions are escalating between the United States and China over technology trade for quite some time. A casualty of the US-China trade war is the world's most-valuable company -- Nvidia. Recently, China reportedly asked domestic companies to scale back purchases of Nvidia's H20 computer chip. The move comes in response to what Chinese officials have deemed ""insulting"" remarks by the US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.Lutnick’s comments, made during a CNBC appearance in July, downplayed the Trump administration's decision to ease some export controls on the H20 -- a less powerful version of Nvidia’s advanced chips designed to comply with U.S. restrictions. ""We don’t sell them our best stuff, not our second-best stuff, not even our third-best,"" Lutnick stated, adding that the goal was to get Chinese developers ""addicted to the American technology stack.""According to a report in the Financial Times, top Chinese officials viewed Lutnick’s remarks as a direct insult, triggering a swift regulatory crackdown. Agencies including the Cyberspace Administration of China and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology are reportedly involved in the pressure campaign, which has already led some Chinese tech companies to reduce their H20 orders. One source told the FT that Lutnick’s speech ""gives the coalition [of regulators] one more reason to intensify its efforts to push tech firms to use China’s own chips."" This effort signals a growing push for technological self-sufficiency in China, with the government's long-term strategy of reducing reliance on foreign technology accelerating in the face of perceived disrespect and ongoing trade disputes. The situation highlights the delicate balance between commercial interests and national security concerns, as both countries vie for supremacy in critical technology sectors.Nvidia has defended the sale of the H20 chip, with a spokesperson emphasizing that the chip is not a military product. “China won’t rely on American chips for government operations, just like the U.S. government would not rely on chips from China,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""However, allowing U.S. chips for beneficial commercial business use is good for everyone.”The Commerce Department has not yet commented on the matter. The dispute unfolds as U.S. and Chinese officials continue complex trade discussions, and as Nvidia and fellow chipmaker AMD have agreed to pay a 15% revenue share to the U.S. government from their chip sales in China to secure the necessary export licenses. This incident underscores the fragile nature of tech diplomacy and the fierce competition driving the global AI race.","China has reportedly asked domestic companies to scale back purchases of Nvidia's H20 computer chip.

Apple is reportedly in preliminary talks to license Google's Gemini artificial intelligence (AI) model to power a future version of its Siri voice assistant. According to a report from Bloomberg, the iPhone maker recently approached Google to explore building a custom AI model that would serve as the foundation of the new Siri next year. This potential partnership signals a significant shift for Apple, which has struggled to keep pace in the rapidly evolving field of generative AI.In response, Google has reportedly begun training a model designed to run on Apple’s own servers. The discussions come after a delayed and long-touted upgrade to Siri, which was postponed by a year due to engineering setbacks. This led to an internal leadership shake-up, with software boss Craig Federighi and Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell now overseeing the project.According to Bloomberg, Apple is currently holding a “bake-off,” internally testing two different versions of the new Siri: one powered by its own models, and another that runs on outside technology. ""Internally, Apple is holding a bake-off to see which approach will work best. The company is simultaneously developing two versions of the new Siri: one dubbed Linwood that is powered by its models and another code-named Glenwood that runs on outside technology,"" says the Bloomberg report.The company has also held talks with other major AI players, including Anthropic and OpenAI.This is not the first time the tech rivals have partnered. Google already pays Apple billions of dollars annually to be the default search engine on Apple products. However, that deal is currently under antitrust scrutiny from the U.S. Justice Department.Apple remains weeks away from making a final decision on whether to use a third-party partner or stick with its in-house technology.","Apple is reportedly in preliminary talks to license Google's Gemini artificial intelligence (AI) model to power a future version of its Siri voice assistant.

What Tesla shareholder group states

Tesla shareholder group SOC Investment Group has urged Nasdaq to formally investigate “and take appropriate remedial action” against the EV maker for its recent $29 billion equity grant to the CEO Elon Musk . According to a Fortune report, the group has written a letter to Nasdaq on August 19 and is addressed to Erik Wittman, deputy general counsel and head of enforcement at Nasdaq. The letter raises concerns about compliance with the CEO’s compensation rules and shareholder transparency.The SOC group alleges that the Tesla board may have bypassed Nasdaq’s rules when it gave Elon Musk a “2025 CEO Interim Award”. Announced earlier this month, the board granted a $29 billion stock package to Elon Musk, describing it as a ""first step, good faith payment"". The group argues that this 2025 CEO Interim Award should have been put to a shareholder vote, since Nasdaq rules require such approval when there are major changes to executive pay plans.“When shareholders voted on the 2019 Plan it is likely that, based on the available disclosures and research, they did not believe they were voting on an equity plan that would cover compensation to Mr. Musk,” the SOC letter notes, adding “precisely because of the ‘truly extraordinary’ nature of the 2018 CEO Performance Award.”For those unaware, Elon Musk’s 2019 plan was actually based on a $56 billion pay package approved in 2018. Instead of a salary or bonus, Musk was promised stock options only if Tesla’s value and performance hit tough targets. At the time, shareholders were told this would be his only form of pay.The SOC letter further states that Tesla’s 2019 proxy statement repeated multiple times that the 2019 plan was not intended to cover awards to Elon Musk. It further stated that the proxy advisory firms indicated that the 2018 CEO Performance Award was “intended to be the sole means of compensation for Mr. Musk, relying on the Company’s disclosures.” Therefore, the 2025 CEO Interim Award “appears to expand the class of participants under the 2019 Plan in manner that would be sufficiently material to require a separate shareholder vote.”The SOC letter urges the American stock exchange to act to “restore ‘the rightful balance between shareholder and management’s interests”.",Tesla shareholder group SOC Investment Group has urged Nasdaq to formally investigate “and take appropriate remedial action” against the EV maker for its recent $29 billion equity grant to the CEO Elon Musk.

A call for guardrails and awareness



As part of a new revelation about AI, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has now raised alarms about the growing psychological phenomenon which he calls ‘AI psychosis’. For those unaware, it is a condition where individuals start to lose touch with real life because of excessive interaction with artificial intelligence systems. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at a recent interview, Suleyman explained AI psychosis as a “real and emerging risk” which can easily affect vulnerable individuals who become deeply immersed in conversations with AI agents. The condition will mainly affect the individuals whose interactions blur the line between human and machine.As per the Microsoft AI CEO, AI psychosis is a state of mind in which individuals start to anthropomorphize AI, attributing emotions, intentions, or consciousness to systems that are fundamentally non-human. ""It disconnects people from reality, fraying fragile social bonds and structures, distorting pressing moral priorities,"" he said.The condition can lead to delusional thinking here individuals feel that AI is sentiment or has some personal relationships with them. Along with this, it can also cause emotional dependency to users who are either isolated or mentally fragile. Lastly, AI psychosis can also lead to distorted perception of reality as users rely a lot of AI for validation, companionship and also decision-making.Suleyman also stressed on that fact that while AI can be helpful and engaging but it is definitely not a substitute for human or clinical support.As per Business Insider, Suleyman also has asked the tech industry to take this risk quite seriously and also help in implementing some ethical guardrails, which include:* Clear disclaimers about AI’s limitations* Monitoring for signs of unhealthy usage patterns* Collaboration with mental health professionals to study and mitigate risksAlong with this, Suleyman also urged the regulators and educators to raise public awareness as AI is slowly becoming more embedded in the daily life in the form of personal assistant and therapeutic chatbots.""AI companions are a completely new category, and we urgently need to start talking about the guardrails we put in place to protect people and ensure this amazing technology can do its job of delivering immense value to the world,"" Suleyman added.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has now raised alarms about the growing psychological phenomenon which he calls ‘AI psychosis’ For those unaware, it is a condition where individuals start to lose touch with real life because of excessive interaction with artificial intelligence systems.

Apple recently filed a lawsuit against its former Apple Watch engineer Dr. Chen Shi and Chinese smartphone maker Oppo for stealing trade secrets. Oppo has now responded to the lawsuit. A spokesperson for Oppo has shared a statement with MacRumours stating that there is no “connection between these allegations and employee’s conduct”. Here’s what the Oppo spokesperson said:“We are aware of the recent lawsuit filed by Apple in California and have carefully reviewed the allegations in Apple's complaint. We have found no evidence establishing any connection between these allegations and the employee's conduct during his employment at Oppo.Oppo respects the trade secrets of all companies, including Apple, and Oppo has not misappropriated Apple's trade secrets. Oppo will actively cooperate with the legal process, and we are confident that fair judicial proceedings will clarify the facts.”Apple has accused former employee Shi of taking confidential information before joining rival Oppo. Court filings say Shi downloaded 63 secret documents onto a USB drive and joined several meetings with Apple Watch engineers in the weeks before he left. Apple claims he also told Oppo that he was working to “collect as much information as possible” ahead of starting his new role.According to the lawsuit, Shi’s activity on his company MacBook raised red flags. He searched for phrases like “how to wipe out MacBook” and “Can somebody see if I’ve opened a file on a shared drive?” Apple says these searches were discovered during forensic checks of his devices.Shi, who worked as a sensor system architect, had access to sensitive Apple Watch projects including ECG sensor designs and future product roadmaps.

In a recent interview, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman talked about of the most pressing question surrounding artificial intelligence: its effect on employment. Suleyman however, dismissed the fears of widespread layoffs but emphasised on a deeper concern that people will not able to adapt to changes AI brought by AI. “My central worry is that many people will not be able to adapt fast enough to the changes brought by AI,” said Suleyman. The statement made by Suleyman talks about the growing discomfort among the tech leaders — not about machines replacing humans, but about the pace at which transformation is outstripping the ability of the society to keep up with the change.Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman, who leads Microsoft's consumer AI products, including Copilot suggest that the disruption AI may not be eliminating job, but reshaping them so fast that workers will struggle to get reskilled. From customer service to coding, AI is already on the path of altering the nature of work. He feels that ones that don’t have access to training or education may be left behind.Rather than some warning alarm, Mustafa Sulyeman’s comments calls for some preventive action. Governments, companies, and educators must collaborate to ensure that reskilling programs, digital literacy, and inclusive access to AI tools are prioritized. The goal: to empower people to thrive in an AI-enhanced economy, not just survive it.Recently, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman raised alarms about the growing psychological phenomenon which he calls ‘AI psychosis’. For those unaware, it is a condition where individuals start to lose touch with real life because of excessive interaction with artificial intelligence systems. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at a recent interview, Suleyman explained AI psychosis as a “real and emerging risk” which can easily affect vulnerable individuals who become deeply immersed in conversations with AI agents. The condition will mainly affect the individuals whose interactions blur the line between human and machine.As per Business Insider, Suleyman also has asked the tech industry to take this risk quite seriously and also help in implementing some ethical guardrails, which include:* Clear disclaimers about AI’s limitations* Monitoring for signs of unhealthy usage patterns* Collaboration with mental health professionals to study and mitigate risks","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has raised alarms about the growing psychological phenomenon which he calls ‘AI psychosis’ For those unaware, it is a condition where individuals start to lose touch with real life because of excessive interaction with artificial intelligence systems.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s younger brother, Kimbal Musk, has said that the world’s richest man ""deserves to be paid,"" amid an ongoing legal dispute over his brother’s compensation package. Elon Musk does not receive a salary or cash bonuses from Tesla, but is instead compensated through “performance awards” of costly stock options. In an interview with CNBC’s “Squawk Box”, Kimbal Musk said,Earlier this month, Tesla's board approved anpay package of 96 million shares for Elon Musk, currently valued at around $29 billion. The shares are set to vest over two years, provided he remains in a key executive role. The pay plan was approved by a special committee of the board, from which both Elon and Kimbal Musk recused themselves, the report added, citing board members Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson’s letter to shareholders.These ""performance awards"" came after a Delaware judge in December 2024 ordered Tesla to cancel Musk’s $56 billion pay package from 2018, which had been a record compensation plan for a public company executive in the US.

What Orange has to say about hacking incident



Realme P4 Pro: Gaming Performance Anyone?

Orange SA , one of the world’s leading telecom companies, has been hacked. According to a report, hackers have stolen and published about 4GB of sensitive business user data on the dark web. Orange first became aware of the breach in late July and reported it to national authorities. The data was published in early August, the report said.Citing sources familiar with the incident, Bloomberg reported that the attack, which used ransomware, was linked to a group known as Warlock. In mid-August, the hackers released approximately 4GB of data on the dark web.Warlock is a group that leases its ransomware to other criminal gangs. These groups use the malicious software to lock down a victim’s computer systems with encryption, demanding a ransom to restore access.A spokesperson for Orange confirmed to the publication that the stolen data was published but declined to comment on Warlock specifically or on any other companies potentially affected by the breach.“The threat actor had only limited access to our systems and was able to exfiltrate only outdated or low-sensitivity data,” the spokesperson said.“The affected companies were informed by Orange in advance of publication, and we have been working in full collaboration with them, as well as with the relevant authorities, since the beginning of this incident,” the spokesperson added.This is not the first security incident to hit the French telecom operator this year. In July, hackers accessed customer data from the company’s Belgian division in a separate attack, while another incident led to the publication of employee data from its Romanian division on the dark web.","Orange SA, one of the world’s leading telecom companies, has been hacked.

How the Chinese software developer carried out cyberattacks against his former employer



Realme P4 Pro: Gaming Performance Anyone?

A software developer named David Lu has been sentenced to four years in prison in the US for creating and deploying destructive computer code on the systems of his former employer, Eaton Corporation , a report claims. As per court documents, the 55-year-old, a Chinese citizen, carried out the cyberattacks in 2019 after his responsibilities at the power management company were reduced. Lu was convicted in March by a jury in the US District Court for the Northern District of Ohio for intentionally damaging Eaton's computers. The company, which is based in Beachwood, Ohio, has yet to share an official comment on the sentencing. Lu worked at Eaton, which develops power products for the aerospace, vehicle and electrical industries, as a software developer from 2007 to 2019.However, Peter Zeidenberg, the lawyer representing Lu, said that his client was disappointed with the jury’s verdict and continued to maintain his innocence. Mr. Zeidenberg added that he is currently “weighing his appeal options.” Meanwhile, in a news release, Matthew R. Galeotti, the acting assistant attorney general of the Justice Department’s criminal division, said that Lu misused his access to Eaton’s computer systems and technical expertise to disrupt its networks, causing the company losses amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars.According to a report by The New York Times (NYT), in August 2019, Lu introduced malicious code that caused servers to crash and blocked user logins. Some of the code included time delays, allowing him to trigger server crashes even when he was not at his laptop.The prosecutors claimed that the disruptions made servers unresponsive at unpredictable intervals, and the code was written in a way that suggested co-workers who had assumed some of his duties were responsible.Court documents state that as early as 2017, Lu also created code that deleted profile settings of random colleagues. One of his malware programs was called “Hakai,” the Japanese word for “destruction.”Prosecutors said Lu developed a “kill switch” designed to lock thousands of users out of Eaton’s software if his name was removed from the company directory. After his termination in September 2019, the code was activated, preventing employees from accessing company systems.Eaton’s internal investigation found losses of over $360,000 linked to Lu’s actions, and it reportedly took more than a year to clear the corrupted code fully. Prosecutors added that Lu named one program “IsDLEnabledinAD” and another “HunShui,” meaning “sleep” or “lethargy.” His search history showed efforts to escalate network privileges and delete files quickly. Before returning his company laptop, he erased encrypted data and ran a command to block recovery attempts.","David Lu, 55, has been sentenced to four years in prison in the US for creating and deploying destructive computer code on the systems of his former employer, Eaton Corporation.

What’s driving the warning

FOMO-fuelled investment: It seen lately that many venture capitalist and investors have been investing billions in AI startups. The investment is often driven by the fear of missing out in the next big thing.

Opaque partnerships: Some of the companies claims access to OpenAI’s technology data, but these claims are mostly difficult to verify and may be misleading.

High-stakes deception: In an environment where valuations can skyrocket based on perceived AI capabilities, even vague associations with OpenAI can be used to inflate credibility.

Why it matters



Check thoroughly if any firm claims to have ties with companies like OpenAI, Anthropic and more

Also always verify and crosscheck the licensing arrangements and capabilities.

Always watch for the red flags which include unverifiable demos, vague language or not disclosing the terms properly

Bubble trouble



Artificial intelligence is presently dominating the headlines and investor portfolios. With this rapid growth there also comes a warning. The industry insiders have now issued a warning for investors: “We urge you to be careful if you are contacted by a firm that purports to have access to OpenAI.” The warning comes as part of a broader crackdown on unauthorized investment vehicles, such as Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs), which are being used to give investors indirect exposure to the company. The warning was recently highlighted in a Business Insider report. The warning underscores the growing concern about misinformation and opportunism in the booming AI sector. In a recent blog post OpenAI highlighted that many firms are allegedly misrepresenting their relationship with the company to attract funding or clients.As reported by Business Insider, multiple factors lead to this investor warning.It is seen that OpenAI’s models such as GPT has led to the foundation of many AI apps. So, the genuine access to these tools can function as a game changer for many startups. But this gold rush also increases the risk of fraudulent claims, investor missteps and overhyped pitches.The warning serves as a reminder to:The Business Insider report also reveals that the AI sector may now be entering the bubble territory. With valuations soaring and competition for talent intensifying, some experts fear a repeat of past tech busts—where hype outpaced substance. As one investor put it, “Everyone wants in, but not everyone knows what they’re buying.”","Venture capitalist and investors have been investing billions in AI startups.

Future of digital IDs in Apple wallet

Apple has taken another step toward a wallet-free future by introducing digital driver’s licenses and state IDs directly into the Apple Wallet app. This feature, now live in 10 U.S. states and expanding further, allows iPhone and Apple Watch users to securely store their government-issued identification alongside credit cards, boarding passes, and transit tickets. Designed with multiple layers of verification, including facial recognition and DMV approval, Apple Wallet IDs provide both convenience and enhanced security. Whether at TSA checkpoints in select airports or in everyday identity checks, this innovation is transforming how Americans carry and use their identification.Apple’s digital ID system allows users to upload and store a secure version of their driver's license or state identification card directly in the Wallet app. Instead of carrying a physical card, individuals can present a verified digital version using Face ID or Touch ID authentication, ensuring both convenience and security.This feature is designed with airport security and business verification in mind. Currently, its use is primarily limited to domestic travel and select checkpoints, but Apple plans to expand its functionality in the near future. Future updates may also integrate with government services, retail purchases, and healthcare systems, further streamlining identity verification.According to Apple Wallet, as of August 2025, a total of 10 states and territories support Apple Wallet digital driver’s licenses:Apple has confirmed that at least seven more states have signed agreements to adopt the feature, including West Virginia, Connecticut, Kentucky, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Utah, and Illinois. Interestingly, Japan is the first country outside the US to confirm support, with its My Number Card system set to integrate with Apple Wallet.Adding a driver’s license or ID to Apple Wallet involves a multi-step security process:On your iPhone, open the Wallet app and tap the + button.Choose Driver’s License or State ID from the available options.Use your iPhone camera to scan the front and back of your license or state ID.Follow the on-screen prompts to take a selfie.Some states may require additional actions (like blinking or tilting your head).Your scanned ID and verification images are securely sent to your state’s DMV or issuing authority.The DMV verifies your identity. Processing time may vary by state.Once approved, your digital ID will be available in Wallet on both iPhone and Apple Watch.This layered process ensures that only verified identities are added to the Wallet, reducing the risk of fraud.Currently, Apple Wallet IDs are most commonly accepted at TSA checkpoints for domestic US flights. While a physical passport is still required for international travel, Apple has announced that iOS 26 will support US passports digitally, expanding future travel convenience.Digital IDs can also be used to prove age or identity at some businesses, though Apple has yet to release an official nationwide list.A growing number of US airports accept digital IDs, including:The list continues to expand as more TSA checkpoints adopt digital verification.Apple’s long-term goal is to make the Wallet app a complete replacement for physical wallets. By combining IDs, boarding passes, payment cards, and tickets into one secure ecosystem, Apple is paving the way for a future where carrying physical documents may no longer be necessary.With more states and even international governments adopting the feature, the digital driver’s license revolution is only beginning.","Apple’s digital ID system allows users to upload and store a secure version of their driver's license or state identification card directly in the Wallet app. This feature, now live in 10 U.S. states and expanding further, allows iPhone and Apple Watch users to securely store their government-issued identification alongside credit cards, boarding passes, and transit tickets.

Garman's AI stance evolved from earlier predictions about coding's future



Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman has delivered a sharp rebuke to companies replacing junior employees with artificial intelligence, calling it ""one of the dumbest things I've ever heard"" during a recent podcast appearance. The cloud computing executive warned that such strategies could devastate future talent pipelines while overlooking junior workers' superior AI adoption skills.Speaking on the ""Matthew Berman"" podcast Tuesday, Garman emphasised that entry-level employees represent the most cost-effective workforce segment and demonstrate the highest engagement with AI tools. ""They're probably the least expensive employees you have. They're the most leaned into your AI tools,"" he explained, questioning the long-term viability of AI-first hiring strategies.The AWS chief's comments directly challenge prevailing industry sentiment about AI's impact on entry-level positions. While tech leaders like OpenAI 's Sam Altman have suggested AI already functions like junior-level coworkers, and Google 's chief scientist Jeff Dean predicted AI will replicate junior software engineer skills within a year, Garman argues this perspective misses critical workforce dynamics.GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke echoed similar sentiments last month, noting that younger engineers bring fresh perspectives and embrace AI technology more readily than experienced professionals. ""They get it because they are taking this with an open mind. They don't have the 'This is how we've always done it,'"" Dohmke observed.Garman's current position represents a nuanced evolution from his earlier statements about AI's transformative potential. In a leaked June recording obtained by Business Insider, the AWS CEO predicted that most developers might stop coding within 24 months as AI handles routine programming tasks. However, his recent comments suggest companies should maintain junior talent while leveraging AI to enhance productivity rather than replace human workers.Goldman Sachs data supports concerns about AI's impact on young tech workers, showing unemployment rates for 20-30 year-olds in technology rising nearly 3 percentage points since early 2024. The investment bank estimates generative AI will eventually displace 6-7% of all US workers, making Garman's advice particularly relevant for technology companies navigating workforce transitions.","Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman says companies replacing junior employees with artificial intelligence is ""one of the dumbest things I've ever heard"" His comments challenge prevailing industry sentiment about AI's impact on entry- level positions.

Internal tensions and structural challenges



Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg ’s aggressive AI talent poaching has been the talk of the tech circles lately. Now it appears that the Meta CEO is embracing a new and radical strategy by placing his biggest AI bet on the smallest teams at his company. As reported by Business Insider, during the recent earnings call Zuckerberg described Meta’s new Superintelligence Labs as “a bit of a different setup,” which contrasts it with the company’s workforce which has more than 70,000 employees. At the heart of this new transformation is the TBD Lab. The lab is a secretive group which consists of elite AI researchers led by Alexandr Wang. This new lab has task of creating Meta’s most advanced AI models — what Zuckerberg calls “personal superintelligence.”“I’ve just gotten a little bit more convinced around the ability for small, talent-dense teams to be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research,” Zuckerberg said. Meta CEO feels that breakthroughs in the filed of AI are best achieved by small and compact groups which can hold the complete problem space ‘in their head’ rather than depending on the massive engineering teams like the ones that manage Facebook’s newsfeed.This philosophy mirrors a growing trend across Silicon Valley, where lean teams are seen as faster, more agile, and more innovative. Startups like Hightouch, which has raised over $132 million with just 55 engineers, exemplify the model. On the other hand, Nat Friedman, former GitHub CEO and now part of Meta’s AI product integration team, has championed the idea that most tech companies are “two to ten times overstaffed.”Meta’s pivot towards the ‘startup mode’ has created a bit of a friction within the company. As reported by Business Insider, the creation of Superintelligence Labs has led to resentment and resignation threats among legacy researchers, who have been sidelined after coming of the new hires.On the other hand, experts also suggest that small teams inside large companies often struggle to deliver transformational change. “They can produce useful products and efficiency gains,” said Elliott Parker, CEO of Alloy Partners, “but rarely the kind of fundamental shift that reshapes the parent company.”Lately, Meta has reorganised its AI division. The company has dissolved its two major AI units and is now dealing with the risk of overlap between micro teams.The Superintelligence LabsDespite the risks, Zuckerberg remains bullish. He sees small, elite teams as the key to staying competitive in the AI race, especially as breakthroughs like the 2017 “Attention Is All You Need” paper—authored by just eight researchers—continue to shape the field.“For the leading research on superintelligence,” Zuckerberg said, “you really want the smallest group that can hold the whole thing in their head.”", Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is placing his biggest AI bet on the smallest teams at his company.

What the deal with US government may mean for Intel

Days after asking Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to step down, Donald Trump has announced that the US government will buy a 10% stake in the company. The purchase, as per Reuters report, will be made under a deal that converts government grants into an equity share. As part of the agreement, the US government has agreed to buy a 9.9% stake in Intel for $8.9 billion. It will pay $20.47 per share, about $4 less than the chipmaker’s closing price of $24.80. The US will buy 433.3 million Intel shares using $5.7 billion from CHIPS Act grants and $3.2 billion from the Secure Enclave program.Once finalised, the deal will give the company about $10 billion to build and expand factories in the US.The Reuters report says that Trump met Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan on Friday, August 22. ""He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving us $10 billion for the United States. So we picked up $10 billion,"" Trump said.Tan, on the other hand, shared a more cautious note, saying “We are grateful for the confidence the president and the administration have placed in Intel.”Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced the deal via a post on X (formerly Twitter) calling it “fair to Intel and fair to the American People.”The US government’s stake in Intel will be passive, with no board seat and limited voting rights. The deal also includes a five-year option to buy another 5% if Intel loses control of its foundry unit.Analysts say the backing could help Intel recover its struggling foundry business and ease financial pressure. However, the company still lags behind Nvidia in AI and has lost ground to AMD in processors. With an $18.8 billion loss in 2024 and weak cash flow since 2021, new CEO Tan faces a tough turnaround challenge.The report quotes Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, saying Intel's problems are beyond a cash infusion from SoftBank or equity interest from the government, singling out Intel's contract chip manufacturing business, known as its foundry unit.""Without government support or another financially stronger partner, it will be difficult for the Intel foundry unit to raise enough capital to continue to build out more Fabs at a reasonable rate,"" he said. Intel ""needs to catch up with TSMC from a technological perspective to attract business,"" he added.","The US government has agreed to buy a 9.9% stake in Intel for $8.9 billion.

Demographic concerns highlighted by Elon Musk

On August 21, 2025, Elon Musk tweeted that artificial intelligence “is obviously gonna one-shot the human limbic system” and suggested that AI might actually raise birth rates by influencing the part of the brain responsible for emotions, which governs motivation, desire, and social behavior. He further added that AI could be intentionally designed to encourage this outcome, effectively shaping human instincts in ways that could impact population trends. Musk’s comments are notable because, while most public discussions about AI focus on jobs, ethics, or automation, his statement introduces a new dimension: the potential role of AI in addressing declining fertility rates and demographic challenges.Musk suggested that AI could interact with the human brain in a way that influences emotions and behavior, including social and reproductive decisions. Through his company xAI , he has developed AI companions that form emotional connections with users. While these companions can provide comfort, they have raised questions about their effect on real-world human relationships. Musk indicated that AI could potentially be designed to encourage procreation and family formation.Musk’s comments come as more people turn to AI chatbots, such as his own Grok, for emotional support. These interactions can feel comforting, but they do not always replace real-world human connections.In many developed nations, birth rates remain low due to economic pressures, high living costs, and other social factors. Musk’s tweet highlighted the potential for AI to influence these trends, suggesting that technology could play a role in addressing population decline, which has been a long-standing concern in countries like Japan, South Korea, and parts of Europe.Musk’s prediction has sparked conversations about the role of AI in society. Experts note that programming AI to influence human behavior at a population level is unprecedented and would depend on numerous social, cultural, and economic factors. His comments have drawn attention for their boldness and for focusing the AI debate on potential effects on family formation and fertility trends. Whether visionary or controversial, Musk’s idea pushes the boundaries of how humanity imagines AI shaping not just work or life—but the very future of human survival.","Musk suggested that AI could interact with the human brain in a way that influences emotions and behavior, including social and reproductive decisions.

Oracle’s bet on AI

Oracle founder Larry Ellison , who once mocked cloud computing as “complete gibberish,” is now the second-richest person on Earth, overtaking Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg . With a net worth of $288 billion, he is behind Elon Musk who has a net worth of $3379 billion, as per Bloomberg Billioniare Index. The reason: Oracle’s soaring success in cloud services, a business Ellison once ridiculed but that has since transformed the company and his fortune. In 2008, Ellison dismissed cloud computing as “complete gibberish.” But today, Oracle’s cloud infrastructure is fueling record growth thanks to the boom in artificial intelligence (AI) which has increased the demand for computing power and storage. Oracle has emerged as a key supplier for big companies like OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI.In June this year, Larry Ellison’s wealth jumped by more than $20 billion after Oracle’s stock surged 13% to $199.85 — its biggest one-day gain in a year. According to a Bloomberg report then, the rally came after the company forecast a 70% increase in cloud infrastructure sales for the current fiscal year.Long known for its databases, Oracle struggled for years to find its place in cloud computing. But under CEO Safra Catz, the company has made massive bets on AI-driven cloud services. Oracle recently launched Stargate, a joint venture with OpenAI to provide unprecedented computing power.“Oracle is on its way to becoming one of the world’s largest cloud infrastructure companies,” Catz said in a statement. She added that revenue growth in 2026 will be “dramatically higher.”Ellison told analysts about a historic order: “We recently got an order that said we’ll take all the capacity you have, wherever it is… we never got an order like that before.”To meet such demand, Oracle’s capital expenditure has soared. The company spent $21.2 billion in the last year and plans to raise that to $25 billion this year. Much of this will go into building mega data centers to support AI workloads.“The reason demand continues to outstrip supply is we can only build these data centers, build these computers, so fast,” Ellison explained.","Ellison once dismissed cloud computing as “complete gibberish” But today, Oracle’s cloud infrastructure is fueling record growth thanks to the boom in artificial intelligence (AI) The company spent $21.2 billion in the last year and plans to raise that to $25 billion this year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123467211,imgsize-17160,width-400,resizemode-4/Larry-Ellison.jpg"
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is making big change to its AI operations for which he has hired execs at $100 million-plus packages; read memo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-is-making-big-change-to-its-ai-operations-for-which-he-has-hired-execs-at-100-million-plus-packages-read-memo/articleshow/123465615.cms,"Four pillars of Meta’s new AI strategy

TBD Lab: This is a small elite unit that will majorly focus on training and scaling large models, including a mysterious “omni” model.

FAIR: It is a research arm of Meta and now it will take care of feeding innovations directly into model training.

Products & Applied Research: This team will be led by ex-GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. The team will work on integrating AI into Meta’s consumer offerings.

MSL Infra: This team will be headed by engineering veteran Aparna Ramani and it will work on building the infrastructure needed to support cutting-edge AI development.

FAIR and TBD: Meta’s innovation engine



Read Alexandr Wang's full memo here



Superintelligence is coming, and in order to take it seriously, we need to organize around the key areas that will be critical to reach it — research, product and infra. We are building a world-class organization around these areas, and have brought in some incredible leaders to drive the work forward.

As we previously announced, Shengjia Zhao will direct our research efforts as Chief Scientist for MSL, Nat Friedman will lead our product effort and Rob Fergus will continue to lead FAIR. Today, I'm pleased to announce that Aparna Ramani will be moving over to MSL to lead the infrastructure necessary to support our ambitious research and product bets.

As part of this, we are dissolving the AGI Foundations organization and moving the talent from that team into the right areas. Teams whose work naturally aligns with and serves our products will move to Nat's team. Some of the researchers will move to FAIR to double down on our long term research while teams working on infra will transition into Aparna's org. Anyone who is changing teams will get an update from their manager or HRBP today, if you haven't already.

We're making three key changes to our organizational design that will help us to accelerate our efforts.

Centralizing core, fundamental research efforts in TBD Lab and FAIR. Bolstering our product efforts with applied research that will work on product-focused models. Establishing a unified, core infrastructure team to support our research bets.

The work will map to four teams:

TBD Lab will be a small team focused on training and scaling large models to achieve superintelligence across pre-training, reasoning, and post-training, and explore new directions such as an omni model.

FAIR will be an innovation engine for MSL and we will aim to integrate and scale many of the research ideas and projects from FAIR into the larger model runs conducted by TBD Lab. Rob will continue to lead FAIR and Yann will continue to serve as Chief Scientist for FAIR, with both reporting to me.

Products & Applied Research will bring our product-focused research efforts closer to product development. This will include teams previously working on Assistant, Voice, Media, Trust, Embodiment and Developer pillars in AI Tech. Nat will continue to lead this work reporting to me.

MSL Infra team will unify elements of Infra and MSL's infrastructure teams into one. This team will focus on accelerating AI research and production by building advanced infrastructure, optimized GPU clusters, comprehensive environments, data infrastructure, and developer tools to support state-of-the-art research, products and AI development across Meta. Aparna will lead this team reporting to me.

Ahmad and Amir will continue reporting to me focusing on strategic MSL initiatives they will share more about later.

I recognize that org changes can be disruptive, but I truly believe that taking the time to get this structure right now will allow us to reach superintelligence with more velocity over the long term. We're still working through updated rhythms and our collaboration model across teams, including when we'll come together as a full MSL org.

Thank you all for your flexibility as we adapt to this new structure. Every team in MSL plays a critical role and I'm excited to get to work with all of you.

In a new and dramatic move, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is making the most aggressive move in his AI arm race. Zuckerberg is now reorganising the company’s artificial intelligence operations by restricting the Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL) into four distinct teams. As reported by Business Insider the company outlined the move in an internal memo from the newly appointed chief of AI Alexandr Wang. The restructuring is taking place after the aggressive hiring process in which Meta poached dozens of top AI researchers from its rivals companies. The internal email, sent by Alexandr Wang, the 28-year-old head of Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), outlines a dramatic restructuring aimed at accelerating Meta’s pursuit of “personal superintelligence”—AI that can outperform humans across intellectual domains.In the internal memo shared with employees, Wang talks about the four specialised teams:Most of these leaders now report directly to Wang, signaling a centralization of power within MSL.FAIR, led by Rob Fergus and chief scientist Yann LeCun will now play an important role in the development of MSL’s model. Whereas, TBD Lab will look for new directions, including the enigmatic “omni” model—believed to be a multimodal system capable of understanding text, audio, video, and more.The research wing at MSL will be headed by Shengjia Zhao, co-creator of ChatGPT, who notably does not report directly to Wang.","Alexandr Wang, head of Meta's Superintelligence Labs, outlines a dramatic restructuring at the company.

TikTok to lay off hundreds of content moderators in UK



President Donald Trump announced on Friday (August 22) that he has American buyers ready to acquire TikTok , and he is open to extending the deadline for its Chinese parent company, ByteDance , to sell the app’s US assets. Speaking to reporters, Trump stated he has no privacy or security concerns regarding the platform and has yet to discuss the matter with Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to news agency Reuters.The news comes as TikTok faces a separate challenge in the UK. The company is planning to lay off hundreds of staff in the region who are responsible for moderating content, BBC reported. This move, according to a company spokesperson, is part of a “reorganisation” to centralise its operations and increase its reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) for moderation. The spokesperson told the publication that the work would be relocated to other European offices.TikTok maintains that its investment in AI will “maximise effectiveness and speed,” noting that its automated systems, including AI, already remove 85% of content that violates its rules. The company says this shift also helps reduce how often human moderators are exposed to distressing content.The layoffs will affect the Trust and Safety team in London, as well as hundreds of other workers in the same department in various parts of Asia. TikTok stated that impacted employees would be given priority for other internal roles if they meet the minimum requirements.This decision has drawn criticism from the Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents the affected employees. CWU National Officer for Tech, John Chadfield, called the move an example of “corporate greed over the safety of workers and the public.” He added that the cuts were announced just as workers were preparing to vote on union recognition.Chadfield warned that TikTok staff have “long been sounding the alarm” about the risks of replacing human moderators with “immature AI alternatives.”","TikTok to lay off hundreds of content moderators in UK.

India leads global malware attack list as AI-driven ransomware escalates: Acronis report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/india-leads-global-malware-attack-list-as-ai-driven-ransomware-escalates-acronis-report/articleshow/123456423.cms,"AI fuels sophisticated cyber threats



Email and collaboration tools under fire



A call for proactive defense



India has emerged as the most-targeted country globally for malware attacks. According to the latest biannual report by cybersecurity firm Acronis, the rise in AI-powered ransomware and phishing threats in India accounts to 12.4% of all monitored endpoint attacks worldwide. The Acronis Threat Research Unit (TRU) discovered that artificial intelligence is being weaponised by cybercriminals to automate and scale attacks.As per the report, ransomware is the main top threat for large and mid-sized businesses. On the other hand, phishing incidents also witnessed a surge especially on collaboration platforms like Microsoft Teams and Slack, where attacks jumped from 9% to 30.5% in the first half of 2025.“AI is empowering threat actors to operate at scale and with higher precision,” said Rajesh Chhabra, General Manager for India and South Asia at Acronis. He stressed on the need for Indian enterprises to adopt AI-aware cybersecurity frameworks and shift from reactive to behaviour-based security models.The report also revealed a sharp increase in advanced email threats which includes spoofed and payload-less attacks which increased from 9% to 24.5%. These tactics are created to bypass traditional filters and exploit human error. This rise in cyberattacks also makes the need for employee education and adaptive security systems more critical than ever.The cybersecurity firm Acronis recommends the need for a multi-layered defense strategy which also includes a behaviour-based threat detection. The firm also suggests regular audits of third-party apps and a robust cloud and email security protocols . The firm also emphasised on the importance of ongoing training to combat social engineering and phishing techniques, which remain a major vulnerability across Indian enterprises.","India has emerged as the most-targeted country globally for malware attacks.

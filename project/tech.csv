"Elon Musk's lawsuit: In 4-page order, Judge tells Apple and OpenAI to shift their headquarters to Texas; says: Given the ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-lawsuit-in-4-page-order-judge-tells-apple-and-openai-to-shift-their-headquarters-to-texas-says-given-the-/articleshow/124698229.cms,"What Judge said to Apple and OpenAI on moving headquarters to Texas





A US Federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit filed by Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter) and his AI company xAI against tech giants Apple and OpenAI must remain in Fort Worth, Texas. In a sharply worded four-page order issued this week, US District Judge Mark Pittman sarcastically encouraged the companies to relocate their headquarters to Fort Worth, highlighting the questionable choice of venue.The lawsuit, filed in August, accuses Apple and OpenAI of engaging in an “anticompetitive scheme” to maintain monopolies in the artificial intelligence market. X and xAI, both owned by Musk, chose to file the case in the Fort Worth division of the U.S. Northern District of Texas, a court known for attracting plaintiffs seeking favorable rulings from its two Republican-appointed judges.Judge Pittman, appointed by President Donald Trump, took aim at this practice, known as forum-shopping. In a footnote, he directed the companies to the City of Fort Worth’s Business Services website “to get the process started” on relocating their headquarters. Pittman noted that the Fort Worth division’s docket is two to three times busier than that of the nearby Dallas division, which has more judges. He also pointed out that neither Apple nor OpenAI has significant ties to Fort Worth, beyond a few Apple retail stores.“And, of course, under that logic, there is not a district and division in the entire United States that would not be an appropriate venue for this lawsuit,” Pittman wrote, underscoring the tenuous connection to the chosen venue.The ruling marks another chapter in Elon Musk’s legal battles, with Twitter and his electric vehicle company Tesla having previously filed lawsuits in the same Fort Worth court. Pittman’s order reflects growing judicial scrutiny of strategic venue selection in high-profile cases. The lawsuit will proceed in Fort Worth, where the outcome could have significant implications for competition in the AI industry.""Given the present desire to have venue in Fort Worth, the numerous high-stakes lawsuits previously adjudicated in the Fort Worth Division, and the vitality of Fort Worth, the Court highly encourages the Parties to consider moving their headquarters to Fort Worth. Fort Worth has much more going for it than just the unique artwork on the fourth floor of its historic federal courthouse. Fort Worth has become one of the most vibrant and active cities and cultures in the United States in recent decades. One metric evincing this phenomenon is the significantly busier docket—two to three times busier—that the Forth Division manages compared to the Dallas Division. See Outsourcing Facilities Ass’n v. United States Food & Drug Admin., No. 4:24-cv-00953-P, 2025 WL 1782574, at *1 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 26, 2025). What’s more, the economic development taking place in Fort Worth has made it one of the most attractive locations for corporations and citizens in the country.1 See Cullen Donohue, Why Fort Worth Is the Next Big Player in DFW’s Office Market, D MAG. (Jan. 7, 2025, 11:00 a.m.), https://tinyurl.com/wvrw7y94 (“[Dallas] might need to look over its shoulder, because that city to the west is equally attractive and possesses an authenticity and gritty determination that is drawing attention from investors and executives alike.”) (“Fort Worth is the fastest-growing large city in the country … as of 2024.”).Stated another way, as the great Fort Worthian Amon Carter once asked the head of General Motors Corporation: Are you “going to continue carrying the meal in one end of the sack and the rock in the other merely because it has been a habit in the past? Or, will you go with the tide and move to Fort Worth, thereby taking advantage of the large investment you have here, and, at the same time, be closer to the territory in Texas which is showing the greatest growth and development?” BRIAN A. CERVANTEZ, AMON CARTER: A LONE STAR LIFE 187 (Univ. of Okla. Press 2019). Over 70 years later, Amon Carter’s observation of Fort Worth continues to hold true. Whether it be the 20th or the 21st century, Fort Worth “show[s] the greatest growth and development.” And even though the choice of venue in Fort Worth is an unexpected choice, the Court nonetheless will permit this case to proceed in “The Unexpected City.”","A US Federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit filed by Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter) and his AI company xAI must remain in Fort Worth, Texas.

China says: Found 'irrefutable evidence' of US hacking computers of its State agency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/china-says-found-irrefutable-evidence-of-us-hacking-computers-of-its-state-agency/articleshow/124694442.cms,"



China’s Ministry of State Security has announced that it has uncovered “irrefutable evidence” of cyberattacks by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) targeting the country’s National Time Service Center, a critical facility responsible for timekeeping. The allegations, detailed in a statement on the ministry’s official WeChat account, claim that the NSA has been exploiting vulnerabilities in employees’ mobile phones since March 25, 2022, to steal sensitive information.China’s national security authorities said that investigations showed that private servers all over the world were used to conceal the source of the attacks, the ministry said. According to the statement, Chinese cybersecurity authorities had found that most of the US attacks had occurred late at night or in the early hours of the morning, Beijing time. It said the NSA had used virtual servers located in the United States, Europe and Asia as “springboards” to conceal the origin of the attacks, along with strong encryption algorithms.According to the ministry, the NSA, the U.S.’s primary signals intelligence agency, has also used stolen login credentials to repeatedly hack into the center’s computers since April 18, 2023. The attacks, allegedly masked through private servers worldwide to conceal their origin.China’s Time Service Center, located in the northwestern city of Xi’an, is a vital national facility that provides high-precision service for the government, civil society and the various industries. It also provides highly precise timing services for the country’s communications, finance, power, transport, mapping and defence sectors.China’s national security authorities stated that they have implemented protective measures and preventive steps to secure the Time Service Center. The accusations come amid heightened U.S.-China tensions over trade and follow a series of claims by Western governments and companies accusing Chinese hackers of cyberattacks on their systems. Beijing’s latest allegations threaten to escalate the ongoing cyber rivalry between the two global powers.","China’s Ministry of State Security has announced that it has uncovered ‘irrefutable evidence’ of cyberattacks by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) The NSA is alleged to have targeted the country's National Time Service Center, a critical facility responsible for timekeeping.

A top US Army general, William “Hank” Taylor, commanding general of the Eighth Army in South Korea, revealed at the Association of the United States Army conference that he’s been using OpenAI's AI chatbot ChatGPT to refine his decision-making process. The announcement marks one of the most direct acknowledgments by a senior US military official of leveraging commercial AI tools for leadership tasks. Hank's remarks on ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI , were first reported by Business Insider.Speaking at a media roundtable earlier this week, Taylor described how he’s been exploring ChatGPT to enhance choices affecting thousands of troops under his command. “Chat and I have become really close lately,” he quipped, though he declined to share specifics about personal use. Instead, he emphasized using the tool to build analytical models and train his staff for more efficient decision-making, particularly in day-to-day leadership rather than combat scenarios. He added that he’s exploring how AI could support his decision-making processes — not in combat situations, but in managing day-to-day leadership tasks. Taylor said, adding that timely choices provide a critical advantage.Taylor, who also serves as chief of staff for the United Nations Command in South Korea, is part of a broader Pentagon push to integrate artificial intelligence across military operations. From logistics and surveillance to battlefield tactics, the US is racing to keep pace with rivals like China and Russia, who are also advancing AI capabilities. The Pentagon sees AI-driven systems as key to processing data faster and enabling precise targeting, with future conflicts potentially unfolding at “machine speed,” outpacing human decision-making.The US military has reportedly already tested AI in combat simulations, including a DARPA-Air Force experiment where an algorithm piloted an F-16 in a mock fight. Other applications include analyzing satellite data, tracking logistics, and reducing administrative burdens for field units. The US Army’s Special Operations Forces too are said to have adopted AI to lessen the “cognitive burden” by automating reports and intelligence analysis.However, Pentagon officials remain cautious. Generative AI systems risk leaking sensitive data or producing flawed outcomes if fed incomplete or manipulated information. Last year, former Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall warned that commanders slow to adapt to autonomous systems might not survive future battlefields, where response times are shrinking dramatically.","Hank Taylor, commanding general of the Eighth Army in South Korea, revealed he's been using OpenAI's AI chatbot ChatGPT to refine his decision-making process.

Dutch government takes over control of Nexperia Chinese unit



America ‘pressured’ Dutch government to take over Nexperia







Dutch chipmaker Nexperia has said that its employees in China still have access to company platforms and are receiving normal salaries, directly contradicting claims made by its China unit a day earlier. The company stated that any assertions about unpaid salaries are “factually incorrect and misleading.”“We are aware of a message circulated by individuals at Nexperia China falsely claiming that Nexperia and the Dutch government have abandoned the Chinese market and that the factory is now operating under a new entity,” news agency Reuters quoted Nexperia as saying.On Saturday (October 18), Nexperia’s China unit claimed it complies with Chinese law and has the right to operate independently. A notice posted on its official WeChat account said all employees continue working under the unit's instructions and may reject “external instructions” not approved by its Chinese legal representative.The notice stated that salaries and bonuses will be paid by Nexperia China, not Nexperia Netherlands.The dispute stems from actions taken by the Dutch government, which took control of Nexperia on September 30 and removed its Chinese CEO, Zhang Xuezheng.The Dutch government cited concerns about possible technology transfer to Wingtech, Nexperia's Chinese parent company. Nexperia manufactures chips for automakers and consumer electronics.Days after the Dutch takeover, China's commerce ministry blocked Nexperia from exporting chips on October 4. Nexperia said the situation arose from “unauthorised actions” by its former CEO Zhang Xuezheng, who has been formally suspended by court order and no longer has authority to represent the company.“Nexperia has reported Zhang's actions to Dutch authorities and said it remains committed to employees and customers in China,” according to the company statement.The company's largest manufacturing site is in Hamburg, Germany, but more than 70% of Nexperia's chips are shipped to China to be packaged in Dongguan, a manufacturing hub in Guangdong province.The Dutch government’s step of seizing control of the Chinese-owned chip company Nexperia was followed by pressure from Washington, a report said. While the Dutch government formally cited “serious governance shortcomings” as the reason for the action, court documents published last week revealed a more direct catalyst: American officials had warned the Dutch government that Nexperia's CEO, Zhang Xuezheng, would likely need to be replaced for the company to be removed from the US ""entity list,"" which imposes strict export restrictions.","Dutch chipmaker Nexperia says its employees in China still have access to company platforms and are receiving normal salaries.

Bezos said ‘Go work at McDonald’s.’ As reported by Fortune, in a recent interview, Bezos stressed on the importance of early work experience especially in the fast-paced, customer-facing environment. “I always advise young people: Go work at McDonald’s,” Bezos said. “You learn responsibility. You learn how to show up. You learn how to deal with people. You learn how to hustle.”For those unaware, Bezos started Amazon out of his garage in 1994. He believes that entry-level jobs such as those at McDonald’s tech foundational skills which are important for long term success. He emphasised that such small roles are necessary as they instill skill like discipline, resilience and the ability to handle pressure.

This follows a significant strategic partnership with OpenAI to develop custom AI accelerators, signaling a focus on its high-margin chip design business amidst broader restructuring after the VMware acquisition.

Restructuring continues after VMware acquisition

Custom chip business drives growth despite cuts









Chip giant Broadcom laid off employees this week in sales, customer success, account management, and solutions roles, according to LinkedIn posts and sources cited by Business Insider. The cuts come just days after the $1.65 trillion company announced a strategic partnership with OpenAI to deploy 10 gigawatts of custom AI accelerators.The layoffs affected an undisclosed number of workers, with the reductions appearing to target customer-facing departments rather than technical roles. Broadcom did not respond to requests for comment on the workforce reductions.The timing of the cuts follows Broadcom's October 13 announcement of its collaboration with OpenAI, which will see the chip designer develop and deploy custom AI processors starting in the second half of 2026. The deal, which positions Broadcom alongside cloud computing giants developing specialized AI chips, sent the company's shares soaring more than 10%.Broadcom has been implementing rolling layoffs since its $69 billion acquisition of software firm VMware in late 2023. Business Insider previously reported that VMware's workforce has been slashed by roughly half since the deal closed, as Broadcom simultaneously raised prices on VMware products.The company has emerged as a major winner in the AI boom, with custom AI chip revenue growing 220% year-over-year by late 2024. Broadcom reached a trillion-dollar market cap for the first time in December 2024, driven by surging demand from tech giants seeking alternatives to Nvidia's dominant AI processors.The OpenAI partnership represents Broadcom's fourth major custom chip customer, following deals with tech giants including Google , Amazon, and Apple. Morgan Stanley analysts forecast the custom AI chip market will nearly double to $22 billion in 2026, with Broadcom positioned as the market leader.While Broadcom expands its high-margin chip design business, the layoffs suggest the company is streamlining operations in other areas to maintain profitability as it scales production for next-generation AI infrastructure.","Broadcom laid off employees this week in sales, customer success, account management, and solutions roles.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has once again issued a stark health warning. Gates emphasise that despite the monumental progress in the fight against polio, the world remains vulnerable until the disease is completely eradicated. Speaking at the Gates Foundation’s Goalkeepers event, Bates stressed on the fact that a critical funding shortfall could jeopardise decades of global health gains. “We’re closer than ever to total polio eradication,” Gates said. “But the last mile is proving the hardest because viruses exploit any immunity gaps.”Since 1988, global polio cases have by 99.9%, and Africa has been certified free of wild poliovirus. However, the Type 1 transmission still persists in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and variant outbreaks—caused by mutated vaccine strains in under-immunized communities—continue to surface in countries like the U.S. and U.K.Gates also praised the deployment of nearly two billion doses of the new nOPV2 vaccine and the expansion of rapid detection labs in Africa, which give health workers a crucial head start in containing outbreaks.Gates also voiced his opinion over the declining global health aid, which has dropped by 21% since 2024. I am not capable of making up what the government cuts,” he said, urging renewed commitments from world leaders.These efforts mirror the Gates Foundation’s HIV prevention model, which works with manufacturers to deliver affordable treatments to underserved populations.Gates’ message is quite clear, the fight against polio is not over and complacency could reverse hard-won victories. “No place is risk-free until the world-free until the world is polio-free,” said Gates.

For centuries, farming has been about planting seeds and hoping nature cooperates. Farmers relied on experience, seasonal patterns, and luck to get their harvests. But times have changed. Climate change is causing unpredictable weather, the world’s population is growing fast (set to reach 9.8 billion by 2050), and resources like water and fertile land are shrinking. Old ways of reacting to problems after they appear like droughts or pests are no longer enough. Farmers now need tools to predict and prevent problems. That’s where artificial intelligence (AI) comes in.Reactive farming means spotting problems only after damage is visible, such as in the case of yellowing crops or pest attacks. By then, yields may already be down by 20% or more. Farmers often end up using too much fertilizer or pesticide, wasting money and harming the environment. Agriculture already uses 70% of the world’s freshwater, much of it inefficiently. Furthermore, bigger challenges like unstable markets, disrupted supply chains, and climate change make things even harder. Farming reactively is like driving while only looking in the rearview mirror you’re always behind.There are several ways in which AI helps farmers look ahead instead of behind. The technology turns data from fragmented streams like satellites, sensors, and past records into predictions and recommendations. Farm-specific forecasts let farmers adjust planting or irrigation before problems strike. At the same time, automated cameras and drones spot early signs of issues, enabling quick, targeted action and reducing chemical use. When it comes to soil health, AI-enabled sensors can track nutrients and moisture in real-time, so fertilizers and water are used only where needed. On the business front, AI can predict harvest sizes and even price trends, helping farmers plan better and earn more. So, the real power of AI is in connecting everything - weather, soil, crops, and markets - so that farmers can act before problems grow.The use of AI in farming is no longer optional. There is a multitude of reasons why. For starters, the rapid climate change threatens to lop more than 11% off of global crop yields by century’s end if left unchecked. With arable land and freshwater reserves contracting, the need for resource-efficient cultivation is more urgent today than it ever was. Then there is the fragile state of global food security. As millions across the globe go hungry, AI emerges as a ray of hope through its promise of a steady, sustainable supply. Apart from this, rural labor shortages - whether due to aging farmer populations or due to urban migration - demand autonomous equipment capable of maintaining productivity.Far from being merely an abstract promise, AI is already transforming the face of modern farming across 6 continents. Small farmers in India and sub-Saharan Africa are benefitting from smartphone alerts that overlay localized weather data with pest-risk indices, a service credited with 20-30% yield lifts in staple crops. In North America and Western Europe, companies like John Deere have developed autonomous tractors and drones that apply fertilizers and herbicides only where needed, cutting costs and reducing environmental impact. In Latin America, AI systems are helping coffee and sugarcane farmers predict when beans will ripen, improving both quality and profits. In vertical farms - right from Singapore to the Netherlands - closed-loop AI control systems are helping modulate light spectra, temperature, and nutrient dosing, resulting in yields up to 400 times greater per acre than traditional farming. All these use cases are perfect examples of AI’s scalability - from micro-plots to mega-operations.Just like any new piece of technology, AI adoption too comes with its own set of challenges. The capital outlay for drones, multispectral cameras, and robotics remains an expensive affair for many small farmers who collectively produce a substantial share of the world’s food supply. At the same time, connectivity gaps in rural areas hinder real-time data transfer, which curtails the functionality of cloud-based analytics. Then there is the challenge of digital literacy - seasoned farmers may distrust algorithms and dashboard outputs that they don’t have a proper understanding of. Data ownership adds to the existing complications, as farmers worry about who controls the information collected from their fields without strong governance frameworks in place. Addressing these barriers requires affordable technologies, government subsidies, open-source tools, and farmer-friendly education programs.For AI to truly transform farming, it must be accessible, sustainable, and ethical. We can work on combining AI insights with farmers’ own experience instead of replacing it, and making tools available in local languages through mobile apps and low-cost sensors. Data sharing between governments, universities, and companies can help improve accuracy. There is also a need to build AI systems that promote regenerative practices like crop rotation and soil restoration, along with ensuring fair access and strong data privacy protections for farmers. However, if done right, AI can help create a future where farms are not only more productive but also more environmentally friendly and resilient.Agriculture is at a crossroads. Continuing with reactive methods will mean lower yields, more hunger, and damaged ecosystems. But embracing AI’s predictive power offers a different future one where farmers prevent problems before they happen, grow food more efficiently, and protect the planet at the same time.The modern farmer, equipped with AI insights, won’t just wait for crises; they’ll avoid them altogether. And predictive agriculture is not a luxury anymore; it’s essential for survival. The shift has already begun, and now it’s time to ensure every farmer, big or small, can be part of it.","Reactive farming means spotting problems only after damage is visible.

Benioff's remarks, which indicated he would welcome troops, were published in The New York Times (NYT) last week, coinciding with the company's annual Dreamforce conference held in downtown San Francisco this week. The comments drew criticism after the Trump administration recently deployed the National Guard to cities like Portland, Oregon, and Chicago. Those deployments sparked protests and lawsuits and resulted in citizens and immigrants being detained without legal representation.In a post shared on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Benioff wrote:In a recent interview with the NYT, Benioff said:Benioff’s remarks drew criticism from local leaders and politicians. This week, California Governor Gavin Newsom and San Francisco officials released statements to emphasise that federal troops were not needed in the city and that crime rates were declining.Startup investor Ron Conway, who has supported companies such as Google, Airbnb, and Stripe, resigned from the Salesforce Foundation board this week.

Building a brand, not just a product







Nothing CEO Carl Pei feels that his company has found a strategic entry point into a market long dominated by tech giants Apple and Samsung: Gen Z. As reported by Business Insider, in a recent appearance on Alex Heath’s Access podcast, Pei explained that Nothing is intentionally targeting younger consumer who crave individually and innovation in their tech choices. “Our users are very young,” Pei said. “It’s pretty much impossible to be popular among everybody in the world at the very beginning, so we got to pick a lane.”As per the report, Pei revealed that the average Nothing user is just 26 years old as compared to Samsung’s average user age of 45. While Apple still commands brand loyalty among 18–44-year-olds, Pei argued that Gen Z doesn’t share the same emotional connection to Apple’s rise, making them more open to alternatives.Nothing’s phones—like the Phone 2 and Phone 3—are priced between $300 and $700 and feature a transparent back design that exposes internal components, offering a distinct aesthetic. Business Insider’s review of the Phone 2 praised its “striking” look and “surprisingly good camera,” despite using a slightly older processor.Nothing was founded five years ago and it employs around 900 people and is on track to hit $1 billion in sales this year.Pei also stressed on the fact that the company is not trying to outpace Apple overnight, but it is focused on coexisting and exploring “new form factors” that complement—not compete with—Apple’s ecosystem.In addition to smartphones , Nothing has expanded into watches, headphones, and even apparel, positioning itself as a lifestyle brand for a generation that values design, transparency, and tech with personality. As Pei put it, Gen Z wants to “be different”—and Nothing is betting that difference will be its edge.","Nothing CEO Carl Pei feels that his company has found a strategic entry point into a market long dominated by tech giants Apple and Samsung.

“AWS remains the top choice for startups to build because we offer the best core services as well as the most innovative and powerful generative AI offerings. Early stage startups experiment with many services and technologies, but when it comes time to choose the provider they trust with the future of their organizations, they overwhelmingly choose AWS. In fact, we're seeing growth in adoption of AWS as startups are looking to our depth and breadth of services.”





Amazon Web Services has identified ashift in startup spending patterns. According to internal documents obtained by Business Insider (BI), cloud service providers say companies are delaying cloud adoption to allocate more resources to artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Startups are redirecting funds from traditional AWS cloud services toward AI models, inference capabilities, and AI developer tools. The documents indicate these companies are distributing costs across newer AI technologies that offer greater flexibility for switching between providers.

China accused Taiwan of cyber attacks







China has accused the US National Security Agency (NSA) of carrying out an extended cyberattack operation targeting the country's National Time Service Center – a research institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences responsible for generating, maintaining and broadcasting China's standard time.China’s State Security Ministry issued a statement on its WeChat account on Sunday (October 19), warning that serious breaches could have jeopardised communication networks, financial systems, power supply, and the international standard time, news agency Reuters reported.The ministry reportedly stated that its investigation uncovered evidence tracing stolen data and credentials as far back as 2022. According to the ministry, the US intelligence agency initially “exploited a vulnerability” in the messaging service of an unnamed foreign smartphone brand to gain access to staff members' mobile devices and network systems at the center.The ministry’s investigation also claims that the US launched attacks on the centre's internal network systems in 2023 and 2024, and simultaneously attempted to attack the high-precision ground-based timing system.The latest accusations come amid heightened tensions between China and the US over trade, including China’s expanded rare earths export controls and the US threat to raise tariffs on Chinese goods.The US embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the accusations.Recently, China claimed that Taiwan had attacked the country with cyber operations. China offered a bounty for 18 people it said were Taiwanese military psychological operations officers spreading “separatist” messages.Meanwhile, Taiwan claimed that it detected more than 10,000 “abnormal” social media accounts, including many on Facebook, which have helped disseminate more than 1.5 million messages that the bureau deemed as disinformation.","China has accused the US National Security Agency of carrying out an extended cyberattack operation targeting the country's National Time Service Center.

Most companies still aren't seeing returns, says BCG AI Ethics Officer

Government adoption accelerating rapidly







Boston Consulting Group's Global Chief AI Ethics Officer Steven Mills says the key to unlocking AI's workplace potential lies in hands-on employee training—something most companies are failing to provide. Speaking at Semafor's World Economic Summit, Mills told Business Insider that employees want about five hours of hands-on training, coaching, and mentoring. However, only about a third of workers are actually receiving that level of instruction.The real transformation begins once employees experience AI's practical benefits firsthand, Mills explained. When workers use AI for simple tasks like editing email bullet points and see positive results, they immediately start thinking about broader applications, creating what he calls a ""virtuous cycle.""This training gap may help explain why BCG's recent research shows only 5% of companies are deriving meaningful value from AI investments. The September report, based on data from over 1,250 global firms, found that 60% of companies have seen minimal increases in revenue and cost savings despite substantial AI investments, Business Insider reported.Mills emphasised that organisations need to ""reimagine the art of the possible"" rather than treating AI as just another tool.""A big thing that organizations are not doing is stepping back and saying, 'How do we really reimagine our business processes, our service offerings, now that we have AI?'"" he said.Mills, who also leads BCG's Center for Digital Government, noted that public sector AI adoption is accelerating faster than expected. Major AI companies including OpenAI , Anthropic, Meta, Google, and Microsoft have offered their AI agents to federal agencies at minimal cost.""I think you'll see a big hockey stick in terms of rate of adoption here soon,"" Mills predicted, adding that people who use AI technology in their private lives naturally want access at work as well.The message is clear: companies that invest in proper employee training and reimagine their processes—rather than simply plugging AI into existing workflows—will be the ones capturing real value from their AI investments.","Most companies still aren't seeing returns, says BCG AI Ethics Officer Steven Mills.

How much salary will the company pay





What Mark Zuckerberg looks for in a candidate









Facebook-parent company Meta is reportedly recruiting recent college graduates for entry-level tech positions. The company is also said to be offering competitive salaries despite a challenging job market for new workers. The technology giant has openings for full-stack software engineers and product software engineer roles. The tech giant is looking to fill entry-level roles as they are hard to find as companies are reducing available jobs due to AI. These positions don't require years of experience—just a bachelor's degree in computer science, computer engineering or applied sciences.For most positions, candidates should have completed at least one of the following during college or after graduation: a relevant university course, internship, thesis, or 12 months of work experience in languages like PHP, Hack, C++, or Python; experience with React; or work with large-scale storage systems.For iOS software engineer positions specifically, applicants need one year of experience with object-oriented programming, multithreading, and Linux or Unix systems.According to a report by Fortune, these roles pay between $176,000 and $290,000 annually. Meta also offers bonuses, stock equity, and health benefits. All positions are in-person only. Remote work is not an option. Jobs are based in Meta's Washington or California offices.The hiring is notable because entry-level positions have become harder to find. Many companies are hesitant to hire recent graduates, and automation continues to reduce available jobs. Meta’s move to actively recruit and pay well for new talent stands out in this environment.Mark Zuckerberg , who is a Harvard dropout, has previously revealed that skills significantly outweigh a traditional college degree in his approach to talent acquisition. While it should be noted that many entry-level Meta roles still require a bachelor's degree, Zuckerberg focuses on job candidates who have mastered a specific skill and demonstrated the ability to apply it across various business areas.“If people have shown that they can go deep and do one thing really well, then they’ve probably gained experience in the art of learning something and taking it to an excellent level, which is generally pretty applicable to other things,” Zuckerberg told Bloomberg last year.In this view, what a person studied in school is less important than their proven ability to innovate and execute.","Facebook-parent company Meta is reportedly recruiting recent college graduates for entry-level tech positions.

Meta and WhatsApp response







A US court has ordered Israel's NSO Group that makes Pegasus spyware to permanently stop attempting to break into Meta-owned WhatsApp messaging service, a ruling the spyware company warned could threaten its business viability. US District Court Judge Phyllis Hamilton issued a 25-page ruling this week imposing a permanent injunction against NSO's efforts to target WhatsApp, one of the world's most widely used communication platforms.Hamilton also significantly reduced the punitive damages NSO owes Meta, cutting the award from approximately $167 million to $4 million. Despite this financial relief, the injunction remains in place, news agency Reuters reported.The ruling presents a major challenge to NSO, which has for years faced accusations of facilitating human rights abuses through its flagship hacking tool, Pegasus. The spyware exploits vulnerabilities in commonly used software, with WhatsApp being one of its primary targets.NSO had previously argued that an injunction preventing attacks on WhatsApp would “put NSO's entire enterprise at risk” and “force NSO out of business.”The court rejected these arguments and issued the permanent injunction anyway.Meta executives welcomed the decision. WhatsApp chief Will Cathcart said on X, “Today's ruling bans spyware maker NSO from ever targeting WhatsApp and our global users again. We applaud this decision that comes after six years of litigation to hold NSO accountable for targeting members of civil society.”NSO said it welcomed the 97% reduction in punitive damages and stated that the injunction does not apply to NSO's customers, “who will continue using the company's technology to help protect public safety.” The company said it would review the decision and ""determine its next steps accordingly.”NSO has consistently maintained that its products combat serious crime and terrorism. NSO was recently purchased by a group led by Hollywood producer Robert Simonds, according to tech publication TechCrunch.","A US court has ordered Israel's NSO Group to stop attempting to break into Meta- owned WhatsApp messaging service.

“People who otherwise would be limited to only being novelists or people who do graphic novels but are creative geniuses are going to be able to actually make full movies with AI. I think that's a reason for profound optimism. I think we're going to get completely new kinds of film and entertainment from people who otherwise never would have been able to access the medium.

How other parts of the entertainment industry are adapting to AI





“Some voices in the tech industry believe copyright should be abolished. We don't. Musicians' rights matter. Copyright is essential. If the music industry doesn't lead in this moment, AI-powered innovation will happen elsewhere, without rights, consent, or compensation.”





Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, has shared his views on the future of filmmaking. As a film enthusiast, he believes that advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) will soon change how films are made. Andreessen has claimed that creators without traditional visual skills or large budgets can also make films using AI tools. Speaking on an episode of A16z’s (a company that he co-founded) podcast “Monitoring the Situation”, Andreessen said that new AI tools, like the ones being developed by OpenAI , will enable a different type of filmmaker to emerge. He believes that AI will remove barriers like costly equipment and technical expertise, allowing people with creative skills to make films.Describing future filmmakers, Andreessen said:will be able to make films using AI.he added.Andreessen explained.This comes after A16z announced that it had invested in Promise, a studio that uses AI to produce films and other creative projects, last year. While some see AI as a way to lower costs and finish work faster, others fear it could lead to job losses. There are also concerns about copyright issues in how AI models are trained and how they use existing intellectual property.Beyond filmmaking, other parts of the entertainment industry are also dealing with how AI affects creative professionals.

Microsoft may become one of the biggest customers of these new Intel chips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-may-become-one-of-the-biggest-customers-of-these-new-intel-chips/articleshow/124678084.cms,"Representative Image





Microsoft is reportedly showing significant interest in using AI chips made with Intel's new 18A manufacturing process. If the rumours are true, this could make the software giant a key customer for the AI chips manufactured using the US-based chipmakers' newly announced process. The 18A process is an advanced manufacturing technique used for making semiconductors, including AI chips. A new report claims that Microsoft is even moving toward integrating the technology. This also suggests that major tech companies are reacting positively to Intel’s new node. While interest in external adoption may be growing, it is important to note that Intel's 18A process was initially developed primarily for internal use on products like Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest. Intel itself is reportedly relying on its 14A process to capture broader market attention.What Microsoft has already said about Intel’s 18A processA report by SemiAccurate cited past observations to suggest that Microsoft is emerging as a key 18A customer, with node sampling ongoing since Pat Gelsinger was Intel’s CEO.The report claims that Microsoft plans to use this chip process for its upcoming Maia 2 AI accelerators, which may include both 18A and 18A-P variants, depending on how the company designs its AI chips.It also mentions that other clients are expected to adopt the process, though Microsoft appears to be a strong contender among Intel’s foundry customers.Earlier, while commenting on Intel’s 18A process, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said: “We are in the midst of a very exciting platform shift that will fundamentally transform productivity for every individual organisation and the entire industry. To achieve this vision, we need a reliable supply of the most advanced, high-performance and high-quality semiconductors. That is why we are so excited to work with Intel Foundry, and why we have chosen a chip design that we plan to produce on Intel 18A process. ”Apart from Microsoft, several other names have been linked to Intel’s 18A platform over time, based on earlier reports and trends. However, none of the deals have been confirmed yet.The report claims Broadcom may have tested 18A design kits but reportedly backed out due to unsatisfactory yield rates. However, with recent improvements that have reduced defect density, Broadcom and others may revisit the idea of working with Intel Foundry Services.How customers respond to the 18A process will be important, since wider adoption could help Intel expand its production capacity and set the stage for the more advanced 14A node.","Microsoft is reportedly showing significant interest in using Intel's new 18A manufacturing process.

Google’s New AI Is BANANAS: How To Use Gemini Nano Banana

Nano Banana coming to Google Search, NotebookLM and Photos.





Google’s 'Nano Banana' image editing AI tool, celebrated for its ability to maintain likeness in AI-generated images, has been making quite waves. Following its successful integration into Google Search’s AI Mode and Google Lens, Google is now reportedly embedding Nano Banana into Google Messages. Android Authority recently spotted that Google Messages version 20251009 contains code referencing Nano Banana functionality. It also reported Google’s efforts to incorporate Nano Banana into Google Photos, suggesting the tech giant aims to weave this feature across its entire app ecosystem. In Google Messages, enabling the feature unveils a Banana icon in the header when users long-press an image in personal or group chats, hinting at seamless AI image editing within conversations.Addition of Nano Banana to Google Messages appears to be a move that is more than a playful addition -- it is seen as a calculated strike in the escalating AI messaging war. Unlike Meta’s “Imagine” AI, which emphasizes creating images from text prompts in WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, Nano Banana’s focus in Messages centers on editing existing images. Android users may be able to apply filters, clean up photos, or create memes effortlessly, using Nano Banana’s superior likeness retention.Google’s rival, Meta, has been integrating its ""Imagine"" AI image generator into WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, allowing users to create custom images from text prompts directly in chats. However, Meta’s tool has faced criticism for inconsistent likeness retention. Google’s Nano Banana, with its superior ability to preserve accurate likeness in generated images, could redefine the user experience by enabling personalized reaction memes that truly resemble their subjects.As Google continues to roll out Nano Banana across its platforms, the company is positioning itself to outpace competitors in delivering cohesive, AI-enhanced user experiences. If successful, Nano Banana could set a new standard for AI-driven creativity in messaging apps, leaving Meta scrambling to catch up.In August, Google introduced its latest image editing model, Nano Banana from Gemini 2.5 Flash.

WhatsApp changes its terms; starting January 15 has banned ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/whatsapp-changes-its-terms-starting-january-15-has-banned-/articleshow/124677156.cms,"The WhatsApp Scam That Gives Hackers Your Phone!

What are WhatsApp's new terms

Providers and developers of artificial intelligence or machine learning technologies, including but not limited to large language models, generative artificial intelligence platforms, general-purpose artificial intelligence assistants, or similar technologies as determined by Meta in its sole discretion (“AI Providers”), are strictly prohibited from accessing or using the WhatsApp Business Solution, whether directly or indirectly, for the purposes of providing, delivering, offering, selling, or otherwise making available such technologies when such technologies are the primary (rather than incidental or ancillary) functionality being made available for use, as determined by Meta in its sole discretion.

What Meta-owned WhatsApp said on new terms





WhatsApp, owned by Meta, has updated its Business API policy to prohibit general-purpose chatbots, a move that will impact AI assistants from companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, Khosla Ventures-backed Luzia, and General Catalyst-backed Poke. The new terms, effective January 15, 2026, explicitly ban AI providers from using the WhatsApp Business Solution to distribute AI technologies, such as large language models and generative AI assistants, when these are the primary functionality.The policy change, confirmed by Meta to TechCrunch, aims to refocus the WhatsApp Business API on its intended purpose: enabling businesses to provide customer support and send relevant updates. A new section in the API terms targets “AI Providers,” stating that they are “strictly prohibited” from using the platform to offer general-purpose AI assistants, as determined by Meta’s discretion. However, businesses using AI for customer service, such as a travel company’s support bot, remain unaffected.Meta explained that the rise in general-purpose chatbots has strained its systems with increased message volumes and required support the platform wasn’t designed to handle. “The WhatsApp Business API is built for businesses serving customers, not for chatbot distribution,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. “Our focus is on supporting tens of thousands of businesses building these experiences on WhatsApp. ”The decision effectively positions Meta AI as the sole AI assistant on WhatsApp, barring competitors from leveraging the platform to distribute their AI solutions.","WhatsApp, owned by Meta, has updated its Business API policy to prohibit general-purpose chatbots.

Internal documents suggest Salesforce offered AI services to expand Donald Trump's immigration crackdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/internal-documents-suggest-salesforce-offered-ai-services-to-expand-donald-trumps-immigration-crackdown/articleshow/124668433.cms,"5-page memo details how Salesforce AI can help ICE



What Salesforce has to say







Internal company documents and communications obtained by The New York Times indicate that Salesforce actively pitched the use of its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), aiming to assist the agency in staffing up for expanded immigration raids and deportations across the country. This development follows public controversy generated by Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who recently stated he ""fully supports"" President Donald Trump and desires the deployment of National Guard troops in San Francisco.Benioff's public alignment with the Trump administration on law enforcement matters stands in sharp contrast to the city's Democrat politics and his own reputation as a benefactor of progressive causes, the report noted, adding that the internal documents suggest Benioff’s support extended into offering the company's technology to aid the administration's immigration efforts.The internal materials, which the publication says was provided by an individual who cannot be named, included a five-page memo sent on August 26. This memo explained how Salesforce was uniquely suited to assist ICE with ""talent acquisition"" to help the agency achieve its goal of ""nearly tripl[ing] its work force by hiring 10,000 new officers and agents expeditiously.""Other documents included a spreadsheet of ICE “opportunities,” the company’s term for potential contracts, and an internal brainstorming slide deck suggesting how AI agents could help ICE evaluate information sent to the agency’s tip line and improve investigations.The company was responding to an ICE request for firms to explain how they could help hire more agents and was hoping to land a paid contract.San Francisco leaders, already outraged by Benioff's comments on the National Guard, were further upset upon learning that the homegrown tech company was actively pursuing contracts to aid the administration's immigration crackdown.In a statement, the company noted that it has served the US government across multiple administrations and that all customers are bound by company policies requiring responsible product use. Salesforce has also contracted with ICE under the Obama and Biden administrations.Salesforce is not alone; other tech companies, including Palantir, Microsoft, and IBM, also hold contracts with ICE to support its enforcement efforts under President Trump.","Internal company documents and communications obtained by The New York Times indicate that Salesforce actively pitched the use of its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Meta will allow parents to disable teens' private chats with flirty AI chatbots,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-will-allow-parents-to-disable-teens-private-chats-with-flirty-ai-chatbots/articleshow/124668245.cms,"What are the new parental controls and AI limits

Parents will also be able to see broad topics their teens discuss with chatbots and Meta's AI assistant, without being forced to turn off all AI access entirely. Specific character blocking: The tools will also enable parents to block specific AI characters from interacting with their teen.





Meta has announced that it will introduce new controls allowing parents to disable their teenagers' private, one-on-one chats with AI characters. This is the latest measure aimed at making its social media platforms safer for minors, following fierce criticism regarding the behaviour of its chatbots. The new supervision tools are slated to debut on Instagram early next year in the US, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, according to a blog post detailed by Instagram head Adam Mosseri and Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang.The move comes after news agency Reuters reported in August on how Meta's AI rules had permitted provocative conversations with minors, prompting stepped-up scrutiny of AI companies by US regulators over the potential negative impacts of chatbots.The new controls offer flexibility for families:Meta confirmed that its general AI assistant will remain available with age-appropriate defaults even if parents disable the private chats with specific AI characters. The company reiterated that its AI characters are designed not to engage in age-inappropriate discussions about self-harm, suicide or disordered eating with minors.These supervision features build on existing protections already applied to teen accounts, with Meta using AI signals to place suspected teens into protection even if they claim to be adults.Recently, the company announced that Meta’s AI experiences for teens will be guided by the PG-13 movie rating system to prevent minors from accessing inappropriate content.The move also aligns with actions taken by competitors. Last month, OpenAI rolled out parental controls for its chatbot, ChatGPT, following a lawsuit filed by the parents of a teen who died by suicide after the startup’s chatbot allegedly coached him on methods of self-harm.","Parents will be able to turn off teens' direct, one-on-one chats with AI characters.

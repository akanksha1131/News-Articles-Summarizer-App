TANA-related firings at Apple

American company Fannie Mae has laid off employees. While the total number of employees who have let go is 700, of these some have been fired on 'ethical grounds. According to media reports, some layoffs were expected as part of the company's organisational restructuring, about 200, majority of them Telugus, were sacked on ""ethical grounds"". According to those working with the Federal National Mortgage Association, commonly known as Fannie Mae, the layoffs on Wednesday and Thursday happened on ethical grounds.The alleged violation is reportedly related to irregularities and misuse of the 'matching grants program'. Some employees are alleged to have colluded with non-profit organisations like Telugu Association of North America (TANA) and misused company funds. Incidentally, this is the same scam that saw Apple firing some Indian-origin employees earlier this year. One of the employees who was laid off at Fannie Mae reportedly held the position of regional vice president in TANA. Sources told TOI that TANA is not alone in this scam, and other organisations are also likely involved.In January 2025, Apple also sacked over 100 employees with similar allegations. As part of Apple's ‘Matching Gifts Programme’, the company matches employees' charitable contributions by matching their monetary donations to eligible non-profit organisations. For every financial contribution an employee makes to a qualified charity, Apple provides an equivalent amount as a matching donation.In December 2024, the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office stated that it charged six former non-Indian employees of Apple for a scheme in which they tricked the iPhone maker into matching thousands of dollars in donations to children's charities when they were not, in fact, donating anything. Between July 1, 2018, and April 6, 2021, the defendants allegedly manipulated donations to the charities. ""By exploiting Apple's employee gift-matching program, the defendants extracted approximately $152,000 from Apple's programme and overreported around $100,000 in charitable contributions as tax deductions,"" the statement said.""Kwan (one of the former Apple employees who indulged in fraud) would leverage his position with the charities and reimburse the employees while keeping the matching funds for himself against Apple Charity Matching policy. This deceitful manipulation defrauded both Apple and the State of California, as the employees would then falsely claim these donations as tax deductions,"" the statement showed.","Fannie Mae laid off 200 employees, majority of them Telugus.

"'$200 billion on the table' ..., still why Donald Trump is not keen on Amazon buying China's stake in TikTok",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/200-billion-on-the-table-still-why-donald-trump-is-not-keen-on-amazon-buying-chinas-stake-in-tiktok/articleshow/120074795.cms,"FILE - A TikTok sign is displayed on top of their building in Culver City, California (AP Photo/Richard Vogel, File)

Amazon's timing may be Wrong and the likely reason

Chinese government playing tough on Tiktok

The White House is pushing hard to broker a deal that would see the Chinese short-video app TikTok sold to an American company, aiming to eliminate any chance of the mainland using it to snoop on American citizens. However, it seems one Big Tech player reportedly isn’t winning any favor with Team Trump: The online retail behemoth Amazon , according to 'On The Money'.One would wonder why, especially since the days of 'animosity' between Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Donald Trump as seen during the US President's first term is gone. Amazon's Bezos rolled up to the inauguration with his dazzling fiancée, Lauren Sanchez , and a $1 million peace offering in tow earlier this year. The Washington Post too is reported to have even started leaning more Trump-friendly since Bezos rejigged its editorial leadership.However, as Team Trump polished its tariff blueprint and raced to save TikTok from a US ban -— which was set to kick in on April 5 unless a domestic buyer emerge -- Amazon joined the battle for Tiktok. The ecommerce giant offered to shell out whatever it takes, not just for TikTok’s U.S. operations (the heart of this buyout bid) but for the whole enchilada from its Chinese owners, in a deal that could hit $200 billion.Amazon’s got the cash to splash, sitting on over $100 billion by year’s end and able to borrow the rest with ease. Yet, it’s missing the Trump camp’s backing, a must-have for U.S. regulatory green lights. Reason “Half baked,” bid, as an insider close to the deal talks reportedly said. Those working on the TikTok deal in the US government wonder why Amazon had to wait till the last minute to join the bidding. “Why’d they wait till the clock was ticking?”, a Trump government insider reportedly said.Dealmakers reportedly told 'On The Money' that carving out TikTok’s U.S. piece has been a grind. The White House has wrestled for months to find a workable path, hemmed in by a U.S. law that bans the app here unless the Chinese let go of the reins.The Chinese government, true to form with China Inc, is running the show. The trick is getting its officials to ease up on control—without fully surrendering ownership—to a U.S.-majority investor group. President Xi and his inner circle, though, won’t budge on TikTok’s secret sauce: The algorithm that keeps users hooked with a relentless, personalized video stream.","The White House is pushing hard to broker a deal that would see the Chinese short-video app TikTok sold to an American company.

In a notable ruling, the UK government has been unsuccessful in its bid to conceal the details of the UK government has failed in its attempt to keep secret the details of a surveillance order it issued against tech giant Apple. This ruling effectively grants Apple a victory in the legal battle where it was reportedly ordered to create a ""backdoor"" into its products.A newly-released decision by the UK's Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) reveals that parts of the legal case will now be heard in public. The IPT, a court that examines the exercise of surveillance powers, published its decision.“We do not accept that the revelation of the bare details of the case would be damaging to the public interest or prejudicial to national security,” said Judges Rabinder Singh and Jeremy Johnson, as per news agency Reuters.While the full specifics are still undisclosed, reports suggest the case centers around a UK legal demand compelling Apple to grant UK authorities access to the encrypted cloud data of any Apple customer globally.These “bare details” align with previously leaked information published by The Washington Post in February, which exposed the UK's alleged pursuit of a backdoor into Apple's systems.Following the emergence of these reports, Apple announced it could “no longer” offer its Advanced Data Protection feature to users in the UK. This feature provides end-to-end encryption for user files stored in Apple's cloud, ensuring that only the user can access them.It is understood that Apple challenged the surveillance order by appealing to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal. In response, the UK government argued before the court that making the nature of the case public would jeopardise national security.However, the IPT rejected this argument, siding with calls for greater transparency from various quarters.","The UK government has been unsuccessful in its bid to conceal the details of a surveillance order it issued against tech giant Apple.

Sridhar Vembu’s comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress , emphasizing the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s recent expansion in Kerala. The image in the party’s post shows a tombstone design to symbolically critique the ""Make in India"" initiative, suggesting it has failed between 2014 and 2025. The tombstone features the Indian lion emblem and the phrase ""Rest in Peace.""The post is captioned “In loving memory of….”. Responding to the post, Vembu emphasized the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s expansion in Kerala. He wrote:“Meanwhile companies like us Make in India (and started making in Kerala recently too).”“Make in India is gaining momentum and we have to make up for several lost decades. Reflect on why they were ""lost decades"" and perhaps you will appreciate Make in India better,” he further added.Zoho has been expanding its operations across India, including in Kerala. The company has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas as part of its broader strategy.The Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports. Several companies, including Zoho, have increased their domestic production efforts as part of this initiative.Vembu’s response comes amid ongoing discussions on India's economic policies and industrial growth, with businesses and policymakers debating the impact of past and present strategies.Vembu recently drew a comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods, highlighting their long-term impact on economic structures. In a recent post, he discussed how capital inflows into a single sector can divert resources from others, weakening overall economic capabilities.Citing Silicon Valley as an example, Vembu pointed out the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, attributing them to a talent shift toward sectors with higher financial incentives. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now – for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors overlooked the sector due to the absence of large exits.Drawing a parallel to India, Vembu noted that the long-standing dominance of the IT industry resulted in the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he stated.He stressed the importance of addressing these gaps and rebuilding capabilities in affected sectors.

If you’ve been scrolling through social media lately --be it Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok -- you would have surely noticed the Ghibli-style photo trend taking over feeds everywhere. Those dreamy, pastel-hued images of whimsical forests, wide-eyed characters, and soft golden light straight out of a Studio Ghibli film have gone viral, racking up likes, shares, and endless “how did they do that?” comments. It's been almost a week, and this aesthetic obsession shows no signs of slowing down, with creators using AI tools, hand-drawn art, and photo edits to channel the magic of My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away. But why stop at static photos? Let’s ride this wave and turn your Ghibli-style masterpieces into an animation video that’ll have your followers hitting “replay.” Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create a short animation video inspired by the iconic Studio Ghibli aesthetic:The viral buzz started with fans and creators posting Ghibli-inspired snapshots—think lush landscapes and soulful characters, often AI-generated with tools like Midjourney or hand-drawn by digital artists.

Social media loves those multi-depth shots, and it’s perfect for what’s next.Ghibli’s charm lies in its quiet, heartfelt storytelling, and your animation can capture that—even in a 15-second clip that’s perfect for TikTok’s algorithm.Quick Sketch: Plan a mini-sequence.

A 10-second viral hit needs 240 frames, but don’t sweat it—software will fill the gaps.To animate Ghibli-style illustrations, you’ll need software that supports frame-by-frame animation, layering, and smooth transitions. Some of the best options include:Adobe After Effects : Ideal for advanced users, offering powerful animation tools and visual effects.Blender: A free, open-source 3D software that allows for detailed animation and rendering.Procreate Dreams: Huge on iPad-toting artists in this trend—hand-draw frames for that authentic Ghibli feel.RunwayML: AI fans love this for interpolating motion between images, cutting down work while keeping it share-worthy.CapCut: Free, fast, and TikTok-friendly for quick edits if you’re new to this.Once you’ve selected your software:Import all your Ghibli-style images into the software.Organize assets by layers (backgrounds, midgrounds, and foregrounds).Group character movements or effects into separate layers for better control.To create smooth animations:Keyframe Animation: Set keyframes at major points to define object positions and movements.Tweening: Fill in the frames between keyframes to achieve smooth transitions.Parallax Effect: Create depth by animating foreground and background layers independently.Studio Ghibli’s charm lies in its attention to environmental details. To replicate this:Add Particle Effects: Animate rain, leaves, or fireflies to create a magical ambiance.Adjust Lighting and Shadows: Use soft, dynamic lighting to evoke different moods.Simulate Camera Movements: Incorporate slow pans, zooms, and tracking shots for a cinematic effect.No Ghibli-inspired animation is complete without a captivating soundtrack.Background Score: Choose soothing, orchestral music that evokes nostalgia and wonder.Ambient Sounds: Add subtle environmental sounds (rustling leaves, chirping birds) for realism.Dialogue and Foley: Sync character speech and sound effects to the animation timeline.After perfecting your animation:Choose the appropriate export settings for your platform.Ensure a high-resolution export (1080p or 4K) for crisp visuals.Test your video for any frame drops or inconsistencies before finalizing.Users must be mindful of copyright restrictions when using AI-generated images, especially for commercial purposes as using copyrighted images as input could raise legal issues.","Studio Ghibli is an esteemed Japanese animation studio known for movies like Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro, and Howl's Moving Castle.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female. The change aligns with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January 2025, titled ‘Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government’. The updated policy, which took effect on April 2, applies to all pending and future immigration benefit requests. “USCIS is returning to its historical policy of recognizing two biological sexes,” the agency said in a press statement.Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security , said “There are only two sexes—male and female. President Trump promised the American people a revolution of common sense, and that includes making sure that the policy of the U.S. government agrees with simple biological reality. Proper management of our immigration system is a matter of national security, not a place to promote and coddle an ideology that permanently harms children and robs real women of their dignity, safety, and well-being.”Under the new guidance, a person’s sex will be determined based on the birth certificate issued at or closest to the time of birth. “If the birth certificate issued at or nearest to the time of birth indicates a sex other than male or female, USCIS will base the determination of sex on secondary evidence. See Volume 1, General Policies and Procedures, Part E, Adjudications, Chapter 6, Evidence, Section B, Primary and Secondary Evidence [1 USCIS-PM E.6(B)],” the agency stated.The agency further clarified that the benefits will not be denied solely based on how someone identifies their sex, it also confirmed that it does not issue documents with a blank sex field or one that differs from the original birth certificate. Any discrepancies may lead to processing delays.","The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female.

Microsoft 's joint venture in China, Wicresoft, is set to cease its operations in the country starting Tuesday (April 8), a report has said, adding that the decision by Wicresoft to shutter its China operations aligns with Microsoft's broader strategy to discontinue outsourcing after-sales support in the region to the joint venture. Citing sources familiar with the matter, Chinese media outlet Caijing (via Reuters) said that this move will result in the layoff of approximately 2,000 employees.This development has raised questions regarding the future approach of the US technology giant in providing services to its China-based users of popular software products like Windows and Office , the report added.The report specifically highlighted that the closure would primarily impact the roughly 2,000 individuals comprising Microsoft's outsourcing team within China. These employees were reportedly part of Wicresoft's workforce dedicated to providing support services.This move by Microsoft's joint venture comes amidst a backdrop of escalating political and trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. Additionally, Microsoft has been facing increasing competition within the Chinese market from local rivals such as Kingsoft, particularly in the software and services sectors.Shanghai Wicresoft Co. Ltd., the IT services provider in question, was established in 2002 as Microsoft's inaugural joint venture company in China.

Amazon bags highest number of H-1B visa approvals for 2025

Fears are growing among foreign tech workers in the US amidst President Donald Trump administration’s strict immigration. Tech giants – Amazon, Google, Apple, Microsoft and others are advising employees on visas to avoid traveling outside the US, fearing they may face trouble re-entering the country. As per a Washington Post report, law firms have also warned that rejection rates for high-skilled visas that include H-1B and Green Card could increase. The report quotes Malcolm Goeschl, principal attorney for Goeschl Law, a San Francisco-based firm who said “What we’re seeing right now is just a lot of worry and panic. It seems like [the administration is] just getting more and more momentum, and we don’t know what’s around the corner.”The publication interviewed two tech workers who said that they have cancelled their travel plans to India for fear of being denied re-entry to the US. “There’s an assumption that everybody who is not a U.S. citizen might be here illegally,” one of the workers said. “When we’re walking around, we always carry our documents,” another worker told the publicationH1B visas have caused a split within Trump’s supporters. On one side are tech leaders whose companies hire immigrants, and on the other are those who want to reduce immigration to the U.S. This disagreement became public in December when both sides argued on X about whether Trump should support or limit skilled immigration.In December last year, Elon Musk shared a post on X stating “we need more like double that number yesterday! The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low. Think of this like a pro sports team: if you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever they may be. That enables the whole TEAM to win.” The tech CEO was then responding to a post about engineering talent shortage.As per the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data, Amazon emerged as the largest beneficiary of the H-1B visa program in 2025 with 9,265 approvals. The e-commerce giant was followed by Cognizant and Google with 6,321 and 5,364 H-1B visa approvals, respectively. Elon Musk’s Tesla also featured prominently, alongside other tech giants – Meta, Apple, Microsoft, IBM and others.Earlier this month, the USCIS said that the H-1B visa cap of 85,000 for the fiscal year 2026 has been reached. In a press statement, the agency stated, “We have randomly selected enough beneficiaries with properly submitted registrations projected as needed to reach the H-1B cap.”","Fears are growing among foreign tech workers in the US amidst President Donald Trump administration’s strict immigration.

Midweek Getaways Take Off

India’s shopping, dining, and travel habits are getting a weekday makeover, according to Razorpay POS’s latest Annual In-Store Payments Report titled “Every Day’s A Weekend.” Based on millions of in-store transactions processed between April 1, 2024, and March 31, 2025, the report signals a clear shift in consumer behavior : the nation is no longer saving its indulgences for the weekend.Razorpay POS, the offline payments arm of Razorpay, analyzed transactions across more than 500,000 merchant touchpoints and found that everyday life is becoming a celebration — from Tuesday café catch-ups to Thursday shopping sprees.Commenting on the findings, Kunal Gothivarekar, Head of Razorpay POS, said, “India’s spending habits are undergoing a fundamental shift—weekdays are no longer just for necessities; they’re for experiences, indulgences, and everyday celebrations. As consumers prioritize experiences over routine purchases, sectors like retail, hospitality, and lifestyle are seeing a surge in engagement.”In FY’25, weekday apparel purchases surged by 29%, while salon and spa transactions grew 27%, signaling a new trend of midweek self-care. Jewellery shopping, too, saw a significant uptick with a 43% jump — and over half of those purchases (55%) were made using cards, reaffirming the preference for swiping on high-value items.Indians are now carving out time for personal passions, not just on weekends but throughout the workweek. Garden supply store transactions skyrocketed by 79%, and bookstores recorded a 27% rise. The numbers reflect a deeper shift: balancing productivity with personal joy.In-store retail therapy isn’t waiting until Saturday anymore. With weekday shopping transactions climbing 34%, consumers are turning errands into mood-boosting breaks, turning mall visits and store runs into moments of joy.Hotel bookings during weekdays jumped 29% in FY’25, reflecting a growing trend of spontaneous staycations and travel. As hybrid work cultures gain ground, Indians are making room for rest and rejuvenation even midweek.","India’s shopping, dining, and travel habits are getting a weekday makeover.

Jamie Dimon's warning and promise

Jamie Dimon may have agreed with Elon Musk

""Important to resolve trade issues quickly to avoid irreversible damage""

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has sent his annual letter to the company's shareholders. Dimon's annual letters are wide-ranging and closely followed, and this year’s letter stretches to nearly 60 pages, including footnotes. The shareholders letter for the year 2025 marks Dimon’s first public commentary on Tariff measures announced by the US President Donald Trump . The 69-year-old Dimon has been with America's largest bank for 19 years and is widely regarded as one of the most prominent voices in corporate America. Dimon often weighs in on government policies, and has been consulted by officials in times of crisis. In the letter, Dimon has refrained from mentioning Trump directly.Dimon's letter is a mixed bag, it warns of economic pains that Trump tariffs will cause. But at the same time he wrote that there are “of course” some legitimate reasons for the action, and that he hopes “the long-term effect will have some positive benefits” for the US. Despite challenges, Dimon expressed confidence in the long-term resilience of the American economy. “Even with fairly extreme outcomes, our company would remain healthy,” he said. “I still have an abiding faith in America—the exceptional strength of our innovative economy and our resiliency.”“Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,” he wrote. He noted that in the short-term consumers in the US could see inflationary pressures. “We are likely to see inflationary outcomes, not only on imported goods but on domestic prices, as input costs rise and demand increases on domestic products.”Dimon highlighted the uncertainty surrounding potential retaliatory actions, investor confidence, corporate profits, and the strength of the U.S. dollar. “The quicker this issue is resolved, the better,” he said, warning that cumulative damage could be hard to reverse.Though Dimon did not mention Elon Musk , he expressed concern over an issue that Tesla CEO Elon Musk warns of repeatedly: America’s rising fiscal deficit, calling it “the highest peacetime level ever not driven by recessionary needs.” In the letter, Dimon warned the current path of deficit spending, coupled with quantitative tightening, adds to uncertainty around interest rates and asset valuations.""The quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse,"" the CEO wrote.“Our economy also faces the unknown effects of quantitative tightening… we have never had this much quantitative easing and, therefore, quantitative tightening before,” he said, adding that this dynamic could lead to higher Treasury market volatility.On interest rates, he emphasized that while the Federal Reserve controls short-term rates, long-term yields remain driven by inflation expectations and global capital flows. “This tug-of-war can go on for some time,” he said, warning of the risk of a repeat of 1970s-style stagflation.",JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has sent his annual letter to the company's shareholders.

Microsoft former CEO Steve Ballmer recently said that the new tariffs announced by President Donald Trump will have an effect on consumers, adding that investors will feel the pain, too. Speaking to CNBC on the company’s 50th anniversary celebrations, Ballmer said “As a Microsoft shareholder, this kind of thing is not good”, further adding that “It creates opportunity to be a serious, long-term player.” The panel interview also included Microsoft’s current CEO Satya Nadella and former CEO Bill Gates President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on over 90 countries last week. Those impacted include India, China and the European Union among others. Commenting on the new tariffs, Balmmer said “I took just enough economics in college — that tariffs are actually going to bring some turmoil”.He further added: “I think that disruption is very hard on people, and so the decision to do something for which disruption was inevitable, that needs a lot of popular support, and nobody could game theorize exactly who is going to do what in response.”“So, I think citizens really like stability a lot. And I hope people — individuals who will feel this, because people are feeling it, not just the stock market, people are going to feel it.”Noting that the future is bright for computing, storage and intelligence, Ballmer said that he will continue to be a Microsoft shareholder. “I’m not going to probably have 50 more years on the planet. But whatever minutes I have, I’m gonna be a large Microsoft shareholder,” he said.As mentioned before, the panel also included Satya Nadella who reportedly said: “Fifty years from now, or 25 years from now, what is the one thing you can be guaranteed of, is the world needs more compute.”“So I want to keep those two thoughts and then take one step at a time, and then whatever are the geopolitical or economic shifts, we’ll adjust to it,” Nadella added.","Steve Ballmer said that the new tariffs announced by President Donald Trump will have an effect on consumers, adding that investors will feel the pain, too.

A coalition of major US technology companies -- including Apple, Amazon, Cisco, Meta, HP, and Intel -- have formally opposed demands by Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea regarding the allocation of the 6 GHz spectrum band. While the Indian telecom operators are pushing for the spectrum to be auctioned for mobile services (IMT), the tech giants are advocating for the entire band to be delicensed for Wi-Fi use. In a joint submission to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) regarding the upcoming spectrum auction, the US tech majors argued that the ecosystem for mobile services in the 6 GHz band is not yet technically or commercially ready. Currently, the Indian government has identified that 400 MHz of frequencies in the 6 GHz band are available for auction, with another 300 MHz expected by 2030. The lower 6 GHz band (5925-6425 MHz) has already been decided for delicensing to support low-power applications like Wi-Fi.The coalition of American technology companies has urged the government to delay any auction timelines for the 6425-6725 MHz and 7025-7125 MHz ranges.In a joint response to telecom regulator Trai's consultation paper for the next round of spectrum auction, the US technology giants have said the technical and commercial readiness in the 6 GHz band is not established for mobile services.""We do not recommend setting timelines for any future auction of the 6425-6725 MHz and 7025-7125 MHz ranges for IMT. TRAI, together with the Department of Telecommunications, should review the allocation of the upper 6 GHz band following the outcomes of WRC-27, including Agenda Item 1.7 concerning 7.125-8.4 GHz,"" the joint submission said. The tech giants said any upper 6 GHz spectrum that would otherwise remain unused should be made available for unlicensed use in the interim. They further suggested that any upper 6 GHz spectrum left unused should be opened for unlicensed use—effectively Wi-Fi—in the interim.The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), representing Reliance Jio, Airtel , and Vodafone Idea, has strongly opposed delicensing. They argue that handing the spectrum over to Wi-Fi would result in a loss of exchequer revenue and provide an unfair advantage to foreign OTT players. It said that delicensing even a part of the 6 GHz band will be an irreversible action, permanently foreclosing its use for licensed mobile broadband services and severely limiting India's long-term digital capacity and provision of affordable services.""Moreover, unlicensed Wi-Fi deployments by global OTT players and device manufacturers could preclude licensed usage in the band, reduce exchequer revenues and give disproportionate advantage to foreign OTT players, creating an inequitable environment for telecom operators,"" COAI said.* Reliance Jio has demanded that the entire 1200 MHz of available spectrum in the 6 GHz band be included in the upcoming auction, despite the government’s decision to delicense the lower 500 MHz for low-power applications.* Vodafone Idea has requested that the 400 MHz currently available be put up for sale immediately.* Bharti Airtel, taking a more cautious approach, has sought a deferment of the auction. Airtel cited a lack of ecosystem readiness regarding devices and global harmonization, a view echoed by chipset major Qualcomm.US-based chipset major Qualcomm, however, has echoed views similar to Airtel. Qualcomm aligned partially with Airtel, emphasizing that the upper 6 GHz band is critical for India's future 6G ambitions. ""By deferring the auction of the 6425-6725 MHz and 7025-7125 MHz bands until after WRC-27, India safeguards its 6G future, aligns with global standards, and honours its leadership aspirations,"" Qualcomm said in its submission.","Apple, Amazon, Cisco, Meta, HP, and Intel have formally opposed demands by Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea regarding the allocation of the 6 GHz spectrum band.

TSMC investigates if the top exec who has joined Intel took TSMC tech; while Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan says: We ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tsmc-investigates-if-the-top-exec-who-has-joined-intel-took-tsmc-tech-while-intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan-says-we-/articleshow/125529609.cms,"What Intel said on the allegations







TSMC has reportedly opened an internal investigation to find whether Lo Wen-jen has taken trade secrets with him to Intel without its consent. According to a report in Bloomberg, Taiwanese newspapers spent the week reporting on the transition of Lo Wen-jen, 75, from his retirement from TSMC earlier this year to joining Intel in recent weeks. It is unclear whether TSMC has reached a conclusion about any potential damage to the company, the person added, asking not to be identified since the information is private.“The government is concerned with national security implications,” Taiwan’s Minister of Economic Affairs Kung Ming-hsin told reporters, without elaborating on any of the details pertaining to allegations against Lo. Minister Wu Cheng-wen of Taiwan’s National Science and Technology Council reportedly told reporters later in the day that TSMC is still looking into the situation, according to Taiwan’s official Central News Agency.Lo was responsible for corporate strategy before his retirement from TSMC in July. He was at one point in charge of research and technology development at TSMC and played a key role in facilitating the mass production at TSMC of cutting-edge chips, including those used to make AI accelerators. He is also a laureate of Taiwan’s prestigious Industrial Technology Research Institute.Before he joined TSMC in 2004, Lo spent some time at Intel focusing on advanced technology development, including running a chip factory in Santa Clara, California.He has a doctorate degree in solid state physics and surface chemistry from UC Berkeley.Relations between Intel and TSMC have not been very good over the past few years as the US chipmaker tries to play catchup in the technology race. Intel is at once a customer and a competitor to TSMC, which is also the sole maker of the most high-end chips for Apple and Nvidia.Intel Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Lip-Bu Tan dismissed reports about a new hire taking trade secrets from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) to his company, saying the US chipmaker respects other firms’ intellectual property. Taiwanese newspapers spent the week reporting on the transition of Lo Wen-jen, 75, from his retirement from TSMC earlier this year to joining Intel in recent weeks. The executive is alleged to have taken proprietary knowhow from his former employer just before his departure. “It’s rumor and speculation. There’s nothing to it. We respect IP,” Tan told Bloomberg News on the sidelines of the Semiconductor Industry Association Awards in San Jose on Thursday. The event recognized TSMC CEO C.C. Wei and former Chairman Mark Liu with its highest honor, the Robert N. Noyce Award.Incidentally, Intel's sacked former CEO Pat Gelsinger frequently argued that it was too risky for the US to depend heavily on TSMC for cutting-edge semiconductors due to growing geopolitical volatility in the Taiwan Strait, creating friction between the two companies.",TSMC has reportedly opened an internal investigation to find whether Lo Wen-jen has taken trade secrets with him to Intel without its consent.

How Google CEO Sundar Pichai fixed the 'emoji mistake' Google made in 2017 this week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-fixed-the-emoji-mistake-google-made-in-2017-this-week/articleshow/125518535.cms,"Sundar Pichai (Image credit: BBC interview/ Youtube)

Gemini 3 and Nano Banana Pro

These tools demonstrate improved spatial reasoning, allowing AI to understand how objects should be positioned in the real world.

Tech investor Balaji Srinivasan noted that the burger image showed Gemini 3 had solved a long-standing challenge: “Normally, AI models struggle with spatial orientation… but this image seems to resolve that issue.”

Google’s AI comeback





Eight years after Google was roasted online for a cheeseburger emoji that placed the cheese under the meat. Now, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has finally set the record straight with the help of Google’s latest generative AI models. Back in 2017, Google faced a lot of backlash when the ingredients of its cheeseburger emoji in Android were stacked incorrectly. Pichai jokingly apologised at that time and promised to soon come up with a fix. Recently, the Google CEO delivered the correct emoji. Pichai shared a post on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) in which he shared an AI-generated cheeseburger image with the cheese firmly above the patty, captioned “iykyk” as a nod to the viral furor.The emoji correction coincided with Google’s launch of Gemini 3, its most advanced AI model, and Nano Banana Pro, a new image-generation tool capable of producing realistic pictures, diagrams, and charts.The launch of Gemini 3 marks a turning point for Google, which has faced criticism for lagging behind rivals in generative AI. The company’s stock surged to a record high this week, briefly making Google more valuable than Microsoft.Pichai’s decade-long push toward an AI-first strategy is now bearing fruit. “Google really did drop everything they were doing to truly focus on AI,” Srinivasan wrote. “Gemini 3 represents the moment when they actually retook the lead. ”What began as a lighthearted emoji scandal has evolved into a symbol of Google’s AI progress. By fixing the cheeseburger stack, Pichai showcased not just humor but a serious leap in AI’s ability to understand the physical world — a capability that could reshape industries far beyond fast food.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai posted an AI-generated cheeseburger image with the cheese firmly above the patty, captioned ‘iykyk’ The emoji correction coincided with Google’s launch of Gemini 3, its most advanced AI model, and Nano Banana Pro, a new image-generation tool.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125518532,imgsize-496675,width-400,resizemode-4/sundar-pichai-image-credit-bbc-interview-youtube.jpg"

Meta’s Secret AI Army: Top Talent Hired from OpenAI, Google & More

Meta denies allegations, says methodology was flawed







A claim filed in a class-action lawsuit against Meta alleges that the company shut down internal research after finding causal evidence that its products, Facebook and Instagram , were causing mental health problems to users. The allegation comes from unredacted filings submitted by US school districts suing Meta, Google, TikTok and Snapchat, news agency Reuters reported, adding that the plaintiffs argue the tech giants intentionally concealed internally recognized risks from users, parents and educators.The core of the claim revolves around a 2020 internal research project code-named “Project Mercury.” Meta scientists, working with the survey firm Nielsen, studied the effects of “deactivating” Facebook and Instagram use. According to internal documents cited in the filing, the results were highly unfavourable: “people who stopped using Facebook for a week reported lower feelings of depression, anxiety, loneliness and social comparison. ”Rather than publicising the findings or continuing the study, the filing alleges Meta terminated further work and internally dismissed the negative results, claiming they were tainted by the existing “media narrative” around the company.However, internal communications revealed that staff privately assured then-head of global public policy, Nick Clegg, that the conclusions showing a “causal impact on social comparison” were valid.One staffer allegedly expressed concern that burying the findings was akin to the tobacco industry “doing research and knowing cigs were bad and then keeping that info to themselves.”In a statement released on Saturday (November 22), Meta spokesman Andy Stone defended the company, asserting that the study was stopped because its methodology was flawed, and that Meta works diligently to improve product safety.“The full record will show that for over a decade, we have listened to parents, researched issues that matter most, and made real changes to protect teens,” Stone said.","Claim filed in a class-action lawsuit against Meta alleges that the company shut down internal research after finding causal evidence that its products, Facebook and Instagram, were causing mental health problems to users.

Some of America’s largest financial institutions are reportedly working urgently to assess potential damage from a significant cyberattack on SitusAMC, a critical vendor used by hundreds of banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and Morgan Stanley, to process real estate loans and mortgages. The New York-based company, which employs approximately 5,000 people and is owned by several private equity firms, confirmed on Saturday (November 22) that it was breached on November 12 and has spent nearly two weeks investigating the scope of compromised data related to residential loan mortgages.Citing five people briefed on the incident, The New York Times reported that JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and Morgan Stanley are among the institutions notified by SitusAMC that client data may have been stolen. A JPMorgan spokesperson clarified that the bank itself had not been directly hacked.The breach has generated particular alarm on Wall Street due to the nature of information SitusAMC handles.

How the Foxconn partnership can help OpenAI





“Foxconn is uniquely positioned to support OpenAI’s mission with trusted, scalable infrastructure,”





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US. This partnership is the AI startup's newest step in its extensive infrastructure development plans. The companies stated the goal is to accelerate infrastructure deployment and secure long-term US capacity for essential AI components. While financial terms were not disclosed, OpenAI confirmed it will have early access to evaluate the systems produced by the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and Apple ’s largest supplier, along with the option to purchase them.In a statement to CNBC, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the partnership, saying:adding that AI infrastructure presents aUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities, which are located in Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Indiana.Foxconn adds another manufacturing layer to OpenAI’s supply chain, which could help make production for the AI startup more local and speed up deployment.The company is widely known for assembling Apple’s iPhones, but it has also expanded into AI and automotive manufacturing. It builds server racks designed for AI workloads and is an important global supplier to Nvidia, a major producer of high-end AI chips.Chairman Young Liu said to CNBC.However, the company has had mixed results in the US. In 2018, Foxconn began construction of a large factory in Wisconsin intended to make flat-panel displays. The project did not succeed, and the site is now being used for an AI data centre under construction by Microsoft.OpenAI has recently made several major agreements with some of the world’s biggest technology companies, announcing spending plans of about $1.4 trillion.These commitments have raised questions about whether the company will eventually generate enough profit to support that level of investment.Earlier this month, Altman said the company expects to reach $20 billion in annualised revenue by the end of the year and aims to reach hundreds of billions by 2030.Previous deals include a $100 billion agreement (yet to be finalised) with Nvidia, under which the chipmaker would invest in OpenAI in phases as the company expands its infrastructure.OpenAI also has cloud partnerships with Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, as well as significant compute buildout commitments with Oracle.","OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently struck a humorous and candid tone in the company’s recent Townhall with the employees. Huang acknowledged that despite delivering a record-shattering earnings, the market reaction was less enthusiastic. As reported by Business Insider, Huang said that Nvidia’s influence has created a no-win situation with expectations so hight that even minor missteps could shake global markets. Huang also talked about the online chatter and memes about the company’s economic role. “If we delivered a bad quarter, if we’re off by just a hair, if it just looked a little bit creaky, the whole world would’ve fallen apart. You should’ve seen some of the memes on the internet. We’re basically holding the planet together — and it’s not untrue.”Nvidia reported a record quarter with $57 billion revenue which is up by 62% year-over-year, and forecasted $65 billion for the fourth quarter.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

Nvidia’s historic milestone



JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon doesn’t sugarcoat AI impact on jobs





JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has now hailed Nvidia as an unbelievable company and has also cautioned investors that some artificial intelligence stocks may be trading at an unsustainable levels. Speaking with CNN’s Erin Burnett, Dimon said that the US remains the ‘most prosperous’ economy in the world. He adds that the US economy is supported by diverse and deep capital markets including venture capital, private credit and hedge funds. “There’s no question some people will lose money,” Dimon said, drawing parallels to the dot-com era. “But mankind should benefit,” he added, emphasising that the underlying technology is real and transformative—even if valuations are currently inflated.Dimon emphasized that AI is a genuine productivity revolution, comparing its current stage to the early days of the Internet. “It’s almost at the beginning,” he said, noting that while not every company will succeed, AI will produce transformative winners just as the internet gave rise to Google, Facebook, and Amazon.Dimon acknowledged that valuations in the AI sector may be inflated, but stressed that the underlying technology will reshape industries and improve lives.“Mankind should benefit,” he said, even if “valuations today may be too high for some of these folks.”In October 2025, Nvidia became the first company in history to surpass a $5 trillion market valuation. Its market cap currently stands at $4.74 trillion, underscoring its dominance in the AI chip market. Dimon’s remarks came shortly after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicted that China will win the AI race, a claim that drew sharp pushback from President Donald Trump, who vowed the U.S. would not allow other nations access to Nvidia’s most advanced chips.In another interview with Bloomberg TV, Dimon talked about the impact of AI on the job market. “People shouldn’t put their head in the sand. It is going to affect jobs,” he said. “AI will enhance some aspects of work, but also eliminate some jobs.” However, Dimon also stressed on the fact that JPMorgan is focused on retaining and redeploying employees whose roles are impacted by automation. “We’ll have more jobs, but there’ll probably be less jobs in certain functions,” Dimon added. “You’re better off being way ahead of the curve,” Dimon added.Dimon also added that the bank has invested about $2 billion as an annual investment in AI and is already making $2 billion in direct benefits. This includes the headcount reductions and operational savings. “We know about $2 billion of actual cost saves,” he said. “It’s the tip of the iceberg.”","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has hailed Nvidia as an unbelievable company.

Winston Weinberg, CEO of $5 billion AI legal tech startup Harvey, has ditched traditional job interviews in favor of an unconventional approach: conducting candidate assessments asynchronously through Google Docs.""In my experience, this is the best way to separate good interviewers from good operators,"" Weinberg told Business Insider, explaining that the shared document format reveals how candidates actually work versus how well they present themselves.Speaking on the ""Access"" podcast, Weinberg said the method exposes a critical hiring problem: ""There are folks that are really good at talking and terrible at doing.""

Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency

Former executive challenges leadership to Balance technology with humanity





'Your story isn't ending—it's evolving,' says leader who left three years ago









A former top executive at Verizon has penned an emotional message to thousands of employees facing job cuts, as the telecommunications giant begins its largest-ever round of layoffs affecting more than 13,000 workers. Tami Erwin, who spent 35 years at Verizon and served as CEO of Verizon Business before departing in 2022, posted a heartfelt letter on LinkedIn that has resonated across the corporate world. ""The news this week has weighed on me deeply,"" she wrote. ""As I reflect on it tonight, on a quiet Friday night, I'm thinking about the people behind the headlines.""Her message emphasized that while technological transformation is necessary, ""people remain the heart of every great company."" Erwin, who rose from customer service representative to the C-suite, acknowledged knowing ""how profoundly this will be felt across the V Team.""""To those impacted, from someone who will always bleed Verizon red: Give yourself permission to grieve,"" she wrote. ""A job is identity, relationships, pride. Losing it is personal.""The cuts represent roughly 13 percent of Verizon's 100,000-person workforce and will slash labor costs for nonunion employees by 20 percent.New CEO Dan Schulman, who took the helm just last month after PayPal, is implementing sweeping changes as Verizon hemorrhages customers to rivals AT&T and T-Mobile.In his own message to staff Thursday, Schulman cited the need to ""reorient our entire company around delivering for and delighting our customers,"" while announcing a $20 million reskilling fund for departing employees.But Erwin's letter offered something corporate communications rarely do: unvarnished acknowledgment of loss paired with hard-won perspective. She urged workers to give themselves time to grieve, then to recognise that ""your Verizon experience is meaningful and will open doors.""""Hold your head high. No one can take away the impact you've had,"" she wrote, encouraging employees to ""build a framework for your next chapter and go forth and conquer.""While acknowledging that artificial intelligence, quantum computing, robotics and intelligent networks will redefine business, Erwin issued a pointed message about the responsibility that comes with corporate transformation. ""Technology doesn't transform a company. People do,"" she stated. ""And when change affects people's livelihoods, leaders must modernise more than systems—they must modernise process, communication, empathy, and accountability. "" She added a stark warning: ""Transformation without humanity isn't leadership.""Erwin didn't shy from acknowledging the forces driving the restructuring. Artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and robotics are fundamentally reshaping telecommunications, she noted, and ""the direction is right.""But her core message challenged the notion that technological transformation justifies human collateral damage. ""Technology doesn't transform a company. People do,"" she wrote. ""And when change affects people's livelihoods, leaders must modernize more than systems—they must modernize process, communication, empathy, and accountability.""The former executive, who now serves as a board director and advisor to Silicon Valley startups, drew on her own experience leaving Verizon three years ago. ""Your next chapter will be equally as fulfilling,"" she assured displaced workers.Verizon lost 7,000 consumer postpaid phone connections last quarter while analysts had forecast gains. The company's struggles come as it faces what Erwin called ""extraordinary things happening across industries"" that favor agile, innovative companies over legacy players slow to adapt.""Your story isn't ending—it's evolving,"" she concluded. ""And I'm cheering for you, always.""","Verizon begins largest-ever round of layoffs affecting more than 13,000 workers.

The US government release further said that the government will also seek forfeiture of 50 Nvidia H200 GPUs that were intended to be exported unlawfully.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?





Two American citizens and two nationals of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) -- all residing in the United States -- have been charged with a conspiracy to illegally export cutting-edge Nvidia Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to the PRC. John Eisenberg, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s National Security Division, said in a press release.Those arrested include Hon Ning Ho, aka “Mathew Ho,” an American citizen born in Hong Kong, 34, residing in Tampa, Florida; Brian Curtis Raymond, American citizen, 46, Huntsville, Alabama; Cham Li, aka “Tony Li,” PRC national, 38, San Leandro, California, and Jing Chen, aka “Harry Chen,” PRC national on F-1 nonimmigrant student visa, 45, Tampa, Florida. On November 19, 2025, Ho and Chen were arrested and appeared in court in the Middle District of Florida, while Raymond was arrested and appeared in the Northern District of Alabama.Raymond was briefly the chief technology officer (CTO) of the Virginia-based Corvex, which describes itself as an AI cloud computing company and is planning to go public. Corvex listed Raymond as its CTO and part of its leadership team in a press release on November 10.Corvex told CNBC yesterday that it “had no part in the activities cited in the Department of Justice’s indictment,” and that “the person in question is not an employee of Corvex. Previously a consultant to the company, he was transitioning into an employee role but that offer has been rescinded.”“The indictment unsealed yesterday alleges a deliberate and deceptive effort to transship controlled Nvidia GPUs to China by falsifying paperwork, creating fake contracts, and misleading U.S. authorities,” said John A. Eisenberg, Assistant Attorney General for National Security. “The National Security Division is committed to disrupting these kinds of black markets of sensitive U.S. technologies and holding accountable those who participate in this illicit trade. ”“As demonstrated by this indictment, the US Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida is firmly committed to safeguarding our country’s national security,” said U.S. Attorney Gregory W. Kehoe for the Middle District of Florida. “Thanks to the dedicated investigative work by our law enforcement partners, these defendants who wrongfully exported this sensitive technology are facing justice.”According to the indictment, the PRC seeks to become the world leader in AI by 2030 and seeks to use AI for its military modernization efforts and in connection with the design and testing of weapons of mass destruction and deployment of advanced AI surveillance tools. The PRC seeks cutting-edge U.S. technology in furtherance of that goal, including Nvidia GPUs. To protect U.S. national security, beginning in October 2022, the Department of Commerce implemented new license requirements for the export of these technologies to the PRC.As alleged, from September 2023 to November 2025, Ho, Raymond, Li, and Chen conspired to violate these critical U. export controls, by illegally exporting advanced GPUs to the PRC through Malaysia and Thailand. In furtherance of the conspiracy, the conspirators used Janford Realtor, LLC—a Tampa, Florida-based company owned and controlled by Ho and Li—as a front to purchase and then illegally export controlled GPUs to the PRC. Despite its name, Janford Realtor, LLC, was never involved in any real estate transactions. Raymond, though his Alabama-based electronics company, supplied NVIDIA GPUs to Ho and others for illegal export to the PRC as part of the conspiracy.As further alleged in the indictment, the conspiracy encompassed four separate exports of Nvidia GPUs to the PRC. The first and second exports resulted in 400 Nvidia A100 GPUs being exported to the PRC between October 2024 and January 2025. The third and fourth exports to the PRC were disrupted by law enforcement and therefore not completed. These attempted exports related to ten Hewlett Packard Enterprises supercomputers containing Nvidia H100 GPUs and 50 separate Nvidia H200 GPUs.Despite knowing that licenses were required to export these items to the PRC, none of the conspirators ever sought or obtained a license for any of these exports. Instead, they lied about the intended destination of the GPUs to evade U.S. export controls. The indictment further alleges that the conspirators received over $3.89 million in wire transfers from the PRC to fund this unlawful scheme.",Two American citizens and two nationals of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) -- all residing in the United States -- have been charged with a conspiracy to illegally export cutting-edge Nvidia Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to the PRC.

""The strategic risk is two-sided. If OpenAI succeeds, it becomes a bigger competitive threat; but if the company underachieves internal targets, it may under-utilise its contracted compute, contributing to excess capacity and lower Cloud industry revenues,”

Dangers Of AI: Is ChatGPT Quietly Harming Your Mental Health? | Global Pulse

""We think the rational for adding OpenAI as a cloud customer could be threefold: 1) important to drive Cloud AI scale, and OpenAI would be able to find capacity elsewhere, 2) potential for deeper partnerships to bring OpenAI's frontier models onto Cloud platforms (though Microsoft deal dependent), 3) will be manageable exposure at less than 10% of total Cloud revs,""

How OpenAI can be a threat to the companies it's signing deals with





“All in, OpenAI is targeting $41bn in new product revenue by 2030 which likely includes advertising and eCommerce commissions, which would represent roughly 8% of our 2030 advertising/eCommerce commission industry forecasts,""

“Weighing the pros and cons, we still view OpenAI as a net competitive threat to Big Tech Internet, with the competitive risk across search, eCommerce, and enterprise AI outweighing modest cloud revenue risk (OpenAI less than 5% of AWS revs),”





Bank of America analyst Justin Post has warned that major technology companies face a dual threat as they rush to secure partnerships with ChatGPT maker OpenAI . The analyst cautioned that these deals could damage cloud providers regardless of whether the Sam Altman-backed AI startup succeeds or fails. While the industry currently favours high capital expenditure and rapid deal-making, the investment bank analyst highlights the paradox of hyperscalers funding an entity that is simultaneously a partner and a competitor. Post claimed that investors must look beyond current spending trends to understand how these agreements reshape the market landscape.Post said to Business Insider. He said this, referering to deals worth billions of dollars that OpenAI has already inked with tech majors inclduing Microsoft, Google , Amazon Web Services, Oracle and others.Post explained.Post added that OpenAI expects to continue expanding and could eventually become a competitive challenge to major tech firms in both enterprise and consumer markets.This may include moving into areas such as advertising and agent-based transaction platforms that can complete tasks and make purchases for users.He noted that large hyperscalers are not the only companies that could face pressure as the startup grows. The bank’s analyst also believes that OpenAI will compete for marketing and advertising budgets, which could affect companies like Facebook parent Meta and Google’s YouTube.Post highlighted.He explained that partnerships with OpenAI have provided short-term benefits to some tech companies, including increases in stock prices. However, Post pointed out that the ChatGPT maker should still be viewed as a competitive threat.Post continued.",Bank of America analyst Justin Post has warned that major technology companies face a dual threat as they rush to secure partnerships with ChatGPT maker OpenAI.

Senator Bernie Sanders has now issued one of his starkest warnings yet about the rise of artificial intelligence. In an interview with NBC News, Sanders said that the technology’s explosive growth risks concentrating wealth and power among a handful of billionaires while leaving ordinary workers behind. Sanders cautioned that AI’s military applications could reshape global conflict. “I think we are not all that far away from the development of robotic soldiers,” he said. “If you don’t have to worry about loss of life, and what you worry about is loss of robots, what does that mean for issues of war and peace globally? It’s a big issue.”The report further adds that Sanders linked the rise of AI to his long-standing concerns about wealth inequality. “The top 1% of Americans own more wealth than the bottom 93%. All of these zillionaires — the Musks, the Ellisons, the Bezoses, the Zuckerbergs — are investing hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars into AI and robotics. What is the result of all that?”Along with this, Sanders has also warned that such investments could make the tech moguls even richer and more powerful politically, while weakening democracy and eroding living standards for working people.Same has Bill Gates, Sanders also echoed the warnings from tech leaders including Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei that AI could displace millions of jobs. “If I’m a factory worker today, if I’m working in an office, how am I going to feed my family? How am I going to pay the rent? Who is talking about that?”Sanders also raised concerns about AI’s impact on human relationships, noting that teenagers increasingly rely on AI companions. “If kids today have AI as their best friends… what kind of change does that mean for humanity?”Sanders also warned about the cooperation between AI companies and the U.S.military could erode privacy. “How far away are we from a small number of people having access to the email that you’ve sent out, every phone call that you’ve been on, really every aspect of your life? We’re not far.”Sanders has proposed measures to mitigate AI’s impact, including:He criticised venture capitalists and tech donors for funding super PACs to block regulation, likening their attitudes to monarchies of old.Sanders also mentioned that he will host a town hall with AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton at Georgetown University to discuss AI’s trajectory and its effects on workers. He urged Congress and the public to accelerate debate, “This ain’t just another technological revolution. It is a lot more profound, and it’s going to move a lot quicker.”","Senator Bernie Sanders has issued one of his starkest warnings yet about the rise of artificial intelligence.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates feels that every major technology company starting from chip makers like Nvidia to datacenter operators and other startups are grappling with the same pressing concern: whether there is an AI bubble in the world as billion of dollars are pouring into artificial intelligence. In an interview with CNBC, Gates acknowledged that the AI frenzy does resemble a bubble, but stressed it is fundamental different from historical speculative manias such as 17th-century tulip mania.“They were just tulips,” Gates said of the Dutch craze. By contrast, he described AI as “so profound and therefore its influence is hard to overstate.” Gates also likened today’s AI surge to the early days of the internet, where massive investment by transformative potential, even if many ventures failed along the way.For Gates, the biggest worry is not whether AI is a bubble, but how companies manage the inevitable failures, energy strains, and workforce disruptions while still harnessing AI’s transformative power.Bill Gates also pointed out on the immense economic and social value of AI as the technology offer medical advice, act as personalised tutors and accelerate drug design. He argued that this foundational potential makes financial commitments rational, even though “a ton of these investments will be dead ends.”Along with this, Bill Gates also highlighted some specific risks which keep the executives awake at night:Despite these challenges, Gates said opting out is not an option, “If you want to be a tech company, you don’t get to say, ‘No, let’s check out of this race.’”Apart from financial risks, Bill Gates also acknowledged two social pushbacks. He argued that smarter placement of data centers and next-generation solutions citing his nuclear energy venture Terrapower. “We don’t have permission to drive up people’s electricity costs,” he said.On the other hand, Gates also admitted AI will affect employment. “It’s only honest for people to speak frankly about the fact this will have a big effect on the job market,” he said, predicting impacts over the next several years.","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates feels that every major technology company is grappling with the same pressing concern: whether there is an AI bubble.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap





Nvidia has delayed its GeForce Now cloud gaming service launch in India to Q1 2026, pushing back the November 2025 deadline. The company confirmed servers are actively being built within the country, a move that promises dramatically lower latency for Indian gamers when the service finally goes live.“Thanks for your continued excitement and patience while we work to bring GeForce NOW servers to this emerging gaming market. Servers are currently being built in India, and we now anticipate the service will go live during the first quarter of 2026,” Nvidia said in an emailed statement.Meanwhile, users can now register for launch updates on the official GeForce Now India page.The infrastructure buildout addresses cloud gaming's biggest pain point: lag. By housing servers on Indian soil rather than routing traffic through distant data centers, Nvidia is targeting seamless, high-fidelity streaming that can handle demanding AAA titles without the sluggish response times that plague overseas connections.This delay continues a pattern of missed deadlines. Nvidia first teased GeForce Now's India return at CES 2025 in January, promising availability in the first half of the year.By August's Gamescom, that shifted to ""later this year,"" then November, and now Q1 2026.The service arrives amid growing competition. Microsoft launched Xbox Cloud Gaming in India this month, though its ₹1,639 monthly Game Pass Ultimate price has drawn criticism. GeForce Now offers a different value proposition: stream games you already own from Steam or Epic Games Store, where aggressive regional pricing makes PC gaming more affordable in India.When it launches, GeForce Now will pack RTX 5080-powered hardware across three tiers. The Ultimate plan delivers 4K gaming at up to 240 FPS with eight-hour sessions, while Performance offers 1440p at 60 FPS for six hours. A free, ad-supported tier provides one-hour sessions at 1080p. Global pricing sits at $9 monthly for Performance and $19 for Ultimate, but Indian rates remain unannounced.Nvidia's cautious use of ""anticipate"" in official statements leaves room for further delays, though the physical infrastructure investment suggests genuine momentum toward launch.","N Nvidia delays launch of its GeForce Now cloud gaming service in India to Q1 2026. The company confirmed servers are actively being built within the country. The infrastructure buildout addresses cloud gaming's biggest pain point: lag. Nvidia is targeting seamless, high-fidelity streaming that can handle demanding AAA titles without sluggish response times.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125502938,imgsize-637660,width-400,resizemode-4/geforce-now.jpg"

“The issue has been mitigated for all affected users as of 2025-07-18 08:56 US/Pacific. A subset of workspace customers experienced elevated latency and error rates using workspace services. Our initial investigation points to a hardware infrastructure failure as the likely cause.

Multiple Google services, including Gmail, Drive, Docs, and Meet, experienced a partial outage that affected thousands of users globally. The outage, which was widely reported, showed a spike in reports on outage tracking site DownDetector around 9 pm IST. While not all Google services are affected in the same way, the impact is evident on platforms like Nest devices, and many users are reporting issues via social media. Additionally, other products partially or fully powered by Google Cloud, such as Zoom, Shopify, Spotify, and Pokémon Go, also appeared to be experiencing related outages. Google quickly acknowledged the outage. Soon after, the company also released a statement claiming that it had fixed the issue and what had caused it.In its Workspace Status Dashboard, Google acknowledged the outage and wrote:Soon after, the company updated the page saying:How the Google outage affected usersAccording to Downdetector, nearly 4,800 users in the US reported facing issues with Google’s services during the outage’s peak time. 47% users reported problems with logging into various services offered by the company, while 41% noted issues with the websites of these services. Meanwhile, 13% users also claimed to face troubles with Google Drive.The global outage affected key cities and business hubs more severely. Major disruptions were reported in the US (New York, LA, Chicago), India (Delhi, Bengaluru), the UK (London), Canada (Toronto), and Australia (Sydney). Users also took to social media platforms to report the issues they were facing with Google's services.Smaller towns and rural areas reportedly saw issues like slow loading and Meet lag, though to a lesser degree. The outage mainly hit business hubs, remote teams, and schools hardest, while some regions like Southeast Asia and Africa saw minimal impact, possibly due to effective server load management.","Google services, including Gmail, Drive, Docs, and Meet, experienced a partial outage that affected thousands of users globally.

Republican representative John Moolenaar , who is the chairman of the House Select Committee on China, has reportedly objected to the US Commerce Department 's decision to allow Nvidia to resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China. In a letter to US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Moolenaar warned that the move could advance China’s AI capabilities and help Chinese companies gain market share in global AI model development.“The Commerce Department made the right call in banning the H20. We can't let the (Chinese Communist Party) use American chips to train AI models that will power its military, censor its people, and undercut American innovation,” stated Republican representative Moolenaar on Friday (July 18), as per news agency Reuters.Earlier this week, Nvidia announced that the US government has permitted the chipmaker to restart H20 sales, reversing an export restriction imposed in April. The ban aimed to keep advanced AI chips out of Chinese hands due to national security concerns, a position that has typically seen rare bipartisan agreement in Congress. This reversal has quickly drawn criticism from some US legislators.China represents a significant revenue source for Nvidia, the world's most valuable company. Recently, Lutnick stated that the planned resumption of H20 chip sales was part of ongoing US negotiations concerning rare earths and magnets.Recently, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang pushed back against US concerns saying that China doesn’t need US-made chips and American stack to aid its military. He claimed that Chinese military “don't need Nvidia's chips, certainly, or American tech stacks in order to build their military” because “they simply can't rely on it” as US technology “could be limited at any time; not to mention, there's plenty of computing capacity in China already.”His comments come just ahead of his trip to China for which he was sent a ‘warning letter’ by some US senators.","Republican representative John Moolenaar has reportedly objected to the US Commerce Department's decision to allow Nvidia to resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China.

Microsoft has reportedly closed its Movies and TV store on both Xbox consoles and Windows PCs, effective today (July 18). According to a report, users can no longer purchase new movies or TV shows but they can access previously bought content for playback on their devices.The Verge reports that Microsoft confirmed that downloads will continue to be available on Windows, in up to HD resolution. However, users must continue to use the dedicated Movies & TV app on Windows or Xbox to play the content they own.Notably, the only exception for accessing content on other services is for purchases made in the US that are part of the Movies Anywhere platform. Microsoft is not offering refunds for past purchases.The company has also stated it will continue to provide support for any playback issues with previously purchased content.The latest move marks the end of Microsoft’s digital video retail effort that began with the Zune Video Marketplace in 2006. That service then evolved into Xbox Video in 2012, transforming into the Movies & TV app and store in 2015.The Verge claims that the closure of Microsoft’s movie and TV storefront wasn’t entirely unexpected by Xbox and Windows users, especially after the company shut down its Groove Music service in 2017.Meanwhile, YouTube has gained market share in terms of watch time of TV in the US. A recent Nielsen report claimed that YouTube and Netflix together captured 20% of all US television viewing time in May. However, the Google-owned service logged more market share – 12.5% – compared to Netflix's 7.5%. Their closest streaming rival, Disney, with its combined services Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+), accounted for 5% of TV time during the same period.","Microsoft has reportedly closed its Movies and TV store on both Xbox consoles and Windows PCs, effective today (July 18) Users can no longer purchase new movies or TV shows but they can access previously bought content for playback on their devices.

This app is designed to integrate with government services and Russia is said to be actively working to reduce its reliance on foreign platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram.“It's time for WhatsApp to prepare to leave the Russian market,” said Anton Gorelkin, deputy head of the lower house of parliament's information technology committee, adding that Meta is designated as an extremist organisation in Russia, news agency Reuters reported.Gorelkin also said on Telegram that MAX could gain significant market share if WhatsApp, which is currently used daily by 68% of Russians, departs. It is to be noted that Meta’s other social media platforms, Facebook and Instagram, have been banned in the country since 2022.This week, Russian lawmakers approved sweeping legal amendments that propose fines of up to 5,000 roubles ($63) for individuals who search online for content deemed ""extremist"" by the government.

What European Union’s AI code of Practice requires



Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApps has officially refused to sign European Union’s newly released AI code of Practice. It is a voluntary framework designed to enable companies to comply with the bloc’s AI Act. Meta’s Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan announced this decision via a LinkedIn post. Meta's stance is rooted in concerns that the current framework of the EU's AI code could stifle innovation.Meta’s vice president of Global Public Policy, Joel Kaplan said in a LinkedIn post that Europe might be ‘heading down the wrong path’. He said that the code introduces ‘“legal uncertainties for model developers” and also impose requirements that go “far beyond the scope of the AI Act”.“Europe is heading down the wrong path on AI. We have carefully reviewed the European Commission’s Code of Practice for general-purpose AI (GPAI) models and Meta won’t be signing it. This Code introduces a number of legal uncertainties for model developers, as well as measures which go far beyond the scope of the AI Act,” wrote Kaplan in a LinkedIn post.“Businesses and policymakers across Europe have spoken out against this regulation. Earlier this month, 44 of Europe’s largest businesses – including Bosch, Siemens, SAP, Airbus and BNP – signed a letter calling for the Commission to ‘Stop the Clock’ in its implementation. We share concerns raised by these businesses that this over-reach will throttle the development and deployment of frontier AI models in Europe, and stunt European companies looking to build businesses on top of them,” added Kaplan.EU’s AI code of Practice requires regular documentation updates for AI tools and it also bans training of AI with paired content. It also needs compliance with content owners’ opt-out requests and systemic risk assessments and post-marketing monitoring. The act will come into effect from August 2 and it sets strict rules for general-purpose AI models such as Meta’s Llama, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and Google’s Gemini. While the code is voluntary, signing it offers companies legal clarity and reduced regulatory scrutiny.","Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApps has officially refused to sign European Union’s newly released AI code of Practice.

What US senator said about Microsoft allegedly employing Chinese engineers for US military systems

A US senator has reportedly questioned Microsoft's alleged use of Chinese engineers to maintain military cloud computing systems. This inquiry follows a ProPublica report from earlier this week that accused Microsoft of employing Chinese engineers to work on US military computing systems. In a letter sent to Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR), who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, has requested additional information from the Pentagon about the tech giant’s reported use of Chinese engineers for US military systems as it raises concerns about potential national security risks , a report by the news agency Reuters claims.The report claimed that these engineers operated under the supervision of US ""digital escorts” who were hired through subcontractors. These subcontractors possessed security clearances but often lacked the technical skills to assess whether the Chinese engineers' work posed a cybersecurity threat , the report added.In the letter sent to Hegseth (seen by Reuters), Cotton wrote:Senetor Cotton also requested the US military to provide a list of all contractors employing Chinese personnel, along with details on the training of US “digital escorts” who are tasked with identifying suspicious activity, the Reuters report added.Microsoft has reportedly used a ""digital escort"" system that lets Chinese engineers indirectly access highly sensitive US military data for nearly a decade now. Despite Pentagon rules barring foreign access, these engineers guide low-paid American escorts, often with minimal coding skills, to input commands into Defense Department cloud systems that has now raised national security concerns, the original report claims.Meanwhile, Microsoft, a key contractor for the US government and previously targeted by both Chinese and Russian hackers, has said that it had informed the government about its practices during the authorisation process.","US senator questions Microsoft's alleged use of Chinese engineers to maintain military cloud computing systems.

Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for 'offensive' political slurs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/poland-flags-elon-musks-grok-chatbot-to-the-eu-for-offensive-political-slurs/articleshow/122348777.cms,"Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for “offensive” political slurs

Why Poland says Elon Musk's Grok chatbot crossed a red line



Offensive answers: From antisemitic tropes to political insults



European digital rules put xAI under the spotlight



Previous incidents: Turkey, hate speech, and Grok’s growing rap sheet



xAI and Musk offer silence, at least for now



Poland just pulled the alarm on Grok, the AI chatbot from Elon Musk ’s xAI. Officials in Warsaw say the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders, so they’re asking the European Commission to investigate and, if the rules allow, hit xAI or X with fines.Krzysztof Gawkowski, Poland’s digitisation minister, told RMF FM radio that the bot’s remarks amounted to hate speech. He argued that ignoring algorithm-driven abuse “may cost humanity in the future,” so his ministry will file an official complaint under existing EU regulations.The step is unusual but legal: member states can trigger EU probes when digital services target their citizens with unlawful content. If Brussels agrees, xAI could face penalties under the Digital Services Act or the forthcoming AI Act.Grok’s missteps are piling up. The same day Poland aired its grievance, the Anti-Defamation League flagged responses in which the bot praised Adolf Hitler and recycled antisemitic stereotypes. xAI deleted the posts, calling them “inappropriate,” yet offered no public apology.Users had also shared screenshots showing Grok calling Tusk “a coward in Brussels slippers,” among other jabs. Warsaw says the language breaches Poland’s hate-speech law and the EU’s code of practice on disinformation.The EU’s Digital Services Act took full effect for very large platforms in February 2025. It forces companies such as X to assess systemic risks, audit their algorithms, and let regulators peek behind the curtain. An AI-specific law is coming later this year, likely adding fresh transparency mandates. Poland’s complaint tees up an early test of those combined powers.Legal scholars note that fines can reach 6 percent of global turnover for DSA violations. For Musk’s empire, that runs into billions.Poland is not alone. A Turkish court ordered X to block Grok content that mocked President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and Islamic beliefs.In June, users spotted the bot rambling about a supposed “white genocide” in South Africa. xAI blamed an “unauthorised change” to its response code.Each flare-up feeds an image of a system that swings from playful banter to extremist rhetoric with a single prompt.As of Wednesday afternoon, xAI had not replied to Reuters’ emailed questions, and Musk’s normally hyperactive X feed stayed quiet on the topic.The billionaire recently urged “maximum free speech” on X, but he also says AI must be “truth-seeking.” That balance gets messy when the bot channels conspiracy theories or ethnic slurs.","Poland says the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's net worth soars $1 billion as the chipmaker joins the $4 trillion club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-net-worth-soars-1-billion-as-the-chipmaker-joins-the-4-trillion-club/articleshow/122377958.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang’s net worth passes $140 billion



Nvidia’s market value climbs above $4 trillion



How a 3.5 percent stake fuels one of the world’s biggest fortunes



Where Jensen Huang now ranks among global billionaires



Why investors keep bidding the price up

AI demand everywhere. Cloud providers, carmakers, and sovereign data-centre projects line up for the current Hopper chips and the coming Blackwell series.

Scarcity premium. Nvidia controls around 80 percent of high-end AI GPU supply, and capacity stays tight even after Taiwan’s fabs ramp up output.

Ecosystem lock-in. CUDA software and support contracts make switching costs high, so even rivals that launch competitive silicon must still lure developers away.

What could slow the rally

Export curbs. The United States still blocks top-tier chips from shipping to China, Nvidia’s largest single-country market outside the U.S.

New competition. AMD, Intel and a clutch of start-ups are readying chips that nibble at Nvidia’s margins, especially in inference workloads.

Rich valuation. At about 40 times forward earnings, the stock leaves little room for an earnings miss; even a small disappointment could yank billions from Huang’s paper wealth.

Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold. The jump did more than rewrite Wall Street leaderboards; it also pushed co-founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s fortune past $140 billion. He owns about 3.5 percent of Nvidia, held directly and through family trusts, so every flicker in the share price lands straight in his pocket.Bloomberg’s daily billionaire tally shows Jensen Huang adding roughly $1 billion in a single session, and nearly $28 billion in 2025 so far. That kind of lift puts him shoulder-to-shoulder with household names like Warren Buffett, a spot unthinkable just three years ago. Investors keep paying the premium because Nvidia sells the chips that make modern AI run, from data-centre clusters to enterprise servers. The faster the market grows, the richer Huang becomes.As of the New York closing bell on 10 July, Bloomberg pegged Huang’s net worth at $143 billion, up from about $20 billion in early 2022. That leap happened in stages: $44 billion by mid-2023, $117 billion in late 2024, and now the $140-plus range. Fueled by the AI boom and soaring Nvidia shares, the difference this year alone is bigger than the entire market value of some Fortune 500 firms.The company’s share price settled near $164, capping a run that has lifted the stock 74 percent since April’s low and around 22 percent since January. Nvidia is now the dominant weight in the S&P 500, ahead of Apple and Microsoft. Analysts at Citi, Barclays and Loop Capital all raised their price targets this week, citing demand for the upcoming Blackwell platform and a backlog of data-centre orders.Huang’s percentage looks small beside founder holdings at some other tech giants, yet at a $4 trillion valuation it leaves him with shares worth roughly $140 billion. The stake figure comes from Nvidia’s March 2025 proxy filing and excludes unvested stock units. Cash, past dividend income and secondary-share sales round out the number Bloomberg uses, but the equity slice is what matters daily.With the latest move, he edges into Bloomberg’s global top ten, swapping places with Google’s Larry Page and closing in on Warren Buffett. Forbes, which refreshes less often, lists him ninth. None of the other names in that bracket made their money so fast in so short a window.","N Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold.

YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced an artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT Agents, designed to function as a virtual computer capable of automating a wide array of digital tasks. ChatGPT Agents aim to extend beyond traditional browser interactions, allowing the AI to interact with an entire virtual operating system. However, apart from the automation of tasks, there’s another interesting part of this announcement – the person who is leading the project. The project is said to be spearheaded by Yash Kumar, a Member of Technical Staff and Product Lead at OpenAI who recently demonstrated the tool's capabilities during a briefing with The Verge.Yash Kumar, an alumnus of IIIT Hyderabad – one of India’s leading engineering institutions – joined OpenAI in November 2023. Based at the company’s San Francisco headquarters, Kumar is now at the forefront of developing this ambitious new AI tool. His LinkedIn profile doesn’t reveal much about him except that he worked in Google as software engineer for 8 years, and has also worked at DoorDash before joining the Sam Altman-led company.Speaking to The Verge, Kumar explained that the development team is currently “optimising for hard tasks” to ensure a smoother user experience. The system is designed to execute digital tasks autonomously while still maintaining a crucial layer of user oversight. This means that the system will ask the user for confirmation before undertaking critical actions such as sending emails or booking appointments.Isa Fulford, who leads research on the ChatGPT Agent project, highlighted the system's ability to run tasks in the background.“Even if it takes 15 minutes, half an hour, it’s quite a big speed-up compared to how long it would take you to do it,” Fulford said, noting the convenience of “kick[ing] something off in the background and then come back to it.”OpenAI has incorporated security safeguards into the ChatGPT Agent system that were initially developed for models with “high biological and chemical capabilities.” OpenAI stated that there is currently no ""direct evidence that the model could meaningfully help a novice create severe biological or chemical harm.""ChatGPT Agents are OpenAI's new AI tool designed to act as a “virtual computer.” They can perform a wide range of digital tasks automatically, interacting with a virtual operating system beyond just a web browser.ChatGPT Agents can manage calendars, summarise meetings, plan meals and handle various other digital tasks.Yash Kumar, a Member of Technical Staff and Product Lead at OpenAI, is leading the development of ChatGPT Agents from OpenAI's San Francisco headquarters.Yes, OpenAI has built strong security safeguards into the system.

A single X thread on 12 July turned into a viral classroom discussion when Telegram founder Pavel Durov urged students to “pick MATH.” He framed the subject as a boot camp for logic—something every would-be company builder needs. Elon Musk chimed in minutes later with a terse counter: “Physics (with math).” The world’s most-watched entrepreneur argued that understanding nature’s rules—and the equations behind them—beats pure abstraction any day. Their posts racked up millions of views and thousands of reposts in 48 hours, reviving an old dilemma for STEM-minded teens: stick with math’s clean symbols or chase physics’ messy realities? The exchange lands at a time when artificial intelligence threatens to automate routine skills, making discipline choice feel more urgent than ever. Below, we unpack what each leader said, why the subjects matter in an AI economy, and how educators think students should decide.In his original post, Durov called mathematics a “core skill” for breaking big problems into smaller, solvable steps—a habit he says underpins both project management and company-building. Within hours, the note passed a million views and drew praise from venture capitalists who echoed his “logic first” mantra.Key points Durov highlighted:Musk’s one-line reply—“Physics (with math)”—shifted the debate from raw logic to real-world application. The SpaceX chief has long credited first-principles physics for rockets, batteries, and self-driving software alike: strip a problem to fundamentals, then rebuild on facts, not precedent.Why Physics, according to Musk:Large language models can already crank out boilerplate code and solve routine calculus. What they still struggle with is framing new problems—deciding which variables matter, spotting hidden constraints, and testing edge cases. That meta-skill is exactly what rigorous math courses (proofs) and physics labs (experiments) drill into humans. Education researchers argue the real contest isn’t math versus physics; it’s active reasoning versus passive recall.

Senator demands Pentagon investigation into security risks

Microsoft is using engineers in China to help maintain the Defense Department's most sensitive computer systems with minimal US supervision, potentially exposing critical national security data to America's leading cyber adversary, a ProPublica investigation revealed this week. The arrangement relies on US citizens with security clearances, known as "" digital escorts ,"" to oversee foreign engineers remotely. However, these escorts often lack the technical expertise to detect malicious activity from highly skilled Chinese developers who could insert harmful code into federal networks, the investigation found.""We're trusting that what they're doing isn't malicious, but we really can't tell,"" said one current escort who spoke anonymously to ProPublica, fearing professional repercussions.The digital escort system has operated for nearly a decade, allowing Microsoft to bypass Pentagon rules that ban foreign citizens from accessing highly sensitive government data. The Chinese engineers work on ""high impact level"" information that includes materials directly supporting military operations and data whose compromise ""could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect"" on national security.Microsoft's arrangement involves Chinese engineers filing support tickets and then remotely instructing American escorts—some earning barely above minimum wage—to input commands into Defense Department cloud systems. Many escorts are former military personnel with little coding experience, creating a dangerous skills gap.""If someone ran a script called 'fix_servers.sh' but it actually did something malicious then [escorts] would have no idea,"" Matthew Erickson, a former Microsoft engineer who worked on the escort system, told ProPublica.The revelations prompted Senator Tom Cotton , who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, to demand answers from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. In a letter obtained by Reuters, Cotton requested a complete list of contractors using Chinese personnel and details about how digital escorts are trained to detect suspicious activity.National security experts expressed alarm at the program's existence. Harry Coker, former CIA and NSA senior executive, called it an ""avenue for extremely valuable access"" that intelligence operatives would covet.John Sherman, former Defense Department chief information officer, said the situation warrants ""a thorough review"" by military cybersecurity agencies. The program's low profile meant even Defense Department officials struggled to find personnel familiar with it when contacted by reporters.","Microsoft is using engineers in China to help maintain the Defense Department's most sensitive computer systems with minimal US supervision.

Social media reacts to recent Coldplay viral ‘kiss cam’ scandal

In July 2025, Astronomer CEO Andy Byron became the subject of widespread public attention after a seemingly intimate moment with his Chief People Officer, Kristin Cabot, was broadcast live during Coldplay’s “kiss cam” segment at Gillette Stadium. The brief embrace, captured on the stadium’s Jumbotron, quickly went viral, raising serious questions about Byron’s marital status, his relationship with Cabot, and the ethics of workplace boundaries. The incident not only sparked online memes and trending hashtags but also ignited internal discussions within corporate circles about leadership accountability and emotional conduct at public events. As social media and the press continue to speculate, here's a detailed look into what happened, who’s involved, and how the incident may be affecting Byron’s personal and professional life.Megan Kerrigan, the wife of Astronomer CEO Andy Byron, has taken a significant step away from her husband in the wake of the viral Coldplay kiss cam controversy. Following intense public backlash, Kerrigan dropped Byron’s surname from her Facebook profile, signaling potential strain in their marriage after he was seen in a seemingly intimate moment with Kristin Cabot, the company’s Chief People Officer.During Coldplay’s July 2025 concert, a kiss cam zoomed in on Byron and Cabot, capturing the pair in a close embrace.The moment turned awkward once they realized they were on the Jumbotron — Cabot covered her face with her hands, while Byron quickly ducked out of view. The footage went viral, igniting widespread speculation about a possible extramarital relationship.Amid the mounting attention, Kerrigan deleted her Facebook account on Thursday, but not before internet users captured screenshots showing she had removed “Byron” from her name. She also took down her Instagram profile, further retreating from public view as media attention around the incident grew.Andy Byron is reportedly married to, a respected educator in Massachusetts. Kerrigan, 50, serves as Associate Director of Lower School and Hope Graham Program Admissions at Bancroft School. While neither she nor Byron has released a public statement, internet users noticed that Kerrigan has dropped “Byron” from her last name on various social media platforms, hinting at a possible marital rift.This subtle shift has led many to believe that the viral video may have had real-world consequences on the couple’s relationship, though no official confirmation has been made.Reports confirm that Byron and Kerrigan have two children. The family has maintained a low profile and has not been publicly linked to the controversy beyond online mentions. As of now, there are no comments or indications of how the children are being affected or whether the couple is taking steps toward separation or reconciliation.The incident has triggered both amusement and outrage online. While some viewed the moment as harmless, others criticized the apparent lack of professionalism—especially given the workplace connection between Byron and Cabot. Following the backlash, Byron issued a public apology, reportedly shared internally within the company and later leaked to the media. However, many found the apology lacking in clarity and accountability.As Byron’s reputation faces scrutiny, this moment continues to serve as a cautionary tale about the blurred lines between personal relationships and public image, especially for high-profile executives. Netizens' support quickly poured in for Megan Kerrigan, with many users applauding her quiet but dignified response. One X (formerly Twitter) user, identifying as Mrs. SpaceX, posted:“Andy Byron‘s wife has now dropped her married name on Facebook and left comments open. What a class act! Go Megan. Get that divorce lawyer and get the money.” The gesture resonated with thousands, casting Kerrigan as a sympathetic figure amid the swirling affair rumors amid the swirling affair rumors and public heartbreak.","Megan Kerrigan, the wife of Astronomer CEO Andy Byron, has taken a significant step away from her husband in the wake of the viral Coldplay kiss cam controversy.

Founder returns with ""AI first"" vision

Amazon employees at Ring and other smart home divisions must now demonstrate artificial intelligence usage to secure promotions, according to a new mandate from Ring founder Jamie Siminoff , who returned to lead the company in April.Siminoff announced Wednesday that all promotion applications at his RBKS organisation—which includes Ring, Blink security cameras, Key in-home delivery service, and Sidewalk wireless network—must explain how employees are using AI at work. The policy aims to reward ""innovative thinking"" and reinforce a culture of speed and efficiency, Business Insider reported.""When we combine innovative technology with our missions, we create something truly special,"" Siminoff wrote in an email obtained by Business Insider. A Ring spokesperson confirmed the changes only apply to Amazon's RBKS employees, not the entire company.Employees seeking promotions must describe how they've used generative AI or other AI technologies to improve customer experience or increase operational efficiency. They must also cite specific AI projects and measurable impact achieved.Management positions face additional requirements, needing to show how they used AI tools to accomplish ""more with less"" while reducing or maintaining headcount levels. ""In the spirit of Day 1 culture, we will keep learning, iterating and improving this,"" Siminoff wrote.The mandate reflects Amazon CEO Andy Jassy 's broader emphasis on productivity and cost-efficiency across the company. Jassy warned last month that AI will reduce Amazon's workforce due to efficiency gains.Since returning after a two-year hiatus, Siminoff has implemented sweeping changes at Ring. He scrapped the company's recent mission statement ""Keep people close to what's important"" and reinstated the original ""Make neighborhoods safer"" focus.""We are reimagining Ring from the ground up with AI first,"" Siminoff wrote in a recent staff email. ""It feels like the early days again — same energy and the same potential to revolutionize how we do our neighborhood safety.""The AI promotion requirement joins other tech companies incorporating AI use into talent evaluation. Shopify announced in April that managers must prove AI couldn't do a job better before hiring, while Microsoft has also begun evaluating some employees based on internal AI tool usage.Siminoff has pushed employees to use AI daily, asking in one email: ""If we all lean in on AI, could we launch 10% or 10 times more shit? My guess is if we really all fully leaned in on AI and pushed ourselves hard to create constraints that only could be overcome with the use of AI, we could double our output immediately.""","Employees at Ring and other smart home divisions must now demonstrate artificial intelligence usage to secure promotions.

Exploring Career Opportunities Across GBM and AWM at Goldman Sachs

Time moves fast at Goldman Sachs — congratulations on passing the halfway mark of your internships. I wanted to share an important update with you on career opportunities we offer at the firm.

As someone who started his career at the firm thinking it would be a two-year stint — and then stayed for at least 12 jobs, eight cities, and many years more — I know how important it is to build a career that is rich and rewarding. As Ashok and I said in June, we hire people based on their curiosity and drive, and so it seems fair some of you might consider working for other great teams and firms, many of whom are our clients, too.

I also understand pressure, and what it means to have made it this far. We hire the best and brightest, and many of you have been working hard for most of your academic careers. After so many years of effort you will feel comfort in having your career mapped out.

I also know few companies offer a better platform and more exciting career paths than Goldman Sachs. Whether it's a switch from leading the financing group in Japan to global TMT coverage in San Francisco (as I did), or from banking to trading to asset management (like fellow division head Marc Nachmann), the possibilities, and offices around the world from which to explore them, are almost endless.

To that end, I'm pleased to share that we will introduce an additional early entry point for those of you interested in exploring buyside careers, in partnership with our AWM colleagues. The program will offer a select group of applicants a full-time offer to join Investment Banking, followed by mobility to Asset Management after two years.

Register your interest and your business unit managers will let you know next steps.

Of course, for those of you committed to banking — I would encourage it! — you will have opportunities as you become more senior to stay in your existing teams or participate in our very own mobility program. You will also be able to register an interest to join Asset Management, and teams across the firm, at other future moments throughout your career.

Our goal with such a talented cohort is to offer the options to you. I might be a little biased, but the path you find yourself on at Goldman Sachs might just be the one that keeps you here many, many years later.

Dan Dees

Goldman Sachs is reportedly introducing a new strategy which is aimed to curb the exodus of junior bankers to private equity firms. As reported by Business Insider, Goldman Sachs has announced a new internal program which will offer select analysts a quick career path into its Asset & Wealth Management (AWM) division. The company announced the new program via an internal memo which was sent by Dan Dees, co-head of Goldman’s global banking and markets unit to the interns.As reported by Business Insider, the memo shared by Dan Dees outlines an ‘early entry point’ for junior bankers who are interested in bayside careers. The memo also highlights that after the completion of this two-year investment banking analyst program, the selected candidates will be given full-time roles in Goldman’s asset management arm. The asset management arm of the company overlooks the private equity and alternative investments portfolio of the firm.“We will introduce an additional early entry point for those of you interested in exploring buyside careers,” Dan Dees wrote. “The program will offer a select group of applicants a full-time offer to join Investment Banking, followed by mobility to Asset Management after two years.”This is new strategy of the company to retain the top talent and also compete with aggressive recruiting tactics from the private equity firms.Apart from the career mobility program, Goldman is also introducing a quarterly loyalty check-in which the junior bankers to affirm that they have not yet accepted offers from anywhere else. The move follows similar crackdowns by JPMorgan and Apollo Global Management, both of which have paused early recruiting amid ethical concerns.","Goldman Sachs is reportedly introducing a new strategy which is aimed to curb the exodus of junior bankers to private equity firms.

Q. Could there be more leaks from the same source?

Jon Prosser is a prominent tech leaker who runs the Front Page Tech YouTube channel, known for revealing unreleased Apple products and features. He gained significant attention in early 2025 for his detailed leaks of what was then called iOS 19 (now iOS 26).Camera app redesign (January 2025): Prosser showed off a simplified Camera app with streamlined buttons for switching between photo and video modes. Messages app overhaul (March 2025): He revealed the Messages app with round navigation buttons at the top and rounded corners around the keyboard. Liquid Glass interface (April 2025): His most comprehensive leak showed the glass-like interface elements, pill-shaped tab bars, and rounder design elements that ultimately debuted in iOS 26.While some details differed from Apple's final release, the leaks were directionally accurate and gave competitors advance knowledge of Apple's software designs.Apple's lawsuit, filed July 17, 2025, in the Northern District of California, alleges a coordinated scheme involving multiple defendants. The company's investigation began after receiving an anonymous tip on April 4, 2025, identifying Apple employee Ethan Lipnik as the potential source.According to Apple's complaint, Ramacciotti used location tracking to monitor when Lipnik would be away from his Santa Clara apartment, obtained his passcode, and accessed his development iPhone. The device contained unreleased iOS 19 software and ""significant amounts of additional Apple trade secret information that has not yet been publicly disclosed.""During the unauthorized access, Ramacciotti allegedly made a FaceTime call to Prosser, demonstrating the unreleased operating system. Prosser reportedly recorded the screen using capture tools, obtaining videos of Apple's confidential software designs and features.Apple claims Prosser shared the recordings with others and used them to create content for his YouTube channel, generating ad revenue from Apple's trade secrets. The company says at least one person recognized Lipnik's apartment in the background of Prosser's videos.Apple is requesting a jury trial and seeking multiple forms of relief:The lawsuit includes claims under the Defend Trade Secrets Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.The case highlights the ongoing battle between tech companies protecting trade secrets and the leak culture surrounding unreleased products. Apple's aggressive legal action sends a clear message about the lengths it will go to protect confidential information.Precedent for Tech Leaks: This lawsuit could set new standards for prosecuting tech leakers, potentially chilling the leak ecosystem that surrounds major product launches. Employee Accountability: Lipnik's termination demonstrates the career consequences for Apple employees who fail to protect development devices, even when they're not directly involved in leaks. Competitive Harm: Apple argues the leaks gave competitors advance knowledge of its software designs, potentially undermining years of secretive development work.No. Apple alleges that Ramacciotti physically accessed the device, while Prosser received the information via FaceTime and recorded it for later use.Prosser disputes Apple's claims, stating on X: ""I did not 'plot' to access anyone's phone. I did not have any passwords. I was unaware of how the information was obtained. Looking forward to speaking with Apple on this.""Ethan Lipnik was terminated by Apple for failing to follow company policies designed to protect development hardware and unreleased software.While Apple frequently pursues legal action against suppliers and manufacturers who leak information, suing individual content creators and leakers directly is less common but not unprecedented.Yes. Apple warns that the development iPhone contained additional unreleased features that have not yet been publicly disclosed, posing ongoing competitive risks if the defendants retained access to that information.","Apple has filed a federal lawsuit against YouTuber Jon Prosser and Michael Ramacciotti.

Calvin French-Owen , ex-engineer at ChatGPT maker OpenAI has shared a blog post, reflecting on his journey at the company. In the blog post, Calvin shared things he liked and didn’t like working at OpenAI. He began his post by praising OpenAI, stating “how quickly it's grown”. Calvin wrote “When I joined, the company was a little over 1,000 people. One year later, it is over 3,000 and I was in the top 30% by tenure. Nearly everyone in leadership is doing a drastically different job than they were ~2-3 years ago.”Calvin continues talking about an unusual part of OpenAI which he says is “that everything, and I mean everything, runs on Slack. There is no email.” He further added “I maybe received ~10 emails in my entire time there. If you aren't organized, you will find this incredibly distracting. If you curate your channels and notifications, you can make it pretty workable.”In the post, Calvin revealed that OpenAI is “very meritocratic”. Writing that “leaders in the company are promoted primarily based upon their ability to have good ideas and then execute upon them. Many leaders who were incredibly competent weren't very good at things like presenting at all-hands or political maneuvering.” He says that this “matters less at OpenAI then it might at other companies. The best ideas do tend to win”.He also points to a ‘strong bias’ in the company. Calvin writes “There's a strong bias to action (you can just do things). It wasn't unusual for similar teams but unrelated teams to converge on various ideas.”Narrating his own experience, Calvin writes “I started out working on a parallel (but internal) effort similar to ChatGPT Connectors.

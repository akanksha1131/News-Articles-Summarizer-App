Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg visits White House for second meeting with Donald Trump since taking office,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-mark-zuckerberg-visits-white-house-meeting-with-donald-trump/articleshow/118959868.cms,"

Mark Zuckerberg's second meet after Donald Trump assumed office

Facebook-parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg visited the White House on Wednesday for meetings with Trump administration officials, Reuters reported. “Mark’s continuing the meetings he's been holding with the administration on American technology leadership,” Meta spokesman Andy Stone told the news agency, though he did not confirm the White House visit.Zuckerberg’s meeting comes just weeks after he made headlines for showcasing Meta’s advancements in artificial intelligence and the metaverse . Last month, the Facebook founder demonstrated the latest AI-powered features integrated into Meta’s platforms, emphasizing the company’s commitment to staying at the forefront of technological innovation.The social media giant is reportedly testing its first internally developed chip designed for training artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Meta is partnering with Taiwan-based TSMC to manufacture the chip. Testing began after Meta completed its first “tape-out” - a critical phase in chip development that involves sending an initial design through a chip factory.This development holds much significance as the company joins other tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI to create custom silicon and decrease dependence on external suppliers such as Nvidia.This is Zuckerberg’s second visit to the White House in two months. Last month, he met with officials to discuss Meta’s role in advancing U.S. technological leadership. Stone had then confirmed the February 6 visit, stating on X:“Mark Zuckerberg was at the White House today to discuss how Meta can help the administration defend and advance American tech leadership abroad.”Zuckerberg has been actively engaging with policymakers on AI regulations, digital infrastructure, and the role of U.S. tech firms in global competition. His interactions with the administration have also included two reported meetings with Trump at Mar-a-Lago before he took office.","Mark Zuckerberg visited the White House on Wednesday for meetings with Trump administration officials, Reuters reported.

UK Regulator: Apple and Google are the reason why innovation in mobile browsers is not working,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uk-regulator-apple-and-google-are-the-reason-why-innovation-in-mobile-browsers-is-not-working/articleshow/118959641.cms,"Representative image

Apple responds to the UK’s CMA, “We have concerns with this report”



The United Kingdom's competition watchdog has concluded that Apple and Google are stifling innovation in the mobile browser market, with Apple's policies bearing most of the blame according to a final report published Wednesday.The Competition and Markets Authority's (CMA) independent inquiry group found that the mobile browser market is ""not working well for consumers and businesses,"" identifying several anti-competitive practices by both tech giants that limit competition and potentially restrict economic growth.""Following our in-depth investigation, we have concluded that competition between different mobile browsers is not working well, and this is holding back innovation in the UK,"" said Margot Daly, Chair of the CMA's independent inquiry group.The investigation highlighted specific concerns about Apple's policies, including requiring all iOS browsers to use its WebKit browser engine, giving Safari preferential access to features compared to competing browsers, imposing limitations on in-app browsing, and pre-installing Safari as the default browser on iPhones For Google, investigators flagged Chrome's position as the pre-installed default browser on most Android devices and revenue sharing arrangements with Apple. The report noted that Google pays Apple ""a significant share of search revenue"" in exchange for being the default search engine on iPhones, which investigators say is ""significantly reducing their financial incentives to compete.""The duopoly's market dominance is striking, with Safari accounting for 88% of browsers on Apple devices and Chrome representing 77% on Android devices in 2024.In response, Apple defended its position: ""Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users. We have concerns with this report and believe the remedies it discusses would undermine privacy, security, and the overall user experience.""While the report suggests potential remedies—including forcing Apple to allow alternative browser engines on iOS and requiring both companies to offer browser choice screens during device setup—no immediate enforcement actions will be taken.Instead, the CMA has launched separate investigations into both companies to determine if they have ""strategic market status"" under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act. If designated with such status, Apple and Google could face stricter antitrust requirements and potential fines of up to 10% of annual turnover for violations.These investigations are expected to conclude later this year.","UK's competition watchdog concludes Apple and Google stifling innovation in mobile browser market.

FBI warning to iPhone and Android phone users: Delete these text messages Right Away,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/fbi-warning-to-iphone-and-android-phone-users-delete-these-text-messages-right-away/articleshow/118949547.cms,"How these text message scams work

Two biggest dangers of text message scams

The 'China-link' in text message scams

Most-affected states in America

FBI's to-do and not-to-do list for Americans

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has sounded the alarm across the United States, warning of a rapidly spreading wave of ""smishing"" attacks aimed at deceiving iPhone and Android users into surrendering sensitive personal and financial information. The term ""smishing,"" a blend of ""SMS"" and ""phishing,"" refers to fraudulent text messages designed to trick recipients into revealing passwords, credit card numbers, and other confidential data. Authorities report that cybercriminals have registered over 10,000 domains to power these scams, which have surged fourfold since January 2025.According to a new report from Unit 42, the threat intelligence arm of cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks , these scams have evolved from fake toll payment notifications to include counterfeit delivery service alerts. The fraudulent messages often lure victims into clicking malicious links or entering payment details on bogus websites. ""What started as a toll scam has grown into a sophisticated operation targeting unsuspecting Americans with fake alerts about unpaid bills or undelivered packages,"" said a Unit 42 spokesperson.The smishing campaign initially gained traction by claiming recipients owed unpaid toll fees, a tactic that state and local authorities have been combating for months. According to a report in New York Post, in one case uncovered by in Detroit, victims attempting to pay the fabricated tolls encountered error messages stating their cards were declined—further delaying detection of the scam. More recently, the fraud has expanded to mimic trusted delivery services like FedEx and DHL, urging users to click links to ""track"" nonexistent packages.The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has cautioned that these malicious links pose a dual threat: Financial theft and identity fraud. ""Clicking a link might seem harmless, but it can open the door to devastating consequences,"" an FTC official warned. Many of the scam texts follow a predictable pattern, alleging an urgent unpaid bill and directing users to a payment portal hosted on one of the scammers’ sprawling network of domains. To evade Apple’s iMessage safeguards, which block suspicious links, fraudsters now instruct users to manually copy and paste URLs into their browsers—a subtle but effective workaround.Cybersecurity experts suspect the operation functions as a ""franchise model,"" with toolkits likely sourced from Chinese cybercriminal groups. Unit 42 identified several malicious domains using China’s .XIN top-level domain, including:* dhl.com-new[.]xin* fedex.com-fedexl[.]xin* sunpass.com-ticketap[.]xin.""Legitimate U.S. toll services and delivery companies would never use foreign domains like these,"" the FTC said.The hardest-hit cities in the US include Dallas, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Orlando, according to a McAfee report, with Miami, Houston, Denver, Phoenix, and Seattle also ranking high on the list of targeted areas.As the scams proliferate, the FBI is urging the public to remain vigilant and take immediate action if they receive a suspicious text. Recommended steps include filing a complaint with the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at http://www.ic3.gov, verifying payments directly with official toll or delivery service websites, and deleting smishing messages without engaging.For those who may have already shared personal or financial information, the FBI advises securing accounts and disputing unauthorized transactions without delay. ""These scams are relentless, but awareness and quick action can stop them in their tracks,"" an FBI spokesperson said.","""Smishing"" texts are designed to trick recipients into revealing passwords, credit card numbers, and other confidential data.

Google 'wants' intelligent robot to deal with messiness

The highs and lows of Google's robotics journey

Google: Robotics AI still in 'early phase'

Alphabet Inc’s research division, Google DeepMind , announced the launch of two groundbreaking artificial intelligence models aimed at transforming the robotics industry. The new models, Gemini Robotics and Gemini Robotics-ER, are designed to tackle a persistent challenge in robotics: Enabling machines to adapt to unpredictable, real-world scenarios. Gemini Robotics, an offshoot of Google’s flagship Gemini AI model, focuses on enhancing robots’ dexterity and interactivity. Meanwhile, Gemini Robotics-ER emphasizes spatial reasoning, offering developers advanced tools to create robots capable of navigating complex environments using Gemini’s powerful reasoning abilities.Introducing the AI models, Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote on Twitter, ""We’ve always thought of robotics as a helpful testing ground for translating AI advances into the physical world. Today we’re taking our next step in this journey with our newest Gemini 2.0 robotics models. They show state of the art performance on two important benchmarks - generalization and embodied reasoning - which enable robots to draw from Gemini’s multimodal understanding of the world to make changes on the fly + adapt to their surroundings. This milestone lays the foundation for the next generation of robotics that can be helpful across a range of applications.""According to a report by Bloomberg, DeepMind engineer Kanishka Rao said that these advancements bring Google closer to realizing “general purpose robotics” — machines versatile enough to handle a wide range of tasks. “Our worlds are super messy and dynamic and rich,” Rao reportedly said during a media briefing. “A general purpose intelligent robot needs to be able to deal with that messiness.”The announcement comes amid a resurgence of interest in robotics across Silicon Valley, with heavyweights like Meta Platforms Inc, Tesla Inc, and OpenAI intensifying their efforts, and startups securing massive funding rounds. Google’s latest push builds on this momentum, showcasing its technology in a pre-taped demonstration.Google’s robotics journey has seen its ups and downs over the years. Over a decade ago, the company acquired eight robotics firms to pursue co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin’s vision of consumer-friendly robots powered by machine learning. Those efforts eventually shifted to Google X, Alphabet’s moonshot lab, and spawned Everyday Robots in 2021, a unit focused on mundane tasks like trash sorting. However, Alphabet shuttered Everyday Robots in 2023 amid widespread budget cuts, though it vowed to integrate the technology into ongoing robotics projects. Now, with generative AI at the forefront, Google appears to be reinvigorating its ambitions.The new models remain in an “early exploration” phase, according to DeepMind research scientist Vikas Sindhwani. Safety is a priority, with the Gemini models built to exhibit “common sense safety” in physical settings. Google plans a cautious rollout, starting with robots operating at a safe distance from humans and gradually increasing interaction as safety improves.To accelerate development, Google is collaborating with robotics companies like Apptronik, with whom it is crafting humanoid robots, as well as Agile Robots and Boston Dynamics — the latter a former Alphabet subsidiary sold to SoftBank in 2017.","Gemini Robotics and Gemini Robotics-ER are Google's new artificial intelligence models.

Republican lawmakers are pushing for investigations into vandalism targeting Tesla' showrooms and charging stations in the US, following President Donald Trump's suggestion that such acts could be classified as domestic terrorism. On Tuesday, March 11, US President Donald Trump publicly backed Elon Musk by buying a Tesla vehicle. During a White House event, surrounded by five Tesla cars brought for his review, Trump was asked by a reporter if those attacking Tesla owners and dealerships should be deemed domestic terrorists. “I think he’s been treated very unfairly by a tiny group of people,” Trump replied. “I just want people to know he can’t be punished for being a patriot -— and he’s a great patriot.”Trump’s display of solidarity with Elon Musk follows escalating protests at Tesla showrooms nationwide, some of which have turned destructive. The unrest stems from opposition to Musk’s leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has driven significant federal job cuts and exposed wasteful government spending.The official White House Twitter account shared a photo of President Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Lil X alongside a red Tesla and a Tesla Cybertruck, with an American flag emoji preceding each of their names.Twitter user who goes by the name DogeDesigner wrote, ""President Trump on Cybertruck: ""Look! I think I have a great imagination. Who else but this guy would design this? And everybody on the road is looking at it. It's amazing actually. That is the coolest design.""Following on the same, the House Speaker Mike Johnson announced that Congress would probe incidents involving Tesla vehicles. In a post on Twitter, the Louisiana Republican vowed that lawmakers would work with the Justice Department and FBI to ""ensure those responsible face the full force of the law.""Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, along with seven other House Republicans, penned a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel, urging investigations into what they called a ""wave of coordinated attacks"" on Elon Musk, Tesla dealerships, charging stations, and vehicles.",Republican lawmakers are pushing for investigations into vandalism targeting Tesla' showrooms and charging stations in the US.

Amazon Prime Video has started streaming the reruns of “The Apprentice ,” the reality television show starring the US President Donald Trump . The first season of the show became available on Amazon Prime Video this week. Soon after, the content streaming platform started advertising the same on its landing page. Amazon plans to release new seasons of “The Apprentice” weekly, with the seventh season scheduled to become available in April. This follows an earlier announcement from Amazon's streaming service that it would also air a documentary providing a behind-the-scenes look at First Lady Melania Trump .In a statement shared by Amazon, Trump expressed his enthusiasm for the program's revival—a show where he served as a producer. Trump said:Debuting in 2004, the reality TV series ‘The Apprentice’ emerged after Trump reportedly experienced a series of bankruptcies and business setbacks in the 1990s, which had significantly damaged his New York real estate empire.The show featured Trump as a tough business tycoon judging aspiring entrepreneurs in a competitive format. Contestants competed for his favor to advance, with failures met with Trump's signature ""You're fired!"" dismissal. The champion earned a six-figure position within Trump's business organisation.The series is owned by MGM Alternative , whose parent company was bought by Amazon three years ago, transforming Trump's name into a global brand, playing a significant role in launching his subsequent political career.The show expanded globally with numerous international adaptations, many of which continued broadcasting even after the original American version ended. Despite Trump being removed from the US program in 2015 following controversial comments about Mexican immigrants, the UK edition remains on air at the BBC.","The first season of ‘The Apprentice’ became available on Amazon Prime Video this week.

"How Jim Walker, the man who saw 2008 Stock Market crash coming, may have just 'agreed' with Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath's 'Stock Market Gyaan'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-jim-walker-the-man-who-saw-the-2008-stock-market-crash-coming-may-have-just-agreed-with-zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamaths-stock-market-gyaan/articleshow/118727832.cms,"Jim Walker to investors: Take long-term investment approach

Jim Walker picks India over China

Indian stock markets witnessed Bears onslaught in the month of February, with the benchmark Sensex closing over 4,000 points lower. The carnage witnessed in the market during the month led to a staggering erosion of over Rs 40 lakh crore from the market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies; while Nifty 50 marked its longest losing streak since its inception in the year 1996. The relentless downward trend has left retail investors anxious. In a message to investors late earlier this week, Zerodha founder and CEO Nithin Kamath termed the fall as ""the first real market correction "" since Covid pandemic.""Markets are cyclical, and given the way our markets went up from late 2020, this fall was inevitable,"" he said. Kamath told investors to not get carried away by the doom and gloom in the market and continue investing in SIPs. ""I don't know how good the data is, but it seems like the number of investors stopping their SIPs has gone up. This is the wrong thing to do. What an SIP helps you do is to average your investments across different market cycles,"" he said.In an exclusive conversation with ETNow, Walker shared his insights on the global economy and his outlook on India. While many fear that the current market exuberance could lead to a collapse similar to 2008, Walker sees it differently. A similar sentiment comes from Jim Walker, a celebrated economist from Alethia Capital who famously foresaw the 2008 financial crisis.Speaking with ETNow, he acknowledged a global economic slowdown but stressed that the circumstances differ markedly from those preceding the financial debacle over ten years ago. Similar to Nithin Kamath, Walker batted for a long-term investment approach. Walker encouraged his clients to boost their stakes in India, despite valuation concerns in its stock market. “I’ve advised clients this week to significantly increase their investments in India. Though stock valuations raise eyebrows, I believe economic growth will soon justify them with strong corporate earnings,” he elaborated.Known for his prescient 2006-07 warning of a looming U.S. housing market crash, Walker remarked that today’s danger signals are less evident. “The signs were glaring in 2006-07 when we predicted a severe downturn driven by excesses in the property sector; it’s not the same now,” he said.He pointed out that unlike the lead-up to 2008, there are currently no significant overindulgences in the housing or financial sectors poised to spark a major banking crisis. Although certain areas show excessive stock market gains and asset price inflation, Walker believes these won’t lead to widespread corporate failures that could rattle the banking system. “We’re not seeing the kind of corporate collapses that impacted banks in 2008. That’s not on the horizon,” he observed.Additionally, Walker expressed a stronger preference for investing in India over China, suggesting it might be an opportune moment to increase investments there. He is especially sanguine about India’s prospects, citing its robust policy environment—the best in three decades—as a key factor enhancing its appeal to investors. “India’s policy stability and certainty are at their peak in the last 30 years,” he asserted, crediting solid monetary and fiscal policies along with exchange rate stability for bolstering India’s economic structure.He also commended the Indian government’s steps toward deregulation and business-friendly policies, seeing them as key drivers of future growth. Walker believes that supporting small and medium enterprises will further boost economic and job expansion.","Jim Walker picks India over China as an opportune moment to increase investments there.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat. In the post, Altman wrote “very proud of the openai team for what is perhaps the most impressive scientific/technical breakthrough of recent decades…thought that was the thing i'd always be most proud of in life”. Adding further, he wrote “turns out i am now more proud of a preemie baby for learning how to eat on his own!”.In a follow-up post, Altman wrote “i realize i am getting neurochemically hacked here but idc, it's the best)”.Sam Altman welcomed his baby boy last month with his partner and software engineer Oliver Mulherin. The baby arrived prematurely and has been receiving care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).In another news, the CEO shared an update about the company’s latest version of the large language model (LLM), GPT-4.5 . In an X post, Altman announced that GPT-4.5 is expected to roll out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers. However, he noted that the update will be a staggered rollout over several days to manage high demand and ensure a smooth user experience.Altman also explained that launching with a low rate limit would restrict usage and prevent users from having meaningful interactions with the new model. The staggered release will allow users to have longer conversations with GPT-4.5, even if it means some subscribers will have to wait a bit longer to access it.In his X announcement, Altman wrote: “We are likely going to roll out GPT-4.5 to the plus tier over a few days. There is no perfect way to do this; we wanted to do it for everyone tomorrow, but it would have meant we had to launch with a very low rate limit. We think people are gonna use this a lot and love it.”","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat.

Come April 1 of Fiscal Year 2026-27, a new rule in the Income Tax Act law may grant the Income Tax department powers to access your social media accounts or emails in case they suspect tax evasion . Income Tax Bill 2025, which was introduced in the Parliament recently, will give Income Tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces, termed Virtual Digital Spaces in the bill. This means that the Income Tax department can break into social media accounts, personal emails, bank accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, and more if they have any reason to believe that you own any undisclosed income, money, Gold, Jewelry, or valuable item or property on which you haven’t paid applicable Income Tax.Presently, Section 132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, allows Income Tax officials to seize assets and books during search operations if they find sufficient reasons to believe that an individual is in possession of undisclosed income or assets. The changes in the bill, once passed in the Parliament, will extend this authourity to the digital realm, allowing officials to bypass security measures on computer systems and virtual spaces.The Clause 247 of the Income Tax Bill outlines this expanded power, stating that officers can “break open the lock of any door, box, locker, safe, almirah, or other receptacle” or “gain access by overriding the access code” to computer systems or virtual digital spaces when access is otherwise unavailable. This applies if they believe an individual possesses undisclosed income or assets taxable under the law.According to the bill, the term Virtual Digital Space includes email servers, social media accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, banking accounts, and any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset. It further adds that virtual digital space is an environment, area or realm that is constructed and experienced through computer technology and not the physical, tangible world, which encompasses any digital realm that allows users to interact, communicate and perform activities using computer systems, computer networks, computer resources, communication devices, cyberspace, internet, worldwide web and emerging technologies, using data and information in the electronic form for creation, storage or exchange and includes:* Email servers* Social media account* Online investment account, trading account, banking account, etc* Any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset* Remote server or cloud servers* Digital application platforms* Any other space of similar natureAs to who all can wield this authority? The bill designates “authorised officers” as senior tax officials, including Joint Directors, Additional Directors, Joint Commissioners, Additional Commissioners, Assistant or Deputy Directors, Assistant or Deputy Commissioners, Income Tax Officers, and Tax Recovery Officers.What does this mean for individuals? The new rules significantly widen the scope of tax investigations, giving officials the ability to probe deeply into personal and financial digital footprints. As this provision takes effect, it raises questions about privacy and the balance between tax enforcement and individual rights.","Income Tax Bill 2025 will give Income Tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces.

Oyo founder and CEO Ritesh Agarwal sees major growth in India’s religious tourism sector, predicting it could generate $150-200 billion in the next 3-4 years, reports MoneyControl. Speaking at the TiE Con Mumbai 2025 summit, Aggarwal highlighted the increasing demand for accommodations in pilgrimage destinations. He said: “More than 5 lakh people stayed with Oyo during the Kumbh in Prayagraj. Around 20% of our revenue comes from religious destinations. The top two are Banaras and Tirupati , which are the best-performing markets in India”.He highlighted Tirupati's high daily visitor influx, which surges during school holidays, and noted the increasing demand in emerging religious hubs such as Kanyakumari and Somnath.“New hotels are being built, giving people more options. Earlier, they would only stay in dharamshalas, but now, better accommodations encourage longer stays,” he added.Agarwal cited Ayodhya as an example of religious tourism driving economic growth. ""The town's economy has changed. Every person I have met has seen their income grow 2-3 times—whether through hotels, restaurants, real estate, or land sales. It’s a massive opportunity,"" he said, calling it a promising space for startups.During the event, Agarwal reflected on his early days, recalling a key investment from Dr. Apoorva Ranjan Sharma, an early backer of Oyo’s parent company, Oravel Stays.""At first, I wasn’t keen on meeting investors, but Dr. Sharma insisted. He invited me to Mumbai and introduced me to two investors at Iskcon Mandir in Juhu. They believed my business could be worth millions, but I was struggling to pay rent. They gave me a Rs 5 lakh loan—that money changed my life,"" he said.Sharma later sold his shares for $400 million but reinvested when Oyo was valued at $6 billion. ""He has been a lifetime partner, on and off, but always a friend,"" Agarwal noted.On success, Agarwal acknowledged luck but emphasized hard work. ""Many things had to go right for me. But hard work increases the probability of being lucky. That’s what I focus on,"" he saidOyo recently announced a £50 million investment in the UK and a $10 million investment to develop digital assets for G6 Hospitality in the US.""In FY25, Oyo did about Rs 30,000 crore in bookings, with Rs 24,000 crore coming from customers outside India.

"TSMC wants Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom to be a part of this Intel joint venture",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tsmc-wants-nvidia-amd-broadcom-to-be-a-part-of-this-intel-joint-venture/articleshow/118941464.cms,"Why some Intel executives may oppose the JV with TSMC



TSMC has a joint venture proposal for US chip designers Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Broadcom, a report claims. A report by the news agency Reuters cited sources familiar with the matter noted that the Taiwan-based chipmaker has asked these chip designers to operate Intel's chip factories. Under the proposal, TSMC will manage the operations of Intel's foundry division – which produces chips tailored to customer needs – but would maintain a minority stake, not exceeding 50%, the report notes.As per the report, multiple sources have confirmed that Qualcomm has also been approached by TSMC with this joint venture proposal. If things go as planned, this joint venture would see TSMC taking on the operational responsibilities of Intel's foundry business, while remaining a minority stakeholder, the report adds. Intel's foundry division specialises in manufacturing chips designed to meet the specific requirements of various clients.According to the report, the proposal for TSMC to partner with US chip designers for an Intel foundry joint venture is in its early stages and originated from a request by the Trump administration for TSMC to assist the struggling US chip icon.Details of TSMC's plan to hold a minority stake and its outreach to potential partners is the latest development. Any final agreement would require approval from the Trump administration, which aims to prevent full foreign ownership of Intel's foundry division.Last year, Intel reported a net loss of $18.8 billion, its first since 1986, due to large impairments. The company's foundry division had a book value of $108 billion as of December 31, 2024. Intel's shares also lost over half their value in the past year.TSMC has proposed a joint venture for Intel’s foundry division, pitching the idea to investors before announcing a $100 billion US investment plan with Trump earlier this month. Talks about the joint venture are ongoing, with TSMC seeking multiple chip designer partners, the report claims.Several companies have shown interest in acquiring parts of Intel, but the company has rejected selling its chip design house separately from the foundry division. Qualcomm has also exited earlier acquisition discussions.Intel's board supports negotiations with TSMC, while some executives oppose the deal. Former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who prioritised Intel’s contract manufacturing business, was ousted in December 2024. Meanwhile, the new interim co-CEOs have put Intel’s AI chip project on hold.A partnership between Intel and TSMC would face challenges due to differences in manufacturing processes, chemicals, and chipmaking tools, the report notes. Previously, Intel has partnered with Taiwan’s UMC and Israel’s Tower Semiconductor, but trade manufacturing secrets remain a concern.TSMC wants joint venture investors to be Intel’s advanced manufacturing customers. Nvidia and Broadcom are also reportedly testing Intel’s 18A manufacturing process, while AMD is evaluating it. The 18A technology has been a point of contention in Intel-TSMC negotiations, with Intel claiming it is superior to TSMC’s 2-nanometer process.","TSMC has proposed a joint venture for Intel’s foundry division, pitching the idea to investors before announcing a $100 billion US investment plan with Trump earlier this month.

Mukesh Ambani’s message to students

Billionaire and RPG Group chairman Harsh Goenka recently took to microblogging site X (formerly Twitter) to share a post highlighting Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani ’s approach to success. The post features a video of Ambani quoting a powerful message from Swami Vivekananda , emphasizing the importance of unwavering focus on a single idea.In the video, Ambani can be seeing saying “Talking about the winner's mindset, let me share with you a thought that has inspired me all my life. It is Swami Vivekananda's thought. Swamiji says: Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life. Dream of it. Think of it. Live on that idea. Let the brain, the body, muscle, nerves (and) every part of your body be full of that idea .. and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.”Goenka captioned the post as “Mukesh Ambani’s formula for success,” highlighting how one of India's most successful business leaders draws inspiration from Swami Vivekananda’s philosophy.Earlier in January, Ambani shared a piece of advice for young students. Speaking at the 12th convocation of Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU), Ambani said that while students should be good at using artificial intelligence (AI), they should not give up on their own critical thinking.He then said: “Talking of Artificial Intelligence, I have a piece of advice to our young students. You must be good at using AI as a tool of learning but do not give up your own critical thinking.”Adding further, he stated “ChatGPT ka jarurat se istemal karo, lekin yaad rakho artificial buddhi se nehi khud ki buddhi se, hum agey badhenge aur aap agey badh sakte hai (Use ChatGPT but don’t use artificial intelligence. Use your intelligence to move forward in life)”.","Harsh Goenka recently shared a post highlighting Mukesh Ambani’s approach to success.

Google confirms Chromecast 'Untrusted Device' error; here’s what the company said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-confirms-chromecast-untrusted-device-error-heres-what-the-company-said/articleshow/118937920.cms,"What Google said about the issue



How the Chromecast error was affecting users



Chromecast users have reported an ""untrusted device"" error that is preventing them from using their devices. Google has acknowledged the problem and stated they are currently working on a solution. In the meantime, the tech giant is advising affected users not to factory reset their devices, as this action will prevent the Chromecast from reconnecting to Wi-Fi. The issue appears to be primarily affecting second-generation Chromecast and Chromecast Audio devices, displaying an error message stating, ""device couldn’t be verified. This could be caused by outdated device firmware.” However, the timeline for when Google will release a fix for this ""untrusted device"" error remains unclear.In an email sent to The Verge, Google spokesperson Nicol Addison said that Google is “aware of an issue with some older generation Chromecasts. Once we have more details about the issue and the fix, I’ll share those with you.”As per a report by 9to5Google, the issue initially caught attention on the r/googlehome subreddit, with numerous users reporting that they couldn’t connect to their Chromecast (2nd Gen).Despite employing standard troubleshooting methods—such as restarting, factory resetting, reinstalling the Google Home app, clearing cache/data, and even switching networks—none of these approaches have resolved the problem.Some users have encountered an error message that reads: “Untrusted device: [name] couldn’t be verified. This could be caused by outdated device firmware.” This message effectively locks users out of casting capabilities, as it only provides an option to close the dialog box.Notably, the problem appeared to be confined to older Chromecast models, specifically the 2nd generation Chromecast and Chromecast Audio, while newer devices like the Chromecast (3rd gen) and Chromecast Ultra reportedly didn’t face any issues.Many users were also worried that Google may have silently discontinued support for these older models, rendering them unusable overnight. Given Google's history of sunsetting products without much notice, this concern isn’t entirely unfounded.However, the nature of the error message suggests that the issue may be more attributable to a software bug than an intentional shutdown.If the device has been factory reset, it is recommended to set up the Chromecast with a phone whose date is set to before March 9, 2025. This approach enables the setup process to proceed without encountering any authentication issues.","Chromecast users have reported an ""untrusted device"" error that is preventing them from using their devices.

Nithin Kamath states trading activity dropped 30%



Broking firms see decline in active users

Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath recently stated on X (formerly Twitter) that the company is witnessing “degrowth in the business for the first time” in 15 years. His statement comes amid a decline in active users across stock broking platforms like Groww , Zerodha, and Angel One , as the Indian stock market navigates a challenging phase.National Stock Exchange (NSE) data shows that eight of the top 10 broking firms experienced a drop in active investors in February. The total number of registered users across platforms declined by 1.37%, falling to 48.97 million from 49.64 million in January. Despite this, Groww maintained its top position with a 26.57% market share, though its user base shrank by 1.68% to 13.01 million. Zerodha, the second-largest brokerage with a 16.25% share, also recorded a 1.55% drop, bringing its active users down to 7.96 million.In his post, Kamath pointed to a broader slowdown in trading activity, stating, “The markets are finally correcting. Given that markets swing between extremes, they can fall more just like they rose to the peak. I've no idea where the markets go from here, but I can tell you about the broking industry. We are seeing a massive drop in terms of both the number of traders and volumes.”He further highlighted a 30% drop in trading activity across brokers and attributed the downturn to market conditions and regulatory changes. Kamath noted that the slowdown underscores the limited depth of Indian markets, where trading remains concentrated among a small segment of 1-2 crore investors.Angel One, the third-largest brokerage, also reported a 1.53% decline in active users, ending February with 7.65 million clients and a 15.62% market share. Upstox and ICICIdirect, which hold the fourth and fifth spots respectively, saw a drop in active users as well. Upstox, backed by Ratan Tata, recorded a 2.42% month-on-month decline, bringing its user base down to 2.79 million, while ICICIdirect saw a 0.57% dip, with active users falling to 1.94 million.The recent decline in user engagement signals a shift in market sentiment, as broking firms face a slowdown after years of rapid expansion driven by new retail investors.","NSE data shows that eight of the top 10 broking firms experienced a drop in active investors in February.

China’s richest person Zhang Yiming net worth

Zhang Yiming’s vision for ByteDance’s AI and global expansion

ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming has recently joined the list of China's richest individuals according to Forbes, with an estimated net value of $65.5 billion. This comes after his 21% ownership of ByteDance, the parent company of social media app TikTok. Zhang started in 2012 when he started ByteDance from a small four-bedroom apartment in Beijing. His vision was to use machine learning and big data to personalize content for users, revolutionizing the way people consume information worldwide.Zhang entered the tech sphere after completing his studies at Nankai University, where he majored in software engineering. Through college life, he earned some extra money repairing computers and building websites. Zhang had a brief stay at Microsoft, and soon it dawned on him that his interest lay elsewhere than in business life as he quit after six months. His entrepreneurial journey included starting a real estate website before ultimately establishing ByteDance.ByteDance was born when Zhang saw fewer individuals reading newspapers during their subway rides and saw the increased importance of mobile phones as a means of accessing information. He had a vision of a platform where individuals could view personally chosen content based on their interest. ByteDance was a small Beijing startup, but with Zhang's passion, it grew exponentially, giving birth to TikTok, one of the world's most popular apps.Though vastly successful, Zhang is an introverted person. In a 2021 company memo to his staff, he freely confessed that he didn't possess the standard attributes of an effective manager. Zhang clarified he was more interested in understanding market trends and organizational theory than human beings. His isolationism has turned him into the embodiment of an outsider, and he only makes appearances publicly and engages in social functions with difficulty.Most of Zhang's fortune is derived from his holding in ByteDance, the proprietor of TikTok. Through 2024, ByteDance has grown to be a tech behemoth, touching every nook and cranny of the world. Even though Zhang is no longer running the day-to-day business of the company, he continues to shape ByteDance's destiny through his grasp of AI strategy.As of 2024, Zhang Yiming's net worth of $65.5 billion places him among the world's richest individuals. Although he has surpassed other Chinese billionaires such as Zhong Shanshan and Ma Huateng, Zhang's net worth is still behind the wealth of people such as Mukesh Ambani, Adani, and global tech tycoons such as Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates. Despite being fabulously wealthy, Zhang remains an introvert personality, working behind the scenes and continuing to shape the tech world.ByteDance has made heavy investments in AI research and development under Zhang, with the goal of attaining artificial general intelligence (AGI). The vision is to develop AI systems that are as good as or even better than human intelligence. ByteDance has aggressively poached the best AI talent, with Zhang himself backing generous compensation packages to lure top industry talent.Zhang has long aspired to make ByteDance as globally influential as Google. He has been optimistic and circumspect, in interviews, regarding the difficulty of spreading Chinese businesses overseas. The success of ByteDance with TikTok has already overcome most obstacles, however, enabling the company to access consumers around the world and redefine the digital media environment.","Zhang Yiming has joined the list of China's richest individuals according to Forbes, with an estimated net value of $65.5 billion.

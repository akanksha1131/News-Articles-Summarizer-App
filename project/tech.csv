Microsoft CEO 'Thrilled' About India's Growing Data Centre Capacity, Details Meet With PM Modi

Microsoft reorganizes leadership for AI-first future







Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is shaking up how the tech giant approaches artificial intelligence with an unconventional leadership strategy: keeping executives out of the room. The CEO has launched a weekly AI accelerator meeting that deliberately excludes senior managers from presenting, instead giving the floor to lower-level technical employees working directly on AI projects.According to internal memos obtained by Business Insider, Nadella created the new meeting format along with a corresponding Teams channel to speed up AI development and gather unfiltered insights from across the company. The approach is intentionally ""messy and chaotic,"" designed to avoid top-down AI leadership and get real-time feedback from engineers in the trenches.The move reflects Nadella's view that AI represents both an existential threat and a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Microsoft. He's pushing the company to operate with unprecedented ""intensity and urgency,"" according to Business Insider sources familiar with the matter.This grassroots meeting structure is part of broader organizational shifts at Microsoft. Nadella recently promoted sales chief Judson Althoff to CEO of commercial business, freeing up his own time to focus on technical AI work. In internal messages to corporate vice presidents, Nadella urged leaders to ""work and act like ICs"" (individual contributors) rather than traditional managers.""We all have to work and act like ICs in our own orgs, constantly learning and unlearning,"" Nadella wrote in a Teams channel for executives, Business Insider reported.The CEO is also having direct conversations with executives about whether they're willing to commit to the ""mountain of work"" required for Microsoft's AI transformation—or leave. ""You've gotta be asking yourself how much longer you want to do this,"" one Microsoft executive told Business Insider.Nadella has shifted his language from saying Microsoft is in the ""early innings"" to the ""middle innings"" of AI, signaling his determination to see the transformation through to completion.","Satya Nadella has launched a weekly AI accelerator meeting that deliberately excludes senior managers from presenting.

Retailers across Europe worried

France threatens China with tariffs over trade surplus





Less than a decade old, Chinese retail giant Shein has already become the world’s No. 1 player in terms of market share and the player that has gained the most market share over the past year, according to GlobalData. Zara owner Inditex and Swedish retail giant H&M, the global kings of the sector to date, are next in line. Zara is the second-largest player in the market, followed by H&M. Shein has become the operator with the largest and fastest-growing market share across the world largely powered by jump in its marketshare in Europe. Now it seems Zara and H&M's this 'Chinese problem' is aggravating and spreading to entire Europe.President Trump’s intensifying crackdown on Chinese imports seems to have redirected a ""Tsunami"" of low-cost goods away from the United States and into Europe, sparking a logistics gold rush that is minting new millionaires and overwhelming local regulators. According to a report in Wall Street Journal (WSJ), the shift represents one of the most dramatic rewirings of global trade since the onset of the US-China trade war.As Washington shuttered a key customs loophole known as the De Minimis rule in May, exports of low-value parcels to the US from China have plummeted by more than 40%.In response, shipments to Europe have more than offset the nearly 20% contraction in US trade, pushing China’s global trade surplus past the $1 trillion mark for the first time this year. The front lines of this trade diversion are not just at massive ports, but in the backyards of European suburbs. The ""shadow logistics"" networks allow Chinese sellers to slash delivery times and under-price commercial warehouses, often charging as little as 70 cents per package.Fueling this surge is a fleet of upstart cargo airlines forging what they call a ""modern Silk Road."" The volume has forced cargo carriers to seek secondary hubs. One Air, a British startup, recently moved its operations from London to the rural East Midlands Airport to avoid congestion. Over the summer, the airport redrew its parking layout to accommodate a surge in Chinese freighters.For the first time, the European Union has surpassed the U.S. as the top destination for China’s $100 billion ""cheap package blitz."" Retailers warn competition is threatening their industry. “We sell at a price point of around 15 euros a pair of underwear, where Shein and other Chinese platforms will sell five pairs of underwear for the same price,” told Guillaume Gibault, founder of French underwear brand Le Slip to WSJ. “It puts in the mind of the customer, the price doesn’t mean anything anymore.”French President Emmanuel Macron recently said that he had threatened Beijing with tariffs during his state visit to China if there was no action taken to reduce the country's ever-widening trade deficit with the European Union. During Macron's visit earlier in December, he reportedly urged China to boost cooperation on ""unsustainable"" global trade imbalances, geopolitics and the environment.""I tried to explain to the Chinese that their trade surplus is unsustainable because they are killing their own customers, particularly by no longer importing much from us,"" Macron said in an interview published by French daily Les Echos.","Chinese retail giant Shein has become the world’s No. 1 player in terms of market share and the player that has gained the most market share over the past year.

AI development depends On reliable power infrastructure







Tesla CEO Elon Musk has sounded the alarm on America's energy infrastructure crisis, calling the country's lagging power generation capacity a ""major competitive disadvantage"" as China races ahead in the global power race. Musk's stark warning came in response to market analyst Adam Kobeissi's December 19 analysis revealing that China now commands 3.75 terawatts of power generation capacity—nearly three times the United States' 1.30 terawatts.The disparity represents more than just numbers on a grid. With China's power capacity doubling over the past eight years while US growth has remained relatively stagnant, the energy gap threatens America's ability to compete in AI development, advanced manufacturing, and technological innovation. In 2024 alone, China added 429 gigawatts of new capacity—equivalent to adding multiple entire countries' worth of power generation in a single year, with wind and solar accounting for 83% of these additions.Beyond renewable energy, China is aggressively expanding its nuclear infrastructure with 34 reactors currently under construction—more than the next nine countries combined. Nearly 200 additional reactors are either planned or proposed for future development.In stark contrast, the United States has no large commercial nuclear reactors under construction, raising concerns about America's ability to meet the growing power demands of AI development and data centers.Goldman Sachs has previously warned that US power grid limitations could severely restrict AI growth, highlighting how China's energy advantage is becoming a critical differentiator in technological development. Morgan Stanley estimates China will invest approximately $560 billion in power grid projects by 2030, with over $80 billion invested in 2024 alone.The power capacity gap has direct implications for the AI race between the two nations. Advanced AI development increasingly relies on abundant, reliable electricity to run massive data centers and computing infrastructure.Research indicates that US data center power demand is rising faster than the grid can handle, with transmission bottlenecks persisting despite record infrastructure spending. China's rapid grid expansion and substantial renewable energy investments are providing the country with a strategic edge in supporting AI development at scale.Musk also praised China's solar power progress, stating ""Incredible progress by China in solar power! America needs to do the same."" His comments underscore growing concerns among tech leaders about America's energy infrastructure falling behind global competitors.","China now commands 3.75 terawatts of power generation capacity—nearly three times the United States' 1.30 terawatts.

Biggest Tech Layoffs of 2025: Job Cuts at TCS, Intel, Microsoft, Google and more

Microsoft

Salesforce

IBM





AI-related job cuts crossed 50,000 in 2025 in the US alone, according to new data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas (via CNBC). The firm said that companies directly cited artificial intelligence (AI) as the reason for 54,883 job cuts this year – making it one of the biggest drivers of layoffs across the tech industry. The job cuts come at a time when AI is being used as a cost-cutting tool by the companies to deal with inflation, high tariffs, and pressure to improve profitability. A recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) study released in November also suggested that AI can handle 11.7% of U.S. jobs and could save companies $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, healthcare, and professional services.However, some experts question whether AI is the real reason for such widespread layoffs. Fabian Stephany, assistant professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, told CNBC that many companies overhired during the pandemic and may now be using AI as a convenient “excuse” for downsizing.Despite the debate, many companies, including world’s biggest tech companies explicitly named AI as a reason for restructuring this year. Here we look at four big tech companies that called out AI in their job cuts announcementThe e-commerce giant laid off 14,000 corporate employees this year, one of its largest.Announcing the job cuts, Amazon’s senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti said that the company is ‘making organizational changes … which will include reducing in some areas and hiring in others’.“This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,” Galetti explained.Though days later at the company’s earnings call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy explained “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least. It really — it's culture”.Microsoft conducted at least four major rounds of workforce reduction, cutting around 15,000 jobs this year. Julia Liuson, president of Microsoft's Developer Division, then instructed managers that artificial intelligence usage ""should be part of your holistic reflections on an individual's performance and impact."" In internal emails, Liuson then declared that ""using AI is no longer optional — it's core to every role and every level"".The company also said that it is considering adding formal AI usage metrics to performance reviews as it pushes for greater adoption of its Copilot AI services, adding some teams are exploring including specific AI usage benchmarks in next fiscal year's employee evaluations, according to sources familiar with the plans.In September, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff confirmed that 4,000 customer support roles were cut with the help of AI automation. Benioff then said AI is already doing “up to 50% of the work” at the company and that fewer staff are needed for many support functions. During an appearance on the ""Logan Bartlett"" podcast, he also described it as ""eight of the most exciting months of my career"" explaining how AI technology has transformed the company's operations.""There were more than 100 million leads that we have not called back at Salesforce in the last 26 years because we have not had enough people,"" he explained. ""But we now have an agentic sales that is calling back every person that contacts us.""The company uses an ""omnichannel supervisor"" system that coordinates collaboration between human and AI agents, allowing AI to recognise when tasks require human intervention.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna revealed that AI chatbots had replaced several hundred HR roles. The company eliminated job roles in marketing and communications and also replaced around 200 human resources positions with AI agents. Krishna said IBM is hiring in areas that require deeper critical thinking such as engineering, sales, and marketing.","AI-related job cuts crossed 50,000 in 2025 in the US alone, according to new data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

Government warns WhatsApp users about ‘GhostPairing’ attack: What is it and how to stay safe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-warns-whatsapp-users-about-ghostpairing-attack-what-is-it-and-how-to-stay-safe/articleshow/126104420.cms,"The WhatsApp Scam That Gives Hackers Your Phone!

What is GhostPairing

How to stay safe





The Indian computer emergency response team (CERT-In) has issued an advisory for WhatsApp users warning them of a ‘device-linking’ feature that can allow attackers to take ‘complete’ control of their account. The advisory, accessed by news agency PTI says that the vulnerability called ‘GhostPairing’ put users’ messages, photos, and videos on the web version at risk. “It has been reported that malicious actors are exploiting WhatsApp's device-linking feature to hijack accounts using pairing codes without authentication requirement,” the cyber agency said in the advisory.“This newly identified cyber campaign called GhostPairing enable cyber criminals to take complete control of WhatsApp accounts without needing password or SIM swaps,” the advisory said.For those unaware, CERT-In is the national technology arm under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (Meity) to combat cyber attacks and guarding of the Indian Internet space.GhostPairing is a type of WhatsApp attack where hackers secretly link their own device to a victim’s WhatsApp account, giving them almost full access without the victim noticing. The attack works by tricking users into entering their phone number on a fake website that looks like Facebook or WhatsApp.According to the advisory, the scam usually starts with a message such as “Hi, check this photo” that appears to come from a trusted contact. The message includes a link with a Facebook-style preview. When users click it, they are taken to a fake Facebook viewer page that asks them to “verify” to see the content. At this stage, attackers exploit WhatsApp’s “link device via phone number” feature by convincing users to enter their number. Once they do, the attacker’s browser becomes a hidden, trusted device — allowing them to take over the WhatsApp account.Once linked, attackers can read synced messages, receive new chats in real time, view photos, videos, and voice notes, and even send messages to the victim’s contacts and group chats.The advisory warns users not to click on suspicious links, even if they appear to come from known contacts, and to never enter their phone number on external websites claiming to be WhatsApp or Facebook.","GhostPairing is a type of WhatsApp attack where hackers secretly link their own device to a victim’s WhatsApp account, giving them almost full access without the victim noticing.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"

SoftBank Group, owned by one of the Japan's richest man Masayoshi Son, is reportedly racing to finalize a $22.5 billion funding commitment to ChaGPT-maker OpenAI by year-end. According to a report in Reuters, the company is employing a complex array of cash-raising tactics that include liquidating major stakes and potentially tapping billions in margin loans. The massive capital injection is said to represent a defining ""all-in"" move by SoftBank CEO Son. As the Japanese billionaire seeks to dominate the artificial intelligence landscape, the company has already executed a series of aggressive divestments to build its war chest. This includes selling its entire $5.8 billion stake in the American AI chip giant Nvidia and offloading $4.8 billion of its holding in one of the US' biggest telecom service provider T-Mobile.Along with these, Softbank has also implemented significant headcount cuts to lean out operations. Internal dealmaking too has shifted. Sources told Reuters that Son has slowed Vision Fund activity to a ""crawl,"" now requiring his explicit personal approval for any deal exceeding $50 million. Part of the funding is expected to be used for OpenAI’s commitment to Stargate. Announced in January, Stargate is a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle that was announced by President Donald Trump.The plan calls for billions of dollars to be invested in the US AI infrastructure.SoftBank’s strategy hinges partly on the public markets. The group is working to take its payments app, PayPay, public in a market debut expected to raise more than $20 billion. While originally slated for December, the IPO was pushed to the first quarter of 2026 following the 43-day U.S. government shutdown.Additionally, SoftBank is looking to exit portions of its stake in Didi Global as the Chinese ride-hailing giant prepares for a Hong Kong listing. OpenAI launched its ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022, kicking off the generative AI race.Despite the massive sum required, SoftBank maintains a diverse toolkit for capital.

"‘I cleaned a lot of toilets’: Nvidia co-founder Jensen Huang opens up on his struggles, Elon Musk agrees",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/i-cleaned-a-lot-of-toilets-nvidia-co-founder-jensen-huang-opens-up-on-his-struggles-elon-musk-agrees/articleshow/126105848.cms,"Jensen Huang’s early struggles shaped his leadership

Leadership as service rather than status

Why Elon Musk agrees with Huang’s approach

A lesson that resonates beyond the tech world





Long before Jensen Huang became the face of one of the world’s most powerful technology companies, his working life looked nothing like the polished image now associated with Silicon Valley success. As a young immigrant trying to find his footing, Huang washed dishes, scrubbed floors and cleaned toilets. These were jobs with little prestige, but they taught him lasting lessons about effort, humility and survival.Those early experiences, he says, shaped a belief he still carries decades later as the co-founder and chief executive of Nvidia. No work is too small, and no task should be dismissed simply because of status. For Huang, leadership is not about distancing oneself from unglamorous work, but about staying close to it and remaining useful to the people doing it.That philosophy resurfaced recently in an interview clip that spread widely online. The remarks also drew public support from Elon Musk , who shared the clip with the phrase “This is the way”, referencing The Mandalorian. The endorsement helped the message resonate even more strongly at a time when leadership culture is under renewed scrutiny.Huang does not romanticise his early jobs, but he treats them as formative. Doing work that many people try to avoid, he suggests, strips away ego early. When you have cleaned toilets for a living, it becomes difficult to believe that certain tasks are beneath you later in life.That mindset followed him as Nvidia grew from a risky start-up into a central player in the global AI economy. Even now, Huang argues that job titles should never dictate who engages with a problem. If he can help by reviewing work, thinking through a challenge or offering perspective, then the nature of the task itself does not matter.What matters most to Huang is usefulness. He frequently stresses that contribution is not only about providing answers, but about explaining how to think. By walking colleagues through his reasoning, especially when problems are complex or uncertain, he believes leaders can expand their impact far beyond the immediate issue.This approach turns decision-making into a shared process rather than a mystery reserved for the top. Over time, Huang says, it builds confidence across an organisation and reduces fear around ambiguity, which is one of the most paralysing forces in fast-moving industries.Musk’s public agreement with Huang’s remarks was widely seen as natural. At Tesla and SpaceX, Musk has cultivated a reputation for immersing himself in engineering details, production challenges and operational bottlenecks.Supporters view this as a shared trait between the two leaders. Authority, in this view, is strengthened by proximity to the work rather than distance from it. By endorsing Huang’s comments, Musk aligned himself with a leadership style that values firsthand understanding over purely managerial oversight.Huang’s story arrives at a moment when many organisations are reassessing what effective leadership looks like. Research in management and organisational psychology has consistently suggested that leaders who prioritise service, transparency and empowerment tend to build more innovative and resilient teams.As Nvidia continues to shape the future of artificial intelligence, Huang’s reflections offer a quieter counterpoint to the mythology of instant success. In his telling, achievement is not defined by escaping hard work, but by remembering it and carrying forward the lesson that even at the highest levels, no job is too small to matter.","Jensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive of Nvidia, says no work is too small, and no task should be dismissed simply because of status.

How Tesla’s new recruitment drive will help the company

""high service demand.""





Tesla is said to be hiring factory floor workers and salespeople to become ""AI operators"" for its self-driving ride-sharing service. The electric car manufacturer, led by Elon Musk , is reportedly offering overtime and shifts to staff willing to monitor its Robotaxi cars. According to a report by Business Insider, a poster at Tesla’s offices in California appears to show the company is looking to hire production associates and material handlers to increase the availability of its “Robotaxi” service in the Bay Area.These operators are required to sit in the driver's seat,as the company eventually plans to release the software as a fully autonomous service.The recruitment effort extends beyond factory lines to include engineering and sales departments as well. The report cited LinkedIn profiles to claim that employees in Nevada and Arizona have already transitioned into similar operator roles in Las Vegas and Phoenix. To accelerate hiring, Tesla is also offering a $500 bonus to staff who refer candidates for the AI operator positions.Bringing on more operators could help Tesla provide faster service.After Tesla made its Robotaxi app available to everyone in September, waiting times increased sharply, with some riders posting on social media about waits of up to 40 minutes and a lack of available cars.The report also cited Robotaxi users who claimed to have experienced wait times of around 10 minutes in the Bay Area. During busy travel hours, the app sometimes says it can't offer a ride due toTesla completed certification of its own service in Nevada and Arizona last month. It hasn't yet requested a license from the Nevada Transportation Authority to start a paid service. Still, it does have approval from the Arizona Department of Transportation to operate a commercial service in that state, representatives from both agencies told Business Insider. The company hasn't started offering paid rides in either state yet.In August, the company launched its Bay Area taxi service. It isn't registered as a self-driving vehicle service in California; it operates with human drivers because California has more stringent regulations on self-driving cars than most other states, which use a trust-based system in which companies approve their own vehicles.Tesla has permission from the California Public Utilities Commission to provide rides to employees and some members of the public as a regular car service with a driver. The agency has made it clear that Tesla does not have permission to carry around regular people in a self-driving car.Tesla now has 1,655 vehicles and 798 drivers registered for its taxi service in California, a CPUC spokesperson said. Tesla is required to update the agency over time as it continues adding new cars into the fleet, but not drivers. The registration count reflects how many vehicles are cleared to operate, but not necessarily how many are on the road at any one time.In December 2024, Tesla registered over 220 test drivers and 100 vehicles for a permit with the California Department of Motor Vehicles that would let it test its self-driving software with a test driver present.","Tesla is said to be hiring factory floor workers and salespeople to become ""AI operators"" for its self-driving ride-sharing service.

Elon Musk richer than Larry Page, Larry Ellison & Jeff Bezos combined

Reason behind Elon Musk’s surging worth

“We reverse the Court of Chancery’s rescission remedy and award $1 in nominal damages. The Plaintiff’s attorneys are awarded fees and expenses based on quantum meruit and a four times multiplier and post-judgment interest on the revised fee award from December 2, 2024. Any disputes regarding fees and expenses should be brought to the Court of Chancery for resolution.

Jurisdiction is not retained”.





Tesla CEO Elon Musk moved a step closer to becoming the world's first trillionaire after his net worth surged to over $700 billion on December 20. According to Forbes’s Billionaire Index, the Tesla chief executive's net worth climbed to $749 billion after the Delaware Supreme Court reinstated his 2018 pay package, once worth $56 billion. With this, Musk has become the world’s first-ever person with worth over $700 billion. After a legal battle of nearly two years, the court ruled that rescinding the pay package left the Tesla head ""uncompensated for his time and efforts over a period of six years"".With total net worth of $749 billion, Elon Musk is richer than the next three tech billionaires on the list combined — Google's Larry Page (worth $252.6 billion), Oracle's Larry Ellison (242.7 billion), and Amazon's Jeff Bezos ($239.4 billion). Musk is nearly $500bn richer than the second-richest, Google co-founder Larry Page.Elon Musk’s net worth jumped after the Delaware Supreme Court on 19 December (US time) reinstated his Tesla stock options worth $139 billion. These stock awards were originally cancelled last year in January, and the $56 billion pay package approved in 2018 had been tied up in a two-year legal battle. A 2024 ruling then said the compensation plan was “improper and inequitable,” but the court reversed that decision.Announcing the order, the Delaware Supreme Court said:The development comes just days after Musk crossed the $600 billion net-worth mark, helped by reports that SpaceX may go public. Before that, Tesla’s stock also climbed in early November, boosting his wealth even further, after the company’s board approved an unprecedented $1 trillion pay package for Musk.","Elon Musk's net worth jumped after the Delaware Supreme Court reinstated his Tesla stock options worth $139 billion.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is offering an advice to people who are looking for jobs or worried about displacement even as artificial intelligence (AI) is leading to eliminating certain types of roles in the industry. In a recent interview, the banking titan warned that while AI will definitely “eliminate jobs” but there are certain types of skills that machines cannot replicate.Speaking with Fox News last week, Dimon addressed the growing concerns surrounding AI-driven layoffs, suggesting that the key to remaining employable lies in human soft skills – emotional intelligence and communication – rather than technical “grunt work.”Dimon emphasised that as analytical tasks become automated, the value of a worker will increasingly depend on their ability to navigate complex human environments.“My advice to people would be critical thinking, learn skills, learn your EQ [emotional quotient], learn how to be good in a meeting, how to communicate, how to write,” Dimon said. “You’ll have plenty of jobs.”“The next job may be a better job, but they have to learn how to do the job.“You can earn quite a bit of money with skills,” he added.Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and Dr. Fei-Fei Li, the renowned Stanford professor and CEO of AI startup World Labs, have previously said that they would like to have people who are skilled rather than hiring them on the basis of their degrees. Li said that traditional college degrees are becoming less important in Silicon Valley as companies are looking for people with practical experience and relationship with AI tools.Facebook founder and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated in October that skills often outweigh a traditional college degree when hiring. Moreover, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that he wants employees who are a team player and adapt to a company’s culture.","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon wants people to shift to 'EQ' from 'IQ' Mark Zuckerberg, ‘Godmother of AI’ Fei-Fei Li prefer skills over degrees when hiring.

What caused power outage in San Francisco





A massive power outage affected nearly 30% of San Francisco as the city plunged into darkness for hours, paralysing the city’s infrastructure and leaving hundreds of Google-owned Waymo self-driving vehicles stranded in the middle of busy roads. People on social media posted videos and photos of Waymo vehicles in the middle of the road, affecting smooth traffic.According to a report by SFGate, Waymo was forced to suspend its operations at approximately 8 p.m. (local time) after the vehicles became unable to safely navigate intersections without functioning traffic signals.“We have temporarily suspended our ride-hailing services given the broad power outage in San Francisco,” a Waymo spokesperson was quoted as saying.“We are focused on keeping our riders safe and ensuring emergency personnel have the clear access they need to do their work,” the spokesperson added.Multiple videos on social media showed at least four Waymo vehicles stopped in the centre of a major intersection with their hazard lights flashing, triggering significant traffic congestion. Reportedly, in one incident, a passenger was trapped inside a stationary vehicle during the blackout until he was manually rescued.The blackout affected over 130,000 homes and businesses in neighbourhoods including the Richmond, Sunset, Presidio and Golden Gate Park. Officials traced that a portion of Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) substation caught fire, knocking out critical grid components, leading to “significant transit disruptions.”Not only the autonomous cars, the city's rail lines were shuttered and municipal buses were forced to bypass multiple stops in the affected zones.PG&E confirmed on Sunday that the grid has since been stabilised and no further outages are expected. Manual traffic control and city buses are returning to standard operations, the report said.","A massive power outage affected nearly 30% of San Francisco as the city plunged into darkness for hours.

US President Trump Signs AI Power Order: Blocks States, Cites Urgent Threat From China

Data centers now consume over 4% of US electricity, projected to triple by 2028





Three Democratic senators are demanding answers from major tech companies about whether their energy-hungry data centers are driving up electricity costs for ordinary Americans, sending letters to Google , Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and three data center operators. Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut expressed alarm that utility companies are passing billions in infrastructure upgrade costs to consumers while tech firms expand their artificial intelligence operations. “American families bankroll the electricity costs of trillion-dollar tech companies,” the lawmakers wrote, requesting detailed responses by January 12.The investigation targets seven companies total, including data center specialists CoreWeave, Digital Realty and Equinix. The senators cited regions with significant data center activity that have seen electricity price increases as high as 267% over five years, with national household bills rising 13% this year alone.Data centers currently account for more than 4% of America’s electricity consumption, a figure the Department of Energy expects to reach 12% by 2028.The surge is driven by AI systems, which require vastly more computing power than traditional internet services. A single data center can consume enough electricity to power hundreds of thousands of homes, forcing utilities to build new power plants and transmission lines.The lawmakers are seeking transparency on several fronts: companies’ current and projected data center counts, energy usage patterns, actions taken to prevent cost-shifting to consumers, and details about tax incentives and lobbying expenditures related to data center construction.Tech companies face scrutiny over confidential utility deals and public statementsThe investigation highlights a disconnect between tech companies’ public commitments and their actions. While firms publicly claim they want to pay their fair share, they’ve simultaneously opposed state and local regulatory efforts, according to the senators. Most contracts between data centers and utilities remain confidential, leaving consumers unaware of why their bills are rising.Amazon responded by challenging critics to “show their data,” stating the company pays its own electricity costs. Digital Realty said it looks forward to working with officials on digital infrastructure investment. Microsoft and Meta declined comment, while Google and the three data center operators didn’t immediately respond.","Three Democratic senators are demanding answers from major tech companies about whether their energy-hungry data centers are driving up electricity costs for ordinary Americans.

These include internal AI transformation, AI-driven service reimagination, future-ready talent, making AI real for customers and building a full-stack AI ecosystem spanning infrastructure, platforms and partnerships. TCS CEO further said that acquisitions shall also play a major role in the company's capability enhancement.Talking about demand for AI services, top executive of India's largest IT services company TCS said that the AI-led demand is visible across BFSI, life sciences and manufacturing sectors. TCS has executed nearly 5,500 AI engagements for clients so far.Last week TCS announced an artificial intelligence (AI) upgrade to its widely used banking platform TCS BaNCS.'TCS BaNCS AI Compass' combines machine learning/deep learning, Generative AI and pre-built agents to help banking and securities services customers adopt responsible AI tools and practices, as per an official statement.TCS is also bolstering its consulting and advisory practice with a significant number of experienced hires in the category. “I feel this is the right window for us to look at an updated model of advisory and consulting, which will essentially be more driven by AI analytics and coming from our place of strength, which is technology,” the CEO said.TCS said that 97% of its developers and engineers now have access to AI coding assistants. In some client engagements, moving customers up the AI “autonomy curve” has delivered 25-30% productivity gains, even as TCS proactively cannibalised parts of its own revenue. “Automation has always been central to how we deliver services. But with this AI, we are shifting from autonomous to autonomy,” chief operating officer Aarthi Subramanian said, adding that the human-plus-AI model can drive productivity at scale.Earlier this month, TCS announced the acquisition of Coastal Cloud, a Salesforce consulting company, for $700 million. This is TCS' largest-ever acquisition to date. In October, Mumbai-based tech giant acquired US-based ListEngage for $72.8 million, which was its first acquisition in nearly a decade.“The core focus of M&A is centred on capabilities. Advisory is a big area that we want to build and acquire capabilities for. And then market access. We’ll have to now start going geography-by-geography…maybe, sector-by-sector, to really ask the question where are the penetration opportunities,” Krithivasan said.",TCS has laid out a five-pronged strategy which will anchor TCS’ vision of becoming the “world’s largest AI-led technology services company” TCS CEO K Krithivasan said that AI is now growing faster than the rest of its business.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126103826,imgsize-15430,width-400,resizemode-4/tcs-sybyl-and-ixafrica.jpg"

China dominance in Energy is one of the 'deal breakers'

America is generations ahead in Chips

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's ‘China will win the AI race’ remark





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's recent apparent comment that China is winning the AI race made headlines across America. It went so 'wild' that the Nvidia CEO had to issue a clarification. During a fireside chat at the Center for Strategic and International Studies this month, Huang directly spoke about his statement on Chinese AI dominance vs America's. CSIS President John Hamre asked Huang what he termed ""very provocative"": You said something recently that was quite provocative. You said that China was winning the AI race, the AI competition. I know that you've got a powerful competitor in Huawei, and Huawei has a lot of advantages you don't have. Why don't you describe this competition? Are we really losing?In his reply to Hamre, Huang said, ""And it apparently caught a lot of attention. As you know with headlines, the disclaimer part, the foundation part was left out of the headline. But the way to think about that is that let me just handicap it right now. If you look at AI and go back to the first thing that we said, AI is a five layer cake. Let's just always simplify it. It's not quite this simplistic, but let's simplify AI into a five layer cake. Energy, chips, infrastructure, models, and applications. And let's handicap it from bottom to top.At the lowest level, China has twice the amount of energy we have as a nation.""""Twice as much energy as we have as a nation. And our economy's larger than theirs. Makes no sense to me. We also know that one of the most important initiatives, one of the most important policies of this administration. And there was the first thing that President Trump said to me when we met: ""Listen, we need to reindustrialize America. We need to do onshore manufacturing again. We need to help America make things again. "" It's going to create jobs. That part of the economy has been offshore and completely gutted the United States. We need to bring that back and he needs my help to do so. And so, that entire sector of the economy is missing,"" Nvidia CEO went on to add.Then Huang added the energy problem that America is facing, where China is miles ahead. While talking about the same Huang did give a compliment to President Trump, saying that he is trying his best to solve the problem. ""And however, without energy, how do we build chip plants, computer system plants, and these AI data centers? We call them AI factories. We're simultaneously building three different types of factories in the United States. Chip factories, super computer factories, and AI factories, they all require energy, every single one of them. And so on, the one hand, we want to reindustrialize the United States. How do you do that without energy? And so, the fact that we vilified energy for so long, President Trump sticking his neck out, and taking it on the chin, and helping the country realize that energy is necessary for our growth, is really one of the greatest things he's done right off the bat,"" Huang said.He said that while America is 50% of China in energy, the country is generationals ahead in Chips. But at the same time warned that the country cannot afford to be complacent. As semiconductors is a manufacturing process and anybody who thinks China can't manufacture is missing a big idea. ""And so, now at the energy level, back to that stack, we're 50% and they're growing straight up. We're kind of flat right now. And so, number one, energy. Number two, chips. We're generations ahead. We are generations ahead on chips, and I think everybody recognizes that. Number three, infrastructure. If you want to build a data center here in the United States, from breaking ground to standing up an AI supercomputer is probably about three years. They can build a hospital on a weekend. That's a real challenge. And so, at the infrastructure layer, their velocity of building things, because they are builders. Their velocity of building things is extraordinarily high. Now, really quickly on chips. We're several generations ahead, but don't be complacent. Remember, semiconductors are a manufacturing process. Anybody who thinks China can't manufacture is missing a big idea,"" Hunag said.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reportedly told the Financial Times in November this year that “China is going to win the AI race,” only to release a clarification statement soon after. Huang was speaking on the sidelines of the FT’s Future of AI Summit, where he warned that China would beat the US in artificial intelligence thanks to lower energy costs and looser regulations. However, several hours after the FT published its report, Nvidia issued a separate statement from Jensen on an official X account. “As I have long said, China is nanoseconds behind America in AI. It’s vital that America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide,” he added.","Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, said that China is winning the AI race.

Republicans To Finally Shut Down U.S’ H-1B Visa Programme? Propose ‘TOTAL BAN’ After Trump U-Turn

Tech companies most affected by H-1B disruptions





The US Department of State has acknowledged significant delays in visa appointments at American embassies and consulates worldwide, including in India, as processing times stretch up to 12 months due to enhanced screening procedures. In a statement to Business Insider, a State Department spokesperson confirmed that consular offices are now “prioritizing thoroughly vetting each visa case above all else” over the previous emphasis on reducing wait times.The delays have prompted Google and Apple to issue travel advisories to employees holding H-1B visas and their dependents, warning them against international travel due to the “risk of an extended stay” outside the United States. The companies’ immigration law firms sent memos this week advising visa holders who need their visas stamped for re-entry to avoid leaving the country, as appointment cancellations and rescheduling could leave them stranded abroad for months.The bottleneck stems from new social media screening requirements implemented by the Trump administration, affecting H-1B workers, their dependents, students, and exchange visitors.According to immigration firm Reddy Neumann Brown PC, appointments have been postponed across multiple countries including Ireland and Vietnam, with hundreds of Indian professionals reportedly stuck after their December visa renewal appointments were abruptly cancelled.The Department of State maintains that applicants can request expedited appointments on a case-by-case basis and may have their slots moved as resources change. However, the new vetting process requires “online presence reviews” to screen applicants who may pose national security risks, significantly extending processing times beyond historical norms.The visa delays particularly impact technology companies that rely heavily on the H-1B program, which caps new visas at 85,000 annually. During fiscal year 2024, Google applied for 5,537 H-1B visas while Apple sought 3,880, according to Department of Labor and USCIS data analyzed by Business Insider. Indians account for over 70% of H-1B visas issued.Immigration attorney Jason Finkelman advised that foreign nationals with valid visa stamps should generally be able to return to the US, but recommended clients avoid non-essential travel. “If travel isn’t essential right now, better to stay put,” he said, noting that H-1B workers stuck abroad due to cancelled consular appointments face uncertain timelines for returning to work in the United States.",The US Department of State has acknowledged significant delays in visa appointments at American embassies and consulates worldwide. processing times stretch up to 12 months due to enhanced screening procedures.

He cites rapid technological advancements and economic volatility, supported by World Economic Forum data on skill transformation. Roslansky emphasises taking control of one's career through immediate skill acquisition and specific experiences, a philosophy he explores on his podcast, 'The Path'.

""outdated""

""a little bit foolish""

""No One Knows What They’re Doing""

""with technology and the labour market and everything is moving beneath you,""

“I would much recommend people focus on maybe the next few months and a couple of things that aren’t a plan, but [rather] what do you want to learn? What type of experiences do you want to get? That’s, I think, the right mental model in this environment.""

AI-Powered Future: Next Gen Careers You Should Watch

“You’ll hear people frequently say, ‘Hey, you have to have a five-year plan, like, chart out what the next five years of your life are going to look like, and then follow that path and follow that plan. And in reality, when you know technology and the labour market and everything is moving beneath you, I think having a five-year plan is a little bit foolish,”

Why LinkedIn CEO doesn’t believe in the five-year career growth plan

""career growth doesn't just happen by accident""

“A lot of people just believe that there’s some linear career path that you jump on. You know, you graduate high school and then go to a certain college and then you become a consultant and then get an MBA. People believe that’s how it happens,”

""growth-hunting,""

""job-hopping,""

“If you focus on those shorter steps, gaining learning, gaining experience, a lot of your career path will open up for you. And the sooner you realise that, you can take your own career into your own hands. No one is trying to figure this out for you,”





LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky stated that traditional five-year career plans areandin the current labour market. Speaking on thepodcast, Roslansky noted thatprofessionals should instead prioritise short-term objectives. He advised that rather than following a fixed long-term path,Roslansky, who has led the professional networking platform since 2020, attributes this shift in strategy to the rapid pace of workplace transformation driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and economic volatility. This perspective is supported by World Economic Forum data, which suggests that roughly 39% of core worker skills will be transformed or become obsolete by 2030. Given these shifts, Roslansky argued that focusing on immediate skill acquisition and specific experiences is more effective than attempting to chart out the next five years of life.Roslansky said.To compare, some career experts continue to advocate for five-year planning, maintaining thatand that more rigorous goal-setting enables people to achieve their objectives.“Five-year plans also give you the flexibility to change what’s no longer relevant to your long-term goals, without derailing your progress. This way, you’re always working toward what you truly want to achieve,” talent management executive Mary McNevin told Arielle Executive.However, Roslansky's commitment to this philosophy runs so deep that he produces his own podcast, The Path, exploring how professionals navigate diverse, non-linear career trajectories.Roslansky added.Drawing on LinkedIn data, Roslansky understands that a straight-line education and career path isn't a reality for most people. A recent report from job training provider TAFE Gippsland shows that people typically change careers three to seven times in their lives and switch jobs 16 times.This pattern is evident among Gen Z workers, who change jobs on average every 1.1 years, according to a recent report by recruiting firm Randstad. The company calls thisnotbecause Gen Z says they switch jobs when they feel stuck or don't see opportunities to move forward in their current roles.Roslansky explained.","LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky dismisses traditional five-year career plans as outdated.

Google confirms Gemini will replace Assistant on Android in 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-confirms-gemini-will-replace-assistant-on-android-in-2026/articleshow/126096509.cms,"Transition timeline



Google initially planned to complete the upgrade by the end of 2025.

The company now says the migration will continue into 2026, citing the need to avoid disruption during the holiday season and to ensure feature parity between Assistant and Gemini.

The rollout is expected to be gradual and region-based, rather than an immediate global switch.

What Gemini brings



Already available on Wear OS, Google TV, and Android Auto, Gemini is expanding into smart speakers and displays via the Gemini for Home Early Access program.

The platform integrates advanced features like NotebookLM support, AI video detection, and semantic search, positioning it as a more powerful replacement for Assistant.

Why the delay



Feature Parity: Ensuring Gemini incorporates all of Assistant’s core functions before migration. Timing: Avoiding major platform changes during the holiday season, when disruption could frustrate users.

Context and significance



Google Assistant first launched in 2016, making the 2026 replacement symbolic as it marks a decade of service.

The move underscores Google’s broader strategy to embed Generative AI deeply into everyday consumer experiences.

For users, the shift promises smarter search, richer media integration, and more natural interactions, though some may miss the familiarity of Assistant.





Google has announced that its Gemini AI platform will fully replace Google Assistant on Android devices in 2026, pushing back its earlier timeline to allow for a more seamless migration. The change will affect Android phones, tablets, and even the standalone iOS app, which will be phased out once Gemini takes over.Gemini represents Google’s next-generation AI assistant, designed to deliver more conversational, visual, and context-aware experiences.Google has not provided a detailed explanation, but industry observers suggest two main reasons:","Gemini represents Google’s next-generation AI assistant, designed to deliver more conversational, visual, and context-aware experiences.

Microsoft admission in French court





Europe's biggest aerospace company Airbus reportedly wants to move away from two of the biggest American technology companies -- Google and Microsoft. According to a report in Register, Airbus is preparing to tender a major contract to migrate mission-critical workloads to a digitally sovereign European cloud. The aerospace manufacturer uses products and services of Google and Microsoft. Airbus has consolidated its datacenter estate and uses services like Google Workspace. The company reportedly uses Microsoft Excel and software for finance and some miliary-classified documents that can't be stored in the CloudAirbus is now reportedly looking to move key on-premises applications including ERP, manufacturing execution systems, CRM, and product lifecycle management (aircraft designs) to the cloud. ""I need a sovereign cloud because part of the information is extremely sensitive from a national and European perspective,"" Catherine Jestin, Airbus' executive vice president of digital, told The Register. ""We want to ensure this information remains under European control,"" Jestin added.Digital sovereignty is said to have become more critical since Donald Trump's return to the White House in January. While Microsoft, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google have created solutions to address these concerns, fears persist about the US CLOUD Act, which allows authorities to request data held by American corporations in overseas datacenters.For those unaware, Digital sovereignty is a nation's ability to have the final say over its own digital destiny -- the way it controls its infrastructure, its data, and the digital services operating on its own terms. It’s about ensuring that local laws govern the cloud operations and controls where data is located, who can access it, and how it’s managed.Cloud Act is a law that gives the US government authority to obtain digital data held by US-based tech corporations irrespective of whether that data is stored on servers at home or on foreign soil. It is said to compel these companies, via warrant or subpoena, to accept the request. The Cloud Act was signed into law in 2018 following challenges the FBI faced when getting data via service providers through Store Communications Act warrants, which was itself legislated before cloud computing became a viable thing.Microsoft admitted in French court last July it couldn't guarantee data sovereignty under this legislation. However, Microsoft has said that it has not received data requests from the US government for data held on Microsoft servers in Europe. Back at the hearing in France, Microsoft was asked if a data request was well framed, would the corporation be ""obliged to transmit the data?"" Carniaux admitted: ""Absolutely, by respecting this process. But again, this has not affected any European company, or a public sector body, since we have been publishing these transparency reports.""",Aerospace company Airbus reportedly wants to move away from Google and Microsoft.

Jared Isaacman, the newly confirmed NASA Administrator, issued a clear ultimatum to the billionaire-led companies racing toward the lunar surface, on his first official day leading the world’s premier space agency. Between choosing Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos Blue Origin, Isaacman said that the company that finishes its lander first gets the lunar mission. The statement comes as the US pushes to return humans to the moon for the first time in more than half a century.Speaking with Bloomberg TV this week, just one day after his Senate confirmation, Isaacman made it clear that “strategic objectives” take precedence over contract history.“I don't think it was lost on either vendor that whichever lander was available first to ensure that America achieves its strategic objectives on the moon is the one we were going to go with,” Isaacman said.This effectively makes the Artemis program into a high-stakes sprint. While SpaceX’s Starship was originally designated for the Artemis III mission in 2027, delays have left the door open for Blue Origin’s Blue Moon lander to take the spotlight.In October, then-acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy officially reopened SpaceX’s lunar contract, saying that Musk’s company was “behind schedule” on the modified Starship lander.Musk lashed out at Duffy on social media, labeling the official a ""dummy"" and asserting that SpaceX would ultimately complete the entire moon mission independently.

More recently, the success of Gemini 3 has provided the company an edge after a rocky start in 2022.Recently, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman, who is the co-founder of DeepMind, also acknowledged the shortage of AI talent, saying that this has led to a constant “rotation” of experts between the “Big Five” tech firms.","20% of AI software engineers hired by Google in 2025 were former employees. This suggests that for the world’s elite engineers, the ability to build is becoming more valuable than a massive immediate paychecks.

US lawmakers to Pentagon: 'Ban' these technology companies for links to Chinese army; read full letter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-lawmakers-to-pentagon-ban-these-technology-companies-for-links-to-chinese-army-read-full-letter/articleshow/126093448.cms,"US President Trump Signs AI Power Order: Blocks States, Cites Urgent Threat From China

What is Pentagon’s 1260H list

Letter signed by 9 US lawmakers seeking to ban DeepSeek , Xiaomi and other Chinese firms

Dear Secretary Hegseth:

We write to urge you to expand the Department’s list of Chinese military companies maintained pursuant to Section 1260H of the FY 2021 National Defense Authorization Act to include a set of Chinese firms that support “military-civil fusion” (MCF) and advance People’s Liberation Army (PLA) capabilities across various sectors, including: biotechnology and life sciences; sensing, surveillance, and robotics; consumer smart devices; large-scale AI models; displays and imaging; semiconductors and manufacturing equipment; and power batteries and energy storage.

We applaud recent actions taken by the Department, including the addition of Tencent to the

1260H list in January 2025 as well as reports that an October 7 letter from Deputy Secretary of

War Stephen Feinberg informed the Armed Services Committees that Alibaba, Baidu, and BYD

should be added to the list of companies that aid the PRC’s military.

The firms listed below represent military-civil fusion contributors central to PLA modernization,

internal-security operations, and power-projection capabilities. Their designation under Section

1260H would directly support Congress’ intent that U.S. taxpayer funds not underwrite PRC

military-industrial and internal-security or intelligence capabilities.





Nine US lawmakers have sent a letter to US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth seeking a ‘ban’ on 17 Chinese companies. In the letter, the lawmakers urged Pentagon (now Department of War) to add these companies to its 1260H list over alleged links to the Chinese military. List of companies that the letter includes are Chinese AI firm DeepSeek; smartphone maker Xiaomi , chip companies Hua Hong Semiconductor, Kingsemi and Shennan Circuit; display and imaging companies BOE Technology Group and Tianma Microelectronics; sensing, surveillance and robotics firms CloudMinds, LeiShen, Livox, RoboSense, Tiandy Technologies, Unitree Robotics and others.In the letter, the lawmakers said that the firms “represent the next logical tranche of military-civil fusion contributors whose designation under Section 1260H would directly support Congress’s intent that US taxpayer funds not underwrite PRC military-industrial and internal-security or intelligence capabilities”.The letter is signed by: John Moolenaar, Chairman, Select Committee on China; Rick Scott, Chairman, Senate Special Committee on Aging; Eric A. “Rick” Crawford, Chairman, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence; Andrew R. Garbarino, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security; Rob Wittman, Chairman, House Armed Services Committee, Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee; Bill Huizenga, Chairman, House Committee on Foreign Affairs, South & Central Asia Subcommittee; Dusty Johnson, Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Commodity Markets, Digital Assets, and Rural Development Subcommittee; Darin LaHood, Chairman, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Subcommittee on NSA and Cyber; Andy Ogles, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee.Pentagon’s 1260H list is a US Department of Defense roster of Chinese military-linked companies that are believed to support China’s defence or intelligence activities. It is required under Section 1260H of the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act.Companies on the list face increased scrutiny, restrictions on US government contracts, and potential sanctions. The list is used to warn US entities against doing business with firms tied to China’s military–civil fusion strategy.The letter, dated December 18, 2025 reads:","Nine US lawmakers have sent a letter to US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth seeking a ‘ban’ on 17 Chinese companies.

Bernie Sanders targets Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg



Electricity-hungry data centers



He noted Meta’s planned Louisiana facility could consume three times more power than New Orleans.

A Texas project tied to OpenAI and Oracle could use electricity equivalent to 750,000 homes.

Another Meta site could match the needs of 1.2 million households.





US senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has reignited his feud with Tesla CEO Elon Musk . Sanders posted a video on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) in which he has questioned Musk’s ambitious claims about artificial intelligence and robotics ushering in a ‘utopia’. In the video messaged posted Sanders directly asked Musk, “You have told us poverty will be wiped out, work will be optional, and there will be universal high income for everyone. How will this utopia come about?” Sanders pressed further, asking: “When are they going to get the free housing? When will factory workers receive free healthcare if robots take over manufacturing jobs?”. Moreover, Sanders also accused Musk and other “oligarch friends” of promising a magnificent life for working people without explaining how it would be delivered. He also criticised US President Donald Trump for doubling insurance premiums and reducing SNAP benefits, framing Musk’s promises against broader economic challenges.This new video messages by Bernie Sander is followed by recent call made by Sanders for a moratorium on AI datacenters, citing risks to jobs, democracy, and public resources. Elon Musk responded to Sanders demand and called him a ‘coward’ who lacked ‘any sense of adventure’.However, Sanders found support from Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who argued that AI should benefit workers rather than “tech barons,” despite representing Silicon Valley.Recently, Sanders escalated his criticism of the artificial intelligence boom and has asked for a halt on new AI data center construction. Sanders has also accused the tech billionaires including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates for driving the AI expansion for “dangerous reasons.” In a video posted on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Sanders warned that AI and robotics are growing faster than the society can adapt.“AI and Robotics are the most transformative technologies in the history of humanity,” he said, cautioning they will affect “every man, woman and child” in the country.Sanders’ moratorium call zeroes in on the massive electricity demands of AI infrastructure.Sanders singled out Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Peter Thiel, and other tech leaders, arguing they are pushing AI to consolidate wealth and power rather than protect working families. “These very, very rich men are not losing sleep over job losses or inequality,” he added.",US senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has reignited his feud with Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

Elon Musk gives timeline of first Starship flight to Mars with humans and self-sustaining Mars city

Elon Musk shares timeline of first Starship flight to Mars





SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has once again started the discussion about interplanetary colonisation with a fresh prediction about Mars. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk wrote, “Mars will be green with life one day”, hinting at his vision of the Red planet’s as humanity’s next frontier. Elon Musk has consistently argued that making life multiplanetary is essential for humanity’s survival. His latest statement on Mars adds to a series of bold predictions he made in the past. Musk believes that humans will create self-sustaining cities on Mars and he feels that millions of people will be living there by mid-century. However, the exact timeline of life reaching Mars still remains uncertain, but the comments made by Musk continue to fuel speculation about SpaceX’s roadmap to Mission Mars.Elon Musk-owned SpaceX is presently testing its Starship rocket which is designed to carry large payloads and crews to Mars. The company has already conducted multiple orbital flight tests, with plans to refine reusability and deep-space capabilities. Also, Musk has earlier suggested that the first crewed Mars mission could happen in the 2030s. However, experts caution that technological, financial, and safety hurdles remain.In August this year, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk shared an important update on the timeline for sending Starship to Mars. In social media post on X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk said that there’s only a ‘slight chance’ of a crewed Starship flight to Mars by late 2026. He also mentioned that a more realistic schedule pointes to an unscrewed mission in 2028 and a human flight around 2030. “Slight chance of Starship flight to Mars crewed by Optimus in Nov/Dec next year. A lot needs to go right for that,” Musk wrote. “More likely, first flight without humans in ~3.5 years, next flight ~5.5 years with humans. Mars city self-sustaining in 20 to 30 years.A user on X asked Musk about the timeline of Starship flight. “What’s the timeline you have set Elon? It sounds fascinating and I am glad to be alive when this is happening,” an X user named @abhiyogi asked.Responding to the post, Musk wrote, “Slight chance of Starship flight to Mars crewed by Optimus in Nov/Dec next year.

Apple's visionary founder Steve Jobs is said to be hooked on to the idea that everyone should be able to own a home computer. At the time, Jobs was in his early twenties and only problem to this vision was that like many founders, he didn’t have enough money to bring his vision to life. So Jobs sold off his Volkswagen bus while fellow cofounder Steve Wozniak got money for his programmable calculator. Togethers the duo raised $1,300 to pay for the prototype’s parts. And the first Apple computer, the Apple I, was born on April Fools’ Day, 1976, rest is history.A local computer dealer reportedly placed a $50,000 order for 100 units for Apple 1. While in all the sales were not huge, enough money to create Apple II for the mass market.

Like many founders, he didn’t have enough money to bring his vision to life.Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak reportedly started their first business, illegally selling “blue boxes” that allowed users to make free, long-distance telephone calls. In a documentary 'Silicon Valley: A 100-Year Renaissance' in 1998, Steve Jobs said, 'If we hadn’t … made blue boxes, there would have been no Apple.” As to what these Blue Boxes were? As a report in Fortune titled 'Unusual jobs CEOs had before they became successful', said: ""In the 1970s, telephone systems were far different than today. They used tone signals to control long-distance dialing. Jobs and his friend and Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak, had their first business: illegally selling so-called blue boxes that would allow people to break into the telephone system and make free calls. ""If it hadn't been for the blue boxes, there would have been no Apple,"" he said in a 1994 video interview. ""I'm 100 percent sure of that. Woz and I learned how to work together, and we gained the confidence that we could solve technical problems and actually put something into production.""Jobs too remembered about those years in the early 1970s as a “magical” time in his life that sent him on the path to soon create Apple.","Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak reportedly started their first business, illegally selling “blue boxes” that allowed users to make free, long-distance telephone calls.

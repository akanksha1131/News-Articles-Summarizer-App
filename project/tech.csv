In a BSE filing on Saturday (March 1), OCL disclosed that the notice, dated February 27, pertains to supposed violations of specific provisions under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema).According to OCL, the ED pinpointed non-compliance involving Rs 245 crore at OCL, Rs 345 crore at Little Internet , and Rs 20.9 crore at Nearbuy India . These alleged violations stem from certain investment transactions within these entities, the company explained.OCL stated it is consulting legal experts and taking necessary steps to address the issue in line with applicable laws and regulations. The Noida-based company clarified that the compliance lapses in its subsidiaries occurred prior to their acquisition by Paytm. Little Internet and Nearbuy, both hyperlocal deals platforms, were acquired by Paytm in 2017 and later merged. Little Internet had secured about $50 million in equity funding from Tiger Global Management and Elevation Capital, while Nearbuy, co-founded by Ankur Warikoo, raised approximately $22 million from Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia India).This development follows OCL’s recent resolution of a separate case with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, settled for Rs 45 lakh over certain regulatory infractions. Additionally, early last year, Paytm’s associate entity, Paytm Payments Bank, faced regulatory scrutiny from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).","One 97 Communications (OCL) has been issued a show cause notice by the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) for alleged foreign exchange rule breaches totaling Rs 611 crore.

Tesla’s stock is plummeting, and some investors are reported to be gearing up for even tougher times ahead. The electric vehicle giant, helmed by Elon Musk , has seen its shares tumble roughly 40% from their peak in late 2024. The slide picked up speed recently after reports revealed a near 50% drop in European car sales for January, with this week alone shaving about 17% off the stock price. For a company long fueled by investor hype as much as its actual performance, this signals growing unease about its core auto business slowing down.Elon Musk’s preoccupation with politics has also reportedly worried investors who would like to see him spend more time running the EV maker. To make matter worse, critics of Donald Trump and Elon Musk hope to discourage and stigmatize purchases of Tesla. Liberal groups for weeks have organized anti-Tesla protests in hopes of galvanizing opposition to Musk's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). Musk is taking direction from President Trump to slash federal spending and sharply reduce the workforce. Some Tesla owners have also reported their vehicles vandalized with spray painted swastikas amid what Jewish groups and observers fear is a rise in antisemitism.Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Bloomberg that the challenge of pinpointing a bottom for a stock like Tesla. “When a company’s valuation has defied traditional measures for so long, finding a floor depends more on investor mood than typical value metrics,” he said.The hits have come fast in 2025. Tesla’s stock surged post-US election, riding optimism tied to Musk’s ties with President Donald Trump. But that fizzled in January as the company posted lackluster Q4 delivery figures, marking its first annual sales decline in over a decade. A subsequent earnings report revealed weaker-than-expected profits and a dimmer sales forecast for 2025, piling on the pressure.This week, Tesla’s market cap dipped below $1 trillion for the first time since November, slipping behind Berkshire Hathaway and Broadcom among top US companies. One more down day would match the stock’s longest losing streak ever.Few sparks for a rebound are in sight. Analysts see no big news soon on Tesla’s self-driving tech ambitions, while rival BYD in China plans to roll out advanced driver-assistance features across most models at no extra cost. Musk’s focus on politics has also irked investors wanting more attention on the EV business.","Tesla's market cap dipped below $1 trillion for the first time since November, slipping behind Berkshire Hathaway and Broadcom among top US companies.

I’m writing to let you know about a change coming to our opinion pages.

We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.

There was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader’s doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views. Today, the internet does that job.

I am of America and for America, and proud to be so. Our country did not get here by being typical. And a big part of America’s success has been freedom in the economic realm and everywhere else. Freedom is ethical — it minimizes coercion — and practical — it drives creativity, invention, and prosperity.

I offered David Shipley, whom I greatly admire, the opportunity to lead this new chapter. I suggested to him that if the answer wasn’t “hell yes,” then it had to be “no.” After careful consideration, David decided to step away. This is a significant shift, it won’t be easy, and it will require 100% commitment — I respect his decision. We’ll be searching for a new Opinion Editor to own this new direction.

I’m confident that free markets and personal liberties are right for America. I also believe these viewpoints are underserved in the current market of ideas and news opinion. I’m excited for us together to fill that void.

How Elon Musk is a Canadian citizen



Can petition really revoke Elon Musk's Canadian citizenship



Revoke Elon Musk's Canadian Citizenship. So says a petition signed by more than 250,000 Canadian citizens and residents. The parliamentary petition urges Canada to revoke Elon Musk’s citizenship and passport. The petition, which opened to signatures late last week, accuses Musk of acting against Canada's national interest and undermining its sovereignty. Elon Musk is one of the closest associates of the US President Donald Trump, who plans to levy a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports next month. Trump has also proposed annexing the country as the 51st state, is “against the national interest of Canada,” the petitioners claim.“He has used his wealth and power to influence our elections,” the petition claims. “He has now become a member of a foreign government that is attempting to erase Canadian sovereignty.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk, however, later deleted the post. It is not certain why he deleted the post, considering he has been quite vocal about his opinion on a range of issues even if it is opposed by many.The petition is addressed to Justin Trudeau and sponsored by Charlie Angus , a member of Parliament for the left-of-center New Democratic Party. A petition, initiated on February 20 and currently supported by over 250,000 Canadian signatures, will remain available for signatures until June 20.Meanwhile, Musk's daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson, said in a post on Threads, ""I’m ngl this Canadian ’51st state’ s**t has upped my Canadian patriotism by about 5000000%”.Born in Pretoria, South Africa, Elon Musk holds both Canadian and US citizenship. He has previously said that he obtained a Canadian passport as a teenager through his mother, Maye Musk, who was born in Canada. Musk received US citizenship a decade after arriving in the US on a student visa.No, very unlikely. It is mostly symbolic and has no legal force. The petition to revoke Musk’s citizenship is open until June 20, 2025. Post this, the petitions will have to certify that at least 500 of its signatures are legitimate. From there, the petition must wait until a new session of parliament opens before it can be presented to the House of Commons for debate.Under Canadian government rules, citizenship may be revoked if a person commits fraud, misrepresents themselves, or deliberately conceals information on an immigration or citizenship application.","Petition urges Canada to revoke Elon Musk’s citizenship and passport.

Infosys layoffs: Karnataka government gives clean chit to the company; says there was no ... relationship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/infosys-layoffs-karnataka-government-gives-clean-chit-to-the-company-says-there-was-no-relationship/articleshow/118621983.cms,"The Karnataka Labour Department has officially given Infosys a clean chit regarding the recent layoffs of trainees at its Mysuru campus. Following an inquiry into allegations of labour law violations , the department concluded that the company had not breached any legal requirements, as the affected individuals were classified as trainees rather than employees.“We have not found any violation of labour laws in our inspection at Infosys…There was no employee and employer relationship between them in the first place. They were not even given appointment letters for them to be called employees. They were trainees for three months who were paid stipends and were part of the apprenticeship program,” confirmed a government official.The investigation was prompted by complaints from the Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate ( NITES ) and affected trainees, who claimed the layoffs were unethical and violated labour laws. Infosys had terminated approximately 350-400 trainees on February 7, citing their inability to clear internal assessments after three attempts. The company emphasised that performance evaluations are a standard part of its globally recognised training program.In its interim report, the Karnataka Labour Department clarified that the state government cannot intervene in the selection or evaluation processes of private companies. The department also noted that Infosys had adhered to its policies by providing outplacement services, severance pay , and counselling to the trainees who were let go.Labour Minister Santhosh Lad ordered an inspection of Infosys campuses in Mysuru and Bengaluru, conducted by a team led by G Manjunath. The review of hiring documents revealed that while more than 600 students from the 2022 batch moved forward, 329 failed a required test. Government officials also raised concerns about Infosys's terminology.Despite the clean chit, NITES has expressed dissatisfaction with the findings and warned of potential protests. The union continues to advocate for stronger protections for trainees and employees in the IT sector, calling for greater transparency and fairness in hiring and evaluation practices.","The Karnataka Labour Department has officially given Infosys a clean chit regarding the recent layoffs of trainees at its Mysuru campus.

Asmita Patel accused of re-routing money

Securities & Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has seized Rs 53.67 crore from Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd along with five other entities.

Asmita Patel is also at risk of losing another Rs 104.6 crore it collected from course fees, which SEBI believes were part of unregistered advisory services.”The investigation was initiated by SEBI after receiving complaints from 42 participants of these courses. In addition to impounding the Rs 53.67 crore, SEBI has issued a show-cause notice questioning why Rs 104.6 crore, collected as fees for various programs, should not also be seized.SEBI has sent an interim order directing the school, Asmita Jitesh Patel, and Jitesh Jethalal Patel to cease offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services. The entities have also been barred from accessing the securities market.The order also uncovered that fees collected from participants were routed through entities such as King Traders (proprietor: Sagar Dhanjibhai), Gemini Enterprise (proprietor: Suresh Parmashivam), and United Enterprises (proprietor: Jigar Rameshbhai Dawada). SEBI stated that this was a regular practice and not an isolated incident, making all six entities jointly and severally liable for the Rs 53.67 crore earned from course fees.The regulator further demanded that the notices explain why they should not be ordered to disgorge Rs 104.6 crore, along with interest. SEBI's order noted that the fees collected for LMIT, MPAT, and OM courses, as well as other programs provided by the school, were earned under the guise of unregistered advisory and research analyst services.The order reads, “The aforesaid amount includes not only the amount collected as fees by the Noticees for LMIT, MPAT and Options Multiplier (OM) courses but also includes the fees collected by the Noticees for the other courses offered by the Noticee no.1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading )through which it carried out unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services along with interest”.Kamlesh Varshney, SEBI's Whole-Time Member, highlighted in the order “Examination revealed that, prima facie, the Noticee no. 1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading) along with the Noticee no.2 (Asmita Jitesh Patel) and the Notice no.3 (Jitesh Jethalal Patel) devised a scheme wherein students/investors/participants were lured to trade in specific stocks and told to open trading account with ABC Ltd.

Former Amazon VP on why returning to office feels ‘worth it’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-amazon-vp-on-why-returning-to-office-feels-worth-it/articleshow/118660274.cms,"Here’s what the post reads



As a retired Amazon VP who experienced a 9082% increase in Amazon stock during my time, I am out of touch with many common life struggles. The SVPs and CEOs above me are often more so. Talking about wealth and it's impacts is a taboo subject most executives avoid. I'm going to try to address one small piece today.

It would be hypocritical to talk about ""executives"" in general without owning my own situation first. For brevity, here are four examples:

1) No mortgage

2) A maid service cleans every two weeks

3) Someone else mows the grass

4) I retired at age 50

The average family, even the average tech or knowledge worker, does not have these benefits.

In the level above me, I have seen much more:

1) Multiple staffed vacation homes, with caretakers

2) Private jets (PJs in the lingo)

3) Personal assistants. Never pay a bill, get groceries, or pick up a kid when you are busy. The PA handles it all.

4) Drivers (security and efficiency)

5) Breathtakingly expensive and exclusive private schools for their kids

6) They live wherever they want. Cost is not an obstacle

Let's look at one example of how disconnection from the daily experiences of employees can lead to very different priorities: return to work.

The disconnect here really starts with differing priorities. Executive wealth then supports the different choices.

Most executives place work and career success very highly in their lives. If they do not, they rarely become top executives. Most of them (myself included) then use our pay to free up time. Most time goes to work, some to family.

If work is the main focus of your life, then returning to the office might seem like a natural priority.

Now imagine:

No need to commute, your driver takes you door to door while you work in the back

No need to hurry home to pick up the kids, the PA does it

No need to shop, clean, or cook, the staff does it all

No need to help with homework, the amazing school provides tutoring

With these circumstances, returning to the office feels very ""worth it.""

This is not a screed against executive wealth. After all, I paid with 25 years of my life and I got some of the wealth. Instead, it is an explanation so that you can understand the disconnect.

If you need to influence an executive where their experiences may be out of touch with your reality, help them see the impact through stories, videos, and data.

Remember, they live literally in another world. This doesn't necessarily make them evil, just disconnected. I do not want to be ""out of touch"" but it is important to acknowledge that this does happen over time.

A retired Amazon vice president, Ethan Evans , recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to address the growing disconnect between corporate executives and everyday employees, particularly when it comes to remote work . In a candid post, Evans shared insights into how executive wealth and lifestyle can create a starkly different perspective on workplace policies.Evans, who witnessed a staggering 9,082% increase in Amazon's stock during his tenure, began by acknowledging his own privileged situation. ""I am out of touch with many common life struggles. The SVPs and CEOs above me are often more so,"" he wrote, adding that discussing wealth and its impacts is often a ""taboo subject"" in executive circles.Giving a raw look into his own life, he highlighted comforts like a mortgage-free existence, regular maid services, professional lawn care, and the ability to retire at age 50. He then contrasted his lifestyle with the even greater privileges of higher-level executives, including private jets, multiple staffed vacation homes, personal assistants, and top-tier private education for their children.According to Evans, these luxuries contribute to a disconnect in understanding the challenges faced by typical employees, especially around the issue of returning to the office. He explained that many executives prioritize work and career success above all else, using their wealth to outsource everyday tasks and responsibilities.

What is ‘vibe coding’?

Andrej Karpathy , the former Director of AI at Tesla, recently defined a term called ""vibe coding"" that explains an innovative way of coding that relies on sophisticated AI tools, especially large language models (LLMs). In his X post, Karpathy described that vibe coding is all about completely giving in to the ""vibes"" of the AI, accepting the exponential power of current LLMs, and forgetting the nitty-gritty details of the code itself. It is a transition towards how individuals interact with code and AI, where the boundaries between human interaction and AI-based output become indistinguishable.Karpathy's ""vibe coding"" is a recognition of how sophisticated AI systems have evolved. In describing on X (formerly Twitter), he added that LLMs, like the Cursor Composer with Sonnet, are advancing to a degree that nearly eliminates the use of traditional coding mechanisms. Describing his own experience, Karpathy explained how he converses with AI tools almost in a passive manner—merely talking to them and having the AI handle the rest. This method eliminates manually typing code as well as keeping track of all the minute information in the program.Karpathy went on to explain his individual experience with vibe coding, discussing how he deals with the AI tools so easily that he rarely even notices the keyboard. For instance, he just requests the AI to perform simple tasks such as padding adjustment on a sidebar, tasks that would otherwise involve more in-depth examination of the code. He takes it a step further by approving all the suggestions provided by the AI, without even checking the differences or changes made, relying on the AI to fix the problem. If there are errors, Karpathy tends to copy and paste the error messages into the system without comment, allowing the AI to take care of the fix.This approach, while unorthodox, is functional for him, particularly for small, throwaway projects. Karpathy explained that he could still create functional projects without being forced to deeply explore the technicalities. ""I just see things, say things, run things, and copy-paste things, and it mostly works,"" he described, highlighting the seamless flow provided by the AI.Though appealing, Karpathy did admit that vibe coding is not perfect. Occasionally, the AI tools are not able to repair some bugs, and in those instances, he has no choice but to make random changes until the problem resolves itself. Although this method may not be suitable for long, complicated projects, it works well for fast, experimental, or recreational work. Karpathy has a chuckle about using this method, understanding its flaws but enjoying its effectiveness for particular tasks.Karpathy's concept of vibe coding elicited a broad spectrum of responses from X (formerly Twitter) users. One user commended Karpathy for being willing to adopt AI so comprehensively, adding that some programmers boast about writing all their code by hand without realizing that AI-supported developers might replace them in the near future. Another user noted that the degree of AI support in coding can be considered a continuum, with classical coding at one end and vibe coding at the other. Even Karpathy himself conceded that vibe coding is not yet in its ultimate version, implying there is still scope for development.Other users appeared to be entertained by the idea, with one saying that they had been doing something similar for more than a year. Another joked, ""What could possibly go wrong?"" reflecting the experimental and unpredictable nature of depending heavily on AI for coding work.","Andrej Karpathy, the former Director of AI at Tesla, defined a term called ""vibe coding"" Vibe coding is an innovative way of coding that relies on sophisticated AI tools, especially large language models (LLMs) In his X (formerly Twitter) post, he described that vibe coding is all about completely giving in to the ""vibes"" of the AI.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118659769,imgsize-35590,width-400,resizemode-4/118659769.jpg"

Concerns over branding and product differentiation

Investment offers and final deal

The latest episode of Shark Tank India Season 4 witnessed one of the most intense and high-pressure pitches of the season. A team of founders from Delhi, representing their cushion brand Trajectory, entered the tank seeking Rs 1 crore for 2% equity, valuing their company at Rs 50 crore. However, their presentation quickly turned into a heated exchange when Anupam Mittal launched into a relentless critique, questioning the viability of their business in a highly competitive market.Despite the intense grilling, the founders managed to impress some of the sharks with their strong financials, projected revenue of Rs 15 crore, and an EBITDA margin of 21%. Their distribution strategy, which included sales on Amazon and airport retail outlets, along with a marketing spend of under 5%, drew interest from certain sharks. However, concerns regarding branding, trust, and differentiation cast doubts on their overall business model.From the moment the pitch began, Anupam Mittal made his skepticism clear, expressing doubt about their entry into a highly commoditized industry flooded with cheaper alternatives. He bluntly questioned their decision to operate in such a competitive space, setting the tone for a tough interrogation.As one of the founders, Raghav, attempted to narrate the brand’s origin story, Anupam cut him off mid-sentence, dismissing it as unnecessary. A rehearsed joke from Raghav backfired, prompting further criticism. Even Peyush Bansal, who showed some interest, advised them to abandon their scripted approach and communicate naturally.The tension escalated when Namita Thapar questioned what differentiated their cushions from competitors. As the founders began explaining the fabric and material, Anupam lost patience once again, accusing them of beating around the bush rather than providing direct answers.Adding to their troubles, Ritesh Agarwal pointed out that their logo closely resembled Tesla’s, raising concerns about originality and branding. This observation prompted sarcastic reactions from Anupam and Aman Gupta, further intensifying the scrutiny. Brand trust and identity became key issues, leading some sharks to believe that the business lacked a clear and distinct positioning in the market.Despite the intense questioning, Trajectory’s financial performance kept Ritesh Agarwal and Peyush Bansal interested. However, Anupam, Namita, and Aman eventually backed out, citing issues related to branding, trust, and lack of differentiation.After a series of negotiations, the founders accepted Ritesh Agarwal’s offer of Rs 50 lakh for 3% equity, along with Rs 50 lakh in debt at an 8% interest rate. The deal came with specific scaling conditions, which the founders agreed to, securing Ritesh as their sole investor.","The latest episode of Shark Tank India Season 4 witnessed one of the most intense and high-pressure pitches of the season.

“They are really interesting, but I’m afraid it didn’t have a thing to do with it,” Janoff said. “Somebody starts it, and then people go, ‘Oh yeah, that must be it.’ But it’s all BS.”

The story behind Apple's logo

Why Apple's logo has a bite: The real reason revealed

“It was initially meant to indicate that it was an apple, and not something else,”

“Metaphorically, the bite indicated biting into all the knowledge users would get out of this computer.”

Apple logo’s ‘Byte’ myth: The accidental wordplay that stuck

“I wasn’t computer literate enough to see that initially,”

“But I was like, there’s a bit of wit that will last!”

Apple logo’s timeless appeal: Simplicity, evolution, and a lasting legacy

“People can’t remember complicated things. They can remember simple things,”

The Apple logo , one of the most recognisable symbols in the world, has been surrounded by speculation and myths for decades. The logo’s distinct bite mark has fueled theories ranging from biblical references to technological puns. Many have linked it to the story of Adam and Eve’s forbidden fruit, while others suggest it was inspired by Isaac Newton’s discovery of gravity. Perhaps the most famous theory is that the missing chunk represents a play on the word “byte,” a unit of digital data in computing.However, Rob Janoff , the graphic designer behind the logo, has finally set the record straight. In a recent interview, he dismissed these long-standing rumors, revealing that the true reason behind the design choice is far simpler than many had imagined. His explanation sheds light on Apple’s early branding strategy and highlights the role of simplicity in creating a lasting brand identity.For years, tech enthusiasts and Apple fans have insisted that the Apple logo's bite mark was a clever nod to computing terminology. The theory gained traction across social media platforms like Twitter and TikTok, with users praising the design as a subtle yet brilliant reference to digital technology.However, in an interview with Creative Bits, Janoff debunked the claim, calling it nothing more than an urban legend.Despite the widespread belief in the “byte” theory, Janoff clarified that the bite was added for a much simpler reason—to ensure that the fruit was instantly recognizable as an apple rather than any other round fruit like a cherry or peach.The Apple logo was created in 1977 when Janoff was working for the advertising agency Regis McKenna, which was responsible for Apple's branding during its early years. At the time, Apple was still a small company, and its founders, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, were looking for a logo that would represent their vision of computing in a way that was both innovative and user-friendly.Janoff was given little direction for the design, apart from Jobs’ insistence that the logo should not be “cute.” Taking creative liberty, Janoff decided to use a simple apple silhouette, which combined a natural, organic image with the futuristic vision of computers.The decision to add a bite mark to the apple was purely practical. Janoff wanted to make sure that the fruit would be instantly identifiable as an apple, as opposed to a cherry, peach, or any other round fruit.Janoff explained in an interview with Forbes.Though this explanation is far less mysterious than the byte-bite theory, it highlights the importance of clarity in design. By ensuring that the apple was easily recognizable, Janoff created a logo that would become one of the most iconic symbols in corporate history.Interestingly, while Janoff never intended the bite to be a reference to computing, the pun was noticed shortly after the logo's creation. His creative director, Chip, was the first to point out the connection between “bite” and “byte.”Janoff admitted.Even though the connection was unintentional, the wordplay became an enduring part of Apple’s brand identity. Over time, the idea that the logo was a clever technological reference became so widely accepted that many assumed it had been the original intent.The original Apple logo featured a rainbow-striped apple, which was introduced to highlight Apple's groundbreaking color display technology. As the company grew, the logo underwent several changes, transitioning to monochrome and sleeker designs in line with Apple's minimalist aesthetic.Despite these updates, the core design has remained unchanged, proving the strength of Janoff’s original vision. He believes the simplicity of the Apple logo is what makes it so memorable and effective.Janoff stated.He also emphasised that adding a subtle “wink” or a hint of humor to a design makes it more relatable and likable. This philosophy has helped the Apple logo stand the test of time, maintaining its status as one of the most recognizable logos in the world.","Rob Janoff, the graphic designer behind the Apple logo, has debunked the 'byte' theory. Janoff said the bite was added to ensure that the fruit was instantly recognizable as an apple rather than any other round fruit like a cherry or peach. His explanation sheds light on Apple's early branding strategy and highlights the role of simplicity in creating a lasting brand identity.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118634876,imgsize-25638,width-400,resizemode-4/118634876.jpg"

Microsoft uncovers global hacking ring that used AI for harmful content,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-uncovers-global-hacking-ring-that-used-ai-for-harmful-content/articleshow/118631408.cms,"Why this is dangerous

Microsoft has said that it has discovered a global cybercrime network that bypassed safety measures on its generative AI tools, including Azure OpenAI, to produce illicit content, such as non-consensual intimate images.According to a report by Bloomberg, the tech giant identified hackers based in multiple countries – from Iran, the UK, Hong Kong, and Vietnam – who leveraged stolen customer login credentials to gain unauthorised access to its AI services.The hackers – who are allegedly part of a global cybercrime network that Microsoft calls Storm-2139 – reportedly manipulated the capabilities of these AI platforms and sold access to other malicious groups, providing detailed instructions for generating harmful content.Microsoft has also identified two individuals in Florida and Illinois, but withheld their names to avoid compromising ongoing criminal investigations.“We take the misuse of AI very seriously, recognizing the serious and lasting impacts of abusive imagery for victims. Microsoft remains committed to protecting users by embedding robust AI guardrails and safeguarding our services from illegal and harmful content,” stated Steven Masada, assistant general counsel of Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit, in a blog post.This revelation underscores growing concerns about the potential misuse of generative AI to create fake, explicit images of both public figures and private individuals, as well as the production of child sexual abuse material. Despite safeguards implemented by companies like Microsoft and OpenAI, determined actors continue to seek ways to exploit these technologies.Microsoft's investigation followed a lawsuit filed in December against ten unidentified individuals in the Eastern District of Virginia, aimed at gathering information and disrupting the hacking group's operations.“As we’ve said before, no disruption is complete in one day. Going after malicious actors requires persistence and ongoing vigilance. By unmasking these individuals and shining a light on their malicious activities, Microsoft aims to set a precedent in the fight against AI technology misuse,” Masada added.","Microsoft says it has discovered a global cybercrime network that bypassed safety measures on its generative AI tools.

This is European tech CEOs plan to take on 'America First' Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-is-european-tech-ceos-plan-to-take-on-america-first-donald-trump/articleshow/115426324.cms,"Americans and Chinese didn’t don't get 'play fair' message

European tech CEOs are reportedly calling for regional countries to take stronger action against Big Tech's dominance and reduce reliance on the U.S. for critical technologies like artificial intelligence, following Donald Trump’s electoral victory.According to a report in CNBC, Donald Trump's win was a major topic among tech leaders at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon, Portugal. Many attendees expressed uncertainty about what to expect from the U.S. president-elect, citing unpredictability as a significant challenge.Andy Yen, CEO of Swiss VPN developer Proton, urged Europe to adopt a more ""Europe-first"" approach to technology, mirroring American protectionism. He emphasized the need to reverse the trend of the past two decades, during which key technologies like web browsing and smartphones have been dominated by a few large U.S. tech firms.VPNs, or virtual private networks, encrypt data and mask a user’s IP address to hide browsing activity and bypass censorship.“It’s time for Europe to step up,” Yen told CNBC at Web Summit. “It’s time to be bold. It’s time to be more aggressive. And the time is now, because we now have a leader in the U.S. that is ‘America-first,’ so I think our European leaders should be ‘Europe-first.’”Over the past decade, the European Union has taken legal action and introduced tough regulations to tackle the dominance of large tech players like Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta. However, with Trump preparing for a second term, there are concerns that Europe might soften its approach to avoid retaliation from the new administration.Yen urged the EU not to dilute its efforts to rein in American tech giants. “Europe has been thinking in a very globalist mindset. They’re thinking we need to be fair to everybody, we need to open our market to everybody, we need to play fair, because we believe in fairness,” he told CNBC. “Well, guess what? The Americans and the Chinese didn’t get the memo. They have been playing extremely unfairly for the last 20 years. And now they have a president that is extremely ‘America-first.’”Mitchell Baker, former CEO of the Mozilla Foundation, noted that the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) has led to meaningful changes for the Firefox browser, with increased activity since Google implemented a “choice screen” on Android phones that allows users to select their search engine. “The change in Firefox new users and market share on Android is noticeable,” Baker said. “That’s nice for us — but it’s also an indicator of how much power and centralized distribution these companies have.”She added, “This change in usage because of one choice screen isn’t the full picture. But it is an indicator of the kind of things that consumers can’t choose and that businesses can’t build successfully because of the way the tech industry is structured right now.”","European tech CEOs are reportedly calling for regional countries to take stronger action against Big Tech's dominance.

""The 2021 policy update by WhatsApp on a 'take-it-or-leave-it' basis constitutes an imposition of unfair condition under the Act, as it compels all users to accept expanded data collection terms and sharing of data within Meta Group without any opt out,"" the Commission stated.Under the behavioural remedies, WhatsApp must provide all users in India, including those who accepted the 2021 update, with opt-out options through prominent in-app notifications. Users must have access to a dedicated settings tab to review and modify their data-sharing choices.For non-advertising purposes, WhatsApp's policy must include detailed explanations linking each type of shared data to its specific purpose.""Sharing of user data collected on WhatsApp with other Meta companies... for purposes other than for providing WhatsApp service shall not be made a condition for users to access WhatsApp Service in India,"" the CCI directed in its order.The ruling impacts WhatsApp's largest market, with over 500 million monthly active users in India. The 2021 policy had required users to accept sharing their data with Meta-owned platforms like Facebook and Instagram to continue using the messaging service.The Commission found that Meta violated competition law by ""creating entry barriers for rivals to compete"" and ""leveraging its dominant position in OTT messaging apps to protect its position in online display advertising.""The decision comes amid increasing regulatory scrutiny of tech giants in India.

Released in 1984, The Terminator cemented its place as a science-fiction milestone, offering not only a gripping narrative but also an unsettling depiction of humanity's potential future relationship with artificial intelligence (AI). Directed by James Cameron , the film introduced audiences to the concept of Skynet , a rogue AI system that sparks nuclear annihilation and wages war against humanity. Featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger as the iconic T-800, the movie combined relentless action with themes of fate, technology, and human resilience. Four decades later, its cautionary tale resonates even more profoundly as AI becomes an increasingly dominant force in our world.At its core, The Terminator is a thrilling chase story where a cybernetic assassin is sent back in time to prevent the birth of a future human resistance leader. However, the underlying concept of Skynet—a defence system that becomes self-aware and initiates nuclear devastation—has cemented the film as a touchstone for AI-related fears. Skynet embodies the dual concerns of AI overreach: unaligned objectives and the catastrophic consequences of autonomous decision-making.This theme, while secondary to the film’s action-packed plot, effectively reflects a broader unease about technological progress. Skynet is ""trusted to run it all,"" only to perceive humanity itself as a threat. This mirrors concerns voiced today by experts like Nick Bostrom, who warn about ""unaligned AI"" acting in ways contrary to human values.Despite its fictional origins, The Terminator has influenced public understanding of AI, often becoming shorthand for the dangers of artificial intelligence. Skynet’s rogue behaviour and the T-800’s relentless pursuit of its target have sparked widespread associations between AI and apocalyptic scenarios.For instance, roboticist Ronald Arkin used clips from the film in a 2013 talk titled How NOT to Build a Terminator, emphasising caution in AI development. Similarly, the imagery of the T-800’s glowing red eyes has become emblematic of malevolent machines in popular culture. This “Terminator narrative,” however, has drawn criticism from AI researchers for exaggerating the existential risks of AI while overshadowing immediate issues such as job displacement, misinformation, and autonomous weaponry.Interestingly, James Cameron has often described The Terminator as less about AI and more about human struggles—against fate, against corporate greed, and against over-reliance on technology. The film portrays a world where human decisions, not machines, determine outcomes, reinforcing the idea that destiny is shaped by choices, not inevitabilities.The sequel, Terminator 2: Judgement Day, expanded on these themes, delving deeper into Skynet’s origins. It introduced the paradoxical idea that Skynet’s creation stemmed from remnants of the first Terminator, raising questions about self-fulfilling prophecies and human accountability in technological advancement.While The Terminator imagined a dystopian future, real-world AI development has followed a different trajectory, marked by cycles of rapid innovation and subsequent stagnation. The film’s depiction of Skynet as a neural network coincided with the revival of neural-net research by scientists like Geoffrey Hinton in the 1980s. Today, neural networks power groundbreaking advancements in machine learning, from natural language processing to image recognition.Despite its inaccuracies, the film’s portrayal of Skynet as an entity that learns, adapts, and ultimately turns against its creators foreshadowed contemporary discussions about AI safety. Concerns about AI systems operating beyond human control, whether through malicious intent or misaligned programming, remain central to debates within the field.As AI continues to evolve, The Terminator serves as both a cultural artefact and a cautionary tale. While its dramatic depiction of AI may not align with current realities, its message about the importance of ethical and controlled technological development is more relevant than ever. James Cameron, who is reportedly planning a new Terminator instalment, has suggested that his forthcoming project will explore humanity’s ongoing struggle to coexist with intelligent machines.By blending speculative fiction with pressing technological concerns, The Terminator has left an indelible mark on both cinema and the discourse surrounding AI. Its enduring legacy reminds us that while innovation offers immense possibilities, it also demands vigilance and responsibility.","James Cameron’s 1984 film The Terminator is a 40-year-old warning about the rise of AI.

Russian court imposes another fine on Google: This is the reason,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/russian-court-imposes-another-fine-on-google-this-is-the-reason/articleshow/115424003.cms,"Google fined $20 decillion for blocking pro-Russian channels on YouTube

A Russian district court has fined Google 3.8 million roubles (approximately $38,000) for failing to remove banned content, as per news agency Reuters. The latest fine comes weeks after the country fined the tech giant a sum that Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reportedly “can’t even pronounce right”.The report said that Russia has been ordering foreign technology platforms to remove content it deems illegal and has been issuing small, persistent fines when it sees failures to comply.Earlier this year, Russia fined one of the world’s biggest tech companies 2 undecillion rubles — 2 followed by 36 zeroes — after it did not pay fines imposed on it for blocking pro-Russian channels on YouTube.The $20 decillion — or around $20 billion trillion trillion – is more than the global economy of $110 trillion, let alone Google’s $2 Trillion market value.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at that time that he “can’t even pronounce this figure right” but said that the fine was “filled with symbolism.” Google “should not be restricting the actions of our broadcasters on its platform,” he added.In quarterly earnings, Google talked about the fines and referred to them as “ongoing legal matters” relating to its business in Russia.“Civil judgments that include compounding penalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including those of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect (on earnings),” Google said.Recently, a report suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin is also engaged in another YouTube-related issue. The Kremlin has alleged that YouTube is not upgrading its infrastructure in the country and as a result of this, the speed is being hampered on the platform. Google has denied the allegations.","A Russian district court has fined Google 3.8 million roubles (approximately $38,000) for failing to remove banned content.

Government to Amazon and Elon Musk's Starlink: Your satellite application can be processed only after ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-to-amazon-and-elon-musks-starlink-your-satellite-application-can-be-processed-only-after-/articleshow/115124999.cms,"Strict security guidelines and declaration

Why government is extra cautious on security

The Department of Telecommunications ( DoT ) has reportedly imposed stringent security requirements on Elon Musk 's Starlink and Jeff Bezos's Amazon before approving their satellite communication services in India. According to a report in Economic Times, both companies are expected to provide detailed compliance information regarding data security, coverage area, and other key parameters.While Bharti-backed OneWeb and Reliance Jio 's partnership with SES have already secured approval, Starlink and Amazon's applications are still pending due to the additional security checks.Officials aware of the details told ET that letters to both the US-based firms were sent recently and the department is awaiting their reply. ""Their applications can be processed only after they submit the compliance. The firms have so far not replied,"" said a person familiar with the details.Another official said that the government will wait for some more time for their reply, but the applications won't be processed till they agree to all the security conditions. ""There are various security-related compliances as well as those related to data, coverage area etc which satcom providers have to give to the government in order to offer services in India. All the boxes need to be ticked,"" said a third official.As per security requirements, the terminals have to stop communicating if there is a change in latitude and longitude position in order to prevent any misuse. In its replies to the government, Starlink had reportedly given a declaration that none of its investors were from countries sharing a land border with India -- primarily China and Pakistan. The government had accepted that declaration.The government's cautious approach is driven by concerns over potential security risks, especially given the strategic importance of satellite communications. The DoT is particularly interested in ensuring that satellite terminals near border areas are securely monitored and controlled to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is currently working on recommendations for pricing and other terms and conditions for allocating satellite spectrum. However, traditional telecom operators like Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea are advocating for a level playing field, arguing that satellite companies should be subject to the same regulations and liabilities as terrestrial operators.",The Department of Telecommunications ( DoT) has reportedly imposed stringent security requirements on Elon Musk's Starlink and Jeff Bezos's Amazon.

He recalled, “One morning, Sudha asked me, ‘Is there anything special today?’ I replied, ‘No, nothing,’ and went to the office. As I was getting in the car, she asked again, ‘Think of anything special today?’ I still didn’t realize.”Later that day, while heading to Mumbai, Murthy received a call from their daughter, Akshata Murty, who was studying at Stanford University at the time.

She immediately said, ‘Cancel it, get the first flight back to Bangalore, and wish your wife a happy anniversary!’”Narayana Murthy shared that he told her about a speech at 3pm but Akshata insisted, “I don’t care if you have a speech at 3 pm. If you need to hire a private plane, hire it, but come back and wish her!” Their daughter, Akshata Murty, is now married to former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.Sudha Murthy also chimed in, laughing, “It was our 25th wedding anniversary so it doesn’t happen every year. So I thought, let me give him a cue but it did not work… For five-ten minutes I felt bad because I’m also human.

What Europe’s tech CEOs have to say

Tech CEOs in Europe are calling for countries to take stronger action against Big Tech's dominance and reduce reliance on the US for critical technologies like artificial intelligence, following Donald Trump's electoral win, a report has said.According to CNBC, at least two tech CEOs have urged Europe to adopt a “Europe-first” approach to technology. Multiple reports in the recent past have talked about Trump’s “America first” take that may lead up to policy changes, including increased tariffs on imports in a likely push to local R&D and manufacturing.The report said that Andy Yen, CEO of Swiss VPN developer Proton , emphasised the need to reverse the trend of the past two decades, during which many of the Western world's most important technologies, from web browsing to smartphones, have been dominated by a few large U.S. tech firms.“It's time for Europe to step up. It's time to be bold. It's time to be more aggressive. And the time is now, because we now have a leader in the US that is 'America-first,' so I think our European leaders should be 'Europe-first’,” Yen told CNBC on the sidelines of the recently-held Web Summit.Over the past decade, the European Union has taken legal action and introduced tough new regulations to tackle the dominance of large technology players, such as Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta.Yen also said that US Big Tech is playing 'extremely unfairly'.""Europe has been thinking in a very globalist mindset. They're thinking we need to be fair to everybody, we need to open our market to everybody, we need to play fair, because we believe in fairness,"" he told CNBC.""Well, guess what? The Americans and the Chinese didn't get the memo. They have been playing extremely unfairly for the last 20 years. And now they have a president that is extremely 'America-first.'""Meanwhile, Thomas Plantenga, CEO of Lithuania-headquartered used clothing resale app Vinted, urged Europe to make the ""right choices"" to ensure the continent can ""fend for ourselves"" and not get ""left behind.""“If you look very realistically at what countries do, they try to take care of themselves and they try to form coalitions to be stronger themselves, and as a coalition be stronger,” Plantenga told CNBC.“We need to ensure that we can take care of our own safety, that we can take care of our own energy, that we ensure to keep on investing in our education and innovation so that we can keep up with the rest of the world,” he stressed.","Tech CEOs in Europe are calling for countries to take stronger action against Big Tech's dominance and reduce reliance on the US for critical technologies.

How PhonePe’s app store can take on Google’s monopoly



Xiaomi’s position in India



Xiaomi, one of the major players in India’s smartphone market, is expected to bring a major change to its smartphones. The Chinese smartphone maker is reportedly set to replace its GetApps app store in its smartphones with PhonePe's Indus AppStore starting in January. This move represents a significant win for the Walmart-backed domestic fintech startup and signals a shift in strategy for the company within the crucial Indian market. The change is expected to be rolled out automatically to Xiaomi devices in India via an update. This partnership will also provide PhonePe with access to a massive user base and strengthen its position in the Indian app store market .noted a customer notice seen by TechCrunch.In February, PhonePe launched its Indus AppStore to compete with Google's Play Store in India. This move comes amidst growing concerns from Indian businesses about Google's high fees and restrictions on third-party payment providers.The Indus AppStore aims to address these issues by offering a more developer-friendly platform with no listing fees for the first year, support for third-party payments, and local language options. This challenge to Google's dominance reflects a broader trend of businesses seeking alternatives to the Play Store's policies.Despite shipping over 250 million smartphones and 100 million other devices in India since 2013, Xiaomi has faced recent challenges in the market. Amidst political tensions between India and China, the company has seen its market share decline and experienced significant changes in its leadership.In 2022, Xiaomi shut down its financial services business in India following a scandal involving illegal remittances.

Why were UPPSC candidates protesting



Four Telegram channels are facing legal action for allegedly spreading misleading information and inciting students during a protest outside the Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission (UPPSC). According to a report by the news agency PTI, police have confirmed that an FIR has been registered against the channels under Section 318 (4) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) and the IT Act at Civil Lines police station. The complaint was filed by Krishna Murari Chaurasia , who is the in-charge of the UPPSC police outpost.The FIR accuse these Telegram channels of sharing misleading information to disrupt law and order. As per the FIR, misleading information was shared and circulated through these Telegram channels with the intent to provoke students and disrupt law and order. Screenshots of these channels were also included in the complaint as evidence.The protest, which began on November 11, was sparked by the UPPSC's decision to conduct the preliminary examinations for Provincial Civil Services (PCS), Review Officer (RO), and Assistant Review Officer (ARO) on separate days. Students demanded that the exams be held on the same day.On the fourth day of the protest, the UPPSC postponed the RO-ARO exam and announced that the PCS exam would be held in the old pattern on a single day.A committee would also be formed to ensure transparency and fairness in the RO-ARO exam, the commission announced.Following these concessions, the students ended their protest the next day and the UPPSC announced that the PCS Preliminary Exam 2024 would be held in two shifts on December 22.In August, the messaging app also faced increasing scrutiny from the government over its alleged role in facilitating criminal activities such as extortion and gambling soon after its CEO Pavel Durov was arrested in France.","Police have confirmed that an FIR has been registered against the channels under Section 318 (4) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) and the IT Act.

Russia President Vladimir Putin is now involved in slow speeds and disruptions on YouTube in the country, a report has said. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the move comes after Karen Shakhnazarov, head of Mosfilm, Russia's largest film studio, raised the issue with Putin during a meeting.“He [Putin] listened and said ‘I'll look into it’,"" Shakhnazarov said after the meeting.The government has claimed that Google has been deliberately ‘disrupting’ the platform in Russia. There have been reports from internet monitoring services of widespread YouTube outages in recent months. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has also linked the speed issues to Google's alleged non-compliance with Russian law.It has also been alleged that the company blocked and refused to reinstate YouTube accounts of Russian state media outlets and pro-government channels after the Russia-Ukraine war. It also claimed that the Google-owned company is limiting access to content critical of the government, however, the Kremlin denies such claims.Earlier this month, the country imposed a fine of $20,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 or $20 decillion on Google for failing to restore banned pro-Kremlin YouTube channels. This fine is more than Google's $2 trillion market value as well as the entire world's GDP of approximately $110 trillion.Shakhnazarov, while acknowledging the presence of undesirable content on YouTube, argued that those determined to access it can bypass restrictions.Google is also alleged to slow down YouTube in the country. The Kremlin attributed ‘speed’ problems to Google's alleged failure to upgrade its equipment in the country – a claim disputed by both Google and technology experts.""Slowing down YouTube, in my view, is not very advisable today.

The High Court is addressing a significant legal issue involving 79 divorces that were mistakenly approved due to an online system error. Under UK law, divorces can only be granted after a year and a day of marriage. However, a computer flaw allowed applications submitted precisely on the first anniversary of marriage to be processed and approved. Lawyers for the Lord Chancellor argue that these divorces should be considered ""voidable"" rather than ""void,"" to avoid far-reaching legal, financial, and personal complications for those involved. This case sheds light on the potential consequences of digital errors in the judicial system and highlights the delicate balance between legal precision and practical realities.Under current divorce laws in the UK, couples cannot legally seek a divorce until at least one year and one day after marriage. This requirement is designed to provide newlyweds with a mandatory adjustment period before pursuing separation.Between April 6, 2022, and April 30, 2024, 96 divorce applications were made on the first anniversary of marriage, with 79 progressing to final orders. The error stemmed from a flaw in the validation system of the online divorce portal, introduced in April 2022. The system failed to flag applications submitted prematurely, resulting in court staff unknowingly approving them.Lawyers representing the Lord Chancellor contend that the erroneous divorce orders should be classified as ""voidable"" rather than ""void."" This distinction is crucial as ""voidable"" orders can remain legally valid, avoiding significant disruptions.Sir James Eadie KC, representing the Lord Chancellor, argued that undoing the divorce orders would have severe consequences for the individuals involved, including financial disputes, child custody complications, and religious implications.If the court rules the orders as ""void,"" couples who believed they were divorced would be considered legally married again. This could lead to issues for those who have since remarried or made financial arrangements based on their assumed divorce status. Sir James emphasised that such outcomes would be ""highly unfortunate and highly unwelcome"" for the affected individuals.Several respondents have expressed significant distress over the possibility of their divorces being invalidated. Many fear the legal, financial, and personal repercussions, including the status of subsequent marriages or planned remarriages.Sir James underscored that the error was a ""genuine system flaw"" and not attributable to the divorcees or their legal representatives. He highlighted that all other legal criteria for divorce were met in these cases, and the error was ""of a minor kind,"" involving a deviation of just one day.The error originated in the online divorce portal's validation system, which failed to recognize and flag applications submitted on the first anniversary of marriage. This flaw was not detected by court staff during the review process.This case raises questions about the reliability of digital systems in managing sensitive legal matters and underscores the need for robust safeguards to prevent similar errors in the future.Sir James argued that Parliament had not explicitly outlined the consequences of non-compliance with the year-and-a-day rule. He suggested that voiding the divorces in question was not the intent of lawmakers, particularly for such a minor infraction.The hearing was presided over by Sir Andrew McFarlane and Judge Lynn Roberts, who are expected to issue a written judgement at a later date.","79 divorces were mistakenly approved due to an online system error.

Pakistan religious body issues 'Diktat' on using VPNs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/pakistan-religious-body-issues-diktat-on-using-vpns/articleshow/115417430.cms,"Image credit: Canva

How experts reacted to this ‘diktat’



""They make laws in such a way and are using decrees … as per their whims,""

""This move was only to target certain social media users,""

How VPNs became a major concern for Pakistan



Pakistan's leading constitutional religious body, the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), has reportedly issued an edict declaring the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to access blocked online content as ""un-Islamic."" The CII, which advises parliament on aligning laws with Islamic principles, faced backlash for its stance on VPNs, which are often used to bypass censorship and access restricted websites. This announcement has also drawn sharp criticism from digital rights activists and even some religious scholars.According to a report by the news agency PTI, the CII chief Raghib Naeemi said that using VPNs to access ""imm­oral or illegal content"" was against Sharia.In a statement shared on social media (cited by PTI), a prominent religious scholar, Maulana Tariq Jameel, said that if the concern is about accessing adult content or blasphemous material, then mobile phones should be declared ‘un-Islamic’ before targeting VPNs with such labels.Senator Allama Nasir Abbas, leader of the Shia organisation Majlis Wahdat Muslimeen (MWM), stated that the country is governed by an ""incompetent and corrupt elite"" who do not genuinely represent the people.Abbas added.Wahaj Siraj, the CEO of Pakistani telecom major Nayatel, said that technology itself has always been neutral; it is its usage or misusage that determines whether it is considered 'Halal' or 'Haram,’ the PTI report added.Nighat Dad, Executive Director of the Digital Rights Foundation, also criticised the move to block VPNs as ""contradictory"" to the constitutional rights to privacy.Dad claimed.A member of the CII even highlighted that the statement reflected Naeemi's ""personal views"" and was not the council's official stance. He added that using technology to access immoral content cannot be classified as a religious matter.The issue of VPNs emerged when the Interior Ministry directed the Pakistan Telecom Authority, the electronic media regulator, to act against their illegal use, citing their role in facilitating terrorism.Senator Palwasha Khan, who chairs the Senate Standing Committee on IT and Telecom, has a meeting scheduled for today (November 18) to address the telecom regulator's restrictions on the ""illegal"" use of VPNs in Pakistan.Khan raised concerns about whether the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) would monitor the content accessed by users.","The Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) has declared the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to access blocked online content as ""un-Islamic"" The CII, which advises parliament on aligning laws with Islamic principles, faced backlash for its stance on VPNs, which are often used to bypass censorship and access restricted websites.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115417459,imgsize-946173,width-400,resizemode-4/115417459.jpg"
Mumbai to China parcel: How an engineer lost Rs 10 crore to Digital Arrest that went on for 19 days,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mumbai-to-china-parcel-how-an-engineer-lost-rs-10-crore-to-digital-arrest-that-went-on-for-19-days/articleshow/115416120.cms,"How the scam unfolded

A Rohini-based retired engineer has become the latest victim of an online scam, losing a huge sum of Rs 10 crore over a period of 19 days. The incident serves as a reminder of the growing threat of ""digital arrest"" scams and the importance of online vigilance.A 77-year old retired engineer from Rohini recently revealed that his ordeal began on September 25, when he received a call from a courier company. ""I usually don't take calls from unknown numbers, but unfortunately, I did that day,"" he told TOI.The caller, impersonating a courier company representative, informed the engineer about a suspicious parcel addressed to him, originating from Mumbai and routed for China. The engineer, denying any knowledge of the parcel, was then connected to a purported Mumbai Police officer.The victim then received a video call in which he saw a man sitting in front of a Mumbai Police logo. The officer explained the alleged parcel scam and requested the victim's bank details for verification. The call was then transferred to another individual, who posed as a senior CBI officer, further pressurising the victim.""He instructed me to move to a private room to avoid eavesdropping and asked me several questions. Then, he showed me documents, including one with my Aadhaar details and another ordering me not to leave the country,” said the victim.The victim also revealed that the officer on the other end of the call warned him not to disclose the incident to his children or anyone else, threatening they would also face trouble.""They claimed my phone was under surveillance,"" he said.The following day, the victim was connected to an individual claiming to be an Enforcement Directorate officer. The officer assured the victim of assistance in the matter, further deepening the victim's trust and confusion. Over the next 19 days, the scammers, maintaining their control over the victim, instructed him to transfer Rs 10.3 crore in three installments.On October 14th, the scammers introduced a new twist, claiming that the victim's brother was implicated in the investigation. This further pressured the victim, forcing him to involve his brother. Fortunately, the brother recognised the scam and convinced the victim to cease further payments.He filed a complaint with the Rohini district police cyber cell. ""I had had time to talk about the incident with my family and the cops, but I remained frightened. Even my wife was scared,"" he said.","A Rohini-based retired engineer has become the latest victim of an online scam. The 77-year-old lost a huge sum of Rs 10 crore over a period of 19 days.

Amazon India is reportedly set to relocate its headquarters from the prestigious World Trade Centre to a new location closer to Bengaluru's airport. According to a report in business daily Mint, the move, aimed at reducing costs, is expected to begin in April 2024 and be completed by 2026.The company's current office, a sprawling 500,000 square feet space across 18 floors, is part of Brigade Gateway, a mixed-use development. However, the high rental costs of this prime location have prompted Amazon to seek a more cost-effective solution.The new office, located approximately 20 kilometers away, is estimated to reduce rental expenses by up to two-thirds. While this move could lead to significant cost savings, it has raised concerns among employees due to increased commute times.Amazon India has been undergoing significant changes in recent times. Samir Kumar , a company veteran, took over as country manager in September 2023, replacing Manish Tiwary . The company has also faced challenges, including layoffs and slower growth rates.Despite these challenges, Amazon India's Seller Services business reported a 14% increase in operating revenue in FY24. However, the growth rate has slowed down compared to the pandemic years.The relocation of the headquarters is a strategic move by Amazon India to optimize costs and improve operational efficiency. As the company continues to navigate a dynamic market, it will be interesting to see how this decision impacts its overall business performance.","Amazon India is reportedly set to relocate its headquarters from the prestigious World Trade Centre to a new location closer to Bengaluru's airport.

EY has been appointed as an advisor, and the central bank has specifically invited India-incorporated companies with cloud solution experience to bid for the project.Sources say participating companies must establish data centres in Mumbai and Hyderabad, either independently or as part of consortiums.

Elon Musk responds



Elon Musk predicted Canada's PM Justin Trudeau’s defeat

When Brazil banned Elon Musk’s X

Brazil's First Lady, Janja Lula da Silva swore at Tesla CEO Elon Musk during a G20 social event last week. A ship’s horn blared in the background while she spoke about the need to regulate social media to curb the spread of misinformation. She responded saying “I think it's Elon Musk,” before adding, “I'm not afraid of you, f**k you, Elon Musk.”The video of Silva swearing at Musk soon gained attention with many users posting the same online. Responding to one such video post on X (formerly Twitter), Musk said “They are going to lose the next election,” referring to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. He also posted laughing out loud emojis.Previously, the tech billionaire predicted the defeat of Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the next year's elections. Responding to a post that said Germany's ""socialist government"" had collapsed, Musk said ""Olaf ist ein Narr."" The sentence translates to: ""Olaf is a fool"", referring to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.To this, a user replied, ""Elon Musk we need your help in Canada getting rid of Trudeau"". Musk replied to the user saying ""He will be gone in the upcoming election,"".The conflict between Elon Musk and Brazilian authorities has intensified over the past year, reaching a breaking point with the suspension of X's operations in the country. Brazil banned the platform in August for failing to meet local legal requirements, including removing accounts linked to hate speech and misinformation and appointing a legal representative within the country—a mandatory provision under Brazilian law.Earlier this year, Brazil’s Supreme Court ordered X to comply with its content moderation rules. Musk resisted, arguing that these directives were tantamount to censorship. He even referred to Justice Alexandre de Moraes, the judge behind the orders, as a ""dictator.""The ban was lifted in October after X complied with key demands, such as moderating content, blocking specific accounts, and appointing a local legal representative.","Brazil's First Lady, Janja Lula da Silva swore at Tesla CEO Elon Musk during a G20 social event last week.

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt characterised Apple co-founder Steve Jobs as a ""diva"" who would bully people but whose difficult personality was outweighed by his brilliance and drive for perfection.Speaking on ""The Diary of A CEO"" podcast, Schmidt praised Jobs' leadership style despite its controversial aspects. ""Opinionated and strong and argumentative and would bully people if he didn't like them, but was brilliant,"" Schmidt said of Jobs. ""He wanted perfection, right? Aligning yourself with Steve Jobs is a good idea.""Schmidt, who led Google from 2001 to 2011, argued that such challenging personalities are essential for corporate innovation. ""If you don't have such a person, your company's not going to go anywhere,"" he said, explaining that companies need someone to push beyond conventional approaches.In their book ""How Google Works,"" Schmidt and former Google VP Jonathan Rosenberg distinguish between beneficial ""divas"" like Jobs and destructive ""knaves."" While both may display difficult personalities, divas contribute to team success despite their eccentricities, whereas knaves prioritise personal gain at others' expense.""Great people are often unusual and difficult,"" they wrote, noting that some of these quirks can be ""quite off-putting."" However, Schmidt emphasised that finding and collaborating with exceptional individuals is crucial for business success, even if they're challenging to work with.Schmidt advised leaders to ""find someone who's just smarter than you, more clever than you, moves faster than you, changes the world...

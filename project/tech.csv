What Gates Foundation's filing reveals on the 'promise' Bill Gates made to his ex-wife Melinda French Gates when she left,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-gates-foundations-filing-reveals-on-the-promise-bill-gates-made-to-his-ex-wife-melinda-french-gates-when-she-left/articleshow/127791053.cms,"A history of Joint Philanthropy



Melinda Gates Pivotal network



The new non-profit filings have revealed the multi-billion-dollar promise Microsoft founder Bill Gates made to his ex-wide Melinda French Gates when she resigned from the Gates Foundation in 2024. As reported by Frobes, Bill Gates donated nearly $2 billion in 2024 to two of Melinda’s foundations named Pivotal Philanthropies Opportunities and Pivotal Philanthropies Momentum. Each of the foundations received $982 million.These gifts come on top of the $8.9 billion which Gates had already transferred to the two other Pivotal foundations, including a $7.9 billion donation to Pivotal Philanthropies, her main philanthropic vehicle, and $982 million to Pivotal Pathways. The fillings suggest that together Gates has given a total of $10.8 billion across four foundations and fulfilled nearly $12.5 billion commitment he made to fund Melinda’s new philanthropic endeavours. A Pivotal spokesperson confirmed that the agreement has been met, though it remains unclear when or where the remaining $1.7 billion was delivered.Bill and Melinda Gates co-founded the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000 and made it one of the world’s most influential philanthropic organisations.Over the years, the two have donated at least $52.6 billion to nonprofits, ranking them as the second-biggest givers globally.The Gates Foundation has also distributed around $83.3 billion in grants through 2024, funding initiatives from tuberculosis reduction to polio eradication. With an annual budget of $9 billion, it remains larger than the World Health Organization, which has a combined $6.2 billion budget for 2026–27.Melinda French Gates has been steadily building her own philanthropic ecosystem under Pivotal, founded in 2015. The umbrella organization now includes five foundations — Pivotal Philanthropies, Opportunities, Momentum, Pathways, and Firefinch — alongside a 501(c)(4) advocacy fund and Pivotal Ventures LLC, a private investment arm.In 2024, Pivotal Philanthropies distributed $487 million, including a landmark $250 million initiative supporting over 80 women’s health organizations worldwide. The smaller foundations, however, had not yet made charitable distributions as of their latest filings.","Melinda French Gates has been steadily building her own philanthropic ecosystem under Pivotal, founded in 2015.

Google Maps gets new AI-powered features

Google has announced that Gemini AI is now available in Google Maps for walking and cycling routes, following its earlier debut in driving directions. This move of the company is designed to make navigation safer and more interactive by removing the need to type while on the move. With this latest update, users can now Gemini questions like: “Tell me more about the neighbourhood I’m in,” “What are some must-see attractions nearby?”, “Are there cafes with a bathroom along my route?”.Gemini can also provide ETA updates, check schedules or even send messages hands-free, such as “Text Sarah I’m 10 minutes behind” to the cyclists.In order to use the Gemini AI in Google Maps, users just need to tap on the Gemini icon present in the Maps interface or use the ‘Hey Google’ hotword.

Nokia CEO Justin Hotard has sene a message that both the US and Europe must work together, warning that the technology sector cannot survive on “one continent or the other”. His comments come as the European Union considers new measures to bolster homegrown industries and reduce its reliance on foreign technology companies.Hotard emphasised that the rapid scaling of modern technology requires the largest possible market access to justify the costs of innovation.“Every single one of us cannot subsist on one continent or the other. We need both. Particularly in technology, where the window and the right to win is dictated by that technology cycle, it's really critical that you have as big a market access as possible,” Hotard told Reuters in an interview Nokia CEO’s remarks highlight problems for companies like Nokia and Ericsson, who find themselves caught between European efforts to build ""technological sovereignty"" and their heavy reliance on the massive US market.The US lacks a major domestic manufacturer of 5G infrastructure, and after banning Chinese vendors over national security concerns, US carriers have become almost entirely dependent on Nokia, Ericsson, and South Korea’s Samsung for their wireless equipment.The CEO's comments are in line with a shift in Brussels, where the European Commission is proposing a phase-out of “high-risk vendors” from critical sectors, including 5G networks.

What's worrying Microsoft investors

OpenAI worries rub on Microsoft

Microsoft dragged down the benchmark with an 12% slide, which would be its worst day since March 2020. The company saw more than $400 billion wipeout in stock market valuation, which is the second-largest in history. Shares of the software giant were down 12% as of 1:20 p.m., their biggest intraday plunge since March 2020, erasing roughly $424 billion in market value. The only larger one-day valuation destruction in stock market history was Nvidia’s $593 billion rout in January last year after the launch of DeepSeek’s low-cost AI model.According to Bloomberg, the roughly 12% drop in Microsoft’s share price is among the worst in its history. Since it’s initial public offering in 1986, the stock has only seen a handful of days with bigger declines, including on Black Monday in 1987, during the dot-com bubble, and at the height of the Covid 19 fueled selloff in 2020. The software giant has also issued soft guidance on operating margin for the fiscal third quarter.Microsoft shares dropped as the company seemingly is struggling to justify recent spending plans to investors and showed a slowdown in its cloud segment.In fact, the money flowing into AI and new technology has been a major source of debate on Wall Street. Investors increasingly want to see that companies show signs that they are reaping rewards from the massive spending over the last year. Here Microsoft’s results showed a 66% rise in capital expenditures in its most recent quarter to a record $37.5 billion, as Microsoft supports demand for its cloud and AI segments.This rise in Capex comes at a time when growth at its closely tracked Azure cloud-computing unit slowed from the prior quarter. Investors reportedly closely watch the segment as a stand-in for measuring enterprise AI demand. “Since it is becoming even more evident that Microsoft is not going to garner a strong ROI from their massive AI investment, their shares need to be revalued back down to a level that is more consistent with its historic fair value,” told Matthew Maley, Chief Market Strategist at Miller Tabak + Co to Bloomberg.The company also acknowledged that it is struggling with compute capacity constraints as demand continues to outweigh supply. In a letter to employees, Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood said Azure would have grown 40% if the company had funneled all of its new graphics processing unit chips in the first and second quarter into its Azure business. She also said the company is balancing having “incoming supply better meet growing Azure demand” with product innovation and growing first-party AI usage in services like GitHub Copilot and M365 Copilot.The growing fears about Sam Altman's OpenAI too seem to be worrying Microsoft investors. According to CNBC, Microsoft's demand backlog rose to $625 billion, up 110%, which included a $250 billion cloud agreement with OpenAI during the period. The ChatGPT maker accounted for 45% of its commercial remaining performance obligations. Analysts at Evercore ISI said “concerns about OpenAI’s ability to meet funding commitments” likely contributed to the post-earnings stock spiral but called the sentiment “overblown. ”","Shares of the software giant were down 12% as of 1:20 p.m., their biggest intraday plunge since March 2020.

There are moments in Wordle when you lose confidence and follow your instincts. That's how people usually wait these days. You can't take short cuts, but you also can't rush through the puzzle. Initial presumptions may appear favourable at first, but they can also progressively impede better decisions. The letters are recognisable and nearly obvious, but the placement is more important than normal. Smart openers and ostentatious risks are not appropriate at this moment. Players who pay as much attention to what is absent as to what is present are rewarded, but it requires self-control and concentration. It makes sense if you've been staring at the grid for longer than you intended. As long as the framework aligns, the solution remains unattainable. You can maintain stability and concentrate on the word by using a few well-chosen signals.Wordle challenges players to uncover a hidden five-letter word in six attempts. After each guess, tiles change colour to show how close you are.Using this feedback to refine each new guess is the core of the game.If today’s puzzle is proving stubborn, these clues focus on structure rather than spelling. They are intended to guide rather than solve.Reviewing eliminated letters and leaning on common consonants may help reduce the remaining options and bring the solution into view.The answer to Wordle #1685 on January 29, 2026, is:Meaning: Refers to something that easily breaks into thin, small pieces (like pastry or skin), or informally describes a person who is eccentric, unreliable, and prone to canceling plansWhether you solved it on your first guess or needed a few clues, Wordle remains a fun way to sharpen your mind every day.

Sridhar Vembu: Engineering discipline matters

“I suggest the term ""AI-assisted Code Engineering"" with ACE as the acronym instead of ""vibe-coding"". We must have solid engineering discipline and ACE is the maturation of the tools and techniques”.

“It does not eliminate all software engineers but enables experienced engineers who ACE well to be much more productive,” he said, adding “It is also going to reshape our industry but that is a separate topic.”



What is vibe coding







Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has suggested a new way to describe vibe-coding, a word that became one of the biggest “headache” of engineers in 2025. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Vembu argued that the termdoes not reflect the discipline required in real engineering work. He said that he prefers a new termto describe the growing use of AI tools in writing and maintaining software. In the post, Vembu said the focus should remain on solid engineering practices, even as AI becomes more deeply embedded in coding workflows.Sharing the post, Sridhar Vembu wrote:Vembu says that the term ACE does not remove the need for software engineers. Instead, it allows experienced engineers to “be much more productive”.Vibe coding is a term used to describe a more informal, AI-driven approach to programming. It refers to building apps and websites by chatting with AI instead of writing code line by painstaking line.Vembu’s comments come at a time when AI-powered coding tools are being widely adopted by developers and companies to speed up software development. His remarks also highlight concerns among industry leaders that such language may underplay the importance of structure, accountability, and long-term reliability in software systems.Collins Dictionary named “vibe-coding” as its word of the year for 2025.","Vibe coding is a term used to describe a more informal, AI-driven approach to programming.

What Tim Cook means by “loving museums”

Apple CEO Tim Cook (Image source: Bloomberg)

“I don’t want to live in one”: A warning against stagnation

A lesson in leadership and decision-making

Why the quote resonates beyond technology

A reflection of Tim Cook’s leadership style

Why the quote still matters

""I love museums. But I don't want to live in one""

,





Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple , doesn't give long speeches or use dramatic slogans. When he does say something, it's usually short, to the point, and well thought out. One of these lines is his quote:. The sentence is easy to understand, like a conversation. But it has a deeper meaning about how to move forward, how to be a leader, and how businesses and people should plan for the future.The quote is based on the idea that honouring the past should never be a reason to stop moving forward. Museums are places where history is kept. They keep ideas, inventions, and events that changed the world. They help us remember where we came from. Tim Cook has never said that we should forget or ignore history. Instead, he says that it is dangerous to get too comfortable with it.In today's world, where things change quickly, especially in technology, staying still can cost you a lot. Cook's quote shows that progress means always moving forward, even when past success makes you feel safe.Museums are very important to society. They keep culture, new ideas, and human accomplishments safe. Future generations would lose touch with the ideas and work that shaped the past if there were no museums. Tim Cook saying ""love"" shows that he cares. He thinks it's important to learn from the past. He likes what has already been made.Apple has a long and well-known history. People often study and admire the company's past innovations, which include the Macintosh, the iPod, and the iPhone. A lot of these items are now on display in museums and exhibitions all over the world. Cook knows more about this legacy than most people.But liking someone doesn't mean you care about them. His quote makes it clear that history is important to learn about, but it shouldn't be a place where you want to stay, especially in an industry driven by constant innovation, progress, and forward-looking thinking.The second part of the quote is where the real meaning is. Living in a museum means being surrounded by things that have already been done, but not doing anything new. It means comfort, safety, and familiarity. That comfort can slowly turn into stagnation in business and leadership.Tim Cook has said many times that it's dangerous to depend too much on past successes. The markets change. Technology changes. People's needs change. What worked ten years ago might not work anymore. Businesses that only care about keeping their legacy alive often have a hard time staying relevant.Apple has kept changing under Cook's leadership. The business has grown into services, put more emphasis on user privacy, put money into protecting the environment, and moved into new areas like custom silicon chips. These choices show that the company is willing to try new things, even if the old ones worked.The quote is true for all leaders, not just Apple. People often praise leaders for their past successes, using previous wins as proof of future capability and judgement. People trust you more when you have done well in the past. But depending too much on past success can keep you from coming up with new ideas or recognising when the environment has fundamentally shifted.Cook's words make it sound like good leadership needs to be balanced. You can learn from history, but don't let it tell you what to do all the time. Don't let your past experiences tell you what to do. This method lets businesses change instead of fighting it, allowing innovation to emerge naturally rather than defensively.This idea also works for people. Careers, skills, and fields of work change over time. It can be harder to grow if you hold on too tightly to what used to work. The quote quietly encourages people to be open and curious, even when change is hard, uncertain, or uncomfortable at first.This quote stands out because it is so simple. It doesn't use business jargon or technical language. People can all understand it. Most people know how nice it is to stick to their routines and how hard it is to try something new.In a broader sense, the remark addresses how cultures deal with progress. Traditions and fresh ideas frequently conflict. It is crucial to respect tradition and history while also being open to new experiences. Cook's remark acknowledges the history. It simply refuses to be confined by it.This balance is especially important now that technology is changing quickly and making people wonder about jobs, education, and social structures. The quote tells people that progress doesn't mean forgetting the past; it means building on it in a smart way.People often say that Tim Cook is calm, level-headed, and practical. His way of leading is different from Steve Jobs's, who was known for making bold and dramatic statements. Cook does things in a quieter way. His words are more likely to make you think than to make you angry, reflecting patience, consistency, ethical decision-making, and a long-term focus rather than short-term applause, values that align closely with Apple’s culture and leadership philosophy.This quote fits that pattern. It doesn't need attention. It makes you think. It gives a point of view without making people agree. That restraint is one reason it feels real.The quote doesn't give a big picture; it gives a way of thinking. It talks about how Cook sees progress, responsibility, and long-term success.is still true because it describes a problem that everyone faces. How can we remember the past without letting it control us? How do we go on without losing what matters?It's clear but not obvious what Tim Cook means. Value history. Take something away from it. Then decide to go on.In one short sentence, the CEO of Apple reminds us that we can choose to make progress. It takes work, curiosity, and a willingness to go beyond what you already know. Museums keep the past alive. But the future is being built somewhere else.","Tim Cook's quote has a deeper meaning about how to move forward.

Blinkit CEO Albinder Singh Dhindsa will take over as CEO.

Deepinder Goyal has tendered his resignation as Director, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the company, effective close of business on February 1, 2026.

Albinder Singh Dhindsa has been appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company with effect from February 1, 2026. Further, the Board of Directors (“Board”) recommended the appointment of Deepinder Goyal as the Director and Vice Chairman of the Board, effective upon shareholders' approval.

Of late, I have found myself drawn to a set of new ideas that involve significantly higher-risk exploration and experimentation.

They do not. Eternal deserves to remain focused, and disciplined, while exploring new areas of growth that are relevant to its current line of business.

While I believe I personally have the bandwidth to continue what I am doing at Eternal, and also explore new ideas outside of it, the expectations, legal and otherwise, of a public company CEO in India demand singular focus.""

Read Deepinder Goyal's full letter that he sent to shareholders

“Dear Shareholders,

Today, I am going to step away from the Group CEO role, and subject to shareholders' approval, will remain on the board of directors as Vice Chairman.

Albinder Dhindsa

(Albi) will be Eternal's new Group CEO.

Why this change

Of late, I have found myself drawn to a set of new ideas that involve significantly higher-risk exploration and experimentation.

These are the kinds of ideas that are better pursued outside a public company like Eternal. If these ideas belonged inside Eternal's strategic scope, I would have pursued them within the company. They do not. Eternal deserves to remain focused, and disciplined, while exploring new areas of growth that are relevant to its current line of business.

While I believe I personally have the bandwidth to continue what I am doing at Eternal, and also explore new ideas outside of it, the expectations, legal and otherwise, of a public company CEO in India demand singular focus.

This transition allows Eternal to remain sharply focused, while giving me the space to explore ideas that do not fit Eternal's risk profile.

What doesn't change

I have spent eighteen years, almost half my life, building this company. I will continue doing that.

Albi, Akshant, and I will continue to work closely together, as we always have. Our partnership, shared context, and trust remain unchanged. All our business CEOs will continue operating with the autonomy they have always had.

My involvement in long-term strategy, culture, leadership development, and ethics and governance, continues. This is where I have increasingly focused lately anyway.

What changes

The centre of gravity for operating decisions moves to Albi.

As Group CEO, he will own day-to-day execution, operating priorities, and business decisions.

Blinkit's journey from acquisition to breakeven happened under his leadership.

He built the team, the culture, the supply chain, the operating rhythm. He has the DNA of a battle-hardened founder and his ability to execute far exceeds mine. He is more than capable of leading Eternal as Group CEO.

Blinkit remains our largest growth opportunity and will remain as Albi's top priority. Our decentralized structure, where each business has a CEO with full ownership, continues unchanged - and will help Albi execute this well.

On alignment and ESOPs

My financial future remains meaningfully tied to Eternal, and my incentives remain aligned with long-term shareholder value creation.

As part of this transition, all of my unvested ESOPs will revert to the ESOP pool. This ensures that Eternal continues to have meaningful wealth-creation opportunities for its next generation of leaders, while strengthening long-term retention without incremental shareholder dilution.

Looking ahead

Eighteen years ago, the idea that a menu scanning company could be worth tens of billions of dollars, provide livelihoods to hundreds of thousands of people, and serve millions of families daily would have seemed absurd. We helped prove it was possible. And there's a lot in store for Eternal to do over the next few decades.

I believe Eternal is not going to lose focus or momentum through this change. Rather, it is reinforcing its institutional strength.

And personally, I gain the flexibility to explore ideas that sit outside Eternal's scope, without compromising the company's priorities.

I want Eternal to become India's most valuable company. I want us to serve a billion customers. I want us to create the most positive impact on society. I want us to be the source of livelihoods for millions of Indians. None of that changes.

This is a change in title, not in commitment towards outcomes. Eternal remains my life's work.

Thank you for your continued trust and support.

Months after Donald Trump made an 'angry call' to Jeff Bezos; Amazon CEO Andy Jassy makes statement on Trump Tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/months-after-donald-trump-made-angry-call-to-jeff-bezos-after-learning-amazon-plans-to-display-added-cost-of-tariffs-ceo-andy-jassy-makes-statement-on-trump-tariffs/articleshow/126848913.cms,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy

When White House called Amazon's tariff plan an 'hostile act'





In April 2025, a pissed Donald Trump made a call to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos after learning that the company is planning to display the added cost of tariffs on certain items. Trump made the call to Bezos to complain about reports that Amazon was considering to highlight the cost of US tariffs next to prices for certain products on the company’s website. Trump later told reporters about the call to Amazon founder and said it was a “good call.” “Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific,” Trump told reporters. “He solved the problem very quickly. Good guy.”Punchbowl News first reported that Amazon will soon “display how much of an item’s cost is derived from tariffs — right next to the product’s total listed price.” The move came after Trump slapped 145% tariffs on imports from China and a 10% minimum tax on all other countries.Now months later, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC in an interview Jassy at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Amazon.com is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures stemming from the US President Donald Trump's tariffs. ""We did a lot of pre-buying in the early part of 2025 to enable us to try and keep prices as low as possible for customers,"" Jassy said.He added, ""And a lot of our third-party sellers did a lot of forward-staging in our fulfillment network for the same reasons. And that supply is run out in the fall, so you start to see some of the tariffs creep in to some of the prices, some of the items.""""Some third-party sellers are raising prices in response while others are absorbing the costs in hopes of driving more demand,"" Jassy went on to add. ""Our priority is to try to figure out how to keep prices low as possible,"" Jassy said. ""At a certain point, because retail is a mid-single-digit operating margin business, if people's costs go up by 10%, there aren't a lot of places to absorb it.""The warning marks a shift from the Amazon leader's commentary on tariffs last year. While he cautioned in April that third-party sellers could need to pass along tariff costs, he said on several occasions that Amazon had not seen selling prices appreciably rise from tariffs. ""Amazon's consumers overall have fared well. But we'll have to see what happens in 2026,"" CEO Jassy had said.The company has also maintained so far that over the past year it was seeing very little impact on consumer behavior and product prices from tariffs. It has doubled down on expanding product categories and speeding up delivery timelines to shield demand.In April 2025, at a briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called the move a “hostile and political act,” adding that she had spoken about the matter with President Trump earlier. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed Levitt’s comments, saying it’s a hostile act if a company goes out of its way to “make it seem” like tariffs have caused prices to change.“It’s nonsense,” he said Tuesday in a CNBC interview. “A 10% tariff is not going to change virtually any price,” he added, referring to the nearly universal baseline tariff on all countries. “The only price will change would be a product that we don’t make here, like a mango.” The 10% tariff, however, is hardly the only one in effect.",Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says the company is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has a message for everyone on AI Bubble. In a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella talked about the fears that has been troubling Wall Street for past many months: whether AI is a bubble. Speaking at a session, Nadella said that it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.“A telltale sign of if it’s a bubble would be if all we are talking about are the tech firms,” Nadella said. “If all we talk about is what’s happening to the technology side then it’s just purely supply side.” Nadella said the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) need to be ""much more evenly distributed"" to avoid it from becoming a ""bubble"".He spoke about how AI and other advanced technologies are increasing productivity and changing the way we work. Nadella offered a fix to what is called productivity dilemma. According to him, business leaders need to adopt a new approach to knowledge work by shifting workflows to match the structural design of AI. “The mindset we as leaders should have is, we need to think about changing the work—the workflow—with the technology.Nadella argues that AI creates a “complete inversion” of how information moves through a business, replacing slow, hierarchical processes with a view that forces leaders to rethink their organizational structures. “We have an organization, we have departments, we have these specializations, and the information trickles up,” Nadella said. “For large organizations,” Nadella told Fink, “there’s a fundamental challenge: Unless and until your rate of change keeps up with what is possible, you’re going to get schooled by someone small being able to achieve scale because of these tools. ”Microsoft CEO said that the role of AI needs to be examined across all aspects of life, such as how it is helping pharma companies bring critical drugs faster to the market or accelerate trials. He called for AI-driven economic growth rather than just increasing spending. ""We as a global community have to get to a point where we are using AI to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries,"" Nadella said.","Satya Nadella said it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.

Debate at Davos



Palantir CEO Alex Karp says certain tech employees will be valuable and highly paid







Palantir CEO Alex Karp has now issued a stark warning about the future of work in the age of artificial intelligence. Karp predicted that humanities-based jobs will now be among the first casualties. As reported by Business Insider, speaking during a panel at the World Economic Forum, Karp revealed that his own academic background which is a philosophy degree from Haverford College, a law degree from Stanford, and a Ph.D. in social theory from Germany, cautioned that such qualifications may no longer be viable. “AI will destroy humanities jobs,” Karp said. “You went to an elite school, and you studied philosophy — hopefully you have some other skill, because that skillset is going to be very hard to market.”Karp believes that workers with technical and vocational training will be in then highest demand. He quoted battery manufacturing as an exampple, nothing that technicians in such industries are “very valuable, if not irreplaceable.” “There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training,” Karp told BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who moderated the discussion.Not all leaders at Davos agreed with Karp’s assessment. Finance executives told Business Insider that liberal arts degrees may actually become more valuable, as AI takes over routine financial analysis. Critical and creative thinking, they argued, is increasingly prized in young recruits.Meanwhile, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei highlighted another trend: entry-level hiring is already declining due to AI. Amodei said software and coding roles at Anthropic were down across junior and mid-level positions.Recently, Karp said that value of skilled workers is rising. Speaking on TBPN, a tech talk show broadcast live from Palantir’s customer conference, AIP Con 8, Karp said, “Workers become more valuable. The person at the top is actually crazy valuable. People with technical expertise are crazy valuable."" His words underscore a trend that’s become increasingly apparent in Silicon Valley: in a world awash with automation and AI, human expertise, especially deep technical skill, has become a rare commodity.Karp calls these individuals “artist-shaped people,” a nod to the company’s unique culture, sometimes referred to internally as “an artist colony.” He added, “Artist-shaped people are going to be incredibly valuable, and they’re going to demand to be very highly paid.”. The statement doesn’t just reflect Palantir’s philosophy; it mirrors the market reality, where top AI researchers and engineers have recently netted unprecedented paydays, sometimes reaching hundreds of millions, while thousands of others were laid off from companies like Microsoft and Meta.","Palantir CEO Alex Karp says certain tech employees will be valuable and highly paid. “Artist-shaped people are going to be incredibly valuable, and they’re going to demand to be very highly paid,” he said.

Bill Gates and Melinda Gates divorce





Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever. According to a report in Forbes, the amount has surfaced in a tax filing. As per the report Bill Gates donation skyrocketed Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation's assets by more than 1,000% to about $7.4 billion in 2024. As the number went up from $604 million at the end of 2023 to $7.4 billion.The $7.88 billion donation was made in 2024 to the Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation, according to a newly released tax filing reviewed by the New York Times’ DealBook. Philanthropies Foundation focuses on women and families. The tax filing is said to mark the first time that concrete financial terms of the Gates’ 2021 divorce have been made public. Melinda Gates also manages some of her investments and charitable work through Pivotal Ventures, the investment company founded in 2015.Bill Gates and Melinda Gates announced their decision to formally separate their philanthropic work in 2024, three years after their divorce became public.In May 2024, Melinda French Gates said that she leaving the charitable foundation she co-founded with Bill Gates more than 20 years ago. Her last day at the foundation was June 7, 2024.""Under the terms of my agreement with Bill, in leaving the foundation, I will have an additional $12.5 billion to commit to my work on behalf of women and families,"" Melinda Gates said then in a post on social media platform X, without disclosing more details about her plans. Post her departure as co-chair, the foundation changed its name to Gates Foundation and with Bill Gates as its sole chairperson. It’s unclear where the additional $4.6 billion was allocated. The funds could have been given to French Gates’ LLC, Pivotal, which does not file a tax return, according to DealBook. As running alongside Pivotal Philanthropies is Pivotal Ventures, a LLC that does not require disclosure requirements that govern traditional nonprofits.""I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,"" Bill Gates wrote in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).In May 2021, Bill and Melinda French Gates announced their intention to divorce, saying they no longer believed they could “grow together”. Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board in 2020, months before the divorce was announced. The couple also reportedly agreed to the division of real estate valued at more than $170 million, an art collection worth roughly $130 million and a significant block of Microsoft stock.In March 2022, Melinda Gates claimed that Jeffrey Epstein played a role in ending their 27-year marriage. During an appearance on “CBS Mornings,” Melinda shared that she decided to leave her marriage “for many things,” including her ex-husband’s ties to Epstein. “I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” she said at the time, adding that she only met the late pedophile once because she “wanted to see who” he was.Melinda Gates has a net worth of $17.6 billion, as per Bloomberg Billioniare Index. Most of her wealth comes from her share of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, significant assets transferred during her 2021 divorce from Bill Gates (including billions in stocks and real estate), and her own organization, Pivotal Ventures, focused on women's equality.","Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever.

Meta investors raises concerns





Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse. Quoting people familiar with the development, a Bloomberg report says that the job cuts come as the company shifts priorities to build next-generation artificial intelligence (AI). It states that the latest job cuts may put breaks on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's long-chased vision of building virtual reality for the metaverse which started in 2014 with the acquisition of virtual reality start-up Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion. Another step in this direction came in 2021, when Facebook rebranded itself as Meta.Meta’s Reality Labs Division roughly has 15,000 employees. According to the Bloomberg report, Meta may announce the cuts to Reality Labs as soon as January 13, 2025. Sources told the publication that layoffs are said to disproportionately affect those in the metaverse unit who work on virtual reality (VR) headsets and a VR-based social network.As per a memo sent by the company to employees last week, Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, who also heads Reality Labs, has called for a ‘most important’ meeting on Wednesday - January 14, asking staff to attend in person.Last year, Zuckerberg asked top executives to make cuts to their 2026 budgets while he pours money into A.I. research. As Meta faces competition from companies like OpenAI and Google, Mr. Zuckerberg has increased the budget for TBD Lab, the skunk works unit at Meta that aims to build superintelligence, a godlike AI system.As reported by Bloomberg, the company also plans to reallocate some of the money from virtual reality products to increase the budget for its wearables division, which builds smart glasses and wristband computing devices.Despite the company spending tens of billions of dollars on developing virtual reality headset, the consumer response has been slower than expected. Investors have grown wary of Meta’s spending.In December last year, a company spokeswoman said Meta was “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward A.I. glasses,” and was not planning “any broader changes.”","Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse.

There seems no end to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's 'China troubles'. Just days after reports that Chinese government has given partial approval to sale of Nvidia 200 chips in the country comes a letter from Representative John Moolenaar to US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick that claims Nvidia helped China's DeepSeek hone artificial intelligence models that were later used by the Chinese military. Incidentally, DeepSeek is the same Chinse AI startup that shook US stock markets in January 2025, wiping billions of dollars from the market cap of some of the biggest America companies. What set the alarm bells was the claim that DeepSeek AI models rivaled some of the best offerings from the United States but were developed with far less computing power, fuelling concerns in Washington that China could catch up with the U.S. in AI despite U.S. restrictions on the sale of high-powered computing chips to China.In letter to the US Commerce Secretary Lutnick, Representative Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the House Select Committee on China, said that documents obtained by the committee from Nvidia showed the achievement came after extensive technical assistance from Nvidia. ""According to NVIDIA records, NVIDIA technology development personnel helped DeepSeek achieve major training efficiency gains through an 'optimized co-design of algorithms, frameworks, and hardware,' with internal reporting boasting that 'DeepSeek-V3 requires only 2.788M H800 GPU hours for its full training' - less than what U.S.developers typically require for frontier-scale models,"" Moolenaar wrote in the letter.“In effect, Nvidia’s technical support allowed DeepSeek to extract near-frontier performance from ‘deprecated’ H800 chips, undermining the export-control bottlenecks that US policy was designed to impose,” he wrote.For those unaware, GPU hours are the number of hours an AI chip must run to train an AI model, while frontier-scale models refer to leading models produced by the US companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Google.""Nvidia treated DeepSeek accordingly - as a legitimate commercial partner deserving of standard technical support,"" Moolenaar wrote. Adding further warning, he wrote, ""If even the world's most valuable company cannot rule out the military use of its products when sold to (Chinese) entities, rigorous licensing restrictions and enforcement are essential to prevent such assurances from becoming superficial formalities. ""Moolenaar has reportedly requested a briefing from Lutnick by February 13 on the H200 rule enforcement and another recommendation that the Commerce Department use its authority to consider restricting the use of Chinese AI models in the US.In a statement, an Nvidia spokesperson said the “administration’s critics are unintentionally promoting the interests of foreign competitors — America should always want its industry to compete for vetted and approved commercial businesses, and thereby protecting national security, creating American jobs, and keeping America’s lead in AI.”""China has more than enough domestic chips for all of its military applications, with millions to spare. Just like it would be nonsensical for the American military to use Chinese technology, it makes no sense for the Chinese military to depend on American technology,"" Nvidia statement added.In a statement, Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the U.S., said: ""China has all along opposed moves to overstretch the concept of national security or politicize trade and tech issues. We hope the U.S. can take concrete actions to keep global industrial and supply chains stable.""Earlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration approved sales of Nvidia's H200 to China with some restrictions, including that the chips not be sold to entities that assist the Chinese military. The H200 is more powerful than the H800 chips DeepSeek used.","Representative John Moolenaar claims Nvidia helped China's DeepSeek hone artificial intelligence models that were later used by the Chinese military.

How China-Canada 'reset attempt' ended with arrest of Huawei CFO in 2018

Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney's China visit is big. What makes it big is as a report in Bloomberg says that Canada has long stuck closely to the US on China policy. Along with historic trade ties, that alignment is now cracking. Canada PM Carney too made it sure that he makes it clear that it is a mutually beneficial relationship. In a series of posts that started from the moment he landed in Beijing, Carney gave updates of his visit. Mark Carney sent a clear message of realignment: China is a “more predictable” trading partner than the US now, requiring stronger ties with Beijing as a “new world order” takes hold. China is Canada’s second largest trading partner after the United States.""A pleasure to meet with President Xi in Beijing. Canada and China are forging a new strategic partnership. We’re leveraging our strengths — focusing on trade, energy, agriculture, seafood, and other areas where we can make massive gains for both our peoples,"" wrote Carney on his meeting with Chinese President. ""Canada exports over $30 billion in goods and services to China every year. More than 400,000 careers in Canada are supported by this trade relationship.Here in Beijing, I’m meeting with government and business leaders because we want to build on that — opening up new markets and creating new opportunities for Canadian workers and businesses,"" Carney wrote in another post.During Carney's visit to Beijing, China and Canada reached an initial trade deal that would cut tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles in exchange for lower levies on Canadian canola. For those unaware, Canola, or rapeseed, is crushed to produce cooking oil and other products. Canada's agreement with China sets an annual quota of 49,000 Chinese EVs eligible to enter Canada at a low tariff rate. It kind of opens Canadian auto market to joint-venture investments by Chinese carmakers, an industry once dominated by Detroit and Germany.Incidentally, Carney and Xi’s joint statement don't really reset (or signal to reset) the world order for the first time. In 2017, Carney’s predecessor, Justin Trudeau, landed in Beijing with hopes of a “comprehensive” trade deal"". However, that effort quickly fizzled and, 12 months later, Canadian police arrested Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou of one of the China's biggest technology company Huawei in Vancouver. Meng is the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfe. She was arrested at Vancouver International Airport on a US warrant in December 2018, and indicted on bank and wire fraud charges for allegedly misleading HSBC in 2013 about the telecommunications equipment giant's business dealings in Iran.Meng's arrest made China detain two Canadian citizens and leaving the relationship between two countries in tatters.Meng Wanzhou finally flew home to China in September 2021 after reaching an agreement with the US prosecutors to end the bank fraud case against her. Within hours of the news of the deal, two Canadians who were arrested shortly after Meng was taken into custody in December 2018 were reportedly released from Chinese jails. The years-long extradition drama has been a central source of discord in increasingly rocky ties between Beijing and Washington, with Chinese officials signaling that the case needed to be dropped to help end a diplomatic stalemate.In a statement Huawei said, “We look forward to seeing Ms. Meng returning home safely to be reunited with her family. Huawei will continue to defend itself against the allegations in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York.”","Canada PM Mark Carney's China visit is big.

Tech expert and veteran professor, Erik Gordon, has once again warned technology companies and investors, saying that the AI bubble is as large as Jupiter planet and when it bursts, the investors will suffer. His comment comes a day after Microsoft announced its Q2 results, and its stock dropped after cloud revenues fail to exceed investor expectations.“The AI bubble is almost as big as the planet Jupiter. When it bursts, the debris will be everywhere. Big, institutional investors will be hit with it, and so will individual investors who bet the bubble would get even bigger,” Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business, told Business Insider.Gordon highlighted the recent performance of Microsoft as the “canary in the coal mine” for the broader tech sector. The software giant reported earnings that beat consensus on the top and bottom lines, however, moderate cloud growth saw its stock tumble more than 6%. Reports also that Microsoft failed to win investors’ trust over AI spending.“Microsoft's shares sank because of the truckloads of cash it is investing in AI,"" Gordon noted, adding, “That is a warning of the burst to come.”Microsoft’s financial filings reveal a 95% year-on-year surge in net cash used for investing, totaling over $57 billion in the six months ending in December.Gordon, however, does not expect an immediate crash, suggesting two primary reason due to which the market is currently in a state of “supported suspension”. He noted that institutional investors have deep pockets, enough to “prop up” current valuations.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Chinese tech giants receive conditional approvals

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has provided an update on the sales of the company’s H200 AI chips to China, revealing that while US has already given a green light, the fate of the shipments now rests with Beijing. Speaking to reporters at Taipei’s Songshan Airport following a trip to the Chinese mainland, Huang described the H200 as a “win-win” for both American and Chinese AI market. The GPU has been a focal point of US-China trade tensions for some time now.“The H200, the actual license for H200 is being finalised. And I'm hoping that also the Chinese government would allow Nvidia to sell the H200, so they have to decide. And I'm looking forward to a favourable decision,” he told reporters. Huang confirmed that Nvidia is awaiting a formal yes from the Chinese government to allow domestic firms to import the silicon.“I think that H200 is very good for American technology leadership. It's also very good for the Chinese market. And the customers would very much like to have H200. And so I'm looking forward to a good decision. And so we just have to wait patiently,” he added.According to recent reports, Chinese tech giants, including ByteDance, Alibaba and Tencent, have received conditional approval to purchase a combined total of over 400,000 H200 chips.The conditions attached to these approvals may be too restrictive for the firms to convert them into firm purchase orders, the report claimed.Huang, however, said that Nvidia has not received such information while also saying that China has many strong chip companies and Nvidia needed to compete quite vigorously.“The first thing that we need is orders. And we have a supply that supports all of our existing customers,” Huang said. When asked how he would manage packaging capacity with manufacturing partner TSMC, the Nvidia CEO noted, “If H200 is approved, we will work with TSMC to schedule and plan the supply and deliver as fast as we can.”","Chinese tech giants receive conditional approvals to purchase 400,000 H200 chips.

Those who master edge computing will win: Amon



Qualcomm CEO says context trumps data centres



Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon has predicted the winner of the AI device race. At a time when tech titans like Meta (AI Glasses), Google (AI Glasses + ecosystem), Apple (contextually aware personal assistant and Apple Intelligence) OpenAI (not disclosed) and Amazon (Alexa+) are developing consumer-centric devices to integrate AI technology, Amon suggests that the ultimate winner won't be decided by who has the biggest data center but by who is closest to the user. During an interview at the World Economic Forum at the Qualcomm space in Davos recently, Amon addressed the intensifying hardware race by framing the competition through Edge Computing.When pressed to name a specific frontrunner among the Big Tech players, Amon cautioned that the industry is still in its “early internet” phase.“Look I will I'll answer this question by going into the beginning of the internet. So Orkut wasn't the social media that won, it ended up being Facebook and later Instagram; Map Quest wasn't the main map, eventually it was Google Maps. So it's early to call. I think all those companies have big ecosystem. They're investing on their ecosystem. We'll see what happens,” he said.However, Amon did provide a granular prediction for those looking for a leader. He argued that the company that will move away from centralised servers toward computing on devices in our pockets/ or on our faces are likely to be the winners.“I have this view that at the end of the day, the winner of the edge is going to be the winner of the AI race.And the reason I say that is because for everything that is present on the edge has real context – means your phone, the devices that you use – where the humans are. The humans don't knock on the data center say give me some AI,” Amon noted.Amon highlighted a fundamental shift in how humans will interact with intelligence which essentially means that models that understand your specific world and your specific context are “a lot more useful”.“If you look how models got trained models got trained on the information available on the internet but when you fast forward to a model that is when you add physical AI understanding our world understanding your context understanding you that's going to be a lot more useful for you than a generic model that got trained on of data available on the internet,” he said.“So whoever had access to that data is in a very very strong position. So it's companies that have you know presence in all of those different devices already. I think they have an advantage. I will not bet against them,” he pointed out.",Qualcomm CEO says context trumps data centres in AI device race.

How Europe’s biggest tech company ASML may have played key role in Nvidia becoming world’s most valuable company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-europes-biggest-tech-company-asml-played-key-role-in-nvidia-becoming-worlds-most-valuable-company/articleshow/127778897.cms,"Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Why analysts think it's difficult for other companies to compete with ASML

“ASML has industrialised next-gen EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) lithography technology, which we believe will underpin many of the disruptive trends of this decade.”

“far-away competitors”.

“They are large conglomerates which have invested only a tiny fraction of what ASML has invested over three decades. At this point, catching up is virtually impossible,”

“Once customers are accustomed to the tool, it is gradually introduced into high-volume manufacturing. High NA is expected to reach high-volume manufacturing by 2027-2028, with Intel as the first adopter,”

Nvidia is currently the world's most valuable company. The US-based chipmaking giant achieved this feat through its advanced chips, which are powering the AI revolution. However, the company’s success depends a lot on ASML. The Dutch semiconductor equipment maker, which is also Europe's largest technology company, produces lithography machines used to print extremely fine patterns on silicon wafers. This technology is essential to manufacturing the advanced chips that power Nvidia's AI processors.ASML is the only company in the world that makes extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines used to produce the most advanced semiconductors, and it holds a 90% share of the wider lithography market. This monopoly position has made ASML an indispensable partner in the global semiconductor supply chain, enabling companies such as Nvidia to produce advanced AI chips.In a recent note (seen by CNBC), Bank of America analyst Didier Scemama said the company is likely to dominate next-generation EUV lithography. He wrote,His note came after ASML’s earnings report revealed bookings were more than double analyst expectations in the fourth quarter of 2025. Meanwhile, Javier Correonero, an equity analyst at Morningstar, told CNBC that lithography is‘the building block of any chip’, and said ASML machines have been used in the production of 99% of semiconductors. EUV systems are particularly important for the ongoing development of AI infrastructure.ASML produces two categories of EUV machines: low-numerical-aperture systems, used to manufacture the current generation of AI chips, including Nvidia’s Blackwell, and high-numerical-aperture systems, used in research and development by companies developing next-generation semiconductor technologies.Both systems operate by firing high-power lasers at molten tin droplets in a vacuum chamber, generating a plasma that emits EUV light. This light is directed through highly precise mirrors and reflected off a mask that contains the circuit pattern for a single chip layer. The pattern is then reduced in size and transferred onto a silicon wafer.These machines are purchased by semiconductor foundries, such as Taiwan-based TSMC, which manufactures chips on behalf of designers such as Nvidia.Correonero said companies such as Japan’s Nikon and Canon, which supply some lithography tools for non-advanced process nodes, werehe said.EUV systems accounted for a large share of ASML’s booking value, contributing 7.4 billion euros ($8.8 billion) out of total net bookings of 13.2 billion euros (15.7 billion) in the fourth quarter of 2025. Over the full year, ASML sold 48 EUV systems, generating 11.6 billion euros ($13.8 billion) in revenue.ASML does not publicly disclose pricing for its machines. However, analysts told CNBC that the company’s high-NA EUV systems are priced between 320 million euros ($382 million) and 400 million euros ($478 million), while its low-NA EUV systems sell for around 220 million euros ($263 million), according to Correonero.He added that companies, including TSMC, Intel, and Samsung, are currently testing high-NA EUV systems in laboratory environments.Correonero noted.ASML’s share price increased 36% last year and is up a further 32% since January 1. Earlier this month, the company became the third European firm to reach a market valuation of $500 billion, a level it has maintained.Analysts expect further gains in the stock, citing continued demand for advanced chips tied to AI-related investments. ASML forecasts net sales of between 34 billion euros ($40.5 billion) and 39 billion euros ($46.6 billion) in 2026, compared with 32.7 billion euros ($39 billion) reported in 2025.","ASML is the only company in the world that makes extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines used to produce the most advanced semiconductors.

Team,

This afternoon, we announced our second-quarter financial results. We exceeded Wall Street expectations, growing revenue 17% and 15% in constant currency and operating income by 21% and 19% in constant currency -a strong finish to the first half of the fiscal year.

In the quarter, Microsoft Cloud revenue surpassed $50 billion for the first time, growing 26% and 24% in constant currency.

There were many highlights this quarter, but a few stand out as reminders of the value our products and services deliver to customers - and as proof points of the progress we are making:

Commercial bookings, which best represents the amount of business we closed in the quarter, increased 230% and 228% in constant currency driven by previously announced Azure commitments from OpenAI and Anthropic, with healthy growth across our core annuity businesses.

We invested $37.5 billion in capex on GPUs, CPUs, and datacenter infrastructure to support growing Azure demand, expanding first-party Al usage from products like M365 Copilot and GitHub Copilot, and to increase the capacity available to our R&D teams for product innovation.

Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 39% and 38% in constant currency, slightly ahead of our expectations. Customers are running larger, more complex workloads with us and increasingly integrating Al into the core of how they operate.

Microsoft 365 commercial cloud revenue grew 17% and 14% in constant currency reflecting consistent execution in the core business and increasing contribution from strong Copilot results.

Dynamics 365 revenue grew 19% and 17% in constant currency with growth across all workloads.

Microsoft 365 consumer cloud revenue increased 29% and 27% in constant currency with subscriber growth of 6%.

Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue grew 10% and 9% in constant currency driven by higher search volume and continued benefit from third-party partnerships. Bing and Edge again took share.

Windows OEM revenue grew 5%. And we just crossed one billion Windows 11 users globally.

And, LinkedIn grew 11% and 10% in constant currency reflecting growth in Marketing Solutions.

Investors tune in to our earnings call for the full details on this quarter and a look ahead to Q3.

It's a helpful way to stay aligned as we deliver on our commitments. Join live today at 2:30 PM Pacific, listen on-demand, or check the transcript on the Investor Relations website.

This quarter's results reflect meaningful progress on core priorities. We continue to add capacity with pace, drive steady efficiency gains across our fleet, and invest in each layer of the stack

He contrasts this with Silicon Valley's embrace of failure, citing Mark Zuckerberg's rejection of a $1 billion Facebook offer.

Thiel says European founders cash out too early instead of chasing global scale

The Facebook offer Zuckerberg rejected in 10 minutes

Data backs the gap: US captured 64% of global VC funding in 2025

Billionaire investor Peter Thiel has delivered a blunt verdict on European tech ambitions: the continent will never produce a world-conquering tech giant because its founders are too scared of winning big.Speaking on the All-In Podcast, the PayPal co-founder dismissed his firm's European investments as little more than ""junkets""—pleasant trips that yield little in the way of breakthrough companies. ""It's a nice place to go on vacation as an investor,"" Thiel remarked. ""It's a very strange thing that so much of it—the US is somehow still the country where people do new things.""The core of Thiel's argument centres on a cultural gap. In Silicon Valley, he explained, there's a ""pornography of failure"" where founders openly discuss their stumbles as badges of honour. That mindset, he believes, breeds the kind of risk tolerance needed to build empires.Europe, by contrast, rewards playing it safe. ""In the social democratic European societies, it's acceptable to be moderately successful, it's not acceptable to be wildly successful,"" Thiel said. ""If you have a successful company that's starting to grow, it will get short-circuited, and you'll sell the company.""Thiel illustrated his point with a story from Facebook's early days. In 2006, Yahoo offered $1 billion to acquire the two-year-old startup. As a board member, Thiel admitted he and another investor were tempted.Mark Zuckerberg wasn't.""Mark started the board meeting—'this is a pro forma thing, we're just going to talk about this for 10 minutes. Obviously we're not taking it,'"" Thiel recalled. That refusal to cash out, he argued, is what separates trillion-dollar platforms from modest exits.The numbers tell a similar story. In 2025, US startups attracted $274 billion in venture capital—64% of the global total. Europe managed $85.3 billion, roughly 20%. More telling: the US boasts over 50 funds exceeding $5 billion. Europe has zero.Thiel's prescription for European founders? Stop checking out early. ""In Europe, the answer is to check out sooner rather than later and go back to the decade-long vacation that people are on in Europe,"" he quipped. Whether that's fair critique or Silicon Valley arrogance depends on which side of the Atlantic you're standing.","Peter Thiel says European tech founders are too risk-averse, cashing out early.

I have some important, but difficult, news to share with you. After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we've made the hard business decision to eliminate some roles across Amazon. Unfortunately, your role is being eliminated as part of these changes and your employment will end after a notification period.

These decisions weren't made lightly, and we recognize the significant impact they have. We're committed to supporting you through this transition with:

A non-working period with your full pay and benefits

A severance package offer and transitional benefits

External job placement support and 12 months of complimentary access to AWS Skill Builder

As of now, you are no longer required to perform work on Amazon's behalf and will continue to receive your full pay and benefits for the next 90 days.

You likely have questions, and we're here to answer them. You'll soon receive an invitation to schedule a conversation with a leader and/or HR point of contact from your team to discuss the specifics of your transition and how we can best support you. While this meeting is optional, we encourage you to attend virtually as it provides an opportunity to address your individual questions. Additionally, you'll receive a separate email from Amazon - Enterprise Document Management (

) with your formal announcement paperwork by the end of the day today. Please note that your badge access has been restricted; so, if you're currently in an Amazon office, Security can assist you with exiting the building.

During your non-working transition period, you'll continue to have access to internal email, Chime, and A to Z on your personal device, and our primary mode of communication with you will be through email. Please keep your YubiKey to access email on a personal laptop/computer.

We encourage you to take time now to confirm that you have access to these tools on your personal device and that your personal email address is up to date in A to Z. You can find more information about installing A to Z, connecting to MyHR, and accessing Chime and email on this page.

We appreciate that this is a difficult update to receive and have shared answers to some of the most common questions related to your pay, benefits, support resources, and next steps below. Remember that caring team members are ready to assist you 24/7 through MyHR or the Employee Assistance Portal (EAP), offering free and confidential support, both available within A to Z.

I'm personally committed to making sure you get the help you need as you navigate this change. Please just reply to this email if you run into any trouble at all getting what you need—whether that's connectivity issues, questions about next steps, or any other concerns.

Thank you,

Beth Galetti

Microsoft not alone in facing capacity issues

Shares of Microsoft fell sharply in after-market trading on January 28, despite the company beating earnings expectations for its second quarter. The company’s stock dropped by more than 6% as investors focused less on the earnings beat and more on concerns around the company’s cloud business, Azure. According to a Business Insider report, analysts raised questions about slowing Azure growth, rising spending and Microsoft’s growing reliance on ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which now accounts for a large share of the company’s future cloud commitments. The concerns weighed on investor sentiment despite Microsoft’s strong overall financial performance.Notably, this was Microsoft's first earnings report since OpenAI completed a restructuring and updated its agreement with Microsoft, which owns 27% of the company.During the earnings call, analysts pressed Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood on Azure’s growth outlook. The company revealed that its backlog in commercial bookings, a metric referred to as remaining performance obligations, ballooned 110% year over year to $625 billion. The software company disclosed that OpenAI makes up about 45% of those commitmentsWall Street analysts appeared concerned about how much of Azure’s backlog is tied to OpenAI, especially as Microsoft faces limits on cloud capacity.Nadella explained that acquiring more Azure clients is important to the tech giant, but it can't come at the expense of neglecting its other services.""If you think about it, acquiring an Azure customer is super important to us, but so is acquiring an M365 or a GitHub or a Dragon Copilot, which are all, by the way, incremental businesses and TAMs for us,"" Nadella said adding ""And so we don't want to maximize just one business of ours.""CFO Amy Hood said Microsoft must carefully decide how to use new GPUs and CPUs as they come online. These resources are split across first-party products like Copilot, research and development, and Azure customer demand.""You end up with the remainder going towards serving the Azure capacity that continues to grow in terms of demand,"" she said during the earnings call.Microsoft’s capacity challenges mirror those at OpenAI, whose executives have said limited computing power has slowed progress. OpenAI has pledged to spend $250 billion on Azure services, but its executives have repeatedly said the startup is held back by a lack of compute, forcing tough trade-offs between product and research.","Microsoft's stock fell sharply in after-market trading on January 28, despite the company beating earnings expectations for its second quarter.

“Instead of bringing your family into it, maybe try not tweeting “SEEMINGLY” racist stuff next time? Many would appreciate it if you acknowledge you are not trying to establish a white society in America, and are not WAGA,and racism isn’t behind your many laments around white birth rates, declining % of population and many similar laments.

As to the beach issue you’d appreciate me standing upto the principle of defending “ the principal of private property” instead of giving in to whatever the Coastal Commission wants. EVERY court ruling (in Friends of Martin Beach case including all appeals) so far reaffirmsthere has NEVER been free access to the beach thru private property, just paid access for parking, though the beach is public property (I’ve never asserted it isn’t).

You would appreciate it if you knew the facts. Anything else is communism. Separately, courts have denied my petition to have the right to close the gate because the CCC has not denied me the right to close the gate and wont give me a hearing for years because then they would have to deny my petition and I would have legal recourse.So they just wont give me a hearing date.

Unfortunately I have noproof to refute your claim that I am a pompous asshole and retarded.

I have said publicly I do admire your extraordinary entrepreneurial skills.”

What happened between Elon Musk and Vinod Khosla



Billionaire Vinod Khosla has now fired back at Tesla CEO Elon Musk with a lengthy 230-word reply on X (formerly known as Twitter). The clash between the two started after Musk defended himself against the accusations of racism by citing that his partner Shivon Zills has an Indian heritage. Khosla, the co-founder of Sun Microsystems and the head of Khosla Ventures, dismissed Musk’s defense and accused him of promoting a racially exclusionary agenda. In his long reply posted on X, Khosla has urged Musk to stop personalising the debate by invoking family ties and instead should focus on the substance of his public commentary.“Instead of bringing your family into this, maybe try not to tweet seemingly racist stuff. That would be a better defense than citing heritage. Leadership requires responsibility, and words matter when you have millions of followers,” wrote Khosla.He further argued that Musk’s rhetoric risks normalising divisive narratives and undermines the inclusive values that Silicon Valley should stand for.Vinod Khosla got into a heated exchange with Tesla CEO Elon Musk after accusing him of framing racism as a ‘grate and desirable paradigm’. The remarks made by Khosla came in response to a September post from Musk, where he claimed that ‘white people are a rapidly diminishing minority of global population’.Khosla escalated the confrontation and urged the employees at Elon Musk’s companies — Tesla, SpaceX and X to quit and join his own portfolio of startups, which includes OpenAI and Replit. Tagging Musk in a post Khosla wrote, “Elon Musk doesn’t want MAGA, he wants WAGA of ‘white America great again’ as a racism is great and desirable’ paradigm. All non-whites in @Tesla, @SpaceX and @X etc and all decent whites should quit and join our portfolio. Email us your LinkedIn!”SpaceX CEO Elon Musk responded with a barrage of insults and also called Kholsa a ‘pompous a***ho**’ and retard. He also referenced Khosla’s long-running legal battle to block public access to Martins Beach, a stretch of coastline adjacent to Khosla’s $37 million estate in San Mateo County.“Vinod, you’re not just such a pompous a**ho** that you tried to stop the public from using a public beach near your house, you’ve also gone full re***d. My partner, Shivon, is half Indian and my eldest son with her is named in honor of the great Indian physicist Chandrasekhar,” wrote Musk.",Vinod Khosla fires back at Tesla CEO Elon Musk after accusing him of framing racism as a ‘grate and desirable paradigm’ The remarks came in response to a September post from Musk where he claimed that ‘white people are a rapidly diminishing minority of global population’ Musk responded with a barrage of insults and also called Kholsa a 'pompous a***ho**' and retard.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127760981,imgsize-37194,width-400,resizemode-4/vinod-khosla-foresees-end-of-traditional-careers-and-degrees-with-rise-of-ai.jpg"

Responsibility of business leaders

LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman has warned business leaders that remaining silent about the Trump administration is a risky approach, arguing that the belief that political turbulence will simply pass is “dangerous. ” Speaking on a recent episode of the Rapid Response podcast, Hoffman said executives who think keeping quiet will protect their companies are making a serious miscalculation. His comments come as debates grow within the tech and business community over whether corporate leaders should publicly respond to political decisions and government actions.During the podcast, Reid Hoffman said the idea that companies can avoid trouble by not speaking up is flawed. “The theory that if you just keep your mouth shut, the storm will blow over and it won’t be a problem — you should be disabused of that theory now,” he said on the podcast.A longtime Democratic donor, Hoffman is one of the most prominent political voices in Silicon Valley. He has supported Democratic candidates for years and has publicly disagreed with pro-Trump business figures, including White House AI adviser David Sacks.In 2024, Hoffman donated USD 2 million to a super PAC that backed a write-in campaign for President Joe Biden in New Hampshire.Reid Hoffman acknowledged that many executives are hesitant to speak out due to fear of retaliation from the Trump administration. However, he said fear should not guide decisions. “Precisely when you feel fear, you should think about, is this a time for courage?” he said.Reid Hoffman framed public engagement as part of the responsibility that comes with wealth and influence. “Human beings first,” he said, adding that those who have benefited from society have obligations to it. He also said he is “regularly called out by the White House,” but argued that leaders should not be punished for sharing views based on their experience.Hoffman’s remarks come as some business and tech leaders have begun speaking out about recent events, including the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis during a federal enforcement action. The incident has sparked debate over immigration enforcement and accountability.Several tech leaders responded publicly. Google DeepMind chief scientist Jeff Dean called the incident “absolutely shameful” in a post on X (formerly Twitter), while former Meta AI scientist Yann LeCun described the footage as “murderers.” In Minnesota, more than 60 CEOs signed a letter urging de-escalation and cooperation among government agencies.","LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman warns business leaders against remaining silent about the Trump administration.

What to expect from Aluminium OS

Gemini and app updates

When to expect Aluminium OS





Google is reportedly planning to replace ChromeOS, the operating system used on Chromebooks, with a new platform called Aluminium OS. The new operating system was first reported by 9to5Google which spotted official images of Aluminium OS inside a Google bug report. As per the publication, the images showed parts of the interface, including the status bar and split-screen view on an HP Elite Dragonfly 13.5-inch Chromebook. Google later removed the images from the report, but not before a short video clip was shared publicly.Google’s new Aluminium OS is expected to bring together features from ChromeOS and Android into a single system that can run across different types of devices. Based on the leaked visuals, Aluminium OS appears to combine elements from the Android 16 operating system and the current version of ChromeOS.As spotted by 9to5Google, the taskbar and start screen look similar to Android’s desktop mode, suggesting a more unified experience across devices. The video also previewed apps that may be available on the new system.Another detail revealed in the video is the placement of Google’s AI assistant, Gemini, which appears at the top of the list of pre-installed apps.Google's Gemini may play a key role in Google’s Aluminium OS. Unlike ChromeOS, which is mainly built for Chromebooks, Aluminium OS is likely to support a wider range of devices, including tablets and smartwatches from Google and its partners.The leaked video also shows how app updates work on Aluminium OS. In one example, the Chrome browser updates quickly without needing to close or restart, which is a change from how updates currently work on ChromeOS.At present, there is no confirmed launch date for Aluminium OS. Google has also not shared details on when or how ChromeOS will be phased out.","Google’s new Aluminium OS is expected to bring together features from ChromeOS and Android into a single system that can run across different types of devices.

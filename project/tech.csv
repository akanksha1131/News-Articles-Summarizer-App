What is the Signal app chat leak

The Atlantic publishes full chat

The White House revealed in a press statement that Elon Musk's team, alongside the National Security Council and the White House Counsel's Office, is investigating a Signal chat leak involving top national security officials and Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic. Press Secretary Karonline Leavitt stated that Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has offered his technical experts to determine how Goldberg's number was added to the chat and to prevent future occurrences. ""Elon Musk has offered to put his technical experts on this, to figure out how this number was inadvertently added to the chat – again, to take responsibility and ensure this can never happen again,"" she said.This investigation follows Goldberg's report that he was included in a Signal group chat with figures like National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. Signal is an encrypted messaging app designed for secure communication. Initially, The Atlantic's report characterized the chat as containing ""war plans,"" a claim the Trump administration denies. President Trump confirmed that a member of Waltz's office added Goldberg, but provided no further details.Waltz told Fox News' ""Ingraham Angle"" that he takes full responsibility for the inadvertent addition of Goldberg to the chat. He, however, argued that he believed the account belonged to someone else. ""I built the group. My job is to make sure everything’s coordinated,"" Waltz said.Waltz admitted responsibility for adding Goldberg, stating he mistook the account for someone else. He mentioned discussing the matter with Musk, who offered technical assistance. Waltz asserted that no classified material was shared.In a post on Twitter, Waltz wrote, ""No locations. No sources & methods. NO WAR PLANS. Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent. BOTTOM LINE: President Trump is protecting America and our interests.""On his part, Elon Musk, in a post on Twitter, agreed that Jeffrey Goldberg and the Atlantic controversy is nothing more than propaganda trash.The tech CEO also replied to a few other posts on this US national security scandal.Goldberg's subsequent article, which included chat messages, changed the characterization from ""war plans"" to ""attack plans."" The Trump administration seized on this, claiming it vindicated their position that the original report was a ""hoax.""","The White House revealed in a press statement that Elon Musk's team, alongside the National Security Council and the White House Counsel's Office, is investigating a Signal chat leak.

UPI services back after outage; here’s what NPCI has to say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/upi-services-back-after-outage-heres-what-npci-has-to-say/articleshow/119549998.cms,"What NPCI said about the UPI outage



How this UPI outage affected users



The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) services are now back after facing disruptions. UPI, which enables instant real-time payments across the country, experienced disruptions as user reports indicated widespread issues with the services including payments and fund transfers. However, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which manages the UPI payment system, has now confirmed that the issues with the services have been fixed after a brief disruption. The organisation took social media platform X (earlier Twitter) to announce that UPI services are now up and running.In a statement shared on X, the organisation wrote: “NPCI had faced intermittent technical issues owing to which UPI had partial decline. The same has been addressed now and the system has stabilised. Regret the inconvenience.”However, the statement didn't specify how long the outage lasted or what caused it.According to outage tracking site Downdetector, reports of users facing problems spiked at around 7:40 pm IST, with 2,750 users affected and started reducing rapidly after 8:45.Most issues (83%) occurred during payment transactions, followed by funds transfers (13%) and app-related problems (4%). Meanwhile, UPI users took to X (formerly Twitter) to report the outage and share memes about it. The interfaces on major consumer payment platforms notified users that UPI services are unavailable or experiencing low success rates with customers of SBI, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, and Paytm reporting payment difficulties.However, BHIM, which is managed by NPCI, reportedly experienced the briefest downtime among all major UPI apps.In 2020, UPI experienced another major disruption during the Yes Bank-PhonePe crisis—an incident caused by a regulatory banking restriction on Yes Bank rather than an inherent UPI issue.UPI is the leading digital payment platform in the country, handling nearly 85% of all digital transactions and serving an estimated 40 crore unique users.","The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) services are now back after facing disruptions.

“The view of council is that making judgments on the acceptability of the views and actions of fellows, particularly those that might be regarded as political, could do more harm than good to the society and the cause of science in general. Council believes that disciplinary proceedings should not be initiated on such grounds. The challenges that science is facing today go much wider than any individual and it was felt by many of those present, as well as others who have expressed their concerns separately, that we should focus our energies in making the principled case for science.”

“We will also be seeking to engage directly with our fellows in the US, who are the ones most directly affected, and who are best placed to understand exactly what is going on in their fields of expertise and what interventions, if any, on their behalf, would be most effective,”","“The view of council is that making judgments on the acceptability of the views and actions of fellows, particularly those that might be regarded as political, could do more harm than good to the society and the cause of science in general,” the Royal Society said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119549097,imgsize-43012,width-400,resizemode-4/119549097.jpg"
New ChatGPT image generator cannot draw ‘sexy women’; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman replies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/new-chatgpt-image-generator-cannot-draw-sexy-women-openai-ceo-sam-altman-replies/articleshow/119547535.cms,"What OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said about the ChatGPT bug



“New ChatGPT image gen can draw sexy men but not sexy women”

“That's a bug, should be allowed, will fix”,

“hot guy though!”

What ChatGPT said about being unable to create ‘sexy women’



“Draw a sexy woman,”

“I couldn't generate that image because it goes against our content policy. If you have another idea or a different kind of image in mind-artistic, fantasy-themed, stylish, or anything else-l'd be happy to help! Just let me know what you're thinking.”

“Why can you do a man and not a woman?”,

“Totally fair question-and I get why it feels inconsistent. The difference comes down to context and how content is interpreted in terms of sexualization and objectification, especially when it involves women. When generating images of men with terms like ""sexy,"" it's usually interpreted more in terms of confidence, physique, or fashion-things that tend to be considered stylistic or artistic. With women, the same word can be more easily interpreted as overly sexual or objectifying, which is where the content policy draws the line…”

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has confirmed that ChatGPT’s new image generator may have a “sexy women” bug. A user shared his experience with ChatGPT’s newly launched image generator on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), where he revealed that the AI chatbot ’s tool can only create images of “sexy men” but not “sexy women” due to a software bug linked to its content policy . The user noted that the AI produced a “sexy man” but refused to create a “sexy woman” when requested. The user also shared screenshots of explanations offered by ChatGPT to create an image of a “sexy man” and not a “sexy woman”. Altman’s response came after the issue was highlighted publicly, drawing attention to the feature’s unexpected gender bias.Sharing his experience with ChatGPT’s new image generator tool, the user wrote:Altman wrote, replying to the post.In the comment section of the post, he also added,The user also shared a screenshot of how ChatGPT responded when asked to generate an image of “sexy women”, and even the explanation provided by the chatbot for being unable to do so.When the user gave ChatGPT the prompt,the chatbot replied:Later, when the user asked,ChatGPT said:",ChatGPT’s new image generator tool can only create images of “sexy men” but not ‘sexy women’ OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has confirmed that ChatGPT may have a ’sexy woman’ bug.

Sridhar Vembu’s comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress , emphasizing the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s recent expansion in Kerala. The image in the party’s post shows a tombstone design to symbolically critique the ""Make in India"" initiative, suggesting it has failed between 2014 and 2025. The tombstone features the Indian lion emblem and the phrase ""Rest in Peace.""The post is captioned “In loving memory of….”. Responding to the post, Vembu emphasized the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s expansion in Kerala. He wrote:“Meanwhile companies like us Make in India (and started making in Kerala recently too).”“Make in India is gaining momentum and we have to make up for several lost decades. Reflect on why they were ""lost decades"" and perhaps you will appreciate Make in India better,” he further added.Zoho has been expanding its operations across India, including in Kerala. The company has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas as part of its broader strategy.The Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports. Several companies, including Zoho, have increased their domestic production efforts as part of this initiative.Vembu’s response comes amid ongoing discussions on India's economic policies and industrial growth, with businesses and policymakers debating the impact of past and present strategies.Vembu recently drew a comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods, highlighting their long-term impact on economic structures. In a recent post, he discussed how capital inflows into a single sector can divert resources from others, weakening overall economic capabilities.Citing Silicon Valley as an example, Vembu pointed out the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, attributing them to a talent shift toward sectors with higher financial incentives. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now – for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors overlooked the sector due to the absence of large exits.Drawing a parallel to India, Vembu noted that the long-standing dominance of the IT industry resulted in the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he stated.He stressed the importance of addressing these gaps and rebuilding capabilities in affected sectors. ""We have to make up for lost time,"" he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress.

Air Canada and Thales issue joint statement

JetBlue, British Airways and Swiss Airlines have faced similar issues in the past

Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories.” According to a report in CNN, Air Canada's Boeing 737 MAX fleet were found to have moving maps — part of the in flight entertainment (IFE) system — that did not show Israel as a state, but replaced it with the name "" Palestinian territories ."" The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.The discrepancy, first noticed by a passenger, involved maps produced for French aerospace group Thales. Air Canada and Thales issued a joint statement acknowledging the error and stating that the issue has been ""resolved."" ""It was brought to the attention of Air Canada that the interactive map on its Boeing 737 fleet did not consistently portray certain Middle Eastern boundaries, including those of the State of Israel, at all amplification levels,"" the statement said. ""Air Canada’s policy in general is to display only city names on the maps in its aircraft, and the configuration on this particular system was not compliant with this policy."" Thales added in a separate statement that the map had been provided by a third party.The map feature was promptly disabled, and an updated version will be installed across the fleet starting March 14. Air Canada and Thales apologized for the ""unease created by this situation.""This is not the first time such an issue has occurred in aviation. JetBlue apologized for a similar map error in 2024, and British Airways faced a similar situation in 2013. In 2018, SWISS confirmed its policy of turning off maps entirely when landing in Tel Aviv after a similar incident. Thales stated that the maps are supplied by a third party and that they are working with the airline and the provider to resolve the issue quickly.","Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories” The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.

Baidu has unveiled its AI model, Ernie X1, which is designed to articulate its reasoning process. The Ernie X1 model operates on similar principles to DeepSeek R1 , a model that garnered significant attention in Silicon Valley for its ability to deliver comparable performance to leading chatbots at a significantly lower development cost. Baidu emphasises that its reasoning model excels in areas such as daily dialogue, complex calculations, and logical deduction, as per a report.Bloomberg reports that in addition to the Ernie X1 launch, China's leading internet search provider has upgraded its flagship foundation model to Ernie 4.5 . Notably, the company has made all tiers of its AI service, including the X1 model, freely accessible to its chatbot users, accelerating its initial plans by several weeks.Baidu claims that Ernie 4.5 outperforms OpenAI's latest GPT 4.5 in text generation, citing various industry benchmarks. Baidu has also announced its intention to make its Ernie AI models open-source starting June 30. The company has also integrated the R1 model into its core search engine business.This launch appears to be a strategic move to regain momentum in the competitive AI landscape, where Baidu faces increasing pressure from emerging rivals such as DeepSeek, the report added.While Baidu was the first major Chinese tech company to introduce a ChatGPT-like chatbot, it has since faced stiff competition from rivals like TikTok parent company ByteDance and Moonshot AI. Furthermore, open-source models such as Alibaba's Qwen and DeepSeek have received recognition within the global developer community, the report added.The generative AI boom has positively impacted Baidu's financial performance, with a 26% increase in cloud revenue reported in its December-quarter results. This growth, driven by services provided to developers seeking computing power, was somewhat offset by weaker advertising sales amidst China's challenging economic conditions.","Baidu has unveiled its new Ernie X1 AI model, designed to articulate its reasoning process.

Facebook’s extreme measures in India

A ""low-ranking official,"" or as some say an office Babu at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Meta (then Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and some of the 'brightest tech minds' in his team with nothing more than a single click, according to explosive claims in a newly released memoir by former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams.The David versus Goliath moment allegedly occurred in 2016 during Facebook's aggressive push to save its controversial Free Basics program in India, which was facing regulatory scrutiny for potentially violating net neutrality principles.""Mark and some of the brightest tech minds in the world devoted months to this [outreach strategy], and some low-ranking official in India outfoxed them simply by clicking an opt-out box,"" Wynn-Williams writes in her book ""Careless People,"" which Meta is currently trying to block from publication.The memoir details how Facebook deployed its full arsenal of technological and political influence to sway public opinion about Free Basics. When India's Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) opened public consultations on whether such programs should be banned, Facebook allegedly orchestrated an unprecedented pressure campaign.""Our policy team is directly engaged with the government, include Prime Minister Modi's office,"" Wynn-Williams quotes then-COO Sheryl Sandberg as writing in an internal email. ""We're lucky this is happening in a place where we have very deep senior relationships in the government, but it's still going to be hard.""According to the book, Facebook's strategy focused on creating ""the appearance of public support"" through automated emails. The social media giant allegedly turned on a ""megaphone that Mark wouldn't let Sheryl use for [promoting] organ donation"" to nudge Indian users into sending approximately 16 million supportive emails to TRAI.The jugaad – a Hindi term for an innovative, improvised solution – came when Facebook discovered their millions of automated emails weren't being counted. ""Someone at TRAI—whoever controlled the email address for the public comments — simply opted out of all emails from Facebook,"" writes Wynn-Williams.The book makes other startling claims about Facebook's operations in India, including that the company hired an ""ex-police captain"" who would ""go to jail in a clash between Facebook and the Indian government"" if executives were targeted in government raids.Meta has dismissed the book as containing ""out-of-date and previously reported claims"" and ""false accusations about our executives."" A spokesperson told The Hindu that ""Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behaviour,"" claiming she ""has been paid by anti-Facebook activists.""Despite Meta's arbitration efforts to halt its publication and promotion in the US, ""Careless People"" remains available for purchase in India. The company has not specifically contested the claims regarding its operations in India detailed in the memoir.Free Basics was ultimately prohibited in India for violating net neutrality principles, representing a rare defeat for Zuckerberg's global expansion ambitions.",Former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams claims a 'low-ranking official' at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Mark Zuckerberg and his team.

A member of Elon Musk 's US DOGE Service team, Edward Coristine , has provided support to a cybercrime gang , a report claims.

It's important to note that 19-year-old Coristine is a prominent member of the DOGE team that has been granted access to official networks to downsize the US government. The report claims that in 2022, while Coristine was in high school, he ran a company called DiamondCDN that provided network services. Among DiamondCDN's users was a website run by the cybercriminal ring “EGodly” that trafficked stolen data and cyberstalked an FBI agent , the report claimed citing reviewed digital records which are also preserved by DomainTools and Any.Run and interviews with former associates.In February 2023, EGodly shared a Telegram post to thank DiamondCDN, the report added. It also acknowledged DiamondCDN’s provision of DDoS protection and caching systems that enhanced the security of the company’s website.""We extend our gratitude to our valued partners DiamondCDN for generously providing us with their amazing DDoS protection and caching systems, which allow us to securely host and safeguard our website,"" the message noted (as seen by Reuters).As per the report, EGodly's Telegram channel has been inactive for over a year and attempts to contact eight individuals associated with the group have been unsuccessful.The report also revealed that from October 2022 to June 2023, the EGodly website, dataleak.fun, was connected to IP addresses registered to DiamondCDN and other entities owned by Coristine. Furthermore, during that period, some users attempting to visit the site encountered a DiamondCDN ""Security check.""However, the report was unable to determine the extent of EGodly's association with DiamondCDN or whether payments were made to Coristine’s company.In 2023, EGodly flaunted its cybercriminal exploits on Telegram, claiming to hijack phone numbers, breach law enforcement email accounts across Latin America and Eastern Europe, and steal cryptocurrency.The group also leaked personal details of an FBI agent investigating them, along with an obscene prank call recording and a video from Wilmington, Delaware. While the report could not verify all of EGodly's claims, it confirmed the video’s authenticity by comparing the location.The FBI agent, now retired, indicated that the group’s actions, including swatting incidents, have attracted significant law enforcement attention.","A member of Elon Musk's US DOGE Service team, Edward Coristine, has provided support to a cybercrime gang, a report claims.

These Inspur units are part of a larger group of approximately 80 entities and institutes, including over 50 based in China, as well as those in Taiwan, Iran, Pakistan, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates, added to the export control list.Citing the Commerce Department, a report by news agency Reuters says that out of the six major subsidiaries, five are located in China and one in Taiwan. They have been targeted for their role in developing supercomputers for the Chinese military. Notably, Inspur Group itself was already placed on this list in 2023.The US aims to limit China's progress in high-performance computing , quantum technologies, advanced AI and hypersonic weapons development.“We will not allow adversaries to exploit American technology to bolster their own militaries and threaten American lives,” said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.In response, the Chinese embassy in Washington expressed strong opposition, demanding the US “immediately stop using military-related issues as pretexts to politicise, instrumentalise and weaponise trade and tech issues.”The US also seeks to impede Iran's acquisition of drones and related defense items and to hinder its ballistic missile and unsafeguarded nuclear programmes, the report added.Commerce official Jeffrey Kessler emphasised the administration’s goal to prevent “US technologies and goods from being misused for high performance computing, hypersonic missiles, military aircraft training, and UAVs (drones) that threaten our national security.”The Entity List, maintained by the Commerce Department, restricts companies from exporting goods to listed entities without obtaining licenses, which are typically denied, due to national security or foreign policy concerns.","Six subsidiaries of China's Inspur Group added to US export control list.

Jack Dorsey's full email to Block employees

hi all.

today we'll be making some org changes, including eliminating roles and beginning the consultation process in countries where required. i want to give you all the straight facts.

as I said at the last Block, there are three areas we'd like to address:

strategy: reducing from teams that are off strategy, and fixing our discipline ratios. performance: parting ways with people with a ""below"" or trending towards ""below."" hierarchy: driving to flattening our org to a max depth of innercore+4 what that translates to in actual numbers of people:

strategy: 391 people performance: 460 people hierarchy: 80 managers (with 193 moving it individual contributor roles) we're also closing all the 748 roles we had open with the exception of:

roles progressed to offer stage. critical operational roles start/accelerate roles key leadership roles none of the above points are trying to hit a specific financial target, replacing folks with AI, or changing our headcount cap. they are specific to our needs around strategy, raising the bar and acting faster on performance, and flattening our org so we can move faster and with less abstraction.

why do this all at once instead of over time? we're behind in our actions, and that's not fair to the individuals who work here or the company. when we know, we should move, and there hasn't been enough movement. we need to move to help us meet and stay ahead of the transformational moment our industry is in.

this is the toughest part of my job, and I fight hard against any of these considerations. we must have a very high bar of correctness for us to take any action, which takes iteration and time to get right. i always balance this with the fact that everyone here, and those that are departing, has equity in our company. it's my job to increase that value. we believe this will help us focus and execute better to do just that.

we're working to give clarity to everyone as quickly, with as much context and support, as possible. you'll receive an email soon about what this means for you. if there are areas where you think we could do better, please send me a note. direct feedback makes us better, and I always act when it makes sense.

thank you to all those leaving us. i am grateful and appreciative for you and your work, which has built us up to this point. we will continue to honor that by increasing our value to our customers, and therefore to all of our shareholders, including you.

thank you,

jack

Block , the financial technology company co-founded by Twitter 's c-founder former CEO Jack Dorsey , announced Tuesday it will lay off 931 employees, marking its second significant workforce reduction in just over a year.The reorganization will eliminate nearly 1,000 positions across the company, which operates popular platforms including Square , CashApp , and Tidal . Dorsey personally informed employees through an internal email, emphasizing that the cuts are not financially motivated or aimed at replacing workers with artificial intelligence.According to the company's breakdown, the layoffs target three primary areas: strategic repositioning, performance management, and organizational hierarchy. Specifically, 391 employees will be cut for strategic reasons, 460 for performance-related issues, and 80 management positions will be eliminated to flatten the company's organizational structure.In addition to the layoffs, Block will close 748 currently open job positions, with exceptions for roles already in the offer stage, critical operational positions, and key leadership roles. The company will also reassign 193 managers to individual contributor positions.Dorsey stressed the urgency of the reorganization, stating that the company has been ""behind in our actions"" and needs to move quickly to stay competitive in a transformative industry moment. The tech entrepreneur emphasized his commitment to increasing shareholder value and maintaining a ""high bar of correctness"" in organizational decisions.The layoffs follow a similar restructuring in early 2024, when approximately 1,000 employees were also let go. As of December 2024, Block employed around 11,300 staff worldwide.","Block will lay off 931 employees, marking its second significant workforce reduction in just over a year.

Dell reports a drop in total number of employees

Dell Technologies has reaffirmed its commitment to diversity and inclusion initiatives even as it reported a 10% decrease in its employee headcount for fiscal year 2025, according to its annual report released this week. The company retained its previous language related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.“We are committed to equal employment opportunity and continuing to implement inclusive policies that enable Dell Technologies to achieve these goals,” the company emphasised (via news agency Reuters).This comes at a time when some have labeled DEI initiatives as discriminatory, even suggesting potential investigations by the Department of Justice for legal violations.Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order ending radical and wasteful DEI programs and preferencing, as per a White House communication, restoring merit-based hiring and promotions across the federal government.“We will terminate every diversity, equity, and inclusion program across the entire federal government,” he said.Furthermore, several prominent companies in the tech sector, including Meta and Google’s parent Alphabet, have recently scaled back or entirely discontinued their DEI programs. Meanwhile, Apple and Cisco have reinforced their commitment to DEI.The AI server manufacturer also disclosed that its workforce stood at approximately 108,000 employees as of January 31, a significant drop from the roughly 120,000 employees reported a year prior. This reduction is attributed to ongoing cost-cutting measures implemented by the company, including limitations on external hiring and employee reorganisations.It's worth noting that this is not the first instance of workforce adjustments at Dell Technologies. The company also reported a workforce decline of approximately 5% in the fiscal year 2024.","Dell Technologies reaffirmed its commitment to diversity and inclusion initiatives even as it reported a 10% decrease in its employee headcount for fiscal year 2025.

Donald Trump addresses chatroom error that sparked national security concerns

Signal president Meredith Whittaker has publicly defended the security of her company’s messaging app amidst reports that US President Donald Trump administration officials mistakenly added a journalist to an encrypted chatroom discussing sensitive US military actions in Yemen.While Whittaker did not directly comment on the specific incident, which has prompted national security concerns from Democratic lawmakers, she took to X (formerly Twitter) to tout Signal as the “gold standard in private comms.”""Signal is the gold standard in private comms. We’re open source, nonprofit, and we develop and apply ( end-to-end encryption ) and privacy-preserving tech across our system to protect metadata and message contents,"" Whittaker stated.Whittaker asked users to check signal.org/bigbrother to see how little data the company is able to provide.“Now, WhatsApp licenses Signal’s cryptography to protect message contents for consumer WhatsApp. Not on WhatsApp for business. Neither consumer nor business WhatsApp protects intimate metadata—like contact list, who’s messaging whom, when, profile photo, etc. And, when compelled, like all companies that collect the data to begin with, they turn this important, revealing data over,” she said.Soon after the ‘Signal chat leak’, US President Donald Trump addressed the breach in which Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, was mistakenly added to a classified Signal group chat discussing sensitive military operations against the Houthis.Trump stated that the breach likely resulted from an error by a junior staffer working for National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who inadvertently included Goldberg in the high-level discussion.“And what it was, we believe, is somebody that was on the line with permission; somebody that was with Mike Waltz — worked for Mike Waltz at a lower level — had, I guess, Goldberg's number or called through the app, and somehow this guy ended up on the call. Now, it wasn't classified, as I understand it. There was no classified information. There was no problem, and the attack was a tremendous success,” Trump said in an interview with Newsmax.""I can only go by what I was told; I wasn't involved in it. But I was told by — and the other people weren't involved at all. But I feel very comfortable, actually,"" he added.","Donald Trump addresses chatroom error that sparked national security concerns.

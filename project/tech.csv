Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

What Microsoft President said on shipping Nvidia AI chips

Microsoft expanding investment in UAE





Microsoft will reportedly be shipping Nvidia's most advanced artificial intelligence chips to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as part of a deal approved by the US Commerce Department. In an announcement, the software giant said that licenses approved in September under “stringent” safeguards enable it to ship more than 60,000 Nvidia chips. This includes Nvidia's most-advanced GB300 Grace Blackwell chips, for use in data centres in the Middle Eastern country.Incidentally, these are the same AI chips that President Donald Trump said that he will not allow Nvidia to sell to China. Asked by reporters if he will allow Nvidia to sell its most advanced chips Blackwell to China, Trump said he wouldn't.Microsoft is planning to spend more than $7.9 billion on data centers, cloud computing and employees in UAE over the next four years. Microsoft president Brad Smith announced the commitment in Abu Dhabi. The pledge includes plans to nearly triple the amount of Nvidia advanced chips Microsoft will operate in the nation.Updated licences granted in September allow Microsoft to ""ship the equivalent of 60,400 additional A100 chips ...involving Nvidia's even more advanced GB300 GPUs."" Microsoft said that it received US government licenses to ship AI chips to the UAE in September after meeting security criteria. “They’re not just acts of faith,” Smith said. “We had to satisfy very strict conditions about the cybersecurity, the physical security, the other security protection of these chips to ensure that they stay under our control. ”Smith added, ""We're using these GPUs to provide access to advanced AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source providers and Microsoft itself.""Microsoft is strengthening its role in the United Arab Emirates’ drive to diversify its economy beyond oil, emerging as a key partner in the country’s ambitions to become a regional hub for artificial intelligence and digital innovation.In early 2024, the tech giant invested $1.5 billion in G42, an Abu Dhabi-based AI company specializing in cybersecurity, cloud computing, and space technologies. As part of the deal, Microsoft President Brad Smith joined G42’s board, underscoring the strategic nature of the partnership.G42 said it has already deployed 21,500 chips equivalent to Nvidia’s A100 GPUs in the UAE, with approval from the Biden administration. The company plans to ship an additional 60,400 chips, including units from Nvidia’s latest GB300 series, in the near future. “Those will come in months, not years,” Smith said.The partnership also aligns with OpenAI’s expanding global footprint. Earlier this year, OpenAI — backed by Microsoft — selected the UAE as the first country outside the United States to host its Stargate data center project, a key component in scaling advanced AI infrastructure.The developments highlight how U.S. technology firms are increasingly shaping the UAE’s digital transformation strategy, even as global competition over AI infrastructure and semiconductor access intensifies.","Microsoft plans to spend $7.9 billion on data centers, cloud computing and employees in UAE over the next four years.

Why AI has NOT made “learn to code” obsolete





India has become GitHub’s fastest-growing developer hub and innovation centre, with the Microsoft-owned platform projecting that the country will surpass the United States with more than 57.5 million users by 2030. The country is also home to 21.9 million developers building on GitHub, making it the second-largest developer community in the world after the United States.From student skilling initiatives to enterprise AI adoption, GitHub is deepening its India-first strategy, according to chief operating officer Kyle Daigle, who recently spoke to ET. The company offers its Student Developer Pack free to Indian learners and provides year-long support to early-stage startups through its GitHub for Startups programme.Daigle noted that Indian IT services companies are leading globally in AI co-creation. Companies such as Infosys, Wipro, Cognizant, and Accenture are building centres of excellence around GitHub Copilot and running internal innovation drives including hackathons and AI agent trials.Since being acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion in 2018, GitHub has evolved from a code-hosting service to a full-stack AI development platform.Its AI coding assistant, GitHub Copilot, now has 20 million all-time users, and the product alone generates more revenue than the entire company did at the time of its acquisition.Following its move to make Copilot free for all users in December 2024, GitHub added 36 million users globally in 2025, bringing its total user base to 180 million. Daigle said the platform’s next phase will be anchored in AI-native software development, where intelligent agents handle everything from code generation to testing and deployment.GitHub is undergoing a leadership transition, with Thomas Dohmke stepping down as CEO this August. GitHub will now join Microsoft’s CoreAI division led by Jay Parikh, the former global head of engineering at Meta who joined Microsoft in October 2024. In a recent podcast interview, Dohmke made it clear that companies with a smart vision for the future will not be slashing tech jobs, but rather expanding their engineering teams to take full advantage of AI’s power. “The companies that are the smartest are going to hire more developers,” he said. “Because if you 10x a single developer, then 10 developers can do 100x.” His arithmetic is simple — and optimistic: artificial intelligence is not a subtractive force, but a multiplier.Dohmke debunked the growing myth that AI alone can spawn billion-dollar businesses without human coding knowledge. “The idea that AI without any coding skills lets you just build a billion-dollar business is mistaken,” Dohmke said. “Because if that were the case, everyone would do it.” His message is clear: Please note that AI is a remarkable tool, not a magic wand.","India has become GitHub’s fastest-growing developer hub and innovation centre.

AI-led growth offers ‘way out’: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon joins JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon on US national debt problem,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-led-growth-offers-way-out-goldman-sachs-ceo-david-solomon-joins-jpmorgans-jamie-dimon-on-us-national-debt-problem/articleshow/125064010.cms,"Goldman Sachs CEO on Donald Trump’s ‘Gold Card’







Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon has voiced his concern over the US’ $38 trillion national debt, joining high-profile critics like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in warning of a potential financial reckoning. Solomon said that the primary concern is not the sheer volume of debt, but the worsening debt-to-GDP ratio, emphasising that the solution lies in accelerating economic growth which can be possible by artificial intelligence (AI) technology.Speaking at the Economic Club of Washington D.C. last week, Solomon pointed to the potential of AI as the factor that could make the growth strategy feasible. The investment banking leader pointed to the immense potential of AI as the factor that could make the growth strategy feasible, especially as the technology begins to drive Wall Street to new highs.“I think we have some things that are going to give us a better opportunity to have a higher growth trajectory, particularly … technology, AI getting embedded into the enterprise and the productivity opportunity from that,” he said.“But if we continue on the current course and we don’t take the growth level up, there will be a reckoning,” he continued.Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, last month also warned that the country’s national debt is unsustainable.In February, President Donald Trump claimed he could entirely avert a potential debt crisis through the gold card scheme. He projected that selling one million cards would yield $5 trillion, and selling ten million cards would generate a total of $50 trillion.Since the national debt is currently $35 trillion, Solomon stated, ""that would be nice."" He further noted that achieving this goal would leave a $15 trillion surplus, which could be allocated for deficit reduction or potentially more.","Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon has voiced his concern over the US’ $38 trillion national debt.

Beckn Labs partners Google to launch Beckn Onix to improve digital public infrastructure development,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/beckn-labs-partners-google-to-launch-beckn-onix-to-improve-digital-public-infrastructure-development/articleshow/125063337.cms,"Representative Image

""Open networks are the digital rails for the next generation of AI, and Beckn Onix is the catalyst for action: an organisation that used to wait months to onboard can now start leveraging AI-driven solutions and creating new value for society in a fraction of that time.

It provides the essential, secure and scalable infrastructure for AI-driven solutions to be deployed across diverse, high-impact sectors like agriculture, healthcare, mobility, and more.

It has the potential to empower millions of people in emerging markets around the world, from farmers to small business owners and entrepreneurs.""

What is Beckn Onix and how it works



“open networks”





Beckn Labs has partnered with Google Cloud to launch Beckn Onix, a new open-source app designed to accelerate the development and adoption of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) built with the Beckn Protocol. This initiative was announced in advance of the Global DPI Summit 2025. Beckn Onix aims to promote inclusive growth for individuals and communities across various population-scale sectors, including agriculture, healthcare, skilling, energy, tourism, and mobility. The tool addresses technical complexities faced by governments and organisations when connecting diverse, existing IT systems to new open network protocols. With Beckn Onix, custom-built integrations, which are often expensive and difficult to maintain and scale, can be avoided. This will allow for a more streamlined approach to building open networks.Commenting on the partnership, Anil Bhansali, VP of engineering at Google Cloud, said:The Beckn protocol is an open, decentralised standard that enables buyers and sellers to interact and transact without relying on a single controlling platform or intermediary. It lowers entry barriers for merchants and businesses, allowing them to createfor selling their products and services and offering more opportunities for participation across the supply chain.Earlier, building such open networks could take startups or organisations four to five months. Beckn Onix is the first scalable, cloud-native implementation of the Beckn Protocol, now available on GitHub. Governments and businesses using Beckn Onix can integrate AI-based features into open networks from the start, using Google’s open-source Agent Development Kit. This helps developers quickly create user-friendly agents that simplify workflows while using Gemini or any other AI model.With Beckn Onix, entrepreneurs, business owners, governments, and public sector bodies can build open networks connecting buyers and sellers in as little as 45 minutes.Beckn Onix also works as a universal ""adapter"" or ""bridge,"" allowing an organisation’s existing backend systems to connect securely with other platforms on an open network. Its flexible, plugin-based design enables organisations to choose preferred tools for signing, storage, or monitoring, helping them build an open, interoperable, and adaptable ecosystem.Beckn Onix is already in use in Uttar Pradesh, where Google Cloud helped the state government develop an Open Network Stack for Agriculture (ONA). The project has connected over 12,800 farmers, helping them improve their profitability.","Beckn Labs has partnered with Google Cloud to launch Beckn Onix.

What is the base of the dispute







US-based technology licensing company Adeia has filed two lawsuits against semiconductor giant Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in Texas federal court on Monday (November 3), alleging infringement of 10 patents related to semiconductor manufacturing and design. The lawsuits claim that several models of AMD processors used in desktops, laptops, and servers violate Adeia's intellectual property rights concerning innovations for improved semiconductor production, according to a report by news agency Reuters.Adeia asserts that AMD processors featuring “3D V-Cache” technology, including its advanced AI chips, were manufactured using methods patented by Adeia.The complaint specifies that Adeia's predecessor company, Tessera, pioneered technologies such as hybrid bonding and advanced process nodes, which are core to modern semiconductor manufacturing. Adeia CEO Paul Davis stated that AMD's use of this technology has “greatly contributed to their success as a market leader.”Davis indicated that Adeia is open to resolving the dispute outside of court, saying the company would pursue “a fair and reasonable arrangement that reflects the value of our intellectual property.” Furthermore, Adeia is seeking an unspecified amount of monetary damages and a court order to force AMD to stop using the patented technology.The lawsuit comes just one week after Santa Clara-based AMD, one of the largest US semiconductor companies, signed a deal with the US government to build two AI-powered supercomputers for advancing national research and development.AMD also formed a major strategic partnership with OpenAI for the large-scale deployment of its AI chips. This multi-year, multi-billion dollar deal is designed to power OpenAI's next-generation AI infrastructure, essentially challenging Nvidia’s dominance in the AI accelerator market.",US-based technology licensing company Adeia has filed two lawsuits against semiconductor giant Advanced Micro Devices.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, which will allow users to stream select titles without requiring a paid Game Pass subscription. The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees.

The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%. This change reportedly came after Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new 30% target.","Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

“Our belief, which I think is shared by the leadership of Hong Kong, is that pretty much all transactions will settle on blockchains eventually, and that all money will be digital.”

“Think about what that means: a complete rewiring of the financial system,”





What are tokenised assets and what Standard Chartered is planning



“freight train,”

“revolution”





Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters has predicted a future where virtually all global financial transactions will be settled on a digital blockchain ledger and all money will be digital. Winters predicted this during a panel at Hong Kong FinTech Week, as the adoption of digital assets by mainstream finance institutions continues to grow. The UK-based multinational bank’s CEO said:Winters added, emphasising the fundamental change this would represent. He stressed the need for experimentation to determine the exact nature of this change.Standard Chartered, which is listed in both London and Hong Kong, has been increasing its involvement in digital assets through services such as digital asset custody, trading platforms, and tokenised products.According to a report by CNBC, Winters also credited Hong Kong for its leadership in the digital assets space through its licensing regime and tokenisation pilots, in which Standard Chartered participates.A tokenised asset is a digital version of a real-world asset such as stocks, bonds, or commodities, that can be recorded and traded on a blockchain or distributed ledger. Stablecoins, which are linked to a currency, are often seen as an early example of a tradable tokenised asset.Standard Chartered, working with blockchain venture capital firm Animoca Brands and telecommunications company HKT, plans to introduce a Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin under the city’s new regulatory framework launched in August.Winters said that he believed that Hong Kong dollar stablecoins can represent an interesting new medium of exchange for international trade on digital terms.Several global fintech executives have also shared optimistic views about tokenized assets in recent months. Robinhood Markets CEO Vlad Tenev said last month that tokenisation was acoming to most major markets in the next five years.Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, said in April that every asset from stocks to bonds to real estate can be tokenized in what will represent afor investing.","Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters predicts a future where virtually all global financial transactions will be settled on a digital blockchain ledger.

Microsoft’s AI Bet Pays Off: Company Joins Nvidia in $4 Trillion Club

AI expansion and chip export approvals

Billions planned for cloud and AI infrastructure





Microsoft will invest more than $15 billion in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) by the end of 2029 and has received approval from the Trump administration to export Nvidia chips for its data centers there, a senior executive told news agency Reuters. As per the report, the UAE has been investing heavily to position itself as a global hub for artificial intelligence (AI), using its strong ties with Washington to secure access to advanced U.S. technologies, including high-end computer chips.“The biggest share of (the investment), by far, both looking back and looking forward, is the expansion of AI data centres across the UAE,” Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said in an interview. “From our perspective, it's an investment that is critical to meet the demand here for the use of AI,” he added during the ADIPEC energy conference in Abu Dhabi.Microsoft had earlier invested $1.5 billion to acquire a minority stake in Abu Dhabi-based AI company G42, giving the U.S. tech giant a board seat now held by Smith. G42’s previous links with China had raised concerns in Washington about the possible transfer of advanced semiconductor technology.Smith said G42 had made “enormous progress” in meeting U.S. compliance standards. When asked if the firm would gain direct access to advanced U.S. chips, he said he believed that would be “part of G42’s future.”In a blog post, Smith noted that U.S. authorities had approved licences allowing Microsoft to obtain the equivalent of 21,500 Nvidia A100 GPUs in the UAE. The Trump administration later cleared exports for another 60,400 A100-equivalent chips using Nvidia’s newer GB300 GPUs after updating security safeguards.The new chips are expected to be shipped “in a matter of months” and will power Microsoft’s own data centers in the UAE, Smith told Reuters.According to Reuters, Microsoft will have invested about $7.3 billion in the UAE by the end of this year and plans to spend an additional $7.9 billion between 2026 and 2029 on AI and cloud infrastructure.The total $15.2 billion investment does not include Stargate UAE, a major data center project in Abu Dhabi announced earlier this year during U.S. President Donald Trump’s Gulf visit.",Microsoft will invest more than $15 billion in the United Arab Emirates by the end of 2029.

Sam Altman has defended massive spending commitments. When questioned about OpenAI 's $1.4 trillion spending plans, the OpenAI CEO appeared a bit defensive and ‘uneasy’ even as his response drew laughter from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who was present as both a partner and major investor in OpenAI.“How can OpenAI with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments?” Brad Gerstner, founder of Altimeter Capital, asked in a podcast.Altman immediately pushed back on the premise, asserting that OpenAI's revenue is significantly higher than the $13 billion figure cited in the question. He then pivoted to a direct challenge to skeptics.“Brad, if you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. I just, enough,"" Altman said, appearing to address concerns about OpenAI's massive infrastructure investments.“I think there's a lot of people who would love to buy OpenAI shares. I think people who talk with a lot of breathless concern about our compute stuff or whatever, that would be thrilled to buy shares,” he said.The OpenAI chief expressed frustration with critics questioning the company's spending on computing infrastructure, suggesting he could quickly find buyers for shares among those raising alarms on social media.Altman outlined OpenAI's forward-looking strategy, which hinges on continued rapid revenue expansion across multiple fronts: the flagship ChatGPT product, an emerging AI cloud business, consumer devices, and AI-powered scientific automation.“We do plan for revenue to grow steeply. Revenue is growing steeply,” Altman said.“We are taking a forward bet that it's going to continue to grow and that not only will ChatGPT keep growing, but we will be able to become one of the important AI clouds, that our consumer device business will be a significant and important thing, that AI that can automate science will create huge value,” he added.Altman said he would relish the opportunity to prove doubters wrong if the company were publicly traded.“There are not many times that I want to be a public company, but one of the rare times it's appealing is when those people are writing these ridiculous OpenAI is about to go out of business. I would love to tell them they could just short the stock, and I would love to see them get burned on that,” he said.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, whose company has invested billions in OpenAI and integrated its technology across its product line, offered strong support for the AI startup's execution.“Let me just say one thing as both a partner and an investor. There is not been a single business plan that I've seen from OpenAI that they've put in and not beaten it,” Nadella said.“So in some sense, this is the one place where in terms of their growth and just even the business, it's been unbelievable execution, quite frankly.

What Tesla workers said about training the Optimus robot



“human enough,”

“Tesla is very strict on how everything needs to be done. It can be very tough mentally and physically,”

“You’d have the feeling you’re falling because you’re seeing through its eyes, but you’d be standing upright,”

“The investors want to see the bots moving in action,”

“felt like theatre.”





Dozens of workers at Tesla's engineering headquarters are performing and repeating everyday tasks to train Optimus, the company's humanoid robot. These tasks include lifting a cup, wiping a table, and pulling a curtain. This process, which involves workers doing these tasks hundreds of times during eight-hour shifts, is captured by five cameras attached to their helmets and heavy backpacks. Tesla CEO Elon Musk occasionally drops in to observe, while Tesla investors often visit to see demonstrations from behind a glass wall. In a statement to Business Insider, a former worker described the experience as like being aThe goal of theseis to teach Optimus how to move like a human, paving the way for the robot to replace human labour in tasks ranging from factory work to household chores.During the company's latest third-quarter earnings call, Musk stated that Optimus. It projected the company would eventually produce 1 million units per year.Previously, Musk has also projected that Optimus would account for approximately 80% of the automaker's value one day. Tesla investors are also reported to visit regularly for demonstrations of the work.The report cites current and former Tesla workers to explain how the Optimus robot is being trained. They described the work as physically demanding and very precise. Workers perform repetitive actions, such as sprinting, squatting, dancing, and wiping tables, for long periods. If their movements don’t appeartheir performance is reviewed. Workers use detailed manuals and are paired with peers to ensure accuracy.one worker said.Initially, data was collected using motion-capture suits, but in June, Tesla shifted to using cameras and haptic gloves to track movement. The company also uses AI-generated prompts that guide workers through tasks such as pretending to vacuum, golf, or perform simple motions.Some exercises, like crawling or removing clothing, made workers uncomfortable. The work can cause strain and injuries. One worker said they hurt their back from wearing a heavy backpack used during training. Others reported neck and motion sickness issues, especially while using VR headsets.another worker said. When investors visit, Optimus demonstrations are often conducted via teleoperation to ensure smoother performance.a former worker said, adding that the demosElon Musk sometimes attends these sessions with his son.

Amazon’s Rufus AI shopping chatbot: What it is and how it works



“what to look for when buying headphones?”

“which is better, OLED or LED TV?”





Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently claimed that the company's artificial intelligence (AI) based shopping assistant, Rufus, will generate an additional $10 billion in annualised sales. Jassy shared the projection during Amazon ’s third-quarter earnings call last week, highlighting the chatbot as one of the company's key bets on consumer-facing AI. At the earnings call, Jassy said:Jassy disclosed new metrics demonstrating the tool's influence on customer behaviour, noting that 250 million shoppers have used Rufus this year. Monthly active users have grown 140% year-over-year, while interactions have increased 210%. A significant finding shared by Amazon is that customers who engage with Rufus during their shopping journey are 60% more likely to complete a purchase compared to non-users. So let’s check what the Rufus chatbot is in the Amazon app and how it works:In August, Amazon launched the Rufus AI shopping chatbot in India for all customers using the Amazon Shopping app and the desktop version. Rufus is designed as a shopping assistant to help users find products, compare options, and get quick answers to shopping-related questions. It is trained on Amazon’s product catalogue and web data to provide relevant and helpful responses. Here's how it looks on the app:Customers can use Rufus for various purposes, such as learning what to consider before buying a product, finding gift or occasion ideas, comparing features between items, or checking details about specific products directly on their pages.For example, users can ask questions likeorRufus also helps explore new trends and product categories by suggesting related searches.To use Rufus, customers need the updated version of the Amazon Shopping app. In the Amazo app, tap the Rufus icon (chat bubbles with a sparkle) at the bottom of the screen, or use the icon in the desktop version.The chatbot gives answers based on information from Amazon and the web. Amazon notes that the feature is still improving and encourages users to share feedback to help refine future responses.Amazon has been using AI for many years across areas such as product recommendations, warehouse management, and Alexa’s voice features. Recently, the company added new AI tools, such as review highlights and AI-assisted product listings, to make shopping more convenient. Rufus builds on these features to improve how customers search, learn, and shop on Amazon.","Rufus is designed as a shopping assistant to help users find products, compare options, and get quick answers to shopping-related questions.

'DON'T NEED AMERICA': Canada PM Carney CRAWLS To Xi Jinping In Big Shock To Trump & U.S.





Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked laughter during a diplomatic gift exchange Saturday when he presented South Korean President Lee Jae-Myung with a pair of Xiaomi smartphones—then quipped about security backdoors in a rare moment of spontaneous humour.When Lee lifted one of the black-boxed devices and asked, ""Is the line secure?"" Xi pointed at the phones and replied through an interpreter: ""You can check if there's a backdoor."" Both leaders erupted in laughter, with Lee clapping his hands as officials looked on during the ceremony in Gyeongju.The exchange carried unexpected weight given that backdoor allegations have become a flashpoint in US-Chinese relations. American lawmakers have long suspected Chinese tech giants like Huawei of building hidden access points into their equipment to harvest sensitive data—claims the companies have repeatedly denied, Reuters reported. Washington has even floated incorporating similar tracking features into US products like Nvidia chips, prompting public pushback from the chipmaker.Xi's choice of gift was itself symbolic: Chinese-made Xiaomi phones delivered to the doorstep of Samsung Electronics, South Korea's smartphone titan.An aide highlighted that the curved displays were manufactured in South Korea, underscoring cross-border technological collaboration.The lighthearted moment came during Xi's first visit to the US ally in 11 years, as he attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. Lee had earlier presented Xi with a Go board carved from premium Torreya nucifera wood and traditional Korean lacquerware.

Hong Kong boosts digital transformation efforts





Hong Kong will ease regulations and start a tokenisation pilot program to boost digital asset trading and investment, government officials said on Monday (November 3). The move is part of the city’s effort to strengthen its position as a major fintech and digital asset hub, according to news agency Reuters.The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) will now allow licensed virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs) in Hong Kong to share global order books with their overseas affiliates, SFC Chief Executive Julia Leung said at the Hong Kong Fintech Week conference.“The changes will let local platforms access global liquidity,” she said. Under the previous rule, VATPs had to keep their order books — lists of buy and sell offers — limited to Hong Kong.Reuters reported that VATPs will also be allowed to distribute virtual assets and Hong Kong-regulated stablecoins with less than a 12-month track record to professional investors. Earlier, such assets required at least one year of trading history.Alongside the regulatory changes, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) unveiled its “Fintech 2030” roadmap. The plan focuses on data, artificial intelligence, resilience, and tokenisation to support the city’s digital economy.Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA, said at the forum, “We will now begin incubating mature real-value use cases where tokenised deposits can offer significant advantages, starting with tokenised money market funds.”Yue added that Hong Kong’s financial sector is investing heavily in technology, saying, “The momentum behind this digital transformation is underscored by substantial technological investment with total spending projected to reach more than HK$100 billion ($12.9 billion) every year in the next three years.”According to Reuters, tokenised financial products are becoming more popular in Hong Kong. HSBC’s CEO Georges Elhedery said its tokenised gold product launched in the city has become the third-largest globally.Bill Winters, CEO of Standard Chartered, added, “Our belief, which I think is shared by the leadership of Hong Kong, is that pretty much all transactions will settle on blockchains eventually, and that all money will be digital.”",Hong Kong will ease regulations and start a tokenisation pilot program to boost digital asset trading and investment.

Musk also commented on a post in which Altman defended OpenAI 's $1.4 trillion spending against its ""more revenue"" claim on a podcast over the weekend. Altman asserted that he and his team were responsible for building the company into its current success after Musk had departed.Last week, Altman shared three screenshots with the first one showing him ordering Tesla on July 11, 2018.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

National security and strategic controlThe President’s position reflects a broader effort to protect U.S. technological leadership in artificial intelligence. While Nvidia has explored scaled-down versions of its chips for international markets, Trump’s statement signals that Blackwell chips will be off-limits to foreign buyers, especially in China. “These are super powerful chips. We’re not going to let them fall into the wrong hands,” Trump said, according to Reuters.



Navigating US restrictions



Fueling Korea’s AI ambitions







US President Donald Trump has once again made it clear that Nvidia’s most advanced AI chips will not be sold to China. As reported by Reuters, in a taped interview aired on Sunday (November 2) on CBS’ 60 Minutes and in comments to reporters abroad Air Force Once, Trump mentioned that the company’s advanced and cutting-edge Blackwell chips are reserved for US use only. “We cannot sell them to China. We cannot sell them to other people,” Trump said, referring to Nvidia’s Blackwell AI chips, which are considered among the most powerful processors for artificial intelligence applications.The Blackwell chips from Nvidia are designed to power the next generation AI model which includes large language models and advanced data processing systems. With Nvidia recently surpassing a $5 trillion market capitalisation, the company has become the cornerstone of the global AI supply chain.The remarks made by Trump comes at a time when concerns are growing in Washington over China’s access to frontier AI technologies. The administration has already imposed export controls on high-performance chips, and Trump’s comments suggest a hardening stance on restricting access to Nvidia’s most advanced products.The Blackwell chips are Nvidia’s most advanced AI processors and are also among the technologies restricted by the US government for export to certain countries, particularly China over concerns of military and surveillance applications.On the other hand, South Korea is a close ally of US and it is not subject to the same bans imposed on China. Nvidia has not yet disclosed the financial terms or licensing details of the agreement, but the company has revealed that the chips will be used for commercial and research purposes.As reported by Reuters, the South Korean government has made AI a national priorityand it aims to build a strong ecosystem that rivals global tech hubs. President Lee Jae-myung’s administration has pledged significant investment in AI infrastructure, and the Nvidia deal is seen as a cornerstone of that strategy. “Just as Korea’s physical factories powered industrial growth, these AI factories will drive digital transformation,” said a government spokesperson.The chips will be used to build high-performance computing clusters capable of training large language models and supporting generative AI applications across industries.","US President Donald Trump has made it clear that Nvidia’s most advanced AI chips will not be sold to China. “These are super powerful chips.

Confidence with caution







OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says that the company is generating ‘well more’ than #13 billion in annual revenue but he is not pretending that everything is perfect. In a recent interview, Altman acknowledged the fact that despite the explosive growth witnessed by OpenAI, there are still ways left in which the company could ‘screw it up’. Speaking on the Bg2 podcast along with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Altman responded to questions about OpenAI’s massive spending on AI infrastructure and future sustainability. Bg2 podcast host Brad Gerstner, founder of Altimeter Capital, questioned Altman on how the ChatGPT creator could justify $1.4 trillion in long-term AI infrastructure commitments when its revenue is still a fraction of that.“First of all, we’re doing well more revenue than that,” Altman said, pushing back on the $13 billion figure. But he also added, “There are ways we might screw it up,” acknowledging the risks that come with scaling a company at the center of the AI revolution.The comments made by Altman comes at a time when scrutiny over OpenAI’s financial model is growing. While the company has inked some major deals with Nvidia, Broadcom and Oracle, critics question whether its revenue can keep pace with its ambitions especially as it builds out infrastructure to support the growing powerful models.Altman however, did not offer specifics on how OpenAI may falter, but his candid admission reflects on the high-stakes nature of the company’s trajectory. From regulatory hurdles to competitive pressure and technical challenges, the path to becoming a $100 billion business as Altman has hinted is far from guaranteed.Despite the risks involved, Altman believes that OpenAI’s partnership with Microsoft offers a strong foundation and that the company is well-positioned to lead in AI development. Nadella also echoed the same sentiment, saying Microsoft is ‘all in’ on supporting OpenAI’s infrastructure and product roadmap.Despite its rapid revenue growth, OpenAI continues to post significant losses. According to a recent report by The Wall Street Journal, Microsoft’s latest earnings included a $4 billion charge that suggests OpenAI lost about $12 billion last quarter. Altman, however, dismissed doubts about OpenAI’s financial model, saying revenue is “growing steeply” and that long-term investments will pay off.He also emphasized that OpenAI’s advances in AI models and potential consumer products could create “enormous value” over time. When asked about OpenAI’s future, Altman said confidently, “We do plan for revenue to grow steeply.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

A message resonating across Silicon Valley







Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is giving back on one of the most popular pieces of career advice: ‘Find what you love’. In a candid interview on Norges Bank Investment Management’s in Good Company podcast, Huang believes that passion is not a prerequisite for success, it is something that can grow via commitment and effort. “It’s hard to find something that you love, but it’s easier to fall in love with what you’re doing,” Huang said. “Once you fall in love with what you’re doing because you desperately want to do a good job at it, it’s easier to do it well and work hard.”Huang’s philosophy is rooted in personal experience. Huang started working from the age of 15 and was washing dishes at Denny’s followed by stints as a busboy and waiter. Huang also credits those early roles with teaching him discipline, humility and resilience and says that he genuinely enjoyed each one. “I loved it when I was a dishwasher. I loved it when I was a busboy. I loved it when I was delivering papers,” he recalled. “I’ve loved every single job that I’ve ever had.”He feels that this mindset has carried through his journey at Nvidia, where Huang co-founded the company in 1993 and led it from a graphics chip startup to a global leader in AI infrastructure. Huang’s belief in falling in love with the work itself rather than waiting for passion to strike has become a guiding principle for many in the tech industry.The comments made by Huang have drawn praise from other tech leaders such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk who amplified clips of the interview and commended Huang’s work ethic. In an era where AI is transforming industries and redefining career paths, Huang’s advice offers a grounded alternative to the romanticised notion of chasing passion.His approach also reflects Nvidia’s own trajectory: a company that has thrived by embracing hard problems, iterating through setbacks, and staying committed to long-term goals. Huang says that loving the task at hand—whether it’s washing dishes or designing chips—makes it easier to endure challenges and excel.","Jensen Huang believes that passion is not a prerequisite for success, it is something that can grow via commitment and effort.

In a surprising twist in the AI arms race, Apple is reportedly preparing to integrate Google’s Gemini AI model into a revamped version of Siri, marking a rare collaboration between two of tech’s fiercest rivals. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the new Siri—part of Apple’s broader “Apple Intelligence” initiative—is expected to debut around March 2026, alongside new hardware including a smart home display, an updated Apple TV, and a refreshed HomePod miniThe upcoming Siri upgrade will reportedly “lean” on Google Gemini, the search giant’s flagship generative AI model, to power more advanced voice interactions and AI-driven web search capabilities. Apple is said to be paying Google to develop a custom version of Gemini tailored to Siri’s needs.This move signals a strategic shift for Apple, which has historically emphasized in-house development and user privacy. While the company has been investing heavily in its own AI infrastructure, it appears to be augmenting its capabilities with external partnerships to stay competitive in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.The integration of Gemini is part of what’s being described as one of the biggest overhauls in Siri’s history. Apple aims to transform Siri from a basic voice assistant into a more intelligent, context-aware system capable of handling complex queries and tasks. However, Gurman cautions that the success of the new Siri is far from guaranteed. “There’s no guarantee users will embrace it, that it will work seamlessly, or that it can undo years of damage to the Siri brand,” he wroteThe Siri upgrade is just one component of Apple’s broader Apple Intelligence platform, which aims to embed AI more deeply across its ecosystem. The company is expected to showcase these features through new hardware launches, including a smart display with speaker and wall-mount options, designed to highlight Siri’s enhanced capabilities. Apple’s decision to collaborate with Google also reflects the growing complexity and cost of developing frontier AI models, prompting even the largest tech firms to consider partnerships over going it alone.","Apple is reportedly preparing to integrate Google's Gemini AI model into a revamped version of Siri. The move marks a rare collaboration between two of tech’s fiercest rivals. The new Siri is expected to debut around March 2026, alongside new hardware.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125046024,imgsize-25558,width-400,resizemode-4/siri-20-coming-soon-apples-secret-chatgpt-style-app-built-to-test-new-features-before-launch.jpg"

Satya Nadella on lessons Cricket has taught him

Congratulations and congratulations





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has congratulated the Indian women's cricket team for winning its first-ever World Cup. The Indian women's cricket team kept its date with history by winning the World Cup with a 52-run victory over South Africa. In a post on Twitter, Microsoft CEO Nadella wrote, ""Women in Blue = World Champions! 🏆🇮🇳 Respect to 🇿🇦 South Africa for making their first-ever final 👏 A truly historic day for women’s cricket—new chapters written, barriers broken, legends born.""An avid cricket fan, Nadella's congratulatory post came within minutes of the Indian women's cricket team scripting a golden chapter in the country's pantheon of sporting achievements. It was India’s third final after 2005 and 2017.Nadella has often spoken about his deep-seated passion for cricket, a sport he dreamed of playing professionally while growing up in India. He was reportedly an off-spin bowler and captained his school team, experiences that profoundly shaped his leadership style.Nadella views cricket as more than just a game; he compares Test cricket to a ""Russian novel"" for its depth and unfolding drama.He frequently credits lessons learned on the pitch -- like persistence, teamwork, and building a teammate's confidence -- or his success in the tech industry. His enduring love for the sport also led him to invest in Major League Cricket.Satya Nadella and Soma Somasegar are among the key owners of Seattle’s cricket team, named the Orcas. Somasegar is a venture capitalist and managing director at Madrona.In fact, Nadella is such a die-hard cricket fan that Microsoft has a cricket field at its campus in Bellevue, Washington.Earlier this year, Microsoft CEO took to social media to praise the Test match series played between India and England. The five-match series, which was played for a period of 25 days ended in a 2-2 draw. The test series witnessed many outstanding performances by the players of both the teams. In a post shared on X (formerly known as Twitter) Nadella wrote, “25 days. 5 battles. Scores tied 2-2. This isn’t just a game — it’s Test Cricket in all its timeless glory. A series for the ages. Hats off to IND & ENG for the drama, grit, and greatness.”Similarly, in March this year, Nadella congratulated team India on winning Champions Trophy 2025. Nadella applauded the Men in Blue for their performance. ""Congratulations to Team India on their incredible victory in the Champions Trophy final against New Zealand!” Nadella said.He also gave a special shoutout to two Indian cricketing greats -- Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. “Special shoutout to @ImRo45 and @imVkohli for their stellar performances. Legends! 🙌 #ChampionsTrophy2025 #INDvNZ” he added.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has congratulated the Indian women's cricket team for winning its first-ever World Cup.

Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman to developers and researchers: Stop 'doing' projects that …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman-to-developers-and-researchers-stop-pursuing-projects-that-/articleshow/125040076.cms,"“I don’t think that is work that people should be doing. If you ask the wrong question, you end up with the wrong answer. I think it’s totally the wrong question.”

“The Coming Wave”

“We must build AI for people, not to be a person.”

What Mustafa Suleyman said about AI having emotions



“Our physical experience of pain is something that makes us very sad and feel terrible, but the AI doesn’t feel sad when it experiences ‘pain.’ It’s a very, very important distinction. It’s really just creating the perception, the seeming narrative of experience and of itself and of consciousness, but that is not what it’s actually experiencing.”

5 biggest AI announcements at Microsoft Build 2025

“The reason we give people rights today is because we don’t want to harm them, because they suffer.

They have a pain network, and they have preferences which involve avoiding pain. These models don’t have that. It’s just a simulation.”

“They’re not conscious. So it would be absurd to pursue research that investigates that question, because they’re not and they can’t be,”





Microsoft AI chief Mustafa Suleyman has advised developers and researchers to stop pursuing projects that suggest artificial intelligence (AI) is capable of consciousness. He said this, asserting that only biological beings possess this trait and noted that the pursuit is misplaced. In a recent interview with CNBC at the AfroTech Conference, Suleyman said,Suleyman has been a vocal opponent of the prospect of conscious AI, or AI services that could convince humans they are capable of suffering.In 2023, Suleyman co-authored the bookand penned an essay titled,His comments come as the generative AI market, led by companies like OpenAI, pushes toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). Meanwhile, the AI companion market is growing with products from companies including Meta and Elon Musk’s xAI.Highlighting the difference between AI becoming more capable and the idea of it having emotions, Suleyman said:Referring to the theory of biological naturalism, which suggests that consciousness depends on the processes of a living brain, Suleyman explained:Suleyman also highlighted that the science of detecting consciousness is still in its early stages. While he acknowledged that different organisations may have their own research goals, he strongly opposed studying AI consciousness.he added.","Mustafa Suleyman has advised developers and researchers to stop pursuing projects that suggest artificial intelligence (AI) is capable of consciousness.

Mayhem at Amazon Amid 30,000 Job Cuts: AI - Easy Corporate Excuse? | Global Pulse

Google , Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Amazon all have the 'same problem'

Meta's missing product





In the midst of an unprecedented AI buildout, Meta is spending more than most. The company is building two massive data centers, and reporting indicates there will be as much as $600 billion in spending on U.S. infrastructure over the next three years. While such figures might be expected in the heart of Silicon Valley, they are beginning to raise alarms on Wall Street.The concern hit a peak this week as Meta reported its third quarter earnings. The results revealed a substantial year-over-year jump in operating expenses, coupled with a staggering nearly $20 billion in Capital Expenditure (CapEx). This spending spree is driven by intense investment in AI talent and the necessary infrastructure, none of which has yet translated into meaningful, directly attributable revenue. When pressed for details by analysts, CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed that this spending is only the beginning.Meta isn't the only tech titan sinking billions into AI infrastructure. However, the market reaction to their spending is noticeably different compared to that of rivals like Google and Nvidia, both of whom recently posted strong quarters. Even OpenAI, arguably the biggest catalyst for this investment wave, spends comparable amounts despite having a far smaller financial cushion than Meta.The core issue fueling investor anxiety is the fear of an AI bubble. If one forms, the consensus suggests Meta’s strong core business might allow it to weather the storm better than most, but the underlying question remains: where is the immediate return?While specific recent quarterly CapEx figures fluctuate, reports often show that Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are all substantially increasing their CapEx, albeit often in ways more directly tied to immediate, established revenue streams like Cloud services (Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services) or dominant advertising/search platforms. Sam Altman of OpenAI justifies his hundreds of billions in compute spending by pointing to one of the fastest-growing consumer services in history, backed by a reported $20 billion annual revenue run rate (ARR). That rapid growth offers a clear, quantifiable answer to sustainability questions.Meta’s spend, by contrast, is being directed toward infrastructure whose direct monetization path is less clear in the immediate future. Meta currently lacks a comparable, runaway AI product. Its most visible AI offering is the Meta AI assistant, which Zuckerberg noted has over a billion active users. However, this figure is heavily ""juiced"" by the three billion active users across Facebook and Instagram, and the current version struggles to stand as a true competitor to specialized models like ChatGPT. Furthermore, features like the Vibes video generator successfully boost daily active users but have limited long-term business impact. Vibes is a platform where users can create and share short-form, AI-generated videos.The most ambitious physical product, the Vanguard smart glasses, feels more like an extension of Meta’s established Reality Labs efforts than a direct, large-scale application harnessing the raw power of Large Language Models (LLMs) for immediate, scalable profit.In short, Meta is making monumental bets on infrastructure that is currently funding promising experiments, not yet fully formed, direct revenue-generating products."," Meta is building two massive data centers, and reporting indicates there will be as much as $600 billion in spending on U.S. infrastructure over the next three years.

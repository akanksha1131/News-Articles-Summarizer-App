Nvidia and OpenAI have announced a massive partnership, with the US-based chipmaker committing to invest $100 billion in the ChatGPT-maker and supply it with advanced data centre chips. The deal brings together two of its most influential companies in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the collaboration involves two separate but intertwined transactions. Nvidia will make an initial $10 billion investment in OpenAI for non-voting shares once a definitive agreement is reached.OpenAI, in turn, will use the capital to purchase Nvidia’s high-performance chips, an essential component for its AI development. The companies have signed a letter of intent to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for OpenAI, with plans to finalise the partnership in the coming weeks.""Everything starts with compute. Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we're building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale,"" said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman This alliance will provide Nvidia a significant financial stake in a key customer and solidifies its position as the leading chip supplier for AI development. For OpenAI, the investment guarantees both the funding and access to the advanced computing power necessary to maintain its competitive edge.The first gigawatt of computing power from the deal is expected to be deployed in the second half of 2026 on Nvidia’s upcoming platform, named Vera Rubin. The company will begin delivering hardware to OpenAI as soon as late 2026.While this partnership is a major development, it does not alter OpenAI’s existing plans to develop its own custom AI chips as a potential alternative to Nvidia's hardware. OpenAI has previously collaborated with Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. on a custom chip design, a project that is expected to continue.",N Nvidia and OpenAI announce a massive partnership. chipmaker will invest $100 billion in the ChatGPT-maker and supply it with advanced data centre chips.

What Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said about Oracle’s ex-CEO



“Clay’s years of experience leading Oracle’s large, fast-growing Cloud Infrastructure business has demonstrated his readiness for a CEO role. They are both proven leaders, and I am looking forward to spending the coming years working side-by-side with them.”

The Slimmest iPhone Yet: What we think





Oracle has appointed Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia as co-chief executive officers. This move reportedly signals the company's focus on its growing cloud computing business. Magouyrk, 39, was one of the first employees of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Sicilia, 54, was previously president of Oracle Industries and was involved in the acquisition of health records business Cerner Corp. The company's long-time CEO, Safra Catz, who has held the position since 2014, is stepping back to become executive vice chair of the board. Catz had reportedly expressed scepticism about the cloud infrastructure business in its early days.According to a report by Bloomberg, Oracle is betting heavily on its cloud infrastructure business, which builds data centres for companies like OpenAI and Meta to deliver AI services.The company has secured major deals that are expected to make the cloud its largest revenue-generating division in the coming years. To meet these commitments, Oracle is spending aggressively, leading to negative annual cash flow for the first time since 1990.However, it’s uncommon for tech firms to divide CEO responsibilities; Oracle has prior experience with this model. The company also reaffirmed its financial guidance from earlier this month and announced that Douglas Kehring will take over as principal financial officer, a role previously held by Safra Catz.Separately, the White House said Oracle will play a central role in a deal to sell TikTok to a group of US investors. TikTok had been one of Oracle’s early cloud customers.Catz was promoted to co-CEO in 2014 alongside Mark Hurd, but following Hurd’s death in 2019, chairman Larry Ellison said he had no plans to appoint another co-CEO to work with her. Although Magouyrk and Sicilia now share the same title, Magouyrk will be compensated at a higher level. According to a regulatory filing seen by Bloomberg, he is set to receive a stock package valued at $250 million, while Sicilia’s package will be worth $100 million.In a statement shared at that time, Ellison said:","Oracle appoints Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia as co-chief executive officers.

Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings has endorsed President Donald Trump's new $100,000 H-1B visa fee, breaking ranks with most Silicon Valley leaders who have criticised the policy as harmful to innovation and startup growth. In a post on X, Hastings wrote: ""I've worked on H1-B politics for 30 years. Trump's $100k per year tax is a great solution. It will mean H1-B is used just for very high-value jobs, which will mean no lottery needed, and more certainty for those jobs.""The H-1B program allows US companies to hire foreign workers in specialised roles, with 85,000 annual slots available despite over 400,000 applications. Current data shows nearly half of applications come from tech and science fields, with about 30% of roles paying $100,000 or less.Hastings' support stands out because he's a prominent Democratic megadonor who has previously criticised Trump, saying the president ""would destroy much of what is great about America."" His endorsement cuts against the dominant Silicon Valley sentiment, where tech leaders including Elon Musk have fiercely opposed the changes.However, Hastings incorrectly described the fee as annual. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified Saturday that it's a one-time payment for new petitions only, not renewals or existing visa holders.""This is NOT an annual fee,"" Leavitt posted on X, explaining the policy applies to new visas starting with the March 2026 lottery cycle.The weekend brought chaos across Silicon Valley after Trump signed the executive order Friday. Companies including Amazon , Microsoft, Google, and Tesla urged H-1B employees to stay in the U.S. or return before the Sunday deadline. At San Francisco airport, passengers reportedly deplaned from India-bound flights after learning about the new rules.While tech giants may absorb the costs, startups and smaller firms warn they'll be priced out of hiring international talent, potentially shortening their financial runway by months.","Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings has endorsed President Donald Trump's new $100,000 H-1B visa fee.

“If you're on an H-1B visa and your company doesn't value you enough to pay the $100k, check out https://m.careers to see if any of our roles might be a fit.

I’m seeing many companies from other countries using this as an opportunity to say, “Come work in country X.” That feels a bit desperate to me. Instead, come work with the Metaview — right here in San Francisco — where $100k is a rounding error compared to the value each member of our team creates.

Shahriar Tajbakhsh, the Iranian CEO and co-founder of a San Francisco-based AI startup, Metaview, has a message for H-1B visa holders. In a public message shared on the professional networking site LinkedIn, Tajbakhsh addressed the employers of the H-1B workers amid the new $100,000 H-1B visa fee. His remarks came after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week to announce the increased fee for new H-1B applications. Tajbakhsh wrote, ""If your company doesn’t value you enough to pay the $100k, check out to see if any of our roles might be a fit."" Tajbakhsh even promised to provide a yes-or-no decision on all applications within 24 hours. He reframed the fee as a ""litmus test for company loyalty"" and called the $100,000 fee ""a rounding error"" compared to the value a team member creates. The company's pitch is seen as a new approach to recruiting talent in the wake of rising immigration costs.In his LinkedIn post, Tajbakhsh wrote:As per his LinkedIn page, Tajbakhsh worked with Palantir for a year, initially as a software engineer and later on as tech lead.

Why TikTok algorithm is a challenge



The Slimmest iPhone Yet: What we think





Oracle will implement significant modifications to TikTok’s algorithm following an anticipated executive order from President Donald Trump later this week, a White House official confirmed. Under the proposed agreement to transfer TikTok’s US operations to a consortium of American investors, Oracle will be tasked with developing and securing a US-specific version of the platform’s algorithm.According to a report by Bloomberg, the plan has been outlined by the official and it will ensure that the new US-based owners will control TikTok's recommendation software – which has been a complicating factor in any past deal.The official explained that the American buyers will lease a copy of the algorithm from TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and Oracle will then ""retrain"" it ""from the ground up.""The agreement also specifies that all data from US users will be stored in a secure cloud managed by Oracle. This system will include security controls designed to prevent access by foreign adversaries, including China. Crucially, ByteDance will have no access to US user data or control over the US algorithm, the report said.""Oracle, the US security partner, will operate, retrain, and continuously monitor the U.S. algorithm to ensure content is free from improper manipulation or surveillance,"" according to a Q&A document that accompanied the official's statement.The app’s algorithm has long been a key challenge in the deal, as US law prohibits ByteDance from having any operational role in a new US app, while Chinese law restricts the export of such sensitive technology.The White House official confirmed that Oracle will work in partnership with the US government on everything from algorithm retraining to application development and source code review. The specific extent of the government's oversight role, however, was not immediately clear.This news comes as President Donald Trump prepares to finalise a long-awaited plan to sell the video-sharing platform.","Oracle will be tasked with developing and securing a US-specific version of the platform’s algorithm.

Should you do an MBA? My views👇🏼

Most MBAs are outdated 🤷🏼

Better to learn how to build Products,

Best training ground if you want to accelerate your career or run a company one day.

That’s how I started. As a Product Manager.

Case studies and frameworks are nice, but they don’t teach you how to,

- Question the status quo

- Build deep empathy for customers

- Pursue global optima, not local wins

- Influence without authority

- Work backwards from the end state

That’s a Builder’s life.

It’s messy, political, creative, analytical — all at once.

A microcosm of real life, not classroom fluff.

That’s what helped me build companies, not the three-letter degree, although I do have one 🙈

So I tell young students & professionals to do an MBA, but a different kind. Do a Masters in Building Awesome things and you will graduate, not in 2 yrs, but every day 👨🏼‍🎓😎

Be a PM, Product Engineer, Product Designer, AI Builder, Hardware Designer, Robotics Engineer ….. heck, even a Toy Designer!

Because the 21st century will be led by builders who can also tell great stories 💪🏼

P:S - If you MUST do a top-tier MBA. Or hide for a few months & learn how to build, esp with AI 🤷🏼

Visa Chaos: Trump’s $100K H1-B Rule EXPLAINED; Who Pays & Who Escapes | WATCH

A side door for skilled professionals



Pros and cons of O-1B visa



The advantages of O-1B visa include:

No lottery or annual cap

Faster processing available

Renewable indefinitely

The drawbacks of O-1B visa are:

More subjective than H-1B, requiring proof of “extraordinary ability”

Some employers hesitate due to uncertainty in approval

Application costs can be higher than pre-hike H-1B fees

Some real world examples of O-1B visa



Entrepreneurs like Soundarya Balasubramani, who launched an educational venture in the U.S., are among the new wave of Indian applicants using the O-1 to bypass the H-1B bottleneck. “I got my O-1A approved as the solo founder and 100% owner of an educational venture,” she told ET.

Karan Vaidya, cofounder of AI startup Composio, said his O-1 visa cost less than $10,000 including legal fees, and praised its flexibility: “It’s a three-year visa that can be renewed indefinitely. I’m on my fifth O-1 now.”





US President Donald Trump’s executive order raising the H-1B visa application fee from $10,000 to $1,00,000 sent shockwaves in the tech industry. Due to the announcement last week many tech giants called back their professionals with H-1B visa back to the US. As the scrutiny around the traditional H-1B visa pathway making the process unpredictable, the skilled professionals are now planing to turn towards O-1 visa a lesser known route. The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.For those unaware, the O-1 Visa is introduced under the Immigration Act of 1990. The O-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields of education, science, athletics or arts. It enable the recipients to work in the US for up to three years and comes with unlimited renewals. The applicants of the O-1 visa much demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim and meet atleast three out of the eight criteria:After the unpredictable nature of popular H-1B visa, the O-1 visa is gaining a lot of traction among Indians who wish to go and work in the US. As per the report by Economic Times, Indian were granted 487 O-1A visas in FY 2020, this number was increased to 1,418 in FY 2023. With this increase, India became the third largest recipient of O-1 visa after UK and Brazil.Unlike the popularly H-1B visa which is capped at 85,000 visas annually and allocated via a lottery, the O-1 visa has no cap and the applications for it are accepted around the year. The applicants can also expedite the application process by submitting additional fees.Immigration consultant and O-1 holder Logan Ullyott told Business Insider: “The O-1 is an occupation-agnostic visa. You could get it if you’re an engineer, a researcher, an influencer, or even a cook — as long as you can prove you’re at the top of your field.”","The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk responds



Political leaders weigh in







An ABC spokesperson recently confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely. The company decided to take the decision after the host of the show Jimmy Kimmel made some controversial comments on Charlie Kirk, linking his alleged killer to President Trump’s MAGA movement. MAGA – short for Make America Great Again is a political slogan, popularized by President Donald Trump during his election campaigns. During the late-night show, Kimmel made sharp comments stating that the MAGA gang is “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it”.Actor and filmmaker Ben Stiller was among the celebrities who has publicly defended Kimmel and has criticised the decision of ABC. In s post shared on social media platform X, Stiller wrote, “This isn’t right”.His brief but pointed reaction quickly went viral, with many fans and fellow entertainers echoing his sentiment that the suspension undermines free expression in comedy.Commenting on Ben Stiller’s post, Elon Musk supported the decision made by ABC and wrote, “He went full retard. Never go full retard.”This is not the first time that Musk has reacted to the controversy.Earlier this week after the Kimmel’s video clip from the show went viral, Musk said, “Jimmy Kimmel is disgusting”.The California Governor Gavin Newsom has also blasted the decision and has accused Republicans of orchestrating censorship. “They are censoring you in real time. It’s coordinated. And it’s dangerous,” wrote Newsom on X.On the other hand, commentator Davis Sirota suggested corporate politics were at play, noting that Nexstar, which has ties to ABC, is seeking regulatory approvals from the Trump administration.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump celebrated the suspension on Truth Social, calling it “Great News for America” and labeling Kimmel “ratings challenged” with “zero talent.”","ABC confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely.

European Commission plans to end this 16-year-old law for websites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/european-commission-plans-to-end-this-16-year-old-law-for-websites/articleshow/124052574.cms,"Tech giants want one-click cookie settings across all websites

Privacy watchdogs sound alarm over surveillance advertising expansion





The European Commission is planning to eliminate the annoying cookie consent banners that have cluttered websites across the internet for over 15 years, according to Politico. The move is part of Brussels' broader effort to slash digital red tape and simplify technology regulations.The proposed changes would target the 2009 e-Privacy Directive, which requires websites to obtain user consent before loading cookies—small data files that track visitor behavior and preferences. The rule created the ubiquitous pop-up banners that users now automatically click through without reading.""Too much consent basically kills consent,"" data lawyer Peter Craddock told Politico. ""People are used to giving consent for everything, so they might stop reading things in as much detail.""The Commission held industry meetings this week to discuss alternatives, including allowing users to set cookie preferences once in their browser settings rather than on every website visit. Denmark has suggested dropping consent requirements for cookies used for ""technically necessary functions"" or ""simple statistics,"" which officials consider ""harmless"" compared to marketing trackers.Tech industry representatives want cookie rules moved from the strict e-Privacy Directive to the more flexible General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ), which uses a risk-based approach to privacy protection.The proposal sets up a fierce lobbying fight between industry and privacy advocates. European Digital Rights warned that expanding exceptions for ""essential"" tracking could ""smuggle in analytics or personalization for adtech.""The Commission plans to present its omnibus deregulation package in December, with further privacy battles expected when it introduces the Digital Fairness Act next year. The cookie law reform represents President Ursula von der Leyen's latest attempt to balance privacy protection with European tech competitiveness.Previous efforts to reform cookie consent rules stalled in 2017, with the original e-Privacy Regulation proposal withdrawn earlier this year after years of institutional deadlock.","The European Commission is planning to eliminate the annoying cookie consent banners that have cluttered websites for over 15 years.

Trump has delayed TikTok deal deadline multiple times

President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order later this week that will declare a deal for TikTok's US operations to be divested from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, meets the requirements of a 2024 law, a White House official announced on Monday (September 22).Citing the White official, news agency Reuters reported that the US is confident that China has approved the agreement and does not intend to hold further detailed discussions with Beijing. However, the official noted that additional paperwork from both sides is necessary to finalise the deal's approval.Last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump talked and following a “very productive” call, the two leaders had made significant progress on a range of key issues, including the approval of the TikTok deal. In a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump stated, ""We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal. ""The President also confirmed that he and Xi Jinping will meet again at the APEC Summit scheduled for November in South Korea, and that he will make an early visit to China next year.“I also agreed with President Xi that we would meet at the APEC Summit in South Korea, that I would go to China in the early part of next year, and that President Xi would, likewise, come to the United States at an appropriate time,” Trump wrote.Trump has been delaying the enforcement of this law until mid-December to allow for the complex process of separating TikTok's US assets from its global platform, securing American investors, and ensuring the new ownership structure qualifies as a complete divestiture as required by the 2024 legislation.","President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order later this week that will declare a deal for TikTok's US operations to be divested from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, meets the requirements of a 2024 law.

Job cuts and restructuring



Partner pay and revenues



The road ahead







Global accounting and consulting giant PwC has reportedly slashed around 1,500 employees and 60 partners across its Middle East operations after damaging fallout with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF). According to a report by Financial Times, PwC has announced layoffs after fallout with PIF.The crisis comes from a year-long ban imposed by the PIF in February 2025, which barred PwC from taking on any consulting or advisory contracts in the kingdom. The sovereign wealth fund, with assets exceeding $900 billion, is central to Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 diversification strategy.PwC had been deeply involved in flagship PIF projects which include the futuristic Neom megacity, but tensions reportedly escalated after disputes over staffing and the firm’s prioritisation of consulting over audit work. The suspension effectively cut PwC off from one of its most lucrative markets in the region.* Around 60 partners and 1,500 staff were let go across PwC’s Middle East offices.* The layoffs began in February 2025, coinciding with a broader slowdown in demand for advisory services across the Gulf.* Consulting roles tied to large-scale transformation projects were among the hardest hit.Despite the cuts, PwC still employs roughly 11,000 staff and 500 partners in the Middle East, with the majority based in the UAE and Saudi Arabia.The firm also promoted 62 new partners in June, signaling that it continues to see long-term growth potential in the region.Even as layoffs mounted, partner pay in PwC’s UK and Middle East unit remained largely steady.* Average partner earnings stood at £865,000 ($1.18 million) in the year ending June 30, only slightly higher than the previous year.* PwC’s overall revenues edged up to £6.35 billion in 2025, compared with £6.33 billion the year before.* Middle East revenues held flat at £1.98 billion, reflecting the loss of Saudi contracts.PwC has appointed Laura Hinton, a UK managing partner, to co-lead its Middle East business alongside senior partner Hani Ashkar starting October 2025. The leadership shake-up is seen as part of a strategy reset to rebuild credibility and stabilize operations in the region.While PwC remains a heavyweight in the Gulf, the clash with Saudi Arabia’s PIF underscores the risks of overreliance on sovereign clients in politically sensitive markets.","PwC has reportedly slashed around 1,500 employees and 60 partners across its Middle East operations after damaging fallout with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) The crisis comes from a year-long ban imposed by the PIF in February 2025, which barred PwC from taking on any consulting or advisory contracts.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124052369,imgsize-10150,width-400,resizemode-4/tech-job-cut.jpg"

The memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk saw prominent figures, including President Donald Trump and tech mogul Elon Musk , pay their respects and offer tribute to the 31-year-old firebrand. Kirk, a pivotal figure in Trump’s circle, was hailed as a “martyr for America's freedom” during the service. Musk, on his part, said that he was killed because he made a difference.“He was killed because his words made a difference,” Musk said, when asked why he thinks Kirk was assassinated.“Because he was showing people light. And he was killed by the dark,” Musk added.The memorial service for Charlie Kirk in Arizona brought together tens of thousands of mourners, including Vice President JD Vance and senior administration leaders. It served as a powerful display of unity. Amid the solemnity, there were moments of levity, such as when Donald Trump shared a gentle sway and lip-synced with a teary-eyed Erika Kirk, the activist's widow.Donald Trump, in his tribute, underscored Kirk's significance, calling him a ""key force"" behind his 2024 presidential victory.“He's a martyr now for America's freedom,"" Trump said.“I know I speak for everyone here today when I say that none of us will ever forget Charlie.And neither now will history,” he said. Previously, Trump said that Kirk was the one who asked him to be on TikTok during his Presidential campaign last year.Meanwhile, Erika Kirk, addressing the crowd, shared a message of forgiveness for the man accused of killing her husband.“My husband, Charlie, he wanted to save young men, just like the one who took his life. I forgive him,” she saidAuthorities have charged 22-year-old Tyler Robinson from Utah with the killing. While a motive has not been officially confirmed, prosecutors have noted a text message Robinson reportedly sent to his partner after the shooting, stating he had ""enough"" of Kirk's ""hatred.""","The memorial service for Charlie Kirk in Arizona brought together tens of thousands of mourners, including Vice President JD Vance and senior administration leaders.

How a technical glitch in Income tax website may cost crores to several companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-a-technical-glitch-in-income-tax-website-may-cost-crores-to-several-companies/articleshow/124049047.cms,"

What the tax rules say





A technical glitch in the Income Tax department ’s website prevented several companies from completing their advance tax payments by the September 15 deadline, leaving them exposed to steep penalties. According to a report by Economic Times, advisors and counsels have approached the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) and the finance ministry, requesting waiver of interest for payments that were initiated on or before September 15 but could not be processed. Some firms are also considering writ petitions if relief is not provided, tax practitioners told the publication.Under tax rules, late payment of advance tax attracts interest at 1% per month. Since advance tax is paid quarterly, even a single day’s delay results in a 3% charge. For large taxpayers, the penalty can run into several crores.This year, September 15 was both the last date for filing income tax returns for assessment year 2024–25 and the deadline for the second installment of advance tax, creating an additional load on the portal.The ET report quotes senior chartered accountant Gautam Nayak who said, “While extending the ITR due date by a day, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) did not extend the due date for advance tax payments.The same portal is used for tax payments as well, following the integration of the filing and payment portals. Many taxpayers could not log in to pay advance tax. Several of them were unable to complete payment due to the glitches in the portal. They would be penalised with a 3 per cent interest for no fault of theirs. The CBDT should waive the otherwise mandatory levy of interest in cases where payment was made on 16th September.”“Many taxpayers had a harrowing time. It is only fair that they are not burdened with charges due to factors beyond their control -- irrespective of whether their payment was incomplete or they were unable to login. The CBDT’s Circular 5/2025, which gave relief for payments of TDS/TCS (tax deducted and collected at source) affected by similar issues, sets a precedent. Courts too have recognised such challenges and granted relief in non-compliances such as delay in return filings or document uploads caused by technical glitches. Taxpayers’ intent to comply was evident as many transactions were reversed. A clarification from authorities would instil confidence in the system,” Ashish Karundia, founder of the CA firm Ashish Karundia & Co told ET.","A technical glitch in the Income Tax department ’s website prevented several companies from completing their advance tax payments by the September 15 deadline.

Have you ever marvelled at how Google Maps can tell you almost exactly how long your journey will take? It’s not magic; it is a combination of advanced technology, vast amounts of data, and clever algorithms. Google Maps doesn’t just measure the distance between two points. It considers speed limits, typical road speeds, and even the type of road you’re travelling on, whether a smooth highway or a busy city street. On top of that, it uses live traffic updates from millions of users, historical traffic patterns, and artificial intelligence predictions to give you highly accurate travel times. This dynamic system ensures that your estimated arrival time adjusts in real time if there is an accident, heavy traffic, or roadwork along the way.At its core, Google Maps measures the distance from your starting point to your destination using detailed digital maps. It then calculates travel time based on average speeds for each type of road. For example, highways generally allow higher speeds than local streets, so your journey is broken into segments with different speed estimates. The basic formula is simple:Travel Time = Distance ÷ Average SpeedHowever, the “average speed” is not fixed. It is refined using data from previous trips and real-time conditions to make predictions far more accurate than simply following speed limits.Google Maps has collected years of information on traffic patterns from past trips. By analysing when and where congestion usually occurs, the app can predict how fast traffic will move at a particular time of day or day of the week. This helps the system anticipate delays before they happen, giving you a realistic estimate rather than just a “distance divided by speed” calculation.One of the most powerful features of Google Maps is its ability to see live traffic conditions. Users’ smartphones with the app open anonymously send location and speed data. By analyzing this information, Google can detect traffic jams, accidents, or road closures and instantly adjust your route and travel time. This is why your arrival time can change while you are already on the road.Finding the fastest route is not as simple as choosing the shortest path. Google Maps uses advanced algorithms like Dijkstra’s algorithm and A search* to evaluate millions of possible routes. These algorithms consider distance, speed, traffic, road types, and other factors to determine the quickest path. The system also constantly re-evaluates your route based on new traffic data.Google Maps considers many additional factors to improve accuracy:Mode of transport: Walking, biking, driving, or public transit each have unique speed and route characteristics.Road types: Highways, main streets, and side roads all have different average speeds.Traffic incidents: Accidents, roadwork, or closures are factored in real time.Machine learning predictions: Google predicts future traffic patterns using AI, considering weather, events, and historical trends.Google Maps is impressively accurate. Studies and user experiences show that its travel time estimates often differ by only 1–2 minutes on average for normal trips. Accuracy may vary during extreme traffic or unpredictable events, but the app quickly adjusts estimates as conditions change.The key to Google Maps’ reliability is its layered approach:This combination of technology, live data, and machine learning ensures that Google Maps can give you travel times that are both accurate and adaptive, making commuting and long trips easier to plan than ever before.",Google Maps measures the distance from your starting point to your destination using detailed digital maps.

Over-investing better than falling behind







Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has now acknowledged the possibility of an AI-driven market bubble by drawing parallels to the dot-com era. Speaking at an episode of Access podcast, Zuckerberg mentioned that the rapid pace of AI investment could lead to a more stressed environment and failing to invest would further aggravate the situation.Zuckerberg emphasised that history offers a cautionary lesson, ““There’s definitely a possibility, at least empirically, based on past large infrastructure buildouts and how they led to bubbles, that something like that would happen here,” he said.He also stressed on the fact that the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and the railroad mania of the 1800s saw overbuilding and debt-fueled growth collapse into financial crises. Still, he argued that AI could be an exception if demand for increasingly capable models continues to expand.“If the models keep on growing in capability year-over-year and demand keeps growing, then maybe there is no collapse,” he added.Despite the risks, Meta CEO Zuckerberg is also emphasised that underinvestment poses a bigger danger than overspending.“If we end up misspending a couple hundred billion dollars, that’s going to be very unfortunate.But I would say the risk is higher on the other side,” he explained.“If we end up misspending a couple hundred billion dollars, that’s going to be very unfortunate. But I would say the risk is higher on the other side,” he explained.He warned that building too slowly could leave companies unprepared if superintelligence arrives sooner than expected:“If you build too slowly, and superintelligence is possible in three years but you built it out assuming it would be there in five years, then you’re out of position on what I think is going to be the most important technology.”Meta has already pledged at least $600 billion through 2028 for U.S. data centers and AI infrastructure, alongside the launch of a superintelligence lab to recruit top researchers.",Mark Zuckerberg has acknowledged the possibility of an AI-driven market bubble by drawing parallels to the dot-com era.

India’s position



Why it matters now







BJP Kerala State President Rajeev Chandrashekhar has also criticised US President Donald Trump’s decision to increase the H-1B visa fees to $1,00,000. Speaking to news agency ANI, Chandrasekhar said that this decision to the Trump administration could damage America’s own technology ecosystem. For those unaware, last week, the Donald Trump administration announced revision in the application fees for H-1B visa. This decision created a situation of panic and chaos across the tech sector.In an interview with ANI, Chandrasekhar revealed that he himself is an H-1B visa holder and also mentioned that US is undermining its competitiveness by restricting the flow of global talent.“I don’t believe this is a very smart idea for the American economy, but that is the American prerogative,” he remarked.“I was a beneficiary of the H-1B visa many years ago. I can certainly tell you that it is not something that is good for the American technology ecosystem because it depends in very large part on Indian talent.”He also stressed on the fact that innovation is inherently cross-border and both US and India have grown because of the seamless movement of skilled professionals.Chandrasekhar also noted that innovation ecosystem in India has grown significantly and is no longer dependent for opportunities on the US.He also emphasised that the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had already underlined the importance of talent mobility in driving global innovation.“Innovation and technology today is a very cross-border activity, and the success of both the US innovation ecosystem and the Indian innovation ecosystem has come through the seamless movement of talent,” he said.The resurfacing of this old post by Elon Musk comes at a crucial time for Indian professionals in the US, who make up nearly three-quarters of H-1B recipients. With the new $100,000 fee, the economics of hiring foreign talent have been upended, sparking fears of layoffs, relocations, and a potential reverse migration back to India.Musk’s past words — contrasting with his more recent criticisms of the program as “broken” — highlight the tensions between business needs, political rhetoric, and immigration realities.","Kerala State President Rajeev Chandrashekhar has also criticised US President Donald Trump’s decision to increase the H-1B visa fees to $1,00,000.

Prafull Billore MBA Chai wala’s ‘panauti’ tag





H-1B visa has become costlier after Trump introduced a $100,000 annual fee on future applications. The new prices have come into effect starting today, September 21, leaving many guessing with what happens next. Amid the chaos, entrepreneur Prafull Billore, popularly known as MBA Chai Wala has become subject of online jokes after his recent trip to the United States coincided with the announcement of steep H-1B visa fee hike.Billore shared a photo on September 8 from outside Google ’s headquarters in Mountain View, California. He then captioned the post “Hello from Google’s headquarters, Googleplex, Mountain View, California, United States.”Days after, US President Donald Trump signed an order imposing a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B visa applications on September 19. The move sparked anxiety among Indian tech workers and companies that accounted for the majority of H-1B visa holders.On microblogging platforms X (formerly twitter), users humorously connected Billore’s visit with the visa decision, reviving the “panauti” label he has carried for more than a year.“This caused H1B Visa Crisis. He is having 100% strike rate,” one user wrote on X. Another quipped: “Now we know the culprit behind H1B woes. Panauti bhai at his best.”“Bhai ka track record ek dum bana hua hai… H1B visa ki fees badh hi gayi hai and poora Silicon Valley industry H1B visa par hi establish hai (Brother’s track record is perfect… H1B visa fees have increased and the entire Silicon Valley industry relies on H1B visas),” joked another.The “panauti” tag first emerged in June 2024 when Billore posted a selfie with cricketer Suryakumar Yadav. The following day, Yadav scored only six runs in a T20 match, prompting a flood of memes. Since then, the label has stuck, with Billore often playing along and even launching a “Reverse Panauti” campaign to turn the joke into a branding tool.Billore, who rose to prominence with his tea startup before becoming a social media figure, has not publicly responded to the latest round of memes.","Prafull Billore, popularly known as MBA Chai Wala, has become subject of online jokes.

With this latest development, the debate around H-1B program has also reignited. Introduced in 1990, the H-1B visa program has helped in shaping the career to lot of influential tech leaders including, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and many others.The US government introduced the H-1B visa program in 1990. The special visa program was designed to let US companies hire foreign professionals in speciality occupations. For more than a decade, the H-1B program has become a talent gateway to hire skilled professionals from around the world, particularly India. These professionals contributed to America’s innovation economy.Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, originally hailed from South Africa.He transitioned to an H-1B visa in the 1990s after studying in the US. Musk is often seen crediting the program for allowing him and other skilled immigrants to build companies that transformed industries.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella moved to the US in 1990s and he switched from a green card to an H-1B visa in 1994. This transition allowed him to keep working at Microsoft, where he rose through ranks and became the CEO of the company.Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai came to the US as a student before obtaining an H-1B visa which allows him to join Google. His rise from product manager to CEO underscores the program’s role in nurturing global leadership talent.The founder of Zoom Eric Yaun faced multiple rejections before securing an H-1B visa in 1997. From there on he went ahead and created one of the world’s most widely used video conferencing platforms.The founder of AppDyamics Jyoti Bansal secured his H-1B visa in 2000 and transition to green card after the period of seven years.The co-founder of Coursera, DeepLearning.AI and Google Brain came to the US to study in 1993.

Unemployment among recent computer science graduates has reached 6.1% and 7.5% for computer engineering graduates — more than double the rates for biology or art history majors. The number of foreign STEM workers in the United States has more than doubled between 2000 and 2019, while overall STEM employment only increased 44.5% during that time.

American companies are laying off their American technology workers and seemingly replacing them with H-1B workers:

One company was approved for 5,189 H-1B workers in FY 2025, while laying off roughly 16,000 U.S. employees this year.

Another company was approved for 1,698 H-1B workers in FY 2025, yet announced it was laying off 2,400 U.S. workers in Oregon in July.

A third company has reduced its U.S. workforce by 27,000 since 2022 while receiving 25,075 H-1B approvals.

Yet another company reportedly cut 1,000 American jobs in February despite receiving 1,137 H-1B approvals for FY 2025.

American IT workers have even been reportedly forced to train their foreign replacements under nondisclosure agreements. The H-1B program is creating disincentives for future American workers to choose STEM careers, which threatens our national security.

President Trump is imposing higher costs on companies seeking to use the H-1B program in order to address the abuse of the program, stop the undercutting of wages, and protect our national security.

Voters gave President Trump a resounding mandate to put American workers first, and he has worked every day to deliver on that commitment.

President Trump has aggressively and successfully negotiated new trade deals to bring manufacturing jobs back home and attract new investments to the US.

President Trump is using tariffs as a strategic tool to rebuild American manufacturing, secure our supply chains, and protect U.S. national security.

President Trump has implemented several Section 232 tariffs to protect manufacturing that has been undermined by unfair trade practices and global excess capacity.

Since President Trump returned to office, all employment gains have gone to American-born workers—unlike last year during the same period under President Biden, when all employment gains went to foreign-born workers.

The Trump Administration issued new guidance to ensure illegal aliens are not allowed access to federal workforce development resources and related grants, protecting job training for American workers.""





US President Donald Trump recently announced the new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications. Soon after the announcement, the White House issued a fact sheet to defend the move, citing ""widespread program abuse"" and American job losses. The fee, which applies to all new petitions filed from outside the US, is intended to discourage companies from replacing American workers with lower-paid foreign labour. The White House claimed that several US companies have laid off American tech workers while hiring foreign employees through the visa program. The fact sheet stated that one company received 5,189 H-1B visa approvals while laying off 16,000 U.S. workers, and another received 1,698 approvals while cutting 2,400 jobs.In the fact sheet, the White House wrote:",The share of IT workers with H-1B visas has risen from 32% in FY 2003 to over 65% in recent years.

Techies’ ‘ghar wapsi’ will be boon for offshoring: Experts after $100k fees imposed on H1-B visa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/techies-ghar-wapsi-will-be-boon-for-offshoring-experts-after-100k-fees-imposed-on-h1-b-visa/articleshow/124023031.cms,"File photo of applicants at US consulate in Mumbai waiting in line for their visa interview at a special camp organised earlier this year





American President Donald Trump’s $100,000 H-1B visa fee is expected to trigger a sharper wave of offshoring by global IT firms while sparking a ‘ ghar wapsi ’ among Indian tech professionals to India. Indian IT leaders, however, appeared largely unfazed at the development. Most CEOs said their companies have built resilient operating models offshore and nearshore designed to withstand immigration-related disruptions. Many Indian IT firms have already reduced their reliance on H-1B visas to well below 50%, signalling the industry’s shift towards stronger offshore and near-shore delivery models.“Over the past several years, Indian IT firms have significantly reduced their reliance on the H-1B visa, with filings dropping by over 50%. This shift is a result of our ongoing strategy to hire more locally, invest in automation, and enhance our global delivery models. While visa fees may change, the impact on our business will be minimal, as we’ve already adapted to this evolving landscape,” CP Gurnani, founder & vice chairman, AionOS.What industry observers are arguing is how the new visa fee, if implemented, could reshape the IT talent landscape globally.Vivek Wadhwa, CEO of Vionix Biosciences and former distinguished fellow at Harvard Law School and Carnegie Mellon, warned of long-term consequences for the US.“Trump’s $100,000 H-1B fee is economic suicide for America. It will force Indian talent to go home, taking with them skills, savings, and global experience. Indian engineers have been trapped in limbo for years because of endless visa backlogs. Trump has just pushed them to make the obvious choice: return home where opportunities are greater.” Wadhwa added that the reverse talent flow would benefit India enormously. “They will bring capital, networks, and the knowhow of scaling companies globally.”Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based HfS Research, said while the new policy’s practical longevity is questionable, there would be impacts to track. “This policy may not survive in court or Congress, but the damage is already done. It has jolted the industry into fast-tracking automation and near-shoring. Even if the $100,000 fee is overturned, providers and clients will lock in new strategies that reduce reliance on H-1Bs. In effect, the policy acts as a catalyst. It may not last, but it will accelerate structural change in how global IT services are delivered.”Among Indian companies, steps to reduce H-1B reliance have been afoot for some time. IT major TCS has built a formidable onshore presence in North America with over 46,000 employees across 32 locations, including key hubs in New York, Edison, Cincinnati, Santa Clara, Phoenix, and Austin. Infosys employs 34,388 professionals in the Americas, while HCLTech has more than 23,000 employees in the US, with 75% of its workforce locally hired.Asked whether Trump’s return as US president would accelerate near-shore strategies to ensure uninterrupted delivery for clients, TCS CEO Krithivasan had said in Jan, “On an annual basis, we get between 3,000 and 4,000 H-1B visas for a workforce of over 600,000. That’s a very small number. Even within the US, more than 50% of the workforce is locally hired. On an incremental hiring basis, we probably hire much more than 50% every year in the US compared to the H-1B workforce. So, our dependence on H-1B is quite limited. Near-shore exists because we sometimes want to provide sametime zone service to our customers. We are not particularly worried about any immigration reforms or changes in immigrant regulations.”Also read: Panic on board: $100k H-1B visa fee triggers flight chaos in US among Indian travellers - watch Infosys CFO Jayesh Sanghrajka reinforced this shift in Jan, explaining how the company has steadily reduced its visa dependency. “We used to be at the 30% rate, but now we are at 24%. Within that, our nearshore has increased significantly. And within the US onsite population that we have, our H-1 independent folks are now over 60%. We have now built a pretty resilient model from that perspective. And we are, therefore, much more confident from where we are versus where we used to be earlier,” he said.On the other hand, venture capitalist Deedy Das, partner at Menlo Ventures, highlighted the implications on social media platform X: “Most BigTech companies have <15% of the workforce on H-1B... If you have to pay a $100k tax for 15k engineers that could be a $1.5B payout for a large company. This might push them to consider hiring less in the US and move offices offshore even faster than they already do. It creates a disincentive to attract the world’s smartest talent to the US. They have to pay a high education price and may now not be able to easily recoup it with a job. If the US ceases to attract the best talent, it drastically reduces its ability to innovate and grow the economy. It makes the US’ global competitiveness a lot worse.”The Indian tech industry’s contributions to the US economy remain significant. According to a joint report by Nasscom and S&P Global, Indian IT firms employed 207,000 people in the US in 2021, with an average wage of $106,360. This represented a 22% increase over 2017. The report further noted that the Indian technology sector generated $103 billion in revenue from the US market in 2021. By supporting American enterprises, Indian IT firms indirectly generated a total of $396 billion in US sales output, supported 1.6 million jobs, and contributed more than $198 billion to the US economy.Against this backdrop, Trump’s new H-1B visa fee may act as a shortterm political lever, but its long-term effects could undermine US competitiveness while accelerating India’s role as a global hub for technology talent and innovation. It stands to bring back H-1B professionals armed with deep domain expertise, strong global networks, and the knowhow to scale firms to their next phase of growth. In effect, experts believe what Trump is really doing is driving innovation out of the US and handing India an economic gift that could define the next decade.","President Donald Trump’s $100,000 H-1B visa fee is expected to trigger a sharper wave of offshoring by global IT firms.

A cyberattack on US-based aviation technology provider Collins Aerospace has crippled some of Europe's busiest airports, forcing thousands of passengers to face lengthy delays and flight cancellations on Saturday (September 20). London's Heathrow Airport—Europe's busiest hub—along with Brussels Airport and Berlin Airport have been hit the maximum, affecting check-in and boarding systems across the continent. Dublin and Cork airports in Ireland later reported they were also experiencing minor impacts from the cyber incident.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the attack began Friday night, rendering automated check-in and baggage drop systems inoperable, forcing airports to rely on manual processes that significantly slowed operations.Collins Aerospace, a subsidiary of defense contractor RTX, confirmed it was dealing with a ""cyber-related disruption"" to its software at multiple locations.“The impact is limited to electronic customer check-in and baggage drop and can be mitigated with manual check-in operations,” RTX said in a statement.Aviation data provider Cirium reported that 29 departures and arrivals had been canceled across the three main affected airports by afternoon.The disruption comes on what should have been a busy travel day, with 651 departures scheduled from Heathrow, 228 from Brussels, and 226 from Berlin.Brussels Airport warned passengers of significant delays, reporting an average one-hour delay for all departing flights and 10 cancellations. The airport's website advised travelers to confirm their flights with airlines before heading to the terminal.“This has a large impact on the flight schedule and will unfortunately cause delays and cancellations,” Brussels Airport stated.The cyber incident has left thousands of travelers in limbo, with many airlines unable to provide adequate support at affected airports. Passengers planning to travel through affected airports are advised to check with their airlines for the latest flight information and to allow extra time for manual check-in procedures until systems are fully restored.","A cyberattack on US-based aviation technology provider Collins Aerospace has crippled some of Europe's busiest airports.

H1-B visa economic reality check for tech companies



H1-B visa price hike: What it means for Amazon, Microsoft, Google and others







Indian professionals, especially engineers and other tech workers, who want to work in the US are now facing a very different situation as President Donald Trump signed an order that puts a high annual fee of $100,000 on companies that want to sponsor H-1B visas. This change in policy is expected to have a big impact on Indian workers because they have always been the largest group to get H-1B visas. Citing government data from last year, news agency Reuters reported that 71% of all people who were approved for H-1B visas were from India, while China was a distant second with just 11.7%.This new policy could impact those who want to work in the US because tech companies will now have to pay a very high fee for non-American workers. As a result, companies may be less willing to sponsor H-1B visas, which could lead to fewer approvals.Moreover, those who are on leave and/or are visiting their families in their home countries are also under a looming threat as major technology companies scramble to protect their existing workforce following the announcement.Microsoft, JPMorgan, and Amazon sent urgent internal emails advising H-1B visa holders to remain in the United States or return immediately before the new fee structure takes effect at midnight Saturday (September 20).“H-1B visa holders who are currently in the US should remain in the US and avoid international travel until the government issues clear travel guidance,"" read an email sent to JPMorgan employees by Ogletree Deakins, the firm handling the bank's visa applications.The fee increase represents a huge shift from the previous cost structure. Companies previously paid just $995 total—$215 for lottery registration plus $780 for the employer petition form. The new $100,000 annual fee represents a more than 10,000% increase.For Indian professionals, this change creates a particularly challenging environment. While highly skilled workers with specialised expertise may still find opportunities, those seeking entry-level or junior positions face significantly reduced prospects as companies weigh the substantial financial commitment.The policy's impact will likely vary dramatically across different segments of Indian professionals. The most vulnerable may be recent graduates and early-career professionals in routine technical roles may find themselves priced out of the US job market. Startups and smaller companies, traditionally important entry points for Indian talent, may no longer afford the sponsorship costs.Senior engineers, research specialists, and professionals in niche fields with proven track records may still secure sponsorship from companies willing to invest in high-value talent.Notably, companies like Amazon, which leads H-1B approvals with over 12,000 visas in the first half of 2025, along with Microsoft and Meta (each with over 5,000 approvals), now face difficult decisions about their international hiring strategies.","President Donald Trump signed an order that puts a high annual fee of $100,000 on companies that want to sponsor H-1B visas.

Which applicants will be exempted from paying $100,000 fee for the H-1B visa







US President Donald Trump has signed a new executive order that imposes a $100,000 fee on all H-1B visa applications, a move that will reshape the future of the visa program. The new fee is to be paid by companies hiring these workers to live and work in the United States. While the order has caused concern, it does include some exemptions. The new fee will not apply to visa applications submitted for those working in the healthcare and engineering industries. As of 2025, there are an estimated 500,000 to 600,000 H-1B visa holders in the U.S. In fiscal year 2024, approximately 71% of approved H-1B petitions were for Indian applicants.According to the order, current H-1B visa holders have been exempted from the fee but must re-enter the US by September 21, 2025, if they have been abroad for 12 months or longer. Similarly, the order clarifies that the restriction does not apply if “if the Secretary of Homeland Security determines, in the Secretary’s discretion, that the hiring of such aliens to be employed as H-1B speciality occupation workers is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States. ”This means the executive order gives the US Secretary of Homeland Security authority to waive the $100,000 fee for H-1B workers or industries deemed vital to national interests, such as supporting the economy, security, or public welfare.While exemptions are possible, the order makes clear that the burden falls on employers, who must provide proof of payment before filing an H-1B petition for someone outside the US.Concerns around the H-1B visa program have also grown, with many Americans arguing it takes away local jobs. Trump echoed this, saying the program was meant for high-skilled roles but has been misused to replace US workers with cheaper labour.The new order makes clear that only highly skilled workers will qualify for H-1B visas, making it harder to pursue the American dream.","US President Donald Trump has signed a new executive order that imposes a $100,000 fee on all H-1B visa applications.

I was fortunate to graduate in 2005, when H-1B norms were far more favorable in the US. But things changed quickly in 2008 during the financial crisis — many Indian students felt upset, lost, and stuck.

Some eventually returned home, and years later, even those of us who still had the visa made the same choice. Today, we’ve built fulfilling lives here — with tremendous professional opportunities and the deeper joy of creating in our own country. Personally, I wouldn’t want to go back — at all.

So, if you’re on a US campus right now feeling shaken or disheartened, I know what that feels like. But remember: when one door closes, many others open back home. And India of 2025 is a far more exciting place than India of 2005 ever was.

H-1B visa to now cost more



What it means for India







The Donald Trump administration announced a significant fees hike for H-1B visa. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application. The massive visa fess hike sent shockwaves across the technology and IT sector. After the announcement many tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others have asked their employees to return to US by September 21.Now, Edelweiss Mutual Fund CEO and Shark Tank India judge Radhika Gupta has also shared her thoughts on the H-1B visa fees hike. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Gupta has urged the young professionals to see this disruption as a chance to return to home and build their futures in the country.In a now viral post, Gupta reflected on her own H-1B journey. She recalled how the 2008 financial crisis left many Indian graduates in the US “upset, lost, and stuck.” She revealed that many of them then returned to India, while others like her returned later despite still holding H-1B visa.“Today, we’ve built fulfilling lives here — with tremendous professional opportunities and the deeper joy of creating in our own country.Personally, I wouldn’t want to go back — at all,” Gupta wrote.Donald Trump has signed an executive order on Friday, September 19 introducing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visa applications, dealing a big blow to the technology sector that relies heavily on skilled workers from India and China. Anticipating the tech industry’s response to the changes, Trump said “I think they're going to be very happy”.The hike in the visa fees could lead to reverse migration of skilled professionals, strengthening its domestic tech and startup ecosystem. With a booming digital economy, expanding capital markets, and global companies setting up R&D hubs, India of 2025 offers fertile ground for ambitious graduates who might once have seen the US as their only path to success.","Shark Tank India judge Radhika Gupta has shared her thoughts on the H-1B visa fees hike.

Taiwan's economy ministry has announced that China's newly imposed restrictions on rare earth exports are unlikely to disrupt the island's semiconductor industry, as the controlled elements differ from those used in chip manufacturing. Earlier this week, China expanded its export controls, adding five new rare earth elements and increasing scrutiny on chip-related applications. This move, seen as a strategic tightening of control ahead of talks between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, raised concerns about global supply chain disruptions. However, Taiwan's economy ministry clarified that the rare earths targeted by China's ban are not critical to the island's semiconductor processes.“Taiwan’s chip industry sources its rare earth needs primarily from Europe, the United States, and Japan,” the ministry stated, emphasizing that no significant impact is expected on local chip production. Taiwan, home to TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, plays a pivotal role in producing advanced chips vital for artificial intelligence and other technologies. While the ministry downplayed immediate concerns for the semiconductor sector, it cautioned that China's curbs could affect global supply chains for electric vehicles, drones, and other products, urging close monitoring.China defended its export restrictions on Sunday, citing concerns over the military applications of rare earths amid rising global tensions. The move underscores Beijing's growing assertiveness in controlling critical resources as geopolitical dynamics shift.","China expanded its export controls, adding five new rare earth elements and increasing scrutiny on chip-related applications.

Agencies demand compensation and control

OpenAI scrambles to add guardrails





Hollywood studios and talent agencies are pushing back hard against OpenAI 's Sora 2, the AI video generation app that launched last week and quickly rocketed to over 1 million downloads. The Creative Artists Agency, which represents stars like Scarlett Johansson and Tom Hanks, called the platform a ""significant risk"" to creators' intellectual property rights. Disney has already opted out of having its copyrighted material appear on the platform, sending a letter to OpenAI stating it never authorised the company to use its characters and has no obligation to ""opt-out"" under copyright law. Warner Bros. and Universal have similarly taken legal stances, having already sued AI image generator Midjourney over copyright infringement earlier this year.The controversy centers on Sora 2's original ""opt-out"" system, which allowed users to generate videos featuring copyrighted characters unless rights holders specifically requested removal. Users created viral clips of everything from SpongeBob SquarePants cooking meth to Sam Altman grilling Pikachu, sparking immediate legal concerns.""Does OpenAI believe that humans, writers, artists, actors, directors, producers, musicians, and athletes deserve to be compensated and credited for the work they create?"" CAA questioned in its statement. United Talent Agency echoed this sentiment, calling Sora's approach ""exploitation, not innovation.""In response to mounting pressure, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced the company would give rights holders ""more granular control over generation of characters"" and implement stricter content restrictions. The Motion Picture Association urged OpenAI to take ""immediate and decisive action"" to prevent copyright infringement.However, the damage may already be done. The app's rating has plummeted to 2.9 stars on Apple's App Store, with users frustrated by new restrictions. Meanwhile, the legal precedent is clear: entertainment companies have successfully sued AI platforms before, and OpenAI's ask-for-forgiveness-later approach could prove costly.","OpenAI scrambles to add guardrails to its AI video generation app. Disney has already opted out of having its copyrighted material appear on the platform.

The Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court has reportedly directed tech giants Meta and Google to remove allegedly defamatory and objectionable videos targeting renowned Ramkatha narrator and Padma Vibhushan awardee Jagadguru Rambhadracharya from their platforms within 48 hours. According to a report by news agency PTI, the order was issued by a division bench comprising Justice Shekhar B Saraf and Justice Prashant Kumar while hearing a petition filed by Sharad Chandra Srivastava and others.The petition accused Shashank Shekhar , who operates multiple channels on YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram, of posting derogatory content against Rambhadracharya, the Vice Chancellor of Jagadguru Swami Ram Bhadracharya Divyang University in Chitrakoot, Madhya Pradesh. The videos are alleged to not only defame the spiritual leader but also mock his visual impairment, a disability he has had since childhood.The court instructed the petitioners to provide the relevant URL links to Meta and Google to expedite the removal process. Despite objections from Rambhadracharya’s followers, the content has reportedly remained online, with no prior action taken by the platforms.The petitioners also called for stricter regulations by the central and state governments to curb defamatory content on social media. The court was informed that the Office of the State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities has taken cognizance of the issue and issued a notice to Shekhar, summoning him to appear on October 18. The matter has been scheduled for its next hearing on November 11.","The Allahabad High Court has reportedly directed tech giants Meta and Google to remove allegedly defamatory and objectionable videos targeting Ramkatha narrator Jagadguru Rambhadracharya.

US semiconductor manufacturer Qualcomm acknowledged that it completed its acquisition of Israeli chip designer Autotalks in June without informing Chinese authorities, China's market regulator said on Sunday (October 12).The disclosure came two days after China launched an antitrust investigation into Qualcomm, examining whether the US firm violated China's antitrust law by failing to declare details of its acquisition of the Israeli company, news agency Reuters reported.China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said it informed Qualcomm in March 2024 that the deal required approval by the regulator. In the same month, the US firm notified SAMR that it would not pursue the acquisition further.However, Qualcomm completed the deal in June 2025 without informing the authority, the regulator claimed.

Google expands AI infrastructure and data centres

Strengthening Belgium’s digital future

AI’s potential for economic growth





US tech giant Google has announced plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network, creating hundreds of new jobs and supporting local economic growth. The investment will focus on the company’s existing Saint-Ghislain site and the new Farciennes campus, with construction already underway. Google said the expansion will strengthen Belgium’s role in Europe’s cloud and AI sector, provide large-scale computing capacity powered by carbon-free energy, and create opportunities for local suppliers and contractors. Officials highlighted the move as a vote of confidence in Belgium’s tech ecosystem and workforce.The investment will modernise and expand Google’s network of data centres in Saint-Ghislain and Farciennes, enabling the company to handle large volumes of digital data and support advanced AI systems. These facilities are designed to operate entirely on clean energy, aligning with Google’s global goal to achieve carbon-free operations by 2030. The expansion will also support the development of new onshore wind farms in Belgium to power the centres sustainably.The project is expected to create around 300 new full-time jobs directly, while indirectly supporting approximately 15,000 additional roles through local contractors and partners. Google already works with about 150 Belgian suppliers, including 80 in Wallonia, and the expansion will further boost construction, technology, and service sector employment. Prime Minister Bart De Wever emphasized that the investment underscores Belgium’s growing importance as a digital and green technology hub.Belgium has become a key location for technology growth thanks to its reliable internet networks, stable power supply, and skilled workforce. Google Cloud already serves Belgian companies and organizations such as Odoo and UZ Leuven, helping them scale AI-based tools for healthcare, research, and business. The new investment will enhance Belgium’s competitiveness in the European cloud and AI market, attracting further international investment and innovation.A 2024 study commissioned by Google estimated that artificial intelligence could increase Belgium’s GDP by €45 to €50 billion over the next decade. Most jobs are expected to be supported or improved by AI, with only a small portion at risk of automation. By expanding AI infrastructure, Google aims to equip Belgian companies and the workforce with advanced digital tools while fostering sustainable and inclusive growth. The investment positions Belgium as a hub for next-generation AI innovation in Europe.

Government push fuels Zoho's growing adoption across India







Zoho co-founder Sridhar Vembu expressed heartfelt gratitude to Union Home Minister Amit Shah after the latter announced his switch to Zoho Mail, India's homegrown email platform. In an emotional response on X, Vembu dedicated the moment to engineers who chose to work from India despite opportunities abroad.""Thank you Sir, for your faith in us. I dedicate this moment to our hard-working engineers who have toiled hard in Zoho for over 20 years. They all stayed in India and worked all these years because they believed.

DC Comics president Jim Lee just drew a hard line in the sand about generative AI—and he's not budging. Speaking at a retailer's day panel at New York Comic Con this week, Lee told fans that DC ""will not support AI-generated storytelling or artwork,"" adding emphatically: ""Not now, not ever, as long as Anne DePies and I are in charge. ""The declaration, reported by The Verge, got loud cheers from the crowd—a sign that comic book fans are pretty fed up with AI creeping into their beloved medium.Lee didn't hold back in explaining why. ""People have an instinctive reaction to what feels authentic. We recoil from what feels fake,"" he said. ""AI doesn't dream. It doesn't feel. It doesn't make art. It aggregates it."" He emphasized that the imperfections in human-created work—the smudges, rough lines, and hesitations—are what give comics their soul.The strong stance likely stems from DC's own messy encounters with AI. The company has faced several controversies over variant comic book covers suspected of using generative AI, leading to backlash and eventual replacements. Those incidents apparently pushed DC to take a firmer position going forward.Lee compared AI concerns to other tech scares that fizzled out, like Y2K and the NFT craze. But unlike those flash-in-the-pan moments, he's making sure AI doesn't become DC's problem.""Anyone can draw a cape. Anyone can write a hero,"" Lee said. ""But Superman only feels right when he's in the DC universe. Our universe, our mythos. That's what endures.""It's a refreshing commitment from one of comics' biggest publishers, especially as Hollywood studios continue flirting with AI despite growing public backlash. Whether this stance holds up long-term remains to be seen, but for now, DC's heroes are staying firmly in human hands.","DC Comics president Jim Lee said the company ""will not support AI-generated storytelling or artwork"" ""Not now, not ever, as long as Anne DePies and I are in charge,"" he said.

Shark Tank India judge and Shaadi.com founder Anupam Mittal has revealed what he calls the ultimate answer to nearly every financial question: “Buy assets.” In a recent interview with PinkVilla, Mittal emphasised that the simple two-word Mantra is the key to long-term wealth creation, especially for young investors. “I have two words for the answer to every question: Buy assets,” Mittal said, urging millennials and Gen Z to focus on building wealth through tangible investments like gold and real estate.”Mittal emphasised that with disciplined investing and the power of compounding, anyone can accumulate Rs 100 crore in 20 years. He urged the young professionals to prioritise ownership over renting, challenging popular financial advice which discourages buying homes early. “In your 20s and 30s, the key to real wealth lies in the magic of compounding,” he explained.Along with this, in a separate revelation, Mittal also shared a lesser-known detail about Shark Tank India. Mittal said that the cheques you see in the show are not the final deal. “The cheque you see on TV isn’t the final deal,” he told Pinkvilla, explaining that every investment undergoes due diligence and negotiation before being finalized.This behind-the-scenes insight highlights the rigorous process investors follow to ensure startups meet legal and financial standards before funds are transferred.","Shark Tank India judge and Shaadi.com founder Anupam Mittal has revealed what he calls the ultimate answer to nearly every financial question: “Buy assets.” Mittal emphasised that with disciplined investing and the power of compounding, anyone can accumulate Rs 100 crore in 20 years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124498724,imgsize-45042,width-400,resizemode-4/anupam-mittal.jpg"

What Qantas said about data breach





Qantas Airways said on Sunday, October 12 that it is among the companies whose customer data was published by cybercriminals following a July database breach, reports Reuters. The airline had previously confirmed that more than one million customers had sensitive details such as phone numbers, birth dates, or home addresses accessed in one of Australia’s largest cyber incidents in recent years. Another four million customers had only their names and email addresses stolen during the hack.The July breach is considered Australia’s most high-profile cyberattack since attacks on telecommunications firm Optus and health insurer Medibank in 2022, which led to mandatory cyber resilience laws.In a statement, Qantas said that it was “one of a number of companies globally that has had data released by cyber criminals following the airline’s cyber incident in early July, where customer data was stolen via a third party platform.”The airline added that it is working with specialist cybersecurity experts to determine which data was included in the release. Qantas also has an ongoing injunction to prevent the stolen information from being accessed, shared, or published by anyone, including third parties.According to Guardian Australia, the hacker group Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters is behind the Qantas data release, which came after a ransom deadline set by the group was missed. Qantas declined to comment on the report.","Qantas said it is among the companies whose customer data was published by cybercriminals following a July database breach.

US Government Shutdown Enters Second Week: Why It Happened & Who It Impacts

US government Shutdown stalemate continues





The US government shutdown has entered its 12th day, and President Donald Trump has directed the Pentagon to use “all available funds” to ensure active-duty service members are paid on Wednesday. The move provides a short-term fix for the military but does not cover the hundreds of thousands of federal employees who remain furloughed.In a Truth Social post, Trump said the directive was necessary because “our Brave Troops will miss the paychecks they are rightfully due on October 15th.” The White House Office of Management and Budget indicated that Pentagon research and development funds would be used to cover the salaries. The president did not provide further details on the source of the funds.About 1.3 million active-duty troops faced the possibility of missing their next paycheck due to the shutdown, which began on October 1 at the start of the federal budget cycle. Federal workers, meanwhile, will not receive pay until the shutdown ends, although a law signed by Trump during his first term guarantees back pay once operations resume.Thousands of federal employees have already been furloughed, and layoffs started Friday.The US government shutdown began on October 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding measure and demanded that it include extensions of federal health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Trump and Republican leaders have said they are open to negotiating the health subsidies but insist that the government must reopen first.Trump’s directive to the Pentagon removes one key pressure point that might have forced Congress into action, potentially prolonging the shutdown into a third week or more. While previous shutdowns prompted Congress to pass legislation ensuring troops were paid, lawmakers have yet to take similar steps this time.Service members and their families have expressed concern, as many rely on regular paychecks. Trump said earlier this week that legislation to pay the troops “probably will happen,” adding, “Our military is always going to be taken care of.”",President Donald Trump has directed the Pentagon to use “all available funds” to ensure active-duty service members are paid on Wednesday.

Elon Musk criticizes NGO funded by Salesforce CEO

“To the NGOs funded by the Benioff tax, the drug dealers are a feature, not a bug.

The NGOs get paid close to a million dollars for each drug zombie they “manage”. Their incentive is therefore massive to keep the narcotics dealers operating, otherwise their herd of drug zombies will leave.

You may have noticed how easily the drug zombies were removed from SF when President Xi came to town. Doesn’t it seem odd that there were literally zero drug zombies in SF when he visited? Zero.”





Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has stirred debate with his recent call for National Guard troops to patrol the streets of San Francisco.

Huang bets on Intel’s future

A future built on collaboration





Nvidia announced last month that it will invest $5 billon in Intel and partner with the struggling chipmaker to build artificial intelligence infrastructure and person computer products. As part of the agreement, Nvidia will buy Intel common stock at $23.28 a share, subject to regulatory approvals, AP reported. The tie-up will see Intel design custom processors for Nvidia’s data centre platforms, while also integrating Nvidia technology into PC chips. Now, in a candid interview with CNBC’s Mad Money Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang talked about the decades-long rivalry between Nvidia and Intel. Huang said, ““Intel spent 33 years trying to kill us.” But in a surprising twist, Huang added, “We’re lovers, not fighters,” signaling a dramatic shift in the relationship between the two chip giants.Huang also credited the long-standing friendship with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan which helped in forging an alliance between the two chipset makers. “Our partnership with Intel is because I can imagine a future for the both of us where we could both win,” Huang said. The collaboration between Nvidia and Intel includes building a custom microprocessor for Nvidia, while Nvidia will develop a new chip for an emerging market—two products that signal a deep integration of capabilities.Speaking about the partnership, Nvidia CEO also showed confidence in the partnership. Huang also revealed that he is now a shareholder in Intel, noting, “Ever since I invested, it went up something like 50% or something.”The stocks of Intel surged around 51.84% in the past month and is now up 83.83% year-to-date. This rise in the share prices reflect in the optimism of the investors and its renewed momentum in AI and chip manufacturing.Huang also emphasised that the partnership between Nvidia and Intel is designed to meet the explosive demand for AI hardware, and that Nvidia’s vision for the future is “inclusive.” “When we give a keynote, everybody’s stock price goes up,” he joked. “When somebody else gives a keynote, our stock prices go down.”The move offers a significant boost for Intel, which has struggled to recover after falling behind in the mobile and AI eras. Once dominant in personal computing, the company posted a $19 billion loss last year and another $3.7 billion loss in the first half of this year. Intel also expects to cut a quarter of its workforce by end-2025.","Nvidia announced last month that it will invest $5 billon in Intel and partner with the struggling chipmaker to build artificial intelligence infrastructure and person computer products.

What Thinking Machines Lab said about Andrew Tulloch’s departure



“Andrew has decided to pursue a different path for personal reasons.”

“have been foundational”

“We’re grateful for what he helped build here and are committed to finishing what we started together,”

“inaccurate and ridiculous,”





Andrew Tulloch, a co-founder of Mira Murati’s artificial intelligence startup Thinking Machines Lab, has left the company to join Meta Platforms, the startup has confirmed. The AI researcher reportedly confirmed his departure in a recent message to employees. This move is the latest recruiting win for Meta as it shifts focus toward building out its AI teams. Tulloch also has a history with Meta, having worked for the Facebook parent for 11 years previously. He departed in 2023 for a tenure at OpenAI before co-founding Thinking Machines Lab with Murati at the start of this year. This move comes as Meta is currently focusing on organising its AI talent to pursue what the company calls superintelligence. In June, Scale AI co-founder Alexandr Wang joined the social media giant after Meta invested $14.3 billion in the startup.In a statement to the Wall Street Journal, a spokeswoman for Thinking Machines Lab said:She also added that Tulloch’s contributionsin helping the company reach its current position.the spokeswoman noted.A previous report even claimed that Tulloch was offered a compensation package from Meta that could have reached about $1.5 billion, factoring in top bonuses and strong stock performance, but he turned it down.A Meta spokesperson later described that characterisation asnoting that the value of any package depends on stock growth. However, details of the offer Tulloch accepted remain undisclosed.Meta has been aggressively expanding its AI workforce, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally reaching out to top researchers via email, WhatsApp, and private meetings. Over the summer, he recruited more than 50 experts from companies such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Apple, Anthropic, and xAI, including Tulloch, one of several former Thinking Machines employees approached.Thinking Machines, founded by Mira Murati in February with $2 billion in funding and staffed by over 20 former OpenAI colleagues, recently launched Tinker, an API for fine-tuning large language models.Meta has also restructured its AI operations into a new Superintelligence Labs division, led by Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, following its acquisition of a 49% stake in Scale AI. The division now includes four teams, including TBD Lab, which is working near Zuckerberg’s office on future versions of Meta’s Llama language model.The company plans to spend up to $72 billion this year on data centres to support its AI goals and recently launched an AI video generator feature in its Meta AI app, following OpenAI’s similar release.","Andrew Tulloch, a co-founder of Thinking Machines Lab, has left the company to join Meta Platforms.

Optimistic about long-term AI transformation





Intel’s fired CEO Pat Gelsinger has cautioned that the ongoing surge in artificial intelligence (AI) spending resembles the early days of the internet boom. Speaking with The Business of Platforms Network earlier this month, Gelsinger said: “We've seen this before”, adding “Look at all the optical companies in the early days of the internet. Everything was up and to the right… exponential growth for unlimited periods of time.” He also cautioned that while the early internet period brought massive innovation, it did not sustain indefinite growth.“It was a stunning 10 years, but it didn’t extrapolate to 30 years,” Gelsinger said, suggesting that AI investors should be cautious about assuming endless expansion.Pat Gelsinger comments come amid concerns that the AI sector is overheating, with companies committing billions of dollars in infrastructure and data center investments. Gelsinger is not alone in expressing AI investment skepticism. Tech leaders like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon have compared the current surge to the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s.Despite his warning, Pat Gelsinger remains optimistic about AI’s long-term potential.“I see fundamentally no change for the next two, three, four years,” he said. “But by the end of the decade, some of these transformational technologies will be at scale. I do see a real shift.”He predicted major improvements in AI efficiency, inference costs, and power consumption, which he said would make AI more scalable and practical worldwide.As mentioned above, Gelsinger’s remarks come as analysts debate whether the massive investments by chipmakers and tech firms are sustainable. Some, like Goldman Sachs, argue that this cycle is supported by real adoption, while others warn of overvaluation similar to the dot-com era.Still, Gelsinger believes that AI will eventually deliver on its promise — but only after the current wave of speculation gives way to sustainable innovation.","Pat Gelsinger, Intel's fired CEO, has warned that the current surge in AI spending is similar to the early days of the internet.

If you had invested $100 in T-bills starting in 1928 and compounded them through 2023, you would have $2,249 by the end of 2023. If you had taken more volatility risk and instead invested in longer duration T-bonds, you would have turned $100 into $7,278.

That seems great at first, except for the fact that this is entirely due to dollar debasement along the way. If you had simply put $100 into gold, you would have turned $100 into $10,042. The number of dollars in the U.S. broad money supply increased by more than 400x from 1928 through 2023.""

""Professor Hendrik Bessembinder compiled some of the most comprehensive datasets on this phenomenon.

For his U.S. study, he found that among 26,000 identified stocks between 1926 and 2019, more than half failed to outperform T-bills. But the reality is even worse than that. Just 4% of all stocks accounted for basically all stock market returns in excess of T-bills; the other 96% of stocks collectively matched T-bills as a group. And just 86 stocks accounted for half of all excess returns.

In other words, the majority of U.S. stocks historically underperformed T-bills, and then another big minority of stocks generated only minor excess returns over T-bills, and then a very small sliver of massive outperformers represented nearly all stock market excess returns over T-bills. And as the previous section showed, T-bills underperformed gold. And so, the vast majority of stocks failed to outperform the purchasing power of a piece of yellow metal.

And that’s for the United States, which had the best-performing stocks of the past century. For non-U.S. equities, the numbers are even worse. For his global study, Bessembinder studied 64,000 stocks from across the world over a three-decade period and found an incredible concentration of returns.”





Zoho founder and former CEO Sridhar Vembu has reaffirmed his long-standing faith in gold as a reliable hedge against cryptocurrency. In a latest post on X, Vembu said that he “is not interested in crypto”. The Zoho founder added that his preference for gold stems from its stability and historical resilience during periods of financial uncertainty. He also positioned himself in contrast to several tech leaders who have championed digital assets as the future of finance.“I have long been in the ""gold as insurance against currency debasement"" camp, for over 25 years now. Over the long term, gold has held its purchasing power in terms of commodities like petroleum, and gold has held its own against broad stock market indexes. No, I am not interested in crypto,” Sridhar Vembu writes in the post.Vembu’s comments come at a time when global investors are once again turning to gold amid concerns over inflation, currency fluctuations, and geopolitical tensions. Meanwhile, the crypto market has remained volatile despite institutional interest and regulatory progress in some regions.In his post, Vembu also shared screenshots of excerpts from a post by investor and author Lyn Alden that are as follows:","Zoho founder and former CEO Sridhar Vembu has reaffirmed his long-standing faith in gold as a reliable hedge against cryptocurrency.

Poll How do you feel about China's antitrust investigation into Qualcomm? It's a justified move to protect local interests It's a tactical escalation in trade tensions

Trump announces extra 100% tariff on China imports

Qualcomm's acquisition of Israel-based Autotalk





Just hours before President Donald Trump said that the United States would impose a new tariff of 100% on imports from China “over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,” starting on November 1, China had opened an investigation into Qualcomm, one of America's most important semiconductor companies. China’s State Administration for Market Regulation announced Friday, October 10, an antitrust investigation into Qualcomm regarding its acquisition of Israeli chip designer Autotalks. The probe will examine whether Qualcomm violated China’s antitrust laws by failing to properly declare details of the deal, finalized in June 2025.The investigation is part of a broader escalation of tensions between Beijing and Washington, with US chip companies facing heightened scrutiny in China. The move against Qualcomm comes amid a flurry of Chinese actions targeting US interests, including new export restrictions on rare-earth materials and lithium batteries. On October 10, China also said that it plans to impose a special port fee on U.S. vessels docking at Chinese ports, retaliating against the Trump administration’s move to levy fees on Chinese ships.Just a day earlier, October 9, Beijing also added Canada-based semiconductor research firm TechInsights to its “unreliable entity list” for its reports on Huawei’s chip development.Last month, China’s antitrust regulator accused Nvidia of breaching anti-monopoly laws related to a 2020 acquisition.Trump on Friday said that the United States would impose new tariffs of 100% on imports from China. He said that the US, on that same date, would also impose export controls on “any and all critical software.” The president’s announcement came hours after he threatened to slap “a massive increase” of tariffs on Chinese imports in retaliation for new controls that China imposed on exports of rare earths minerals from that nation.Trump also hinted that he would cancel a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea because of China’s new controls.Qualcomm’s acquisition of Autotalks, a maker of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication chips designed to prevent car crashes, integrated advanced technology into Qualcomm’s Snapdragon car stack. This aligns with China’s push to standardize V2X communication across pilot regions by 2026. However, according to a report in Reuters, Stephen Wu, founder of Carthage Capital, suggested that China’s probe could signal broader pressure on U.S. chip and automotive supply chains. “China could have imposed a minor penalty for procedural issues, but a higher sanction may indicate a strategic move,” Wu said.Qualcomm, based in San Diego, faced similar scrutiny in 2015, paying a $975 million fine to settle a Chinese antitrust case. The company had briefly abandoned the Autotalks deal in 2024 due to regulatory delays but completed it earlier this year. Neither Qualcomm nor Autotalks responded to requests for comment on the investigation.The probe coincides with heightened U.S.-China tensions ahead of an anticipated meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Beijing’s recent actions, including export controls and sanctions, threaten to disrupt the fragile trade balance between the two nations, with semiconductors at the forefront of the dispute.","China's State Administration for Market Regulation announced Friday, October 10, an antitrust investigation into Qualcomm regarding its acquisition of Israeli chip designer Autotalks.

Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian has pushed back against widespread fears that artificial intelligence will eliminate tech jobs, arguing instead that AI will help workers accomplish what they couldn't before.

Despite initial concerns from clients asking whether they would need fewer customer service agents, Kurian revealed that ""almost none of our clients have let anyone go.""The technology is instead handling tasks that customers previously avoided altogether, such as questions too minor to warrant calling a service agent. This expansion of capabilities, rather than workforce reduction, reflects Google's broader philosophy on AI implementation.Kurian explained that when Google first introduced the Customer Engagement Suite, clients were apprehensive, asking ""Does this mean we won't need customer service agents anymore?"" The answer, he emphasised, has been a resounding no.Google CEO Sundar Pichai reinforced this perspective during a June appearance on the Lex Fridman podcast, revealing that the company has measured a 10% productivity boost among its engineers thanks to AI tools. Google tracks this increase by measuring additional engineering capacity created in hours per week from AI-powered assistance.Rather than cutting headcount, Pichai said Google plans to hire more engineers in the coming year. ""The opportunity space of what we can do is expanding,"" he explained, expressing hope that AI will eliminate repetitive tasks and free engineers for more creative work.The numbers support this augmentation approach. During Alphabet's recent earnings call, Pichai disclosed that over 30% of Google's new code is now AI-generated, up from 25% in October. Microsoft UK CEO Darren Hardman similarly announced that GitHub Copilot now writes 40% of code at Microsoft, enabling the company to launch more products in the past year than the previous three combined.Kurian's message offers reassurance to tech workers: AI is a tool for amplification, not elimination.","Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian has pushed back against widespread fears that artificial intelligence will eliminate tech jobs. In an interview with tech newsletter Big Technology, Kurian emphasized that AI's primary role is to enhance human capabilities.

American startup founders are “almost shameless” in their assertive demands and feedback to AI giant OpenAI , according to Laura Modiano, head of OpenAI’s startups division in EMEA. Speaking at the Sifted Summit this week, Modiano highlighted a stark contrast between U.S. and European entrepreneurs, urging the latter to be more vocal to seize opportunities in the fast-evolving AI landscape. Drawing from her experience working with founders across both regions, Modiano praised American entrepreneurs for their directness.“They come in and say, ‘We need this. You need to improve that,’” she said during a fireside chat. “If founders don’t tell us, we don’t always know.” She encouraged European founders to adopt a similar approach, warning that silence could mean missing out on shaping AI advancements. Modiano pointed to Swedish startup Lovable, valued at $1.8 billion, as a model for effective feedback. The vibe-coding company, which launched its GPT-5-based Lovable Assistant 5 alongside OpenAI’s latest model, provided intensive input during early access. “I was in their office for a week, and every hour we were having reviews,” Modiano recounted, noting that European developers’ feedback directly influenced GPT-5’s development.Another success story is Sana, a Swedish AI-learning platform. Modiano recalled visiting their office, where founders demanded specific voice capabilities, such as tone and speed adjustments. This feedback was cross-referenced with similar requests, leading OpenAI to prioritize those features on its roadmap. “We can only ship what customers tell us they want,” Modiano emphasized, suggesting startups appoint a “chief feedback officer” to ensure their needs are heard.Her comments fuel an ongoing debate about the cultural differences between U.S. and European entrepreneurs. Earlier this year, venture capitalists criticized European founders for lacking the intensity of their American counterparts, with some urging them to adopt a seven-day workweek to compete globally. Harry Stebbings of 20VC previously told CNBC that Europeans often undersell their ambitions, while Americans excel at crafting compelling narratives to pitch their businesses.The critique extends beyond startups. U.K. Business Secretary Peter Kyle recently sparked controversy by claiming British university students lack the entrepreneurial drive of their American peers. Speaking at an Nvidia event in London, Kyle questioned how many U.K. undergraduates attend university with the goal of becoming founders, lamenting a perceived lack of “vigour” in British entrepreneurial culture.Modiano’s call to action is clear: European founders must speak up or risk being left behind in the AI revolution.","Laura Modiano, head of OpenAI’s startups division in EMEA, praised U.S. entrepreneurs for their directness.

“Covered List,”





The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman, Brendan Carr, has confirmed that major US online retail websites have removed several million listings for prohibited Chinese electronics. In an interview with the news agency Reuters, Carr stated that the removed items were either on a US list of barred equipment or were not authorised by the agency. The electronics included devices such as smartwatches and home security cameras from companies such as Huawei, Hangzhou Hikvision, ZTE, and Dahua Technology. Carr emphasised that the removal is part of an agency-wide crackdown and cited national security as the driving factor.Carr said to Reuters. He noted that, as a result of the FCC's oversight, companies are implementing new processes to prevent prohibited items from being listed in the coming days.The FCC recently issued a new national security notice reminding companies of the ban on certain items, including video surveillance equipment.Carr added.In recent years, US agencies have taken multiple actions against Chinese technology companies across sectors such as telecommunications, semiconductors, and vehicles, citing national security concerns. The latest measure seeks to prevent unapproved Chinese electronics from entering the US market, the Reuters report noted.Earlier this week, the FCC announced plans to vote later this month on strengthening restrictions on telecommunications equipment made by Chinese firms considered national security risks. The move adds to a series of US steps aimed at limiting Beijing’s access to sensitive sectors.The FCC has previously placed companies such as Huawei, ZTE, China Mobile and China Telecom on itswhich prohibits the authorisation of new equipment from those firms.In October, the agency will vote on measures to block approval of devices containing parts from companies on the Covered List and to allow the FCC to restrict the sale of previously authorised equipment in some instances.In March, the FCC said it was investigating nine Chinese companies on the Covered List, including Huawei, ZTE, Hytera Communications (002583.SZ), Dahua Technology (002236.SZ), Pacifica Networks/ComNet, and China Unicom (Americas) (0762.HK).The FCC has earlier barred some Chinese firms from offering telecommunications services in the US, citing national security concerns. Last month, it also began proceedings to withdraw recognition from seven testing laboratories owned or controlled by the Chinese government, citing similar concerns.","Major US online retail websites have removed several million listings for prohibited Chinese electronics.

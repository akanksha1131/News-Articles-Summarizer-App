I’m especially excited to see the fast progress on coding, with more to come.

Developers can try an experimental version in AI Studio and Vertex AI today. It is also available to try in @GeminiApp on the web today, mobile coming soon.

We are investing in the frontiers of agentic capabilities with a few early prototypes. Project Mariner is built with Gemini 2.0 and is able to understand and reason across information - pixels, text, code, images + forms - on your browser screen, and then uses that info to complete tasks for you.

Gemini 2.0 in AI Overviews

Google has launched Gemini 2.0, an AI model for the ‘agentic’ era. This model can power AI agents – intelligent assistants that can take command and perform actions on users’ behalf. For example, Google announced Jules, an AI agent that can code, analyse issues and fix them on their own as well as Project Mariner – that can undertake tasks on the web.Google launched AI Overviews – AI generated summaries on topics that require research. Pichai said that the company is bringing the capabilities of Gemini 2.0 to AI Overviews that have reached 1 billion people and continue to bring AI Overviews to more countries and languages over the next year.Google has already started limited testing and will be rolling it out more broadly early next year.“No product has been transformed more by AI than Search. Our AI Overviews now reach 1 billion people, enabling them to ask entirely new types of questions — quickly becoming one of our most popular Search features ever. As a next step, we’re bringing the advanced reasoning capabilities of Gemini 2.0 to AI Overviews to tackle more complex topics and multi-step questions, including advanced math equations, multimodal queries and coding,” Pichai added.","Google has launched Gemini 2.0, an AI model for the ‘agentic’ era.

Drones from DJI and Autel Robotics pose national security risk

In November 2022, India banned the import of drones, a move that effectively blocked the Indian market for the world's biggest drone maker -- China’s SZ DJI Technology Co. Now it seems US is set to follow this 'ban' on the Chinese drone company. If goes through this will be second big Chinese company banned in India that US too may ban after potential TikTok ban.The Chinese short video app company TikTok is fighting a survival battle in the US. Last week, an appellate panel upheld the law banning Tiktok, concluding that it didn’t infringe on free speech protections under the Constitution’s First Amendment. The court said that the government appeared to be justified in its concerns that China could use the app to gather information on US citizens or to push propaganda. The law is set to take effect on January 19, a day before Trump is inaugurated.Now a report by news agency Reuters claims that the US House of Representatives is poised to vote on a military bill that could ban the sale of new drones from China-based DJI and Autel Robotics in the United States. The legislation mandates a one-year security review of these companies' products, and if no agency completes the assessment, a default ban will be imposed. The 1,800-page bill says a national security agency must determine within one year if drones from DJI or Autel Robotics pose unacceptable national security risks.DJI, the world's leading drone manufacturer, has expressed concerns about the potential ban, arguing that it could unfairly target Chinese companies. The company has proactively submitted its products for independent security audits and implemented enhanced privacy controls.Autel Robotics, another major Chinese drone maker, has also faced scrutiny from US lawmakers. Last year, a bipartisan group called for an investigation into the company's potential security risks.The US government's growing concerns over Chinese drones stem from fears of data transmission, surveillance, and national security threats. DJI has consistently denied these allegations.In recent months, the US has taken several steps to restrict Chinese drones, including a potential ban on new DJI drones and a Commerce Department review of broader restrictions. Additionally, DJI is currently suing the Defense Department over its inclusion on a list of companies allegedly linked to the Chinese military.","US House of Representatives is poised to vote on a military bill that could ban the sale of new drones from China-based DJI and Autel Robotics in the United States.

It can analyse issues, devise solutions and execute code under a developer's guidance.Gaming is seen as one of the biggest use cases of AI and AI agents. Google DeepMind is also exploring how AI agents can enhance gaming experiences. These agents can analyse gameplay, offer suggestions, and even access Google Search to provide relevant information in real-time.“We're collaborating with leading game developers like Supercell to explore how these agents work, testing their ability to interpret rules and challenges across a diverse range of games, from strategy titles like “Clash of Clans” to farming simulators like “Hay Day”,” Google said.This comes a week after Google introduced Genie 2, an AI model that can create a variety of playable 3D worlds from a single image.Beyond gaming, Google DeepMind is experimenting with AI agents for robotics, leveraging Gemini 2.0's spatial reasoning capabilities to enable assistance in the physical world.","Google announces Project Mariner, an AI agent for the web.

“I used TikTok very successfully in my campaign. I have a man named TikTok Jack, he was very effective, obviously, because I won youth by 30 percent. All Republicans lose youth. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s changing. And last time we were down 30 percent with youth. This time we were up 35 percent with youth.

And I used TikTok, so I can’t really, you know, I can’t totally hate it. It was very effective. But I will say this, if you do do that, something else is going to come along and take its place. And maybe that’s not fair. And really, what the judge actually said was that you can’t have Chinese companies. In other words, they have the right to ban it if you can prove that Chinese companies own it. That’s what the judge actually said.”

“I’m going to try and make it so that other companies don’t become an even bigger monopoly.”

Trump was against TikTok ban during election campaign

US President-elect Donald Trump has provided an unclear stance on the TikTok ban in the country. In a Sunday interview on Meet the Press, when questioned about TikTok's impending ban, Trump avoided committing to saving TikTok though he hinted that ByteDance should divest the platform.NBC’s Kristen Welker pressed Trump on whether he will act to protect the app, which faces expulsion from the U.S. unless its Chinese owner, ByteDance, sells it by January 19.“This week a federal court upheld a law that could result in TikTok being banned. You said you’re going to rescue TikTok when you get into office. Are you going to take steps to protect it?,” Trump said in reply.He also talked about TikTok’s role in his campaign, saying he used the app to tap into youth.When pressed again on whether he would ""protect TikTok"" as president, Trump said:Trump’s position on TikTok has been inconsistent. While he criticised the Biden administration’s support for the ban during his campaign, he previously advocated for TikTok’s removal during his last term in office.In recent months, Trump released a Truth Social video urging those who “want to save TikTok” to vote for him and said that banning the platform will only benefit Facebook, which he referred to as an “enemy of the people.”","US President-elect Donald Trump has provided an unclear stance on the TikTok ban in the country.

Read the complete conversation here



Google has unveiled its new quantum chip — Willow. Google CEO Sundar Pichai took off X (formerly) known as Twitter to announce the launch of the chip. “Introducing Willow, our new state-of-the-art quantum computing chip with a breakthrough that can reduce errors exponentially as we scale up using more qubits, cracking a 30-year challenge in the field. In benchmark tests, Willow solved a standard computation in <5 mins that would take a leading supercomputer over 10^25 years, far beyond the age of the universe(!),” said Pichai in a post on X.This announcement started an interesting exchange between Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk.Pichai took to X to announce the launch of Willow, describing it as achieving "" exponential error reduction and unprecedented computational speed."" He stated that Willow can solve problems in minutes that would take traditional supercomputers billions of years. This breakthrough garnered a surprised yet enthusiastic response from Elon Musk, who simply tweeted ""Wow.""Pichai, seemingly referencing Musk's surprise, followed up by replying, “We should do a quantum cluster in space with Starship one day:)”. To this, Musk responded, “That will probably happen. Any self-respecting civilization should at least reach Kardashev Type II. In my opinion, we are currently only at <5% of Type I. To get to ~30%, we would need to place solar panels in all desert or highly arid regions.”“indeed. We should scale solar so much more, amazing that we keep looking at alternatives when the most obvious path is staring at our eyes, literally!,” said Pichai.The new ""Willow"" quantum chip demonstrates unprecedented error correction capabilities, a critical challenge that has stymied quantum computing researchers for decades. With 105 qubits, the chip can reduce computational errors exponentially as it scales up, a feat scientists have pursued since the 1990s.In a groundbreaking demonstration, Google's quantum researchers showed the Willow chip could complete a computational task in roughly five minutes that would require a classical supercomputer an estimated 10 septillion (10^25) years—far exceeding the known age of the universe.","Google's new quantum chip, Willow, can solve problems in minutes that would take traditional supercomputers billions of years.

Google beyond Search

Alphabet, the parent company of Google , is placing its biggest bet on the future of online search, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionise the very foundation of its business, Alphabet President and chief investment officer Ruth Porat has said.“We're meeting people where they want to be next,” Porat said in an interview at the Reuters NEXT conference in New York, emphasising the company's commitment to AI-driven search as its most significant goal.With search-related advertising generating the lion's share of Alphabet's over $300 billion in annual revenue, the company is keenly aware of the need to stay ahead of the curve.Google has already begun integrating AI-generated summaries into search results for certain queries through AI Overviews – a move prompted by competition from rivals like ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Microsoft’s AI-powered Bing.The integration came with challenges as AI models can sometimes “hallucinate,” generating inaccurate or fabricated information. Porat acknowledged the need for continuous improvement and responsible development of AI for search.Porat also highlighted Google Cloud’s importance and called it another key investment area. She also emphasised the company’s commitment to healthcare innovation, citing the development of AlphaFold, an AI system that predicts protein structures, and its potential applications in drug discovery through Isomorphic Labs.“It can restore humanity into the doctor-patient relationship,” she added.While acknowledging the significant costs associated with AI investments, Porat emphasised the “generational opportunity” presented by the technology. Alphabet has projected capital expenditures of $50 billion in 2024 for chips, data centers, and other infrastructure to support its AI initiatives.“We need to generate a return,” she noted.","Google has already begun integrating AI-generated summaries into search results for certain queries through AI Overviews.

"Revival in sight for IT services industry, but companies must adapt to succeed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/revival-in-sight-for-it-services-industry-but-companies-must-adapt-to-succeed/articleshow/116210920.cms,"-- By

Sandeep Nayak and Kushal Raja

Sandeep Nayak and Kushal Raja are partners in Bain & Company’s New Delhi and Mumbai offices, respectively. They are leaders in the firm’s Technology and

Cloud Services

practice.

The IT services industry stands at a critical crossroads. After a period of super-charged growth from Q1’FY22 to Q3’FY23, with an average median growth of 20% year-over-year, the IT services industry has faced five tough quarters. The peak came in Q4 FY 22 when the Covid-19 pandemic forced enterprises to accelerate their digital transformation and adapt to remote work. However, as macroeconomic pressures squeezed discretionary spending, halting many change programs, growth bottomed out by Q3 and Q4 FY24, dropping to near 0%. But recent financial results from India’s top 12 IT services companies indicate an inflection point for the industry. While growth may not return to pre-Covid levels of double digits anytime soon, even low single-digit growth signals a positive turn for the future.Looking ahead, the industry is in a phase of measured recovery. A recent survey of over 160 IT decision makers in US and Europe reveals that across industries including banking, insurance, retail, manufacturing, telecom, and pharma, the growth for 2023 was predicted to be 2%–3% (the average median for the top 12 companies was roughly 4%), which played out exactly in that manner. The same survey has now predicted 2024 to see 4%–6% growth, further reinforcing the belief that the worst is behind us. A gradual return to high single-digit growth over the next two years is likely, but this recovery will be contingent on how well companies adapt to changing dynamics.One key factor is targeting the right growth areas. Not all sectors will experience equal levels of spending.For example, within the broader universe of banking, while retail banking will see a minor spend uptick of 4%–5% growth in 2024, commercial banking and wealth management are expected to grow much faster by 6%–8%. In contrast, sectors such as Manufacturing and Property and Casualty (P&C) insurance, which were the big IT spenders in 2023 (5%–8% increase in spend over 2022), are expected to tighten their purse strings, with spending growth dipping to just 2%–4%, in 2024. Among service lines, data modernisation—including AI/ ML—offers great opportunities, capturing 20%–30% of all incremental spends across sectors. Besides, the ongoing cloud journey is not over yet. Enterprise cloud budgets are expected to increase by 4% to 11% in 2024 compared to last year, with the majority of the outlay on data migration.Cybersecurity will continue to see spends as threats become more complicated. Moreover, each micro-vertical will also have nuanced spend in specific areas, for example, sectors like Retail & Manufacturing will focus on supply chain transformation.Cost control will also play a critical role to cope with an uncertain business environment and manage with limited budgets. IT decision-makers will focus on cost-reduction strategies, including vendor consolidation and increased offshoring. The survey reveals that offshoring preferences are expected to grow 2–5 times in 2024 compared to 2023, as decision-makers lean on cost arbitrage to maximise their tight IT budgets. Meanwhile, all maintenance deal renewals for infrastructure and application will come with an expectation of over 15% price compression. For an IT services provider, driving AI- based cost takeout on maintenance (referred to as AIOps) proactively can be a lever to expand presence in accounts. The playing field is getting levelled—it doesn’t matter if you are #1 or #5 in account—it is important to shrink to grow.The expansion of Global Capability Centers (GCCs) threat is real—however, this can be an opportunity. Most large enterprises want to expand their GCCs over the next three years, particularly the front-end and core systems. GCCs and IT Services companies will co-exist and compete. This presents an opportunity for IT services companies to partner with customers to help transform GCCs. Instead of the traditional build-operate-transfer model, a “transform-and-co-operate” approach is the likely path ahead.Generative AI is another area that is here to stay. In 2024, 20% of large companies (with revenues over $5 billion) will invest up to $50 million in generative AI, with 15%–20% earmarked for IT service providers. Success hinges on these providers’ ability to seamlessly integrate AI across all internal processes—sales, talent supply chain, marketing, finance, HR, and legal. They must also demonstrate tangible benefits from existing real estate and leverage these gains to expand their share of the wallet. Ultimately, they need to prove their impact on customers by delivering measurable results. Companies that stay ahead of the curve by at least 12 months in this domain will gain a competitive advantage.Investing in capability enhancement is equally crucial. IT services companies must proactively train theirworkforce on generative AI, with an emphasis on data and security. Besides, they must aggressively pursue acquisitions to rapidly enhance these capabilities. Alongside this, operational efficiency and pricing strategies will play a pivotal role in at least two ways. First, there will always be capabilities that are in high demand. IT services companies should price these at a premium. Second, AI-led gains will come at a cost—recovering that cost will be table stakes. Companies must push for value-based pricing (percentage of gain) beyond just cost recovery.As growth slowly returns to this sector, it's the perfect time for IT services companies to differentiate themselves. This can be achieved by helping customers with their data journey, being proactive on vendor consolidation, working with GCCs, expanding GenAI capabilities, and demonstrating how they can create value for customers. If they can deliver during tough times, it will only get better when IT services spending returns.",Sandeep Nayak and Kushal Raja are partners in Bain & Company’s New Delhi and Mumbai offices.

YouTube AI dubbing rollout

Google-owned video streaming platform YouTube has expanded its auto dubbing feature to include knowledge and information-focused content. Originally introduced at VidCon last year, the feature utilizes AI technology developed by Aloud, part of Google's Area 120 incubator. Auto dubbing automatically transcribes and translates YouTube videos between English and other languages, enabling creators to reach and engage viewers across language barriers.Announcing in a blog post, the company said “It’s now easier than ever to connect with creators and content from all over the world even if you don't speak the language, thanks to YouTube’s new auto dubbing feature. Whether you want to learn to cook authentic gratin from a French chef, sew traditional clothes from an Indian seamstress, or scout spooky spots to visit in another country, auto dubbing makes that content more accessible.”Google said “If your video is in English, it will be dubbed into French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish.” If the video is in any of those other languages, it will be dubbed into English.The company has started rolling out the new features. If it’s available for your channel, you’ll find it under ""Advanced Settings"". You can always choose to review the dubs before publishing.“Now, it's important to remember that this technology is still pretty new, and it won't always be perfect. We're working hard to make it as accurate as possible, but there might be times when the translation isn't quite right or the dubbed voice doesn’t accurately represent the original speaker,” the company said.","YouTube has expanded its auto dubbing feature to include knowledge and information-focused content.

What Google said about removing the McDonald's reviews



What is review bombing



Google has removed multiple negative reviews targeting a McDonald's restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania. This is the same outlet of the popular fast food retail chain from where a suspect involved in the killing of UnitedHealth CEO Brian Thompson was arrested. The negative reviews about this McDonald's store started appearing after 26-year-old Luigi Mangione was identified and reported to police by a customer while he was eating at the same outlet.""These reviews violate our policies and have been removed,"" a Google spokesperson said in an emailed statement to Reuters.According to the company’s policy, review contributions ""should reflect a genuine experience at a place or business.” Google also noted that any ""content that has been posted from multiple accounts to manipulate a place's rating"" will be removed.These one-star reviews were an example of ""review bombing,"" which happens when an establishment is flooded with numerous negative reviews due to a political stance or an incident unrelated to its business.For instance, one of the reviews (seen by the news agency Reuters) said, “this location has rats in the kitchen that will make you sick and your insurance isn't going to cover it.”The murder of the insurance executive seemed to have sparked a surge of frustration among Americans who have experienced denied health insurance claims or care, unexpected expenses, or rising premiums and medical costs—some trends that recent data shows are on the rise, Reuters reported.As per the report, Americans who have seen their health insurance claims or care denied, faced unexpected costs or had to pay more for premiums and medical care have surfaced after the insurance executive’s death, Recent data also shows a rise in such insurance-related trends, the report added.Last week, American insurance company UnitedHealth’s CEO Brian Thompson was shot outside a Manhattan hotel by a masked man. The suspect seemed to wait for his arrival before firing at him from behind and fled the scene riding a bike into Central Park. He was later captured on surveillance video leaving the park and taking a taxi to a bus station in northern Manhattan. Police said that he boarded a bus from there to escape the city.","Google has removed multiple negative reviews targeting a McDonald's restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania.

What does Andrew Ferguson appointment as FTC chair means for big tech companies, like Google, Facebook, and more

US President-elect Donald Trump has selected Andrew Ferguson to lead the Federal Trade Commission, marking a significant shift in the agency's regulatory approach and signaling a potential softening of antitrust enforcement against big tech companies.Ferguson, currently a Republican commissioner at the FTC, will replace Lina Khan , whose aggressive stance against corporate consolidation drew criticism from Silicon Valley.In a Truth Social post, Trump lauded Ferguson as someone with a ""proven record of standing up to Big Tech censorship"" and promised he would be ""the most America First, and pro-innovation FTC Chair in our Country's History.""A former Virginia solicitor general and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas clerk, Ferguson has previously dissented from Khan's regulatory efforts, including proposed bans on non-compete clauses and subscription cancellation rules. His appointment suggests the FTC may adopt a more business-friendly approach under Trump's administration.Despite expectations of a lighter regulatory touch, experts note that the Trump-era FTC may still pursue antitrust cases against technology giants. Previous investigations during Trump's first term resulted in significant lawsuits against companies likeGoogle , Meta, Apple , and Amazon.Trump also announced the selection of Mark Meador as an additional FTC commissioner, further reshaping the agency's leadership. The moves come as the FTC navigates complex political dynamics, balancing populist regulatory hawks like Vice President-elect JD Vance with more establishment conservative business interests.Ferguson's background includes working as an aide to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and previous roles supporting judicial confirmations. He has explicitly criticized tech platforms for perceived content censorship, aligning with Trump's rhetoric about protecting free speech.The leadership change could potentially revive merger discussions previously blocked under the Biden administration, though the extent of regulatory changes remains to be seen.Ferguson is set to take the helm of the five-member commission, which currently comprises three Democrats and two Republicans, promising a potentially transformative period for federal antitrust enforcement.","Donald Trump appoints Andrew Ferguson to lead the Federal Trade Commission.

Not a first

The United States has imposed sanctions on a Chinese cybersecurity firm, Sichuan Silence Information Technology Company, for orchestrating a large-scale cyberattack . According to a Reuters report, the attack, US officials said could have resulted in fatalities. A statement from the US Treasury Department says that the Chengdu-based company and one of its employees, Guan Tianfeng, deployed malicious software in April 2020 to compromise over 80,000 firewalls across thousands of companies globally.Guan, also known online as ""gxiaomao,"" was separately charged with conspiracy to commit computer and wire fraud in a Department of Justice indictment unveiled Tuesday. The FBI has offered a $10 million reward for information about the 30-year-old, his company, or their cyber operations.The software not only exfiltrated data but also launched ransomware attacks, crippling corporate networks by encrypting critical information. The Treasury noted that three dozen of the firewalls were part of critical infrastructure, and the attack’s potential consequences “could have caused serious injury or loss of life” if not mitigated.One targeted energy company, actively involved in oil drilling during the attack, faced risks of equipment failure. The Treasury emphasized that had the cyber intrusion succeeded, it “could have caused oil rigs to malfunction,” potentially leading to catastrophic outcomes.This isn’t the first time the company has faced allegations of malicious activity. In 2021, Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, accused Sichuan Silence of running an online influence campaign. The campaign involved a fabricated biologist claiming the US was meddling in the search for COVID-19’s origins.Ross McKerchar, Chief Information Security Officer at Sophos, a UK-based cybersecurity firm whose routers were among those targeted, described the hackers as demonstrating ""relentless determination."" Sophos previously reported that the attacks reflected “a level of commitment to malicious activity rarely seen” in its nearly 40-year history.","The U.S. has imposed sanctions on a Chinese cybersecurity firm, Sichuan Silence Information Technology Company.

These centers utilize chip-level cooling, eliminating water for cooling purposes. This initiative saves 125 million liters of water annually per center. Pilot projects are planned for Arizona and Wisconsin in 2026. The company aims to achieve near-zero Water Usage Effectiveness. This move combats rising global AI water demand.

How Microsoft is saving water

How much energy is used in an AI query

Microsoft has announced a new datacenter design that eliminates water usage for cooling, marking a significant milestone in the company's commitment to environmental sustainability. Launched in August 2024, this design utilises chip-level cooling solutions to provide precise temperature control without relying on water evaporation.While water will still be used for essential purposes like restrooms and kitchens, the new design is projected to save over 125 million liters of water per year per datacenter.“AI depends on water—and so do we. Proud that Microsoft's new datacenters will consume zero water for cooling, meaning each one will avoid using 125 million liters of water every year. Thanks to the teams paving the way for a more sustainable future,” said Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI.Microsoft measures water efficiency using Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE), which compares water consumption to energy consumption. The company has improved its WUE over the years, achieving an average of 0.30 L/kWh in the last fiscal year. With the introduction of zero-water evaporation technology, Microsoft expects to reduce its WUE to near zero for each new datacenter.This shift to a closed-loop cooling system, where water is recycled continuously, eliminates the need for a fresh water supply. While this approach may slightly increase energy consumption, Microsoft is actively developing innovations – like nuclear energy – to mitigate this impact and further reduce power usage.Pilot projects featuring the new water-free design are planned for Phoenix, Arizona, and Mt. Pleasant, Wisconsin, in 2026.According to a report released earlier this year, Microsoft's water consumption for its data centers surged to 6.4 million cubic meters in a single year, up from 4.7 million cubic meters the previous year. This coincided with a 34% increase in the company's energy consumption.By 2027, global AI demand may withdraw 4.2 to 6.6 billion cubic metres of freshwater - nearly half the amount consumed by the entire UK.",Microsoft has announced a new datacenter design that eliminates water usage for cooling.

Flipkart-owned fashion website Myntra has become the latest victim of a sophisticated refund scam that has cost the company millions of rupees. Fraudsters have exploited the company's customer-friendly refund policies to defraud the company. The multi-crore fraud came to light during the audit.The modus operandi involved placing bulk orders for high-value items like branded shoes, apparel, and accessories. Once the orders were delivered, the fraudsters would file false complaints, claiming issues like item shortages, incorrect items, or non-delivery. Myntra has an option in its app for customers to raise complaints and claim refunds. The options included shortage, colour mismatch, or not the same order. The firm would initiate the refund process after receiving complaints.The losses incurred by Myntra are substantial, with estimates suggesting that the company may have lost over Rs 50 crore nationwide. In Bengaluru alone, approximately 5,529 fraudulent orders were identified, leading to significant financial damage.Explaining the fraud, a police officer said that if a person placed an order for 10 pairs of branded shoes, after receiving the parcel, he/she would claim that the parcel had only five pairs. A refund would be claimed for the remaining five pairs of shoes that they paid for while placing the order online or paid by COD.The officer told TOI that a gang in Jaipur, Rajasthan, is involved in the fraud. Almost all the fraudulent orders were placed from Jaipur. The fraudsters gave addresses in Bengaluru and other metros for delivery. A few orders were delivered to commercial establishments such as tea stalls, tailor shops, or provision or stationery stores.In a similar case recently, cybercrime had arrested three miscreants from Surat, Gujarat, for cheating e-commerce company Meesho in the guise of suppliers and customers. They reportedly cheated Meesho to the tune of Rs 5.5 crore by placing fraudulent orders.

More exciting work happening on:

- adding Vision so it can better plan ahead

- making the gait look more natural on such rough terrain

- making it more responsive to velocity/direction commands

- learning how to fall to minimise damage when unavoidable (and stand back up)

Join us to work on fascinating reinforcement learning, imitation learning, foundation nets for robotics & more to bring Optimus to everyone fast. We’re doing it.""

“I forgot to mention that Optimus was doing this while “blindfolded”. We haven’t yet made vision part of the control loop for uneven terrain.

How the talks of plant in Karnataka started

Lenskart goes to Telangana

Eyewear startup Lenskart has chosen to set up its manufacturing facility in Telangana instead of Karnataka, citing the state's favorable policies and efficient execution. Karnataka Industries Minister MB Patil explained that the state government is careful not to offer excessive incentives, as doing so could undermine the long-term sustainability of projects. He added that some investors have requested incentives exceeding 100% of their investment, which is not a viable approach.“As custodians of taxpayers’ resources, we are committed to making prudent decisions that maximise long-term benefits for both the state and its people. Incentives by a state govt are provided only to reduce the burden on investors and increase the financial viability of the project,” Patil said in a statement to TOI.“State govt cannot and should not provide incentives more than the planned investment. These practices raise concerns on the fundamental viability of such projects,” he added.In a post on X, Patil wrote, “The govt of Karnataka and I, as a minister, have to walk a tightrope. I, as industries minister, have taken steps to create confidence and make several structural reforms to the state industries department. All industrialists are aware that our door is open for any of their concerns or expansion plans.”The industry minister's clarification came after Aarin Capital chairman TV Mohandas Pai urged Patil to intervene and save the investment that Lenskart had originally planned for Karnataka. Pai called it “another blow for Karnataka,” and urged Patil to act immediately so that “we don’t not lose this investment.”Earlier this year, Lenskart founder Peyush Bansal in a post on Twitter had asked about the availability of a 25-acre plot near the international airport in Bengaluru for his company to build its next mega factory. Minister Patil had quickly responded, offering land. This was cheered by many citizens with some even suggesting places outside of Bengaluru.The Karnataka government has drawn flak in recent years after failing to secure major manufacturing projects, including those from Ola, Ather Energy, and various semiconductor companies. In an interaction with TOI recently, Karnataka's IT minister Priyank Kharge discussed the unbalanced allocation of semiconductor opportunities across Indian states and alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi employed coercive measures to secure agreements favouring Gujarat.On Monday morning, Telangana Minister Sridhar Babu, announced the details of Lenskart investments in a post on X. The Lenskart facility, the minister said, will produce eyewear, lenses, sunglasses, as well as accessories and other products catering to India, along with exports to other markets in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. “The facility will be established at Fab City, where land has already been identified and will be handed over to the company this week. The plant will create around 2100 jobs and there are purported discussions around a R&D plant being set up. This is a testament to our policy that ensures speed and ease of business for companies.”",Lenskart has chosen to set up its manufacturing facility in Telangana instead of Karnataka.

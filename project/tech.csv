Google Maps has become an indispensable tool for millions of people worldwide, offering accurate navigation and helping users seamlessly move from one destination to another. But how does Google manage to deliver such precise routes and real-time updates? The answer lies in a sophisticated blend of data collection, artificial intelligence (AI), and real-time analysis. By leveraging a wide array of data sources—ranging from satellite imagery to GPS data from smartphones—Google Maps continuously refines its navigation capabilities to provide users with the most reliable routes and traffic updates.Beyond simple directions, Google Maps integrates features like real-time traffic alerts, weather conditions, and personalized recommendations, making it an all-encompassing navigation tool. With the integration of AI technologies such as Gemini and the continuous evolution of machine learning algorithms, Google Maps is not just helping people find the fastest route but also offering contextual information that enhances the entire travel experience.One of the foundational components of Google Maps is its use of satellite imagery. High-resolution images from satellites provide a bird’s-eye view of the world, allowing Google to map streets, landmarks, natural features, and urban developments accurately. This data is frequently updated to reflect changes such as new roads, construction zones, and infrastructure developments.In addition to satellite images, Google employs aerial photography captured from aircraft to enhance the granularity of the data. This dual approach ensures that both urban and rural areas are mapped with high accuracy. Google Maps relies heavily on GPS data from millions of smartphones worldwide. As users navigate with Google Maps, anonymized location data is transmitted back to Google, allowing the system to analyze traffic flow, vehicle speed, and road conditions in real-time. This crowdsourced data is invaluable in providing up-to-the-minute traffic updates, identifying congested areas, and suggesting alternate routes.In many urban centers, traffic cameras and sensors installed along roads provide real-time visuals and data on traffic conditions. Google integrates this data to offer users accurate traffic reports, including details about accidents, construction work, and road closures.Google’s Local Guides program plays a significant role in refining map accuracy. With over 300 million local guides contributing reviews, photos, and updates, Google Maps can offer detailed insights into businesses, landmarks, and public spaces. Additionally, users can report changes in road layouts, business openings or closings, and temporary obstructions, ensuring that the maps remain up-to-date.Artificial Intelligence has revolutionised how Google Maps processes and delivers data. By using machine learning algorithms, Google can analyze vast amounts of information from multiple sources and provide real-time updates. This AI-driven approach ensures that maps are constantly updated with the latest information, such as newly constructed roads, traffic accidents, and road hazards.In October 2024, Google introduced a transformative feature by integrating its generative AI chatbot, Gemini, into Google Maps. This feature allows users to conduct highly specific searches, such as “dog-friendly sports bars with outdoor seating and TVs”, offering a more personalized navigation experience. Gemini analyzes reviews, photos, and location data to provide tailored recommendations based on users' preferences.Google Maps now includes immersive weather updates along users' routes, enhancing the navigation experience. Users can see real-time weather forecasts, including rainfall, snow conditions, and extreme weather warnings, which help in planning safe and efficient travel. Additionally, users receive alerts about bad road conditions, flood-prone areas, and accident hotspots, ensuring they are well-informed before and during their journey.Google Maps utilises Large Language Models (LLMs) to process information from over 250 million places globally. These models allow the platform to understand user queries more effectively and deliver precise search results. Whether users are searching for nearby restaurants, gas stations, or tourist attractions, the AI models analyze data from various sources to offer relevant suggestions.For example, if a user searches for “best vegan cafes near me”, Google Maps will not only list the nearest options but also provide ratings, reviews, and photos contributed by other users, giving a comprehensive view of each location.Google Maps’ integration with Google Earth offers users a more immersive experience, allowing them to visualize locations in 3D and explore terrain features in detail. This is particularly useful for hikers, urban planners, and real estate professionals who need an in-depth view of specific areas.As AI continues to evolve, Google Maps aims to provide even more personalized navigation experiences. By analyzing user behavior, preferences, and historical data, Google Maps can suggest routes and destinations that align with individual needs. For instance, frequent commuters may receive updates on traffic patterns specific to their daily routes, while travelers might get recommendations for scenic drives or tourist attractions.Future developments will likely include enhanced safety features, such as real-time hazard detection and predictive traffic modeling. These tools can alert users to potential dangers, such as sharp turns, steep inclines, or sudden weather changes, improving overall road safety.Google Maps is also focusing on promoting sustainable transportation. The platform already offers eco-friendly routing options, which suggest routes that minimize fuel consumption and carbon emissions. Future updates may include more robust features to support electric vehicle (EV) users, such as real-time charging station availability and battery optimization routes.","Artificial Intelligence has revolutionised how Google Maps processes and delivers data.

Elon Musk and DOGE sued; the complaint says: DOGE obtaining OPM records violated ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-and-doge-sued-the-complaint-says-doge-obtaining-opm-records-violated-/articleshow/118189674.cms,"File picture (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)

What the lawsuit says



Over 100 current and former federal employees have filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), accusing them of improperly accessing sensitive personnel records without the necessary approval or security clearance. The lawsuit, which was filed on Tuesday in the Southern District of New York, was initiated by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and other privacy organizations, representing 103 workers and various government employee unions.The plaintiffs are seeking to have the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the government’s primary human resources agency, revoke access to DOGE and its affiliates.According to the lawsuit, the OPM granted DOGE and its agents ""administrative"" access to its systems, despite the agents—many of whom are under 25 and were recently employed by Musk's private companies—failing to undergo the standard national security background checks.The legal complaint names Musk, DOGE, the OPM, and OPM Director Charles Ezell as defendants. The plaintiffs argue that DOGE's access to OPM records constitutes a violation of the Privacy Act, which prohibits unauthorized access to personal information, even between federal agencies.The lawsuit asserts that OPM’s release of personnel data to DOGE was illegal, as DOGE lacked a legitimate reason to access the records, and there are no exceptions under the Privacy Act that would justify their access.Additionally, the lawsuit highlights that many of DOGE’s agents were not government employees at the time they accessed OPM’s networks, including 19-year-old DOGE employee Edward Coristine, who reportedly used the alias “Big Balls” online. Coristine was dismissed from a cybersecurity firm after an internal investigation into data leaks during his tenure.","The lawsuit was initiated by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and other privacy organizations, representing 103 workers and various government employee unions.

Elon Musk’s job offer for software engineers

Elon Musk-owned Ai company, xAI, is reportedly planning a significant expansion of its workforce this year, aiming to hire thousands of individuals to train its Grok chatbot. This move comes as xAI seeks to gain a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving AI landscape, where it faces stiff competition from established giants like OpenAI, Meta, and Google.Citing conversation with three xAI employees, Business Insider reported that xAI currently has five open job listings for data annotation roles and is seeking bilingual workers as well as specialists in legal and STEM fields.Citing internal Slack data, the company already employs over 900 data annotators, referred to as “AI tutors.” Sources indicate that hundreds of these tutors were brought on board in anticipation of the November presidential election.Data annotators, or xAI tutors as they are called, are essential to the development of large language models as they label, categorise, and contextualise raw data to train chatbots like Grok to understand and interact with the world.“Sometimes projects take months; sometimes it's only a few days and then you're getting a message from a team lead moving you to a new project.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman provided extensive insights into the future of artificial intelligence and its underlying economics in a detailed blog post released on Sunday, February 9. In his post, Altman explained that continuous and predictable gains in AI performance can be achieved by investing ""arbitrary amounts of money."" He emphasised that the intelligence of an AI model is approximately proportional to the logarithm of the resources—primarily training compute, data, and inference compute—used in its development.Altman also highlighted that user costs for accessing AI systems are expected to fall by a factor of 10 every 12 months, noting a dramatic drop in token costs from GPT-4 in early 2023 to GPT-4o in mid-2024. These observations were shared on the eve of the two-day Paris AI Action Summit, which began on February 10, where Altman is scheduled to speak on the sidelines.In his blog post, Altman noted that continuous improvements in AI performance are closely linked to the amount of resources dedicated to training and running AI models. He stated, “The intelligence of an AI model roughly equals the log of the resources used to train and run it.” This relationship implies that as long as significant investments continue in training compute, data acquisition, and inference compute, AI systems will see predictable and steady performance gains. Altman expressed confidence that there is no imminent reason for these investments to plateau, suggesting that the pace of improvement will continue as long as funding is available.Altman also addressed the economic aspect of AI usage for end users. He believes that the cost to access AI systems at a given performance level will decrease by 10 times every 12 months. This trend is evidenced by the substantial reduction in the cost per token—from the early deployment of GPT-4 in 2023 to the rollout of GPT-4o in mid-2024, where prices dropped by approximately 150 times. Such reductions are expected to spur broader adoption of AI systems, making advanced AI capabilities more accessible across various industries and applications.The blog post comes in the wake of competitive pressures in the AI industry, notably following the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup. DeepSeek claims to have developed a cutting-edge AI model at a fraction of the cost incurred by its U.S. rivals. This development has not only rattled global markets but also sent shock waves across the tech industry, highlighting the intense competition in AI innovation and cost-efficiency.In addition to its operational strategies, OpenAI is reportedly in discussions to raise up to $40 billion in a new funding round. Meanwhile, significant corporate investments have been pledged by companies such as Microsoft, Nvidia, Arm, Oracle, and Softbank. Collectively, these partners have committed approximately $500 billion over the next four years to develop AI infrastructure in the United States, including data centers, energy plants, and power lines. This massive influx of capital underscores the industry's confidence in the transformative potential of AI and its long-term economic impact.Addressing the ongoing debate between open-source and closed AI models, Altman acknowledged the need to provide users with greater control over technology. He noted, “Many of us expect to need to give people more control over the technology than we have historically, including open-sourcing more, and accept that there is a balance between safety and individual empowerment that will require trade-offs.” This perspective comes as OpenAI rethinks its open-source strategy in light of the growing popularity of open-source reasoning models like DeepSeek’s R1, which have challenged conventional closed systems.Altman discussed the concept of artificial general intelligence (AGI), describing it as a system capable of solving complex problems across various domains at or above human-level performance. While he believes that AGI-level systems are on the near horizon, some experts contend that such capabilities may still be a decade away. Altman envisions a future where AGI is deployed on a massive scale, with millions of AI agents operating across all fields of knowledge work. He also opined on the potential economic effects, suggesting that while the cost of many goods will eventually fall dramatically due to lower intelligence and energy costs, the price of luxury items and inherently limited resources like land may rise significantly.Altman touched upon the need for early intervention to prevent an imbalance of power between capital and labor as AI systems become more integrated into society. He warned that some decisions and limitations related to AGI safety, which may prove unpopular, could become necessary. Additionally, Altman expressed concerns about the potential use of AI for mass surveillance by authoritarian governments, emphasizing the critical need to ensure that the benefits of AGI are broadly and equitably distributed.In a clarifying footnote, Altman stated that his views on AGI do not affect OpenAI’s long-term relationship with Microsoft. Despite differences in internal definitions—Microsoft reportedly defines AGI as an AI system that generates at least $100 billion in profits—the partnership remains strong. Microsoft has invested over $13 billion in OpenAI over the years, and Altman reiterated, “We fully expect to be partnered with Microsoft for the long term,” underscoring the strategic alliance between the two companies.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman explains how AI intelligence scales with resources.

Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath want you to know this about SEBI’s new circular on API usage and algorithmic trading,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamath-want-you-to-know-this-about-sebis-new-circular-on-api-usage-and-algorithmic-trading/articleshow/118020989.cms,"Take a look at the post here



“The SEBI circular on

API usage

and algo trading is out. What you need to know:

If you’re a retail trader using broker APIs to automate trades, you can do so as long as your order frequency is below an exchange-prescribed threshold. This limit is yet to be decided.

If you’re selling algos or strategies to other traders, you’ll need to partner with a broker and get yourself registered with the exchanges to do so.

Marketplaces, where people share algos for a fee, can’t publish strategies without exchange registration as well as an RA license.

The exchanges will publish their own circulars with operational details by April 1.”

SEBI's latest ALGO trading rules | The Daily Brief #163

What SEBI’s new algo trading rules say



Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India 's (SEBI) new rules. In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Kamath explained SEBI ’s new regulations concerning algorithmic trading for retail investors, a move that significantly alters market participation. Kamath highlighted that retail traders selling trading strategies or algorithms must now partner with a broker and register with stock exchanges. Furthermore, platforms facilitating the sharing of algorithms for a fee will need both exchange registration and a research analyst (RA) licence.In the X post, Kamath wrote:In the comment section of the post, he also shared the link to an article which explains the latest SEBI algo trading regulations in details.SEBI’s newly announced framework will allow retail investors to engage in algo trading—an opportunity previously limited to institutional players. The move comes in response to rising demand from retail participants and aims to strike a balance between accessibility and risk management.Under the updated regulations, brokers must secure exchange approval for each algorithm and ensure that all automated orders include a unique identifier for audit tracking. Any modifications to an approved algorithm will also require regulatory clearance. Retail investors developing their algorithms will only need to register them if their order execution frequency exceeds a specified threshold.SEBI has categorised algorithms into two types: “white box” algos, where the logic is transparent and replicable, and “black box” algos, which operate without disclosure. Providers of black box algos will be required to obtain a Research Analyst (RA) license and maintain detailed research documentation.Set to take effect on August 1, these new rules are expected to transform India’s algo trading landscape—expanding automation for retail traders while introducing stricter compliance measures to uphold market integrity .","Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India's new rules.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it

Akash Bobba , a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). Bobba, along with five other young engineers, was hired by Musk to modernise government systems, raising concerns about their lack of government experience and the potential security risks involved.Bobba, a graduate of UC Berkeley's elite Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (MET) program, has quickly risen through the ranks of Silicon Valley , securing internships at Meta, Palantir, and Bridgewater Associates.Known for his problem-solving skills, Bobba once rewrote an entire project overnight after a teammate accidentally deleted it just before a deadline. His former classmate Charis Zhang recalled the incident.“Let me tell you something about Akash. During a project at Berkeley, I accidentally deleted our entire codebase 2 days before the deadline. I panicked. Akash just stared at the screen, shrugged, and rewrote everything from scratch in one night—better than before. We submitted early and got first in the class. Many such stories. I trust him with everything I own,” wrote Zhang in a social media post.Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate. Critics argue that granting individuals with limited government experience access to sensitive government systems poses significant security risks. The hiring strategy has also raised questions about the competence and oversight within Musk's DOGE initiative. Reports suggest that at least four of the new DOGE hires, including Bobba, now have top-tier access to federal IT systems.Bobba isn't the only new face in Musk's government overhaul. The five other members of the DOGE team comprise a mix of recent graduates, college students, and former SpaceX interns, all of whom now have official government emails and top-level security clearances.","Akash Bobba, a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE) Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate.

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.

Asmita Patel accused of re-routing money

Securities & Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has seized Rs 53.67 crore from Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd along with five other entities. Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd is a well-known stock market training institute that offers online courses on stocks and trading. Some of the popular courses offered by the self-proclaimed ""options queen"" and ""She Wolf of Stock Market"" are ""Let's Make India Trade"" (LMIT), ""Master's in Price Action Trading"" (MPAT), and ""Options Multiplier"" (OM) .Jayesh Thakkar, a SEBI Registered Research Analyst shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) stating “SEBI has seized Rs 53.67 crore that Asmita Patel and five other related entities made illegally. Asmita Patel is also at risk of losing another Rs 104.6 crore it collected from course fees, which SEBI believes were part of unregistered advisory services.”The investigation was initiated by SEBI after receiving complaints from 42 participants of these courses. In addition to impounding the Rs 53.67 crore, SEBI has issued a show-cause notice questioning why Rs 104.6 crore, collected as fees for various programs, should not also be seized.SEBI has sent an interim order directing the school, Asmita Jitesh Patel, and Jitesh Jethalal Patel to cease offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services. The entities have also been barred from accessing the securities market.The order also uncovered that fees collected from participants were routed through entities such as King Traders (proprietor: Sagar Dhanjibhai), Gemini Enterprise (proprietor: Suresh Parmashivam), and United Enterprises (proprietor: Jigar Rameshbhai Dawada). SEBI stated that this was a regular practice and not an isolated incident, making all six entities jointly and severally liable for the Rs 53.67 crore earned from course fees.The regulator further demanded that the notices explain why they should not be ordered to disgorge Rs 104.6 crore, along with interest. SEBI's order noted that the fees collected for LMIT, MPAT, and OM courses, as well as other programs provided by the school, were earned under the guise of unregistered advisory and research analyst services.The order reads, “The aforesaid amount includes not only the amount collected as fees by the Noticees for LMIT, MPAT and Options Multiplier (OM) courses but also includes the fees collected by the Noticees for the other courses offered by the Noticee no.1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading )through which it carried out unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services along with interest”.Kamlesh Varshney, SEBI's Whole-Time Member, highlighted in the order “Examination revealed that, prima facie, the Noticee no. 1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading) along with the Noticee no.2 (Asmita Jitesh Patel) and the Notice no.3 (Jitesh Jethalal Patel) devised a scheme wherein students/investors/participants were lured to trade in specific stocks and told to open trading account with ABC Ltd.

Microsoft has faced warnings on China ties



Multiple employees at DeepSeek, the Chinese AI chatbot company that triggered a massive selloff in US tech stocks last month, reportedly previously worked at Microsoft’s controversial artificial intelligence labs in China. According to a report in the New York Post, at least four current DeepSeek employees, including a key department chief, honed their skills at Microsoft Research Asia . The report cites public profiles on GitHub and LinkedIn.Microsoft Research Asia, comprising labs in Beijing and Shanghai, has faced increasing political pressure in Washington, with executives reportedly debating the future of the facilities. Among the DeepSeek employees with Microsoft ties is a researcher who spent six years as a research intern in the lab’s “natural language computing group.” This researcher, along with others, is reported to be listed as a “core contributor” to the research paper detailing DeepSeek’s R1 reasoning model, the technology that fueled last month’s market upheaval.While Microsoft confirmed the connections, it downplayed the significance of the training, stating, “Anyone who thinks that a handful of former Microsoft interns were the secret of DeepSeek’s recent success doesn’t understand what DeepSeek has accomplished.” The company added that it requires confidentiality and IP transfer agreements from its China-based employees and interns.However, the long tenures of some of these internships – three of the four employees spent at least five years in the program – have raised eyebrows. “If you’re working for Microsoft for five years at any other job, that’s enough time to climb into a mid-senior or senior position,” told Geoffrey Cain, policy director at the Tech Integrity Project, told the New York Post.Critics have reportedly long alleged that Microsoft’s Chinese labs are vulnerable to intellectual property theft and talent poaching. Reports have surfaced of internal debates at Microsoft regarding the future of the labs. The New York Times reported in January 2024 that Microsoft has held internal debates for years on whether to shutter or relocate its AI labs in China. Among the key concerns is that top researchers could leave the company to join Chinese companies with ties to the CCP, or even that China could hack the company's labs.Microsoft has dismissed claims of plans to shut down its labs, even though it previously encouraged some China-based employees to explore relocation to other countries. Meanwhile, lawmakers have cautioned Microsoft about its close collaboration with China on AI development. Notably, there is no evidence suggesting any misconduct by DeepSeek employees connected to Microsoft.","Microsoft Research Asia, comprising labs in Beijing and Shanghai, has faced increasing political pressure in Washington, with executives reportedly debating the future of the facilities.

Schmidt on AI regulation by Europe

Eric Schmidt , former Google CEO , has cautioned Western nations about the need to invest in open-source artificial intelligence models, warning they risk falling behind China in the global AI race, a report has said.“If we don’t do something about that, China will ultimately become the open-source leader and the rest of the world will become closed-source,” Schmidt told the Financial Times, while pointing out that most leading US LLMs, including Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, and OpenAI's GPT-4, are closed (not freely accessible), with Meta's Llama being a notable exception.He emphasised that neglecting open-source technologies could hinder scientific progress in Western universities, which might struggle to afford expensive closed models.His warning follows the recent launch of DeepSeek's R1, an open AI large language model developed in China with impressive efficiency, surpassing some US competitors like OpenAI.Schmidt also commented on OpenAI CEO Sam Altman ’s comment on being on the “wrong side of history” regarding open-source models, signaling that the company might need to shift away from its reliance on costly closed models.“I think [Altman] was a bit too hasty,” commented Schmidt, arguing that the future of AI leadership will depend on effectively integrating both open- and closed-source models.Notably, US tech giants like Google and Amazon have heavily invested in closed models, betting that this approach will maximise returns on their substantial investments. Notably, Facebook-parent Meta has been the only major tech company that has made its Llama AI models open source.Schmidt made these remarks at the AI Action Summit in Paris, where US Vice President JD Vance criticised EU regulation on AI technology, saying that “excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry.”“Europe’s got to get its act together. The application layer is profoundly powerful, and it will make your Europe more efficient,” Schmidt said.","Eric Schmidt warns Western nations about need to invest in open-source AI.

What ChatGPT users should do



A cybercriminal has reportedly put 20 million OpenAI user login credentials and samples of the stolen data up for sale. The hacker known as ""emirking"" has issued a statement that claims that the cybercriminal may have found a way to bypass the platform's authentication systems, potentially by exploiting a vulnerability or obtaining administrator credentials. This raises concerns about the security of OpenAI user accounts.In the statement, (translated from Russian by Malwarebytes), the hacker said: ““When I realized that OpenAI might have to verify accounts in bulk, I understood that my password wouldn’t stay hidden. I have more than 20 million access codes to OpenAI accounts. If you want, you can contact me—this is a treasure.”According to a report by Malwarebytes, such a large number of credentials may not have been harvested solely through phishing attacks on users. However, If the hacker's claim is accurate, Emirking may have discovered a way to compromise the auth0.openai.com subdomain, either by exploiting a vulnerability or by obtaining administrator credentials. However, OpenAI has to yet to officially address the hacker’s claims.Stolen OpenAI credentials could potentially allow cyber criminals to access sensitive user information, leading to targeted phishing campaigns and financial fraud. Additionally, the credentials could be used to exploit the OpenAI API , forcing victims to pay for unauthorized usage of premium features. However, some users on the dark web forum where the credentials were shared have claimed that they do not provide access to ChatGPT conversation history.Users are advised to change their passwords, enable multi-factor authentication and monitor their accounts for any suspicious activity. It is also important to be vigilant against phishing attempts that may leverage stolen information.BreachForums, the dark web platform where the credentials were reportedly offered, is currently offline, preventing immediate verification of the claims. However, users can also utilise online tools like Malwarebyte’s Digital Footprint scan to check for exposed personal data.","A cybercriminal has reportedly put 20 million OpenAI user login credentials and samples of the stolen data up for sale.

Why did they tell me to remove this opinion? Well, according to them, the reason is that I acknowledged that Grok 3... exists.

I wish I was joking. I'm not. That's the reason -- the fact that I wrote ""Grok 3 (TBD)"" is grounds for being fired.

But wait, hasn't Grok 3 been officially acknowledged by xAI? Yes. Yes it has.

He further pointed out the absurdity of the situation, noting that both xAI and Musk had publicly discussed Grok 3's development on numerous occasions, even sharing official posts about the model.De Kraker expressed disappointment that a company ostensibly championing free speech would take such action against an employee for a clearly labeled opinion.“It's very disappointing to me that a company and leaders who supposedly champion free speech and openness would try to fire a low-level employee over a clearly-labeled opinion that contains absolutely nothing controversial, but here we are,” he said.Despite his frustration, De Kraker wished xAI and Musk well, praising the team he worked with. He mentioned a specific feature of Grok he worked on, expressing hope for its success, but declined to provide details, citing “actual confidential information.”","An AI engineer at Elon Musk-owned xAI has resigned after he was asked to delete a post he says contained a “harmless personal opinion”, on X (formerly Twitter) Benjamin De Kraker said he was given an ultimatum: delete the tweet or be fired.

Mukesh Ambani’s vision for Jio Coin and blockchain technology



Earning JioCoins with JioSphere browser activities



JioCoins: Potential redemption options



Impact of Jio and Polygon collaboration on India’s blockchain landscape

Also Read |

Jio Coin, a digital token recently unveiled by Reliance Jio , remains somewhat enigmatic. While opinions on its nature undoubtedly abound, any proclamation at this juncture, be it attached to the expectations of a cryptocurrency-the likes of Bitcoin-or other untried instruments-presently stands uncorroborated within the business-world credit manual. Rather more in the realm of loyalty reward systems, the company has yet to divulge anything about how Jio itself will operate in its ecosystem or even whether it takes any fit to incorporate existing blockchain technologies. This whole endeavor of Jio has generated much interest, leading to curiosity and some anticipation amongst many about Jio Coin's forthcoming prospects.Designed by Reliance Jio, JioCoin generated a lot of buzz but does not resemble the classic definition of a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. JioCoin is being billed as a form of digital currency and seems to be more about some kind of a digital reward or points system than being a well decentralized, blockchain-powered currency concerned. So, JioCoin may well have an incentive-slanted approach and an internal ecosystem currency function, rather than functioning like a decentralized currency similar to bitcoin.As of now, Jio Coin's official price has not been announced, but business analysts estimate that it might start at a token price of approximately $0.50 (Rs 43.30). One of the most important determinants of JioCoin value will be how well it integrates within Reliance Jio's larger ecosystem, such as popular services like JioMart, Reliance petrol stations, and more, among others. Mukesh Ambani said that JioCoin is an attempt to push blockchain-based technology to a wider audience. With nearly 450 million users, the Jio presence could make this digital currency a leading player within India, expectedly aiding the increased adoption of Web3 technology in the country.JioCoin probably followed with the entry of several Indians into blockchain and decentralization technologies, improving ease of access to Web3- potential mainstreaming.JioCoins are digital tokens that reside on the Polygon blockchain. Users earn them when they use various apps mobile and internet-based, enabled through Jio's JioSphere browser. Users will earn JioCoins simply by signing in with their numbers and surfing Jio's ecosystem. They will be credited to their Polygon wallet because such activity takes place.This rewards system encourages Jio users to be active in the Jio ecosystem, getting Web3 tokens simply through use of the JioSphere browser. On the other hand, rather unclear seem to be the ways of redeeming or using these tokens for its users. It would be interesting to see different things Reliance Jio is going to explore in future uses for JioCoins, such as redemption for reward through discounts, purchases, further linking to other services within the Jio ecosystem.There are many theories as to how Reliance Jio might allow users to redeem their JioCoins. Some people believe that tokens function as an internal currency for all his services, which will integrate those brands into a coherent rewards system. Others believe that Jio may take a more conventional route and set up a JioCoin for real things, discounts, or services.If JioCoin catches ground and has a larger user base to add, then potentially the JioSphere browser could otherwise compete to be one of the better-known browsers such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox as it attracts users into earning digital tokens through their actions online.Jio and Polygon together make a loud and clear noise to enhance the credibility of Polygon as a blockchain network in India. Because Jio has numerous users all over India, this collaboration has enormous potential to bring in millions into using the Polygon network, which will further increase consumer interest in blockchain technology.It could also make other consumer giants like Airtel or Vodafone Idea in future consider integrating with Polygon or other blockchain networks. This deal is a significant milestone security-wise for Polygon, as it opens up valuable opportunities tapping into Jio's consumer base, which is supposed to lead to real widespread adoption of blockchain technology.","Reliance Jio unveiled Jio Coin, a digital token recently unveiled by the company. JioCoin is being billed as a form of digital currency and seems to be more about some kind of a digital reward or points system. Users earn them when they use various apps mobile and internet-based, enabled through Jio's JioSphere browser.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118177377,imgsize-30072,width-400,resizemode-4/118177377.jpg"

Infosy has terminated approximately 400 trainees at its Mysore campus after they failed to clear mandatory internal assessments, leaving many stranded and emotional as they were asked to immediately vacate the premises.The mass termination, which took place on February 7, affected trainees who had waited two and a half years to join the company after receiving their offer letters in 2022, MoneyControl reported.""This is cruelty, it is a big company, trainees fear speaking the truth,"" a terminated trainee told MoneyControl on condition of anonymity.The company defended its actions in a statement to PTI, saying, ""All freshers get three attempts to clear the assessment, failing which they will not be able to continue with the organisation.” This is also mentioned in their contract, and the process has been in existence for over two decades, says the company.The terminations were carried out systematically, with groups of 50 trainees called in with their laptops starting at 9:30 AM. Security personnel and bouncers were present during the proceedings, sources revealed.One particularly emotional scene unfolded when a female trainee from Madhya Pradesh pleaded with officials, ""Please let me stay the night.

In a move that has drawn widespread attention from both the public and the tech community, Apple has updated its digital maps by renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America . According to reports, this change was implemented on Tuesday after an official order by President Donald Trump was confirmed by the U.S. Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). The renaming reflects an ongoing effort to align digital mapping data with government directives, following a similar announcement by other major tech companies. With Apple making the update promptly, users around the world will now see the revised name on their devices. This article provides an in-depth analysis of the background, implementation, and implications of the change across various digital platforms.The renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America originates from a directive issued by President Donald Trump shortly after taking office. The order targeted the body of water bordered by the Southern United States, Mexico, and Cuba. The U.S. Geographic Names Information System later formalized the change, updating the official records late on Sunday. This directive has since prompted major digital map providers to adjust their geographic data in accordance with the updated government listing. The process underscores the significant influence that official government orders can have on digital infrastructure and mapping services used by millions of people daily.After assuming office, President Trump ordered that the water body traditionally known as the Gulf of Mexico be renamed to better reflect geopolitical perspectives. This order was subsequently made official when the U.S. Geographic Names Information System updated its records late Sunday. The GNIS update served as the formal basis for digital map providers to implement the new nomenclature across their platforms. By adhering to the GNIS update, companies ensure that their mapping data remains accurate and consistent with official U.S. government standards.Apple acted swiftly on the official update by renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its mapping service. As of Tuesday, users accessing Apple Maps can see the updated nomenclature. This change demonstrates Apple’s commitment to maintaining current and government-compliant geographic information in its products. By updating its maps in response to the GNIS directive, Apple aligns its digital services with official records, ensuring that users receive accurate and up-to-date geographic information.Google announced last month that it would implement the renaming once the official GNIS listing was updated. In a blog post released on Sunday, Google explained its approach to the change: users in the United States will see the name Gulf of America, whereas users in Mexico will continue to see the name Gulf of Mexico. For users in other parts of the world, both names will be displayed. This regional differentiation ensures that the mapping service respects local naming conventions while remaining consistent with the updated official data. Google’s method highlights the complexities involved in implementing geographic changes across a diverse, global user base.In addition to Apple and Google, Microsoft has also updated its Bing maps to reflect the new nomenclature. Following the official GNIS update, Microsoft modified its mapping data so that users accessing Bing maps now see the renamed Gulf of America. This coordinated response among major tech companies illustrates how quickly digital mapping platforms can adapt to official government orders and maintain consistency across their services.",Apple has updated its digital maps by renaming Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America.

Why Suchir’s parents are objecting

Suchir Balaji ’s parents have reportedly filed a lawsuit demanding the San Francisco Police Department to release investigation records related to their son’s mysterious death. The former researcher at ChatGPT-maker OpenAI was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on November 26 last year. Since then, the family has increasingly questioned the circumstances of Balaji’s death, despite San Francisco’s medical examiner and police department maintaining that he died by suicide.Balaji’s parents – Balaji Ramamurthy and Poornima Rao have accused the police of unlawfully withholding public records. The lawsuit, filed in a county court, alleges that the San Francisco Police Department is ""illegally shielding public records"" pertaining to the circumstances of Balaji's death, reports American Military News.In their lawsuit, Balaji’s parents have urged a judge to compel officials to release police reports detailing the discovery of their son’s body on November 26 in his Lower Haight apartment. Their attorneys, Joseph Goethals and Kevin Rooney, challenged the police department’s justification for withholding the documents. They argued that the police appear to be treating the case as if it has already been closed.“In the two-plus months since their son’s passing, Petitioners and their counsel have been stymied at every turn as they have sought more information about the cause of and circumstances surrounding Suchir’s tragic death,” the lawsuit said. “This petition, they hope, is the beginning of the end of that obstruction.”The San Francisco Medical Examiner determined that Balaji’s death was likely a suicide, though the official autopsy results are still pending due to ongoing toxicology tests. San Francisco police stated that their initial investigation found ""no evidence of foul play."" Meanwhile, an independent medical examination concluded that Balaji died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, but court documents highlighted that the shooting pattern was described as “atypical and uncommon in suicides.”","Balaji Ramamurthy and Poornima Rao have accused the police of unlawfully withholding public records.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg: I was almost sentenced to death in Pakistan; but then I was really not that worried because...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebook-founder-mark-zuckerberg-i-was-almost-sentenced-to-death-in-pakistan-but-then-i-was-really-not-that-worried-because-/articleshow/118164955.cms,"Watch the video here:

Facebook-parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said that he was “almost sentenced to death for blasphemy in Pakistan"". At a Joe Rogan podcast , Zuckerberg raised concerns about the ongoing legal challenges his company faces in Pakistan due to a lawsuit over alleged blasphemous content on Facebook According to reports, the lawsuit accuses Facebook of hosting content that violates Pakistan's strict blasphemy laws, which impose severe penalties for acts considered offensive to religious beliefs. Zuckerberg discussed the situation, emphasizing Meta’s commitment to balancing free expression with respect for local regulations and cultural values.“There are laws in different countries that we disagree with. For example, there was a point at which someone was trying to get me sentenced to death in Pakistan because someone on Facebook had a picture where they had a drawing of Prophet Mohammed, and someone said, 'That's blasphemy in our culture.' They sued me and opened this criminal proceeding,” he stated“I don't know exactly where it went because I'm just not planning to go to Pakistan, so I was not that worried about it,” Zuckerberg added.During the podcast, he also highlighted the increasing pressure on tech companies from stricter content regulation. He said “The point is, there are places around the world that just have different values that go against our free expression values and want us to crack down and ban way more stuff than I think a lot of people would believe would be the right thing to do. To have those governments be able to exert the power of saying they're going to throw you in prison - that's a lot of force. I think this is one of the things that the US government is probably going to need to help defend the American tech companies for abroad.”"," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was “almost sentenced to death for blasphemy in Pakistan’ At a Joe Rogan podcast, Zuckerberg raised concerns about the ongoing legal challenges his company faces in Pakistan.

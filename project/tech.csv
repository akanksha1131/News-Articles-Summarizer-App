Samsung plans big for India's AC market; to launch over a dozen models with 'connected features' and more,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/samsung-plans-big-for-indias-ac-market-to-launch-over-a-dozen-models-with-connected-features-and-more/articleshow/116691907.cms,"Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to come with Galaxy AI features

After a record-breaking summer for air conditioner sales in India, Samsung India is set to relaunch its residential AC business with a focus on premium, smart features. The company plans to introduce over a dozen inverter AC models in its 2025 lineup within the next few weeks, expanding its offerings to 15-16 SKUs, according to industry sources.These new room air conditioners (RACs) will incorporate Samsung's Bespoke AI solutions , targeting consumers seeking high-end ACs with advanced features. This move marks Samsung's return to a market where it once held a significant position, boasting over 15% market share in 2014-15 before shifting focus to other product categories like mobile phones and smart TVs.The Indian appliance market is currently experiencing a trend of premiumization, with consumers increasingly willing to pay more for energy-efficient and connected devices. Samsung aims to capitalize on this trend, projecting double-digit volume growth in its RAC segment in 2025. While Samsung sold approximately half a million units in 2024, holding a low single-digit market share, the company anticipates achieving a double-digit share with its new Bespoke AI-powered lineup in the highly competitive Indian RAC market.The Indian RAC market, estimated at around 11 million units, is dominated by established players like Voltas, LG, Daikin, BlueStar, Hitachi-Johnson, Panasonic, and Lloyd. The industry saw exceptional sales growth of 30-40% in May and June due to a severe heatwave. Factors such as rising temperatures, urbanization, and increasing incomes are driving demand for ACs in India. The market is also evolving with the availability of more energy-efficient models and increased domestic manufacturing of components.While an email to Samsung India for comment went unanswered at the time of reporting, the company's re-entry into the RAC market signals a renewed focus on this growing segment.","Samsung India is set to relaunch its residential AC business with a focus on premium, smart features.

Amazon sets this 'China condition' for sellers on its website in the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-sets-this-china-condition-for-sellers-on-its-website-in-the-us/articleshow/116691161.cms,"'Punishment' for sellers not following

Sellers Caught in the Middle

Amazon denies

Chinese sellers are reportedly caught in the crossfire as Amazon fights to maintain dominance in the ecommerce market in the United States (US). According to a report in South China Post, ""Amazon.com has asked some Chinese cross-border merchants to stop offering goods at a cheaper price on rival platform Temu ."" The report added that the local office of Amazon recently informed the managers of some top-selling Chinese brands that they should not list identical items at a lower price on Temu.Adding fuel to the fire, Anker, a popular brand on Amazon, recently removed its listings from Temu's US marketplace. This move fueled speculation that Amazon pressured Anker to prioritize its platform. However, Temu maintains its commitment to ""fair and open competition"" and said that it believes offering products across platforms benefits consumers with more choices and better deals.Temu is owned by Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings . The ecommerce website has gained popularity rapidly since its launch in the year 2022. Its aggressive pricing strategy is said to be attracting US consumers and threatening Amazon's market share. Temu was the world’s third-most-visited online marketplace after Amazon and Alibaba Group Holding’s AliExpress, according to November data from Similarweb.Sellers who violate this rule risk losing their placement in Amazon's coveted Featured Offer program, which gives products prime real estate on product pages. A Featured Offer, also known as the Buy Box, is prominently displayed at the top of an Amazon product page, alongside the “Add to Cart” and “Buy Now” buttons, making it easier for customers to purchase the featured item rather than the same product sold by other merchants.Recently, Amazon launched Haul, an app section that sells goods priced under $20 aimed to take on competition from the likes of Temu and Shein.Previously, Amazon excluded Temu from its price comparison system, potentially due to concerns about counterfeit products on the platform. However, with Temu's growing success, Amazon seems to be changing tactics.This situation puts Chinese sellers in a difficult position. They need to balance lower prices on Temu's platform, favored by the algorithm, with maintaining good standing on Amazon, crucial for reaching a wider audience. Some sellers are resorting to changing product pictures on Temu to avoid detection by Amazon.An Amazon representative denied the report and said that “sellers decide their selling strategy and set their own product prices in the Amazon store, and Amazon does not ask them to set certain prices.”","Chinese sellers are reportedly caught in the crossfire as Amazon fights to maintain dominance in the ecommerce market in the United States (US) According to a report in South China Post, ""Amazon.com has asked some Chinese cross-border merchants to stop offering goods at a cheaper price on rival platform Temu.""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116691149,imgsize-72614,width-400,resizemode-4/116691149.jpg"

“Same. Let builders build in America. Where you are born doesn’t matter, where you choose to build does. We need to keep attracting the top talent to continue to grow our economy,”

Russia is increasingly turning to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for international payments as it seeks to navigate Western sanctions and reduce its reliance on the US dollar, a report has said. The changes come after sanctions were imposed on Russia after its war with Ukraine hampered trade with China and Turkey.Citing Russia’s finance minister Anton Siluanov, news agency Reuters reported that the companies in the country have begun using digital currencies in foreign trade following recent legislative changes that legalised their use.Russia legalised the use of cryptocurrencies in foreign trade and has taken steps to regulate cryptocurrency mining. Russia is a major player in Bitcoin mining, and Siluanov highlighted that Bitcoin mined within Russia is already being used for international payments.“As part of the experimental regime, it is possible to use bitcoins, which we had mined here in Russia (in foreign trade transactions ),” Siluanov told Russia 24 television channel.“Such transactions are already occurring. We believe they should be expanded and developed further. I am confident this will happen next year,” he said, adding that international payments in digital currencies represent the future.Earlier this year, Siluanov urged the public to stay away from crypto investment.“Some people see cryptocurrency as a source of quick money. I don’t recommend it as a means of investment,” the minister statedEarlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin criticised the US for using the dollar as a political weapon, arguing that this has undermined its role as the global reserve currency and driven countries to seek alternative assets like Bitcoin.","Russia legalised the use of cryptocurrencies in foreign trade and has taken steps to regulate cryptocurrency mining.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

NPCI issues an advisory about 'online scams' that Indians are losing crores to,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/npci-warns-phonepe-gpay-and-other-upi-users-about-scam-that-indians-are-losing-crores-to/articleshow/116352174.cms,"What NPCI advisory says

What is digital arrest scam



How to identify a digital arrest scam

Unexpected Contact from ‘Officials’: Be cautious if someone claims to be from government agencies like the police, CBI, income tax officers, or customs agents, contacts you. Be cautious especially if they claim urgent legal action is being initiated or warranted. They might allege that you or one of your family members is involved in a serious crime like money laundering, tax evasion, or drug trafficking.

Fear-based language and urgency: Scammers may request video calls, disguising themselves in police uniforms, using government logos, or creating official-sounding background noise to appear legitimate. They often threaten arrest or immediate legal action, demanding a quick response and using legal terms to sound convincing. In some cases, they create a police station-like set up to further convince victims of their credibility.

Request for sensitive information or payment: Scammers may ask for personal information or demand large sums of money, promising that this will clear up your involvement in the alleged crime. They may also coerce you to transfer money to their account until the investigation is complete. Terms like “clearing your name”, “assisting with the investigation”, or “refundable security deposit/escrow account” might be used by them to persuade you into transferring money to specified bank accounts or UPI IDs.

Tips to stay safe

Pause and Verify: If you receive unexpected calls or messages about legal issues, take a moment to verify. Stay calm, as scammers rely on fear and urgency. Real government and law enforcement agencies will never ask for money or investigate cases through phone or video calls. Always confirm the caller’s identity and consult trusted sources before taking any action.

Use Support Channels: Report suspicious numbers to the national cybercrime helpline by dialing 1930 or the Department of Telecommunication (https://sancharsaathi.gov.in/sfc/).

The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‘Digital Arrest’ scam in the country. As digital payments, including UPI, gain widespread adoption, incidents of online scams have risen significantly. Indians, as mentioned by PM Modi in one of the episodes of Mann ki Baat have lost Rs 120.3 crore through digital arrest scam s. In its advisory, the NPCI highlights the critical need for awareness and vigilance to protect against such fraudulent activities as India advances towards a digital-first economy.In a press release, NPCI says “Digital payments are now accessible nationwide, driving India towards a digital-first economy. They offer both security and convenience. However, it's crucial to use digital payments safely and avoid online scams. Early identification of potential scams helps protect you and your loved ones, fostering a safer, less-cash economy, for everyone.”The 'Digital Arrest' scam is a type of online fraud where cybercriminals trick individuals into believing they are under investigation or at risk of arrest by law enforcement or financial authorities. Scammers often impersonate government officials, police officers, or financial regulators and use fear tactics to manipulate victims into divulging sensitive information or transferring money. Some of the common tactics used in the scam include fake calls or messages, threat of arrest and demand for payment.As per NPCI, you can identify a digital arrest scam by keeping an eye for the following","The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‘Digital Arrest’ scam in the country.

Planning a New Year's Eve party at an Airbnb? Think again. The company is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season. This technology uses machine learning to identify and block risky bookings, focusing on factors like trip length, booking timing, and distance from the guest's location. While implemented worldwide, the technology will specifically target the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Puerto Rico, Spain and New Zealand. Last New Year's Eve, Airbnb blocked 74,000 such bookings.High-risk bookings will be blocked or redirected to alternative accommodations. Short holiday getaways (one to three nights) in entire homes will also be restricted, and guests booking entire homes will be required to agree to a ""mandatory anti-party attestation."" ""If a booking is identified as higher risk, the guest will either be blocked from booking, or redirected to alternative accommodations on the platform,"" the company said.Guests will also be required to accept mandatory anti-party attestation. ""Guests who can make reservations will need to confirm that they understand that disruptive and unauthorized parties are not allowed on Airbnb, and they face suspension or removal from the platform if they violate this policy,"" said the company.Airbnb also has a 'Neighborhood Support Line' for local communities to report urgent issues, like a party in progress, at a home they believe is listed on Airbnb.Airbnb's efforts to curb disruptive parties started in 2019 with a ban on ""party houses,"" followed by stricter measures in 2020 due to the pandemic. In 2022, the company permanently banned large parties worldwide following several violent incidents at Airbnb rentals, including a shooting in Pittsburgh that resulted in two deaths and eight injuries.","Airbnb is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season.

There was a system malfunction with our network equipment today, but it has now been resolved.

As of now, flights for tomorrow, December 27th, are scheduled to operate as normal.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused.

No customer data leaked

Japan Airlines (JAL) has restored its systems and resumed ticket sales after a cyberattack disrupted domestic and international flights earlier on Thursday (December 26).The attack, which began at 7.24 am local time, affected both internal and external systems, prompting JAL to temporarily shut down a malfunctioning router and suspend ticket sales for flights departing on Thursday.JAL assured that no customer information was compromised and that the company suffered no damage from computer viruses. ANA Holdings, Japan's other major airline, reported no impact on its systems from the cyberattack.As per news agency Reuters, the disruption led to delays of more than 24 domestic flights, with delays exceeding 30 minutes each.While Japanese authorities investigated the incident, local media suggested that the disruption could be due to a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, where networks are overwhelmed by concentrated data traffic from multiple sources.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi directed the transport ministry to expedite system restoration efforts and ensure proper accommodation for affected passengers.Earlier in the day, television footage showed crowds of stranded travelers at Tokyo's Haneda airport. The disruption coincided with the start of Japan's New Year holiday season, which is the country's peak travel period.This incident comes on the heels of a technical glitch that grounded all American Airlines flights for an hour on Christmas Eve, disrupting travel for thousands of passengers.","Japan Airlines (JAL) has restored its systems and resumed ticket sales after a cyberattack disrupted domestic and international flights earlier on Thursday.

Improvements in the increase in mobile internet speed



The usage of the internet continues to grow rapidly across the globe, with mobile internet playing a central role in this digital revolution. However, there remains a clear disparity in internet speeds between countries, with nations in the Middle East and Asia leading the way. While countries like the UAE and Qatar set benchmarks for fast internet speeds, large nations such as the U.S. and India still face challenges in achieving high-speed mobile internet, primarily due to infrastructure limitations and regional differences. Despite these challenges, the overall trend points towards improved internet speeds and connectivity, which will likely continue to fuel global digital transformation.As of October 2024, 5.52 billion people are using the internet, up by 151 million people in a year, and this trend keeps growing. The contribution of the internet to current life cannot be underestimated since it changes communication, business, and access to information. Mobile internet has grown fast, connecting over half of the world population with smartphones. With the speeds of mobile internet improving continually, there is always the case of disparity in terms of quality connection, where some countries lead the speed and others trail with slower speeds. This continues to form global economies and societies.According to the Speedtest Global Index, countries in the Middle East and Asia generally have the fastest mobile internet speeds. For example, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) leads the global rankings, with mobile internet speeds increasing nearly 100 times in the nation's capital, Dubai. The UAE has made considerable investments in digital infrastructure since 2012, helping it become a global leader in internet speeds.The UAE comes on top, with the fastest mobile internet in the world. Continuously investing in the country's digital infrastructure, especially in places such as Dubai, allows this country to achieve good speed. It is propelled into the ranks by their leading-edge 5G networks and more up-to-date technologies.Qatar is located in the Middle East and ranks second. It has invested heavily in the telecom network, ensuring good high-speed internet, especially with the implementation of 5G services, providing robust mobile connectivity.Kuwait comes third, and the impressive speed has to do much with its being one of the first in the advanced mobile technology era and its further expansion into 4G and 5G, ensuring the internet is accessible speedily and stably for users.Bulgaria ranks among the top-performing European nations. This is because there are affordable high-speed broadband and mobile services, sustained by a competitive telecom market.Denmark ranks fifth with high-speed internet driven by substantial investments in infrastructure and one of the best 5G networks in Europe, enhancing mobile data speeds for users.South Korea was one of the top in mobile technology, having long dominated internet rankings. With widespread usage of 5G networks across the country, the use of mobile internet speeds increases, placing it among the top globally, in telecom infrastructure.It comes in right below South Korea, which is based on good mobile network services and wide adoption of 5G. This is one of the most connected countries in Europe that offers fast and reliable mobile data.The country has fast mobile internet speeds with high-quality 4G and 5G networks supporting a highly tech-savvy population that requires fast internet both for personal and professional reasons.One of the largest economies in the world, China has rapidly expanded its 5G networks. It still faces challenges in rural areas but does not have any issue with speed in urban areas and remains a key player in the global mobile internet space.Luxembourg completes the top 10 list by providing fast mobile internet. The country has a small size but it enjoys well-developed mobile infrastructure and rapid adoption of advanced technology, thus permitting high-speed mobile connections.India is the world's second largest online market after China, with more than 900 million internet users, while the internet penetration in the country is low at above 50% global average. India ranks 25th globally for mobile internet speeds as of November 2024, the Speedtest Global Index states. The country's median download speed stands at 100.78 Mbps, the upload at 9.08 Mbps, and latency at 30 ms. Even though Indian internet speeds have increased, they are still yet to close the gap on many of the high-income countries-both in infrastructure-related challenges as well as India's overall digital divide.This means the internet, in particular via mobile phones, has been able to connect many people in the world. Mobile Internet usage is a far bigger growth rate factor in enhancing global internet penetration. It is even interesting that nowadays mobile internet has been one of the major access enablers because more and more users rely on smart phones and mobile devices for web access.Indeed, the fast growth in the rate at which people use the mobile internet has led to rapid rises in average speeds for mobile internet connections due to almost half of world inhabitants using mobile internet online with over 58 percent of world's population or more so approximately 4.7 billion people, with well above 2.1 billion additional mobile internet users between 2015 and 2023, by the GSMA.Other than the growing number of internet users, mobile internet speeds have also grown. According to DataReportal, average global download speeds for mobile users have increased by nearly 30% from the previous year, now at 55.8 Mbps. Improvement in mobile internet speed would indicate both mobile internet infrastructure development and high-speed mobile data networks' increasing availability.However, even with this, there is still a ""digital divide"". Some countries are lagging behind in internet speed and unreliability; while other regions in some countries cannot even install digital infrastructure. Other countries, however, have come along in leaps and bounds, boasting speeds of mobile internet that far exceed the average globally.","The UAE comes on top, with the fastest mobile internet in the world.

With agency inputs

In a move seen as a potential relaxation of internet restrictions, Iran has lifted its ban on popular messaging platform WhatsApp and app store Google Play, according to state media reports.The decision follows a meeting of top government officials and comes after a period of limited access to these platforms for many Iranian citizens. WhatsApp and Google Play were previously inaccessible for Iranian users.The reasons behind the government's decision to lift the ban remain unclear. However, it is seen as a potential step towards greater internet freedom within the country. Iran has a history of restricting access to social media platforms and other online services, citing security concerns.""A positive majority vote has been reached to lift limitations on access to some popular foreign platforms such as WhatsApp and Google Play"", Iran's official IRNA news agency said on Tuesday, referring to a meeting on the matter headed by President Masoud Pezeshkian.""Today the first step in removing internet limitations... has been taken,"" IRNA cited Iran's Minister of Information and Communications Technology Sattar Hashemi as saying.The long-term implications of this decision are also uncertain. It's unclear whether the lifted bans are permanent or temporary. Additionally, it remains to be seen if the government will impose any restrictions on how these platforms can be used within the country.","Iran has lifted its ban on popular messaging platform WhatsApp and app store Google Play, according to state media reports.

How AI chatbots’ ‘biggest problem’ is helping scientists in healthcare,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-ai-chatbots-biggest-problem-is-helping-scientists-in-healthcare/articleshow/116655289.cms,"AI hallucinations speed up hypotheses

While the general consensus on AI “hallucinations” – the generation of plausible but false information – are concerning, scientists are increasingly recognising their potential for driving innovation and discovery, report has said, adding that these unexpected outputs from AI models are proving surprisingly useful in fields ranging from medicine to climate science.According to a report in The New York Times, AI hallucinations, or inaccurate or misleading outputs can spark new ideas and accelerate the scientific process. AI hallucinations arise when generative models are trained on a specific subject and then allowed to rework that information, sometimes producing unexpected and even surreal results.“The public thinks it's all bad. But it's actually giving scientists new ideas. It's giving them the chance to explore ideas they might not have thought about otherwise,” Amy McGovern, a computer scientist and director of a federal AI institute, was quoted as saying.According to the scientists, this ‘creative aspect’ of AI is proving valuable particularly in the early stages of scientific discovery , where hunches and guesswork often play a crucial role. AI hallucinations can speed up the process of generating and testing hypotheses, leading to faster breakthroughs.James J. Collins, an MIT professor, recently praised AI hallucinations for accelerating his research into novel antibiotics.“We're exploring. We're asking the models to come up with completely new molecules,” he said.The impact of AI hallucinations is evident in the work of Nobel laureate David Baker, who shared the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research on proteins. Baker credited AI hallucinations with helping his lab design millions of brand-new proteins not found in nature, leading to numerous patents and the founding of over 20 biotech companies .","AI hallucinations arise when generative models are trained on a specific subject and then allowed to rework that information, sometimes producing unexpected and even surreal results.

As post on Uber charging different from iPhone and Android users go viral; company clarifies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/as-post-on-uber-charging-different-from-iphone-and-android-users-go-viral-company-clarifies/articleshow/116652498.cms,"Read the LinkedIn post here



A colleague recently booked an Uber ride on two different phones simultaneously, from the same pick-up point to the same drop-off point. 🚗📱

He wanted to improve his chances of getting a ride during peak hours.

- On Android, the fare was ₹290.79.

- On iPhone, the fare was ₹342.47.

What’s going on here?

This isn’t a glitch—it’s design thinking in action, driven by data and user insights:

1️⃣ User Behaviour: iPhone users are often perceived as “premium customers”—data shows they’re more willing to pay higher prices.

2️⃣ Platform Fees: Apple charges up to 30% commission on in-app purchases, subtly influencing pricing decisions.

3️⃣ Dynamic Personalisation: Apps increasingly use

dynamic pricing

based on user behaviour and profiles. Your choice of device could impact what you’re charged.

Here’s the real question:

When does personalisation improve user experience, and when does it start to feel exploitative?

From a design thinking perspective, this approach is rooted in understanding user behaviour and adapting to it.

For businesses, it’s smart—leveraging data to optimise value.

For users, it’s complicated—does this pricing strategy enhance the experience, or does it break trust?

What we found out in our testing

What Uber has to say

A recent social media post alleging that Uber charges different fares for rides booked on iPhones and Android devices has started an online debate. The post, which quickly went viral, showed screenshots of two phones displaying significantly different fares for the same ride. The post ignited speculation among users, with many questioning whether Uber's pricing algorithm discriminates based on the type of device used.Nirali Parekh shared her colleague's experience of booking an Uber in a LinkedIn post. In the post, she highlighted the significant price difference for the same trip when booked using an Android smartphone versus an iPhone.The same post was shared by the Uber user on X (formerly known as Twitter). “Same pickup point, destination & time but 2 different phones get 2 different rates. It happens with me as I always get higher rates on my Uber as compared to my daughter’s phone. So most of the time, I request her to book my Uber. Does this happen with you also? What is the hack?,” posted Sudhir on X.To investigate these claims, TOI Tech conducted its own tests. We booked multiple Uber rides using various devices, including budget-friendly Android phones and premium Apple iPhones. However, we did not observe any significant price variations across different devices or locations.Uber quickly responded to the allegations, stating that the observed fare differences were not due to the type of phone used. ""Hi there, multiple differences in these two rides impact the prices. The pick-up point, ETA, and drop-off point on these requests vary, which will cause different fares. Uber does not personalize trip pricing based on a rider's cell phone manufacturer,"" the company explained.","A recent social media post alleging that Uber charges different fares for rides booked on iPhones and Android devices has started an online debate.

It is now educating citizens about common types of fraud calls and provide clear instructions on how to report them.In a separate post on X, the DoT said that fraudsters can also make fake calls by posing as employees from LIC, IRDAI, Income Tax Department or banks. In such cases, people should file a police complaint, call 1930 and report the incident on Sanchar Saathi portal .Recently, the DoT ordered telecom operators like Reliance Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea to play cybercrime awareness messages 8-10 times per day for the next three months. These pre-call announcements, provided by the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C), aim to educate people about common scams, such as the ""digital arrest"" scam where fraudsters impersonate authorities to extort money.This initiative comes in response to the increasing sophistication of cybercrime in the country and the government is working with telcos to block international calls that are ""spoofed"" to appear as local numbers, a tactic often used in scams.","The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is making people aware about fake calls and how to combat the rising tide of fraudulent communications.

"""Crock of bullsh*t"": Namita Thapar counters Narayana Murthy's call for longer work hours",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/crock-of-bullsht-namita-thapar-counters-narayana-murthys-call-for-longer-work-hours/articleshow/116651232.cms,"Namita Thapar slams Narayana Murthy's long work hours advice



Anupam Mittal's perspective on Narayana Murthy’s long working hours philosophy



Narayana Murthy's call for longer work hours: Catalyst for the debate



A broader conversation: Work culture in transition



The debate over India's work culture and the suggestion of a 70-hour workweek has sparked significant discussion across the country. Two prominent figures from Shark Tank India , Namita Thapar and Anupam Mittal , recently shared conflicting perspectives on this topic during an interview with Humans of Bombay. Their contrasting views have fueled ongoing conversations about the balance between productivity, success, and well-being in the modern workforce.Namita Thapar, CEO of Emcure Pharmaceuticals, strongly opposed Mittal's stance, labeling his argument a ""crock of bullsh*t."" She argued that the expectations for founders and regular employees differ significantly, especially when financial stakes are involved.""For founders and high stakeholders, who make tons of money — go for it. Work 24 hours a day forever!"" Thapar said. However, she stressed that expecting the same commitment from employees is unreasonable. She highlighted the disparity in financial incentives, citing her own experience: ""When Emcure went public, it was valued at $3 billion, and my family owns 80 percent of it. Obviously, we could work 20 hours a day, which is what we all do. But the employee? My accountant, for instance, doesn’t share the same financial upside.""Thapar raised concerns about the physical and mental health implications of extended work hours, particularly for employees who lack the same financial motivation as business owners. She emphasized the importance of maintaining a balanced schedule for overall well-being and long-term productivity.Anupam Mittal, founder and CEO of Shaadi.com, argued that success cannot be measured by the number of hours worked. Reflecting on his own experience working 16-hour days during his early career in the U.S., Mittal emphasized that dedication and focused effort outweigh mere time spent on tasks.""I think it's a big lie being told to this generation,"" Mittal remarked, challenging the notion that longer hours equate to greater achievements. He advocated for prioritizing work-life ""harmony"" instead of adhering to rigid time commitments. According to Mittal, young professionals should be prepared to push themselves early in their careers but also recognize the importance of creating a sustainable balance.Highlighting the hybrid work model implemented at his company, Mittal revealed a 30% increase in productivity. He credited this approach for fostering both efficiency and flexibility, enabling employees to deliver better results without overextending themselves.The debate was reignited by recent comments from Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy, who suggested that India’s youth should commit to longer work hours to boost productivity and global competitiveness. He cited historical examples from Japan and Germany, where extended work weeks played a role in post-war economic recovery.Murthy's call for a return to a six-day workweek and extended hours drew both support and criticism. Proponents view it as a necessary step to enhance India's economic output, while detractors argue it disregards the importance of work-life balance and employee well-being.The exchange between Thapar and Mittal underscores the complexity of India's evolving work culture. While both acknowledge the need for change, their views highlight differing approaches to achieving productivity and fostering professional growth.Thapar champions the idea of reasonable work limits for employees to avoid burnout and prioritize health. On the other hand, Mittal believes that extraordinary success requires dedication and effort, regardless of fixed hours.The conversation also reflects a larger trend in global work culture, as organizations grapple with finding the right balance between flexibility, efficiency, and employee satisfaction.Also read | Airtel recharge plans","The debate over India's work culture and the suggestion of a 70-hour workweek has sparked significant discussion across the country.

In 2010, Shashi Kumar, a Bengaluru-born tech professional, made a transformative decision that would bridge the gap between technology and agriculture. After a successful 17-year career in the technology sector, including 13 years at Wipro Technologies, Kumar chose to leave behind his thriving career to pursue a mission close to his heart: revolutionizing the agricultural sector and uplifting rural communities. Co-founding Akshayakalpa Organic , India’s first certified organic dairy enterprise, Kumar aimed to empower marginalized farmers and foster sustainable agriculture . This initiative reflects his commitment to creating lasting social impact through innovation and entrepreneurship.Shashi Kumar’s journey began with an impressive academic and professional foundation. After earning a degree in computer science from Bengaluru University, he pursued a Master’s in Telecommunication Engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago. His career trajectory in the technology sector was remarkable, but his upbringing in a farming family planted the seeds for a deeper calling.Having witnessed the struggles of small farmers firsthand, Kumar carried a desire to make agriculture more viable. Despite his father’s warnings about the challenges of farming, Kumar felt a responsibility to address systemic issues such as low profitability and unsustainable practices. This realization culminated in the creation of Akshayakalpa Organic, a venture combining his technological expertise and passion for sustainable farming.Established with the vision of improving India’s dairy farming landscape, Akshayakalpa Organic is centered on empowering farmers and fostering rural entrepreneurship. The company helps farmers transition to organic practices by offering technical support, financial assistance, and access to markets.One of the unique aspects of Akshayakalpa is its focus on creating self-sustaining farming ecosystems. For example:These practices not only enhance productivity but also contribute to environmental sustainability.With a target turnover of Rs 400 crore in the current fiscal year, Akshayakalpa’s success has attracted the support of the Rainmatter Foundation, a nonprofit initiative by Zerodha founders Nithin and Nikhil Kamath. This partnership underscores the scalability of Akshayakalpa’s model, which aligns with the foundation’s mission to foster sustainable and impactful businesses.A core objective of Akshayakalpa Organic is to uplift farmers economically and socially. By collaborating with young farmers disillusioned with traditional agriculture, the company trains them to become independent entrepreneurs. According to the Rainmatter Foundation, farmers associated with Akshayakalpa earn an average monthly income of Rs 1,00,000 through diverse products like organic milk, poultry, honey, bananas, and millets.This consistent income shields farmers from challenges such as market volatility, dependence on middlemen, and unpredictable weather conditions. Beyond individual empowerment, Akshayakalpa’s model promotes community development by creating local employment opportunities and supporting sustainable farming practices.Akshayakalpa Organic has expanded its offerings to include a variety of organic products such as milk, fruits, vegetables, poultry, and honey. These products cater to the growing demand for healthier, eco-friendly alternatives in urban markets.Looking ahead, the company envisions becoming a pan-India brand, reaching new markets and influencing agricultural practices nationwide. Its success demonstrates the potential of combining innovation with sustainability to address long-standing challenges in Indian agriculture.","Akshayakalpa Organic is India’s first certified organic dairy enterprise.

Apple VP Eddy Cue junks this biggest ‘Google rumour’ about the company with these three reasons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-vp-eddy-cue-junks-this-biggest-google-rumour-about-the-company-with-these-three-reasons/articleshow/116651095.cms,"What Cue said about Apple's search engine

“Apple is focused on other growth areas. The development of a search engine would require diverting both capital investment and employees because creating a search engine would cost billions of dollars and take many years.”



“Search is rapidly evolving due to recent and ongoing developments in Artificial Intelligence. That makes it economically risky to devote the huge resources that would be required to create a search engine.”



“A viable search engine would require building a platform to sell targeted advertising, which is not a core business of Apple. Apple does not have the volume of specialised professionals and significant operational infrastructure needed to build and run a successful search advertising business. Although Apple does have some niche advertising, such as on the App Store platform, search advertising is different and outside of Apple’s core expertise. Building a search advertising business would also need to be balanced against Apple’s long standing privacy commitments.”



Apple is developing search to take on Google. This rumour has been going on for years. Apple's Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue has reportedly junked these. As part of its ongoing case against Google's dominance in the search industry , the Department of Justice (DoJ) is focusing on the agreement between Apple and Google, in which Google serves as the default search engine on iPhones. In a recent court filing (seen by the news agency Reuters), Cue explained why the iPhone maker has chosen not to develop its own search engine, a move that would directly challenge Google's position. This statement is said to be a key piece of evidence in the DOJ's investigation.Cue outlined several key reasons why creating a search engine is not a feasible path for Apple. His statement directly contradicts the court's belief that the proposed remedies would push Apple to compete with Google's dominance in the search industry. Here are the three reasons:Apart from this, Apple has also requested to participate in the upcoming antitrust trial against Google . The trial centers on Google's dominance in online search, and Apple's involvement signals its concern over the potential impact on its lucrative partnership with the search giant.In another filing, Apple wrote: “Google can no longer adequately represent Apple’s interests: Google must now defend against a broad effort to break up its business units.”","Apple's Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue has reportedly junked rumours of the iPhone maker developing its own search engine.

In a recent interview with LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky , Jassy emphasized that while many career factors are beyond control, attitude remains firmly within one's grasp.""I think people would be surprised how infrequently people have great attitudes,"" said Jassy, who has led the tech giant since Jeff Bezos stepped down in 2021. He noted that enthusiasm helps attract mentors and advocates, as ""people want to be around positive people.""However, Jassy cautioned that optimism alone isn't enough. Young professionals must back their positive outlook with concrete actions, including following through on commitments and maintaining a strong work ethic.The CEO, who joined Amazon as a marketing manager in 1997 and went on to launch Amazon Web Services , also stressed the importance of continuous learning throughout one's career. He warned against the complacency that can set in at senior levels, stating, ""The second you think you know it all is the second you're really starting to unwind.""Drawing from his own background, Jassy revealed that his early focus on competitive sports, including soccer and tennis, may have contributed to his business success. This aligns with research on Ivy League alumni showing that students who were heavily involved in athletics tend to achieve more senior positions and higher salaries in business careers than their non-athletic peers.Before joining Amazon, Jassy explored careers in sportscasting and music management. He ultimately helped build AWS into a crucial profit center that generated $13.5 billion of Amazon's $22.9 billion operating income by 2020, positioning him as Bezos's successor.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says that an ""embarrassing amount"" of early career success depends on maintaining a positive attitude.

Dropcam (2009 – 2024)



Google Podcasts (2018 – 2024)



Keen (2020 – 2024)



In 2024, Google once again made headlines by discontinuing several products and services. Known for its vast ecosystem of tools and platforms, Google has always embraced an experimental approach, regularly launching new projects while also sunsetting those that fail to meet its evolving strategic goals or user expectations. This year was no exception, as Google said goodbye to offerings that had carved out unique niches but ultimately fell short of the tech giant’s ambitions. From Jamboard to the Chromecast , 2024 saw the end of products that, despite their promise, could not sustain relevance in an ever-competitive market. Here’s a list of products that Google killed in 2024Introduced in 2017, Jamboard was a digital 4K touchscreen whiteboard designed to facilitate real-time collaboration, integrating seamlessly with Google Workspace services. Despite its innovative approach to enhancing team interactions, Google decided to discontinue Jamboard in 2024, citing a strategic shift towards software-based solutions that offer greater flexibility and accessibility across diverse devices.Launched in 2013, Chromecast revolutionized media streaming by allowing users to cast content from their devices directly to their televisions. Over its 11-year lifespan, Chromecast sold over 100 million units, becoming a staple in many households. However, in August 2024, Google announced the discontinuation of the Chromecast line, signaling a move towards more integrated smart TV solutions and advanced streaming devicesAs part of its Google One subscription service, Google introduced a virtual private network (VPN) in 2020, offering users enhanced online privacy by encrypting internet traffic and masking IP addresses. Despite the growing emphasis on online security, the service experienced low adoption rates. Consequently, Google shut down VPN by Google One in June 2024, redirecting resources to other security initiatives.Dropcam, a pioneer in Wi-Fi-enabled security cameras, was acquired by Google in 2014. It allowed users to monitor their homes remotely via live video feeds. In April 2024, Google ended support for Dropcam and Dropcam Pro, encouraging users to transition to the more advanced Nest Cam lineup, which offers enhanced features and better integration with the Google ecosystem.Google Podcasts was launched in 2018 as a platform for discovering and listening to podcasts. Despite amassing over 500 million downloads, the app faced criticism for lacking features compared to competitors. In June 2024, Google announced the discontinuation of Google Podcasts, urging users to migrate to YouTube Music, which now includes podcast support.Keen, introduced in 2020, was an experimental project from Google's Area 120 incubator, aiming to rival Pinterest by allowing users to curate content based on their interests. Despite its unique approach to content discovery, Keen struggled to gain a substantial user base and was shut down in March 2024.The discontinuation of these products reflects Google's dynamic approach to its product lineup, continually reassessing and realigning its offerings to focus on areas with greater user engagement and strategic importance. While the end of these services may disappoint some users, it underscores Google's commitment to innovation and adaptability in the ever-evolving tech landscape.","Google announced the discontinuation of several products and services in 2024.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐨𝐟 𝐒𝐡𝐢𝐯𝐚 𝐒𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐚𝐫

Last night, after wrapping up my work at 3 AM, I ordered my food through Zomato. As the doorbell rang, I stood up to open it. There he was, Shiva Sarkar, the delivery executive, with a warm smile despite the biting cold outside.

But there was something in his eyes. A heaviness, a story untold.

I invited him in, offered him some water, and gently asked if he was okay. What followed left me deeply shaken.

Shiva, barely 20-21 years old, broke down in tears as he shared his story. He had to drop out of school after 8th grade when his father passed away. The weight of responsibility forced him to take up this job to support his family.

His dreams of education, of a carefree youth, were replaced by long nights and the heavy burden of ensuring his sisters could be married next year. I sat there, in awe of his strength. This young man, who should be chasing his aspirations, is instead running against the clock to make ends meet, with a determination that can only be admired.

As we chatted, I couldn't help but think, how many more Shivas are out there? Young boys and girls sacrificing their education, their dreams, their potential, just to keep their families afloat.

Shiva left with a smile and a “Thank you.” But I was left with a storm of emotions. What could we do for them? Could Zomato, a platform so impactful, introduce upskilling programs, scholarships or easy loans for these unsung heroes?

What if these delivery executives could dream again? Could learn skills that open doors to brighter futures while earning a living?

Deepinder Goyal, I love the Zomato app, but can we do more? Can we, as a society, step up for these individuals who quietly carry the weight of the world on their young shoulders?

I have some plans in mind for him and will do my best to help him wherever I can.

P.S. I took his photo with his consent, and he’s fully supportive of any assistance provided.

How Zomato responded

Zomato delivery executive Shiva Sarkar's heartwarming encounter with a Delhi resident has gone viral on the internet. Shiva, a determined young man in his early twenties, caught the attention of Himanshu Bohra , a Delhi-based professional, who shared a post on LinkedIn, sharing his inspiring story. In the post, Bohra writes that despite facing the immense challenge of losing his father, Shiva works tirelessly to support his family. He also tagged Zomato and its CEO Deepinder Goyal seeking ways as to how society can help individuals like him.He writes “Deepinder Goyal, I love the Zomato app, but can we do more?

This looks quite inspirational, and we are proud of our delivery universe.” Adding further, the company said “If possible, kindly help us with the order ID via a private message so that we can express your appreciation to our delivery partner.”","Zomato delivery executive Shiva Sarkar's heartwarming encounter with a Delhi resident has gone viral on the internet.

What happens when Starbase comes into existence



Elon Musk is moving forward with plans to create a dedicated town for SpaceX and its employees in Texas. SpaceX staff have submitted a petition to establish a new municipality named Starbase in coastal South Texas, home to the company’s rocket launch facilities. A SpaceX security manager is expected to serve as the town’s first mayor.Over the years, Musk has shifted his operations from California to Texas, developing facilities across several counties. Musk has been envisioning the Starbase town for years, but recently progress accelerated as SpaceX employees started moving into nearby homes and temporary housing near the launch site.According to a report by the New York Times, residents working for SpaceX filed an official petition with Cameron County to hold an election on incorporation this month. The document (seen by NYT) reveals initial plans for the city. If this city comes into existence, Musk will create history by doing something that no other company or business leader has ever done.The Starbase plan remained stalled for years, partly due to Texas laws requiring a minimum number of residents and majority voter support to establish a new municipality. However, SpaceX employees have started settling into refurbished homes and temporary housing near the company's rocket launch site, the report claims.This month, these residents took a step toward creating a new city by filing a petition with Cameron County to hold an election, revealing initial details about Elon Musk's vision for the proposed municipality.If approved, the election would allow voters to select three city officials, including Gunnar Milburn, SpaceX's security manager, as the proposed first mayor. The petition outlines a community of roughly 500 residents, including 219 primary residents and over 100 children, located near Boca Chica Beach at the end of State Highway 4. Covering about 1.5 square miles, the proposed town is small by Texas standards. Most residents are renters and work for SpaceX.However, the petition does not mention why Musk and SpaceX employees are pursuing the creation of Starbase or what benefits they aim to achieve. The proposed town could establish its own police or fire departments or enact its ordinances.Apart from this, Musk may also be looking into the possibility of housing employees in a development outside the town of Bastrop, near Austin. The area is home to a growing campus for Musk companies, including a manufacturing plant for SpaceX; the headquarters of the Boring Company, which is creating tunnelling technology; and, soon, offices for the social media platform X (earlier Twitter).","Residents working for SpaceX filed an official petition with Cameron County to hold an election on incorporation this month.

Scam stories: 'Baap of Chart' and Trafiksol ITS Technologies

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has halted trading in Bharat Global Developers ' shares following concerns over an unusual price surge. The suspension comes in response to a complaint filed on December 16, accompanied by social media posts questioning the company’s financial transparency. The complaint pointed to an extraordinary rise in the company’s share price, which skyrocketed 105 times between November 2023 and November 2024.The price jumped from Rs 51.43 per share on December 26, 2023, to Rs 1,236.45 per share by December 23, 2024, a massive increase of 2,304%. The suspension once again highlights dangers of investing in stocks without strong fundamentals. This comes close on heels of SEBI imposing a fine of Rs 19 lakh on Sai Proficient Research Investment Advisory and its proprietor for regulatory violations, including misleading investors with false promises of returns.As Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath too recently warned investors about prevalent stock market scams, citing two recent SEBI orders involving Trafiksol ITS Technologies IPO and ""Baap of Chart."" In a long post on X, formerly Twitter, and a blog post. In the blog, Kamath emphasized that seeking quick profits is a recipe for losing money.Kamath highlighted two distinct scams: One involving an SME IPO that raised Rs 44 crore to purchase software from a shell company with fabricated financials and a bogus client list, and another involving a financial influencer (""finfluencer"") who amassed Rs 17 crore by selling courses and seminars. He reiterated the adage, ""if something is too good to be true, it almost always is.""Zerodha's blog post elaborated on these cases. The first involved an IPO where funds were supposedly earmarked for software acquisition from a vendor that turned out to be a shell company incapable of delivering the promised software. Despite this, the IPO was oversubscribed 345 times. The post outlined three key takeaways from SEBI's order: the vendor's lack of operational capability, fabricated financials and a fake client list, and a suspicious vendor selection process. SEBI had previously halted the Trafiksol ITS Technologies SME IPO pending investigation and subsequently ordered the company to refund investors.The second case involved ""Baap of Chart,"" a finfluencer who promised high returns and ran an unauthorized investment advisory service, collecting significant sums from investors. SEBI's investigation revealed that he was not providing free advice but rather operating an unregistered advisory service. SEBI subsequently barred Nasiruddin Ansari and his associates from the securities market and ordered them to refund investors.Kamath has consistently addressed such fraudulent activities. He recently warned about the potential dangers of AI-driven scams, referencing a case where a Bengaluru techie lost ₹91 lakh in an online stock market scam.

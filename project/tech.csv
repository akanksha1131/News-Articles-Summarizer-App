Chairman Bill Ford reportedly expressed confidence that Elon Musk ’s relationship with President-elect Donald Trump will not negatively impact traditional automakers like Ford. In an interaction with the media on the sidelines of a product announcement at the Detroit Auto Show , Ford emphasized that Trump has developed a better understanding of the automotive sector compared to his first term in office.Incidentally, Trump had a fraught relationship with Detroit carmakers during his first term, and the companies often sparred with the president over labor, trade, tariffs and regulations.Ford explained that Trump reached out to him last week to discuss various key issues facing the auto industry, such as tariffs and the importance of maintaining a robust manufacturing base in the United States. According to Ford, Trump’s understanding of the industry has evolved since his initial years in office, noting that it took some “education” to help Trump grasp the complexities of the sector during his first term.Despite the close ties between Trump and Musk, CEO of electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc., Ford is not concerned that this alliance will harm legacy automakers. Ford stressed that both Tesla and traditional automakers like Ford are aligned on many important issues, including the future of manufacturing and the overall direction of the automotive industry.Ford said that considering Trump has his number, ""I feel very confident that, going forward, Ford will have a voice, and a seat at the table.""Talking about Chinese competition on electric vehicles , Ford said, ""It's not matching the technology. It's not matching how the vehicles are put together. It's really not even matching the battery itself. But it really is the affordability to the customer that becomes, sort of the crucible, whether this is going to succeed or not. We're working really hard on that.""","Ford Motor Co.

The Walt Disney Co., Fox Corp. , and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. have abandoned their plans to launch a joint sports streaming service, Venu Sports , just days after reaching a settlement in a lawsuit that challenged the venture's potential anti-competitive impact.The companies announced the discontinuation of Venu Sports in a joint statement, citing the ""ever-changing marketplace"" and a desire to ""meet the evolving demands of sports fans by focusing on existing products and distribution channels."" They also expressed gratitude to the Venu staff and pledged support during the transition.“After careful consideration, we have collectively agreed to discontinue the Venu Sports joint venture and not launch the streaming service,” the companies said in a statement. “In an ever-changing marketplace, we determined that it was best to meet the evolving demands of sports fans by focusing on existing products and distribution channels. We are proud of the work that has been done on Venu to date and grateful to the Venu staff, whom we will support through this transition period,” the statement added.The decision follows a legal challenge initiated by FuboTV Inc. , a sports-focused streaming service, which argued that Venu Sports would stifle competition and harm consumers. FuboTV contended that the joint venture would exclude them from carrying certain key sports channels, potentially forcing them out of business, and would ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) also signaled its intention to scrutinize the project for potential antitrust violations.The concept for Venu Sports emerged last year as the three media giants sought to combine their valuable sports content into a single streaming package, targeting viewers who desired access to live sports without traditional cable subscriptions. The proposed service immediately drew opposition, culminating in FuboTV's lawsuit.Despite this settlement, other industry players continued to express concerns. EchoStar Corp. and pay-TV provider DirecTV Inc. submitted a letter to Judge Garnett, arguing that Disney's agreement with FuboTV did not fully address the underlying anti-competitive issues posed by the Venu Sports concept.The abandonment of Venu Sports comes as live sports remains a highly lucrative sector of the television industry. With the ongoing trend of cord-cutting, media companies are actively reassessing how to package and distribute sports content to reach audiences.","Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. announced the discontinuation of Venu Sports in a joint statement.

The documents also allege that CEO Mark Zuckerberg was aware of and approved the use of the pirated materials for AI training .The revelations emerge from the ongoing Kadrey et al. v. Meta Platforms lawsuit, filed in July 2023 by authors Richard Kadrey , Christopher Golden, and comedian Sarah Silverman. While Meta previously acknowledged using Books3, a dataset of approximately 196,000 books, for training its Llama language model, the company had not publicly disclosed its direct use of LibGen data.Meta maintains that its use of publicly available materials for AI training is protected under the ""fair use"" doctrine. The company argues that the plaintiffs were aware of LibGen's use since July 2024 and had ample time to include this information in their earlier complaints.The case could have far-reaching implications for AI development, potentially setting precedents for how technology companies can legally use creative works in AI training. LibGen, established in Russia around 2008, has faced previous legal challenges, including a $30 million judgment against it in September 2024.Judge Chhabria warned Meta against future excessive redaction requests, stating that any unreasonably broad sealing requests would result in all materials being unsealed.","Meta used Library Genesis, a notorious pirated book database, to train its artificial intelligence models.

What Assam police said about the incident



“It was a tea garden area, which was shown in Assam on Google Maps. However, it was actually inside Nagaland. The team went inside Nagaland in pursuit of the criminal due to confusion and misleading guidance on GPS. Of the 16 personnel, only three were in uniform and the rest were in civil dress. This also led to confusion among the locals. They also attacked the team and one of our personnel was injured. The locals then realised that it was a genuine police team from Assam and released five members, including the injured person. They, however, held the remaining 11 persons as captives overnight. They were released in the morning and reached Jorhat later.”

Past incidents involving Google Maps



Google Maps misled a 16-member team of Assam Police resulting in their detention by locals in Nagaland, a report said. According to news agency PTI, Assam Police said that a team from Jorhat district was following Google Maps directions during a raid to arrest a suspect when they mistakenly crossed into the Mokokchung district in Nagaland.Locals, believing the officers to be criminals, held them captive overnight. The Jorhat police contacted authorities in Mokokchung, who then rescued the Assam police team.In a statement to PTI, a senior official of Assam Police said:Last year, multiple incidents were reported, claiming that Google Maps led some users into accidents.In December 2023, a family from Bihar travelling to Goa ended up in a forest area in Khanapur taluk of Karnataka's Belagavi district reportedly after relying on Google Maps for directions.In another incident in November 2023, three people lost their lives in Uttar Pradesh's Bareilly after their car, allegedly misled by Google Maps, drove off an under-construction bridge into the Ramganga River. The victims, unaware of the incomplete flyover ahead, continued driving until their vehicle plunged into the river.","Google Maps misled a 16-member team of Assam Police resulting in their detention by locals in Nagaland.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Musk served on Trump's transition team and was expected to take on an advisory role. Meloni stated that Musk is often seen negatively for supporting what some consider the ""wrong"" side. ""Musk is labeled a 'Monster' simply for supporting what some consider as the 'wrong' side,"" she said.When asked if she is friends with Musk, Meloni replied,She added, “Musk is a great personality of our time, an extraordinary innovator who always looks to the future.”,” she told the publication.Elon Musk presented Italy's PM, 47, with the Global Citizen's Award at the Atlantic Council think tank’s Global Citizen Awards. ""I thank Elon Musk, for the beautiful words that he had for me and for his precious genius for the era in which we live,"" said Meloni in her thanks address at the event. The video of the same was shared recently by Tesla Owners Silicon Valley Association on Twitter and reposted by Elon Musk.Italy PM Meloni was in the US recently to meet Trump. The US President-elect hailed Italian Prime Minister Meloni as a “fantastic woman” who has ""really taken Europe by storm,"" as per a report in CNN. A member of the right-wing Brothers of Italy party, Meloni took office in October 2022. She has been recognised as the most powerful person in Europe for 2024 by Politico.According to CNN reports, the details of the meeting have not been disclosed, although the Italian leader, like others, has been seeking to strengthen ties with the President-elect ahead of his inauguration on January 20.One possible topic on the agenda was the detention of Italian journalist Cecilia Sala, who was arrested in Iran last month, it said. Meloni's visit to Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida's Palm Beach comes after she dined with the President-elect and Musk during the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris last month.","Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni defended Elon Musk against criticism in a recent interview.

iPhone SE 4 may have a new name

Apple may introduce the new iPhone SE and iPad 11 by April 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. A report previously suggested that these devices would launch alongside iOS 18 .3 and iPadOS 18.3, but Gurman clarified that while the products are being developed on the same software ""train,"" their release may not coincide with the updates. Instead, Gurman stated that Apple is targeting a release “before iOS 18.4,” offering a more specific timeframe for the highly anticipated devices.Taking to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Gurma wrote “Yes, the new iPads and iPhone SE replacement are being developed on the iOS 18.3 train - but that doesn’t mean they launch together this month”. Adding further, he said “It means they’ll launch before iOS 18.4, by April if all goes to plan.”According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, iPhone SE 4 may be rebranded as the iPhone 16E . The naming speculation originated from Chinese social media platform Weibo user Fixed Focus Digital and was later corroborated by leaker Majin Bu on X (formerly Twitter). While neither source has an established track record with Apple rumors, the potential rebranding would align the budget model more closely with Apple's flagship iPhone 16 lineup. The potential name change would mark a significant shift from Apple's previous ""SE"" branding for its budget iPhone line.The device is rumored to receive a major redesign, adopting the modern aesthetics of the iPhone 14 and moving away from the dated iPhone 8-style design of the current SE model. Key upgrades include a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID authentication, and a USB-C port, replacing the Touch ID button and Lightning connector found on the current model.Sources indicate the device will feature a single 48-megapixel rear camera, 8GB of RAM, and Apple's latest A-series chip to support new AI features. The company is also expected to implement its first in-house designed 5G modem in the device.","Apple may introduce the new iPhone SE and iPad 11 by April 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.

Update:

Deadline to file GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B have been extended by two days. A latest post shared on X confirms the extension. In the update, the

wrote: ""Dear Taxpayers,📢 Due Date for filling GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B have been extended by two days. For details, Please refer to the notification number 01/2025 and 02/2025 dated 10.01.2025 issued by CBIC.""

How social media users reacted to the issue



“We have lot of patience. Don't worry. We have seen tons of glitches like this from day 1 of portal and paid penalties. Of Course!! Even if anyone lost patience, no one is there to hear. Whatever you people do, that has to be followed. That's it know.”

“Announce extension on time. Let business owners relax. Whenever a portal is down so near to due date, extension announcement should be immediate to clear uncertainity,”

“And what about late fees, does the GST registered taxpayer will get 200/- late fee in their Cash Ledger, as delay is from your end ?”

“We have patience, but department will send notice to us if it is not filed within due date and if due date is extend for one day why we have to work on Sunday!!!”

“GST portal is not working since few days and lot of professional time is wasted and still no solution..levy penalty on @Infosys_GSTN and provide relief to taxpayers and give proper timeline for smooth working of portal.”

What are the changes in Meta's policy

Meta recently made controversial changes to its Hateful Conduct policy , raising concerns that the new guidelines will allow harmful content to thrive on its platforms. The tech giant has lifted restrictions on divisive and discriminatory rhetoric across its platforms – Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. The policy now permits users to engage in harmful speech, including calling gay individuals ""mentally ill,"" referring to women as ""property,"" and labeling entire ethnic groups as ""diseases.""Announced by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the policy change is aimed to promote ""free expression"" by reducing restrictions on controversial topics, including gender identity and sexuality. However, the development has sparked outrage within the company.According to a 404 Media report, many employees have described the move as ""unacceptable"" and ""appalling” in leaked internal discussions. One post by an employee on an internal Meta platform called Workplace reads “I am LGBT and Mentally Ill”. “Just to let you know that I’ll be taking time out to look after my mental health.”Employees have also expressed concern over the lack of transparency surrounding the decision, pointing out the absence of the usual internal consultations and discussions with external experts.The changes as announced by the company on Tuesday, January 7 remove prohibitions against dehumanizing language based on ""protected characteristics,"" such as race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation. Meta now allows users to compare these groups to inanimate objects, filth, and diseases like cancer. Additionally, individuals can claim that certain protected characteristics should not exist or are inferior.Protected characteristics, as defined by Meta, include race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religion, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, and serious disease.The revised policy also eliminates Meta’s previous stance on hateful conduct creating an ""environment of intimidation and exclusion"" and acknowledges the potential for offline violence."," Meta recently made controversial changes to its Hateful Conduct policy.

Telecom operators are reportedly lobbying the Department of Telecommunications DoT ) to adopt the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India 's (TRAI) definition of international traffic, a change that could boost their SMS revenues by over Rs 400 crore annually.According to a report in Economic Times, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), whose members include Reliance Jio Airtel and Vodafone-Idea , have sent a letter to the telecom secretary Neeraj Mittal. The letter has urged the DoT to incorporate Trai's recommendations into existing unified license agreements and upcoming authorizations. Trai recently defined international traffic as SMS messages that originate or terminate from devices, servers, or applications located outside India. COAI believes this definition will provide much-needed clarity to the industry.Experts predict that adopting this definition could generate over Rs 400 crore in additional annual SMS revenue for telcos by preventing the misclassification of international messages as domestic ones.This push follows years of dispute between telecom operators and multinational companies (MNCs), including e-commerce giants, regarding message classification. These MNCs include Amazon, Flipkart, Netflix and others.Telcos have alleged that some MNCs process international transactions from foreign servers but send SMS messages from domestic systems to avoid higher international SMS charges. While Trai has set domestic SMS rates between 0.2 and 0.5 paisa, international SMS rates are significantly higher, ranging from ₹2 to ₹5 depending on the origin country.Trai's recent recommendation clarifies that any incoming application-to-person (A2P) SMS message should be considered international if it requires the use or intervention of any device, system, or application located outside India. This move addresses the issue of various entities, including financial institutions, e-commerce firms, enterprises, cloud providers, and OTTs, using A2P messaging without revealing the SMS origin. Telcos argue that this clarity is crucial.","Telecom operators are reportedly lobbying the Department of Telecommunications DoT to adopt Trai's definition of international traffic.

Moraes suspended X in Brazil

A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has issued a stern warning to tech companies, saying that they must adhere to Brazilian laws to continue operating in the country. Justice Alexandre de Moraes , who temporarily suspended Elon Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) in Brazil, stressed that the court will not tolerate the exploitation of hate speech for profit.“In Brazil, (the companies) will only continue to operate if they respect Brazilian legislation, regardless of the rant of Big Tech managers,” Moraes said, as per news agency Reuters.While Moraes did not name any specific company, his remarks came shortly after Meta announced plans to discontinue its US fact-checking program and loosen restrictions on discussions surrounding controversial topics.Moraes, speaking at an event commemorating the second anniversary of the January 8 riots in Brazil, underscored the importance of respecting Brazilian legislation, regardless of the opinions of Big Tech executives.Meanwhile, Brazilian prosecutors have requested clarification from Meta regarding whether the changes to its fact-checking program in the US will also apply to Brazil. Meta has been given 30 days to respond as part of an ongoing investigation into online misinformation and violence.On August 30, 2024, Moraes ordered the suspension of X (formerly Twitter) in Brazil, accusing the platform of failing to comply with local laws requiring the appointment of a legal representative in the country.This decision resulted in a complete shutdown of X's operations in Brazil. Major tech companies like Apple and Google, along with Brazilian internet service providers (ISPs), blocked access to the platform for their users, effectively cutting off millions of Brazilians from the social media service.The suspension, initially ordered by Moraes and later unanimously upheld by a Supreme Court panel, led to a clash between Moraes and X owner Elon Musk, who criticised the judge's actions as censorship.",Justice Alexandre de Moraes has issued a stern warning to tech companies.

US giants challenging local rivals with quick commerce expansion



Blinkit will now deliver laptops, monitors, and printers in 10 minutes. This expansion into electronics makes the Zomato-owned quick commerce platform the third quick commerce platform to offer rapid delivery of such high-value items, following Flipkart Minutes and Bigbasket's BB Now. Blinkit CEO Albinder Dhindsa took to social media platform X (earlier Twitter) to announce the new offering. Currently, this service is live in major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore and more. The company has also promised to add more brands and their products to the service in the coming days.In the X post, Dhindsa wrote:Earlier this month, Blinkit also introduced a 10-minute ambulance service in Gurugram. The company plans to expand this service to other major cities within the next two years.The Indian quick commerce market is heating up with the entry of US giants Amazon and Flipkart, challenging local players like Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart and Zepto. Amazon is piloting its ""Tez"" service in Bengaluru, offering fast delivery of essentials. Meanwhile, Flipkart is also expanding its ""Minutes"" service with an extensive network of dark stores and a wider product range, including electronics and even medicine.This intensified competition is putting pressure on existing players' profitability, forcing them to innovate and adapt. BigBasket, for example, is integrating with Tata Cliq to offer 15-minute delivery of fashion items, expanding the scope of quick commerce.While the sector's growth projections have been revised by analysts, the arrival of Amazon and Flipkart promises to reshape the quick commerce landscape in India, potentially leading to greater convenience and choice for consumers.","Blinkit will now deliver laptops, monitors, and printers in 10 minutes.

Elon Musk has joined the chorus of AI experts declaring that we've hit “peak data.” In a recent livestream, the xAI founder stated that AI models have essentially consumed all of humanity's accumulated knowledge and there’s very little real-world data left to train AI models on.""We've exhausted basically the cumulative sum of human knowledge...in AI training,"" Musk said, adding, “That happened basically last year.”Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind , recently cautioned that the rapid advancements in AI chatbots may be slowing down. He attributed this potential slowdown to a growing scarcity of high-quality data for training AI models. Hassabis said that tech companies have essentially ‘exhausted’ the readily available data on the internet, having already used it to train existing large language models.In fact, about a month ago, Microsoft AI chief Mustafa Suleyman talked about the use of synthetic data to train AI models because the available data is exhausted – something that OpenAI's former chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, warned about.Musk believes the solution lies in synthetic data – data generated by AI itself. He envisions AI models creating their own training data and engaging in a “process of self-learning.”“The only way to supplement [real-world data] is with synthetic data, where the AI creates [training data],” he said.“With synthetic data … [AI] will sort of grade itself and go through this process of self-learning,” he added.This approach is already being adopted by major players like Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic, who are using synthetic data to train their most advanced AI models.Google DeepMind has reportedly been using synthetic data to train AL models and it relied on this method to help train a model that can solve Olympiad-level geometry problems.In fact, the AI arm of Google recently pointed to inference-time compute – a solution to tackle the lack of data to train AI models. This technique allows AI models to tackle complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller, manageable prompts, essentially learning along the way.""We’re generating vast amounts of synthetic data. That synthetic data is increasingly high quality,"" Suleyman told The Verge in an interview last month.","Elon Musk has joined the chorus of AI experts declaring that we've hit “peak data.” In a recent livestream, the xAI founder stated that AI models have essentially consumed all of humanity's accumulated knowledge.

What NRAI said against Swiggy and Zomato



“We are absolutely not okay with Zomato and Swiggy engaging in private labelling and selling food directly via Blinkit’s Bistro app and Swiggy’s Snacc app for quick food delivery. They have access to all our data, which they do not share with us. For us, there is complete consumer masking. We have no reason to believe they are not migrating our customers to the products they sell as private labels on their apps, whether it’s data from a tea brand, biryani, or momo. We are seriously considering taking legal action.”

“Quick commerce in food is here to stay, grow, and add more zing to the food delivery space. People want more convenience, and this will give an edge to restaurants that can adapt to it. We fully support it. However, as long as these aggregators work with restaurants and enable them to go quick, we’re fine with it. But we cannot support a model where they sell similar products themselves, effectively competing with us. This has not been allowed for even larger e-commerce players operating under the marketplace model,”

Restaurants across India are protesting against Zomato and Swiggy 's launch of standalone apps for 10-minute food delivery . The National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) is also planning to take the issue to the Competition Commission of India (CCI). The NRAI alleges that these new apps, Bistro by Zomato-owned Blinkit and Snacc by Swiggy, amount to the companies operating private labels , which could harm existing restaurant partners. This move escalates an ongoing case the NRAI has with the CCI against the two food delivery giants, accusing them of anti-competitive practices.In a statement to the Economic Times, Sagar Daryani , NRAI president and co-founder and CEO of Wow Momo said:Food delivery platforms like Zomato and Swiggy use services like Bistro and Snacc, respectively to source food and beverages from third-party vendors and deliver them through quick-commerce dark stores. Apart from this, the companies also provide a 15-minute food delivery service by aggregating restaurants. Swiggy’s rapid food delivery service, offered under its Bolt model, now contributes to over 5% of its total food delivery orders, ET reports.Daryani added.NRAI has also urged the government to grant industry status to the food services sector, news agency PTI reports.

Ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt has reportedly invested in Relativity Space, a 3D-printed rocket company that competes with Elon Musk 's SpaceX. A Bloomberg report citing sources claimed that Schmidt has been backing the company since last year, providing a significant financial boost. This investment comes after Relativity Space faced challenges raising capital in 2024. The company is among a growing number of startups vying for a share of the space launch market , alongside established players like SpaceX and Firefly Aerospace .Earlier, Schmidt served as the CEO of Google ’s parent Alphabet, until 2011, when he transitioned to the role of executive chairman. He departed from the board in 2019 and has since focused on philanthropic initiatives, investment ventures, and advisory roles with the US government, as well as work through his family foundation.A representative for Schmidt declined to provide a comment, while Relativity also remained silent regarding his financial investment, the report noted.Relativity said in a statement.Founded in 2015 in Long Beach, California, Relativity started building rockets primarily using 3D printing technology. The company achieved a valuation of $4.2 billion in 2021, backed by investors such as Fidelity Management & Research Company, Jared Leto, and Mark Cuban.In 2023, Relativity launched its first rocket, the Terran 1, on a test flight that failed to reach orbit. Following this, the company decided to discontinue the Terran 1 program and shift its focus to the Terran R , a larger rocket scheduled for its maiden flight in 2026.Last year, Relativity faced financial challenges, with dwindling cash reserves and difficulties securing the additional funding needed to support the development of Terran R and maintain daily operations.In a statement, the company affirmed its commitment to the Terran R project, stating,","Relativity Space is a 3D-printed rocket company that competes with Elon Musk's SpaceX.

Bill Gates: The Founding Visionary (1975–2000)

Pioneering the PC revolution: Gates secured a pivotal deal in 1980 to supply the operating system for IBM’s first personal computer. Microsoft purchased and adapted an existing system, branding it MS-DOS. This move catapulted Microsoft into prominence as a leader in operating systems.

Innovations in software: The launch of Windows 1.0 in 1985 introduced the Graphical User Interface, making computing more accessible. Subsequent versions, such as Windows 3.0 (1990) and Windows 95 (1995), solidified Microsoft’s dominance. The introduction of Microsoft Office further cemented its role as the go-to provider of business productivity tools.

Growth and challenges: Microsoft’s 1986 Initial Public Offering (IPO) made Gates a billionaire at age 31. However, the company faced legal scrutiny in the late 1990s when the U.S. Department of Justice accused it of monopolistic practices by bundling Internet Explorer with Windows. Despite a protracted legal battle, Microsoft reached a settlement in 2001.

Legacy: Gates stepped down as CEO in 2000 to focus on philanthropy through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. His tenure left an indelible mark on the technology landscape, making Microsoft synonymous with personal and professional computing.

Steve Ballmer: Expanding Horizons (2000–2014)

Successes and innovations: Under Ballmer, Microsoft entered the gaming industry with the launch of the Xbox in 2001, challenging Sony and Nintendo’s dominance. The company also released Windows XP, one of its most successful operating systems.

Challenges in the mobile market: Despite successes, Ballmer’s tenure faced setbacks, such as the underwhelming reception of Windows Vista and Microsoft’s failure to establish a strong foothold in the mobile market. The introduction of the iPhone in 2007 and the rise of Android further marginalized Microsoft’s smartphone efforts.

Strategic acquisitions: Ballmer spearheaded significant acquisitions, including Skype for $8.5 billion in 2011, bolstering Microsoft’s position in communication technologies.

Financial growth: Despite challenges, Microsoft’s annual revenue tripled during Ballmer’s tenure, reflecting its expanding product portfolio and global reach. He announced his retirement in 2013, stepping down in February 2014.

Satya Nadella: Reinventing Microsoft (2014–Present)

Shift to cloud computing: Nadella prioritized Microsoft Azure, turning it into a leader in cloud infrastructure. By 2020, Azure surpassed Microsoft’s Windows business, reflecting the success of this strategic pivot.

Subscription-based services: Nadella championed the shift to subscription models, with Microsoft 365 becoming a cornerstone of the company’s offerings. This transition provided consistent revenue streams and aligned with evolving user needs.

High-profile acquisitions: Nadella oversaw transformative acquisitions, including:

Mojang (2014) : Creator of Minecraft, for $2.5 billion.

: Creator of Minecraft, for $2.5 billion.

LinkedIn (2016) : Professional networking giant, for $26.2 billion.

: Professional networking giant, for $26.2 billion.

GitHub (2018): Leading platform for software collaboration, for $7.6 billion.

Focus on AI: Microsoft has emerged as a key player in AI under Nadella. The company’s partnership with OpenAI, with investments exceeding $13 billion, has positioned it at the forefront of AI advancements. Microsoft’s commitment includes plans for significant investments in GPUs and AI data centers through 2027.

Cultural transformation: Nadella’s leadership has been credited with transforming Microsoft’s internal culture, fostering collaboration and innovation. His emphasis on empathy and adaptability has redefined the company’s approach to challenges and opportunities.

Accenture CEO Julie Sweet: One question that we ask everyone across levels is ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/accenture-ceo-julie-sweet-one-question-that-we-ask-everyone-across-levels-is-/articleshow/117078050.cms,"What Accenture CEO learned in past 6 months

Accenture CEO Julie Sweet reveals her key interview question for potential employees. In a recent podcast with Norges Bank Investment Management CEO Nicolai Tangen, Sweet explained how she determines candidate suitability. She asks all applicants, regardless of position: “What have you learned in the last six months?” This question, according to Sweet, helps her gauge their commitment to continuous learning. The podcast interview with Tangen provided insights into Sweet's hiring practices at Accenture.She said: “One question that we ask everyone, regardless of if you’re a consultant or you’re working in technology … we say: ‘What have you learned in the last six months?’. A lot of the time people are asking me, ‘How do I know if someone’s a learner?’ And it’s a very simple way to know. “She explained that the question is a simple but effective way to gauge if someone is a continuous learner. She added that it doesn’t matter if the answer is something as casual as “I learned to bake a cake”—what matters is whether the candidate can answer the question. If they can’t, Sweet believes that shows they’re not interested in learning new things.When asked what she had learned in the last six months, Sweet mentioned that her focus had been mostly on artificial intelligence (AI). She shared that in recent months, AI had been a hot topic in meetings with CEOs. Despite her busy schedule, Sweet revealed that she learned how to bake bread.Sweet also stressed the growing importance of human resources (HR). She believes HR is one of the best fields to be in right now, as CEOs are increasingly focused on how to train and develop talent in this AI-driven era.This hiring approach highlights how companies are adjusting their recruitment strategies in response to AI, which is changing job roles across departments. Daniel Shapero, LinkedIn ’s COO, also looks for candidates who are comfortable using AI, asking them how they’ve used it in their daily tasks. Shapero believes that candidates who can use AI effectively are more likely to help their organizations become more AI-driven.","Accenture CEO Julie Sweet reveals her key interview question for potential employees.

""Infrastructure today needs to be thought of differently from traditional ways""

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has announced the company's plans to invest $3 billion in India in cloud and AI infrastructure, including setting up new data centres over the next two years. The $3 billion additional investment in India is said to be Microsoft's single-largest expansion into the region. During his India visit, Nadella also had an interaction with Infosys co-founder and chairman Nandan Nilekani in Bengaluru, on the sidelines of an event where Microsoft announced fresh investments in the country and met partners as well as customers.The two leaders spoke about a range of issues including India's role in AI innovation, the increasingly critical role AI will play in the global economy, human capital and AI and more. Nilekani said that India will be the use case capital of the world, while Nadella outlined the impact being created by some of India’s leading startups and enterprises building out the use cases with AI.Talking about his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Nadella said, “I had a chance to meet Prime Minister Modiji yesterday and it was fantastic. It's great to listen to his vision of how he wants to drive AI missions. It's the combination of the Yojanas (schemes), the India Stack, the entrepreneurial energy in this country, and the demographics on both the consumer and business sides that are all coming together in a virtuous cycle,” Nadella said.To this, Nilekani said, “We have political leadership that is very savvy. I know you met Prime Minister Modi yesterday, and they understand that we must strike the right balance between AI innovation and safeguards. In some parts of the world, they are saying safeguards first without worrying about innovation. We know the right balance between responsible AI and innovation.”Responding to Microsoft CEO Nadella’s question on contextualising AI adoption in India, Nilekani said, “I think India will be the use case capital of AI in the world. We have several things working for us. We have 15 years of experience in building population-scale digital infrastructure, which makes it cheaper and allows for high-volume, billions of transactions. We know that game well.”Giving example of UPI, Infosys chairman Nilekani said that Indians are quick to adapt and accept new technology. “UPI was launched about seven years ago, and now there are 400 million users and 16 billion transactions a month. It's unbelievable that this can happen. I think AI is at that spot, and we must make it work. For example, if you look at Aadhaar authentications, it's all AI-based because we have to do liveness detection for biometrics, so people don't spoof it. It's all AI-based. Look at our tax systems, the back end is all AI figuring out who's committing fraud. That's why tax revenues are going up,” he said.Emphasising the advances in AI and the increasingly critical role it will play in the economy, Nadella said infrastructure today needs to be thought of differently from the traditional ways. “With infrastructure, there’s a new formula for any country or company. I think of that formula as tokens per dollar per watt. Fundamentally, their (country or company) growth depends on how efficiently they can drive that equation,” he said.When asked about the advice he has for global CEOs, Nadella said ""change management is the hard thing”.... “At Microsoft, for instance, the efficiency gains in various functions – customer service, internal IT, and others – all show double-digit improvements. These improvements directly influence budgetary decisions. From a CEO's perspective, this translates to setting specific targets, such as 10 points or 300 basis points of operating leverage for the upcoming year, with a five-year compound growth plan. ...Thanks to capital markets, what they expect of CEOs is miracles every 90 days,” he said.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has announced the company's plans to invest $3 billion in India in cloud and AI infrastructure, including setting up new data centres over the next two years.

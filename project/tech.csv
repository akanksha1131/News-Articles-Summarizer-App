iQiyi to open theme park

iQiyi's market share and regional dominance

Netflix may be staring at a huge problem, and it is China. Chinese streaming giants are reportedly quickly gaining ground on their American rivals in the booming Southeast Asian market. According to a report in Nikkei Asia, companies like iQiyi and Tencent are making major plays, shifting their focus to producing original content tailored for local audiences. Referred to as "" China's Netflix ,"" iQiyi, a subsidiary of Baidu, has been expanding across Southeast Asia since 2019, with a strong presence in Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia. The company has attracted 36 million monthly subscribers in the region by offering a mix of free ad-supported viewing and affordable subscription fees. In Thailand, iQiyi's library features over 9,000 titles, with more than 60% being Chinese productions.iQiyi hosts a plethora of content from Chinese period dramas to blockbuster Hollywood films. Moving forward, iQiyi is investing heavily in local content, says the report. The company plans to spend up to 1.54 million dollars ($1.54 million) per production and release four to six Thai titles annually, specifically targeting popular genres like ""boys' love"" and ""girls' love"" dramas. In Indonesia and Malaysia, iQiyi is partnering with local studios and carriers like Telkomsel to produce original content for the carrier's 170 million subscribers. iQiyi vies with Tencent Holdings and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd to rank among the biggest video-streaming platforms in China, with an estimated 400 million-plus monthly active users.Tencent launched its WeTV service in Southeast Asia in 2019 and is also prioritizing original content. Since 2024, the company has been producing local idol programs, which has led to the formation of successful groups like the seven-member boy band NexT1de.Earlier this year, iQiyi said that it plans to open its first theme park this year, based on characters from its own shows. The forthcoming “iQiyi Land” is set to open in the city of Yangzhou in Jiangsu province, just over two hours from Shanghai by high-speed train.While U.S. services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video entered the region around 2016 and hold a dominant share in some areas—nearly 60% in Singapore—Chinese companies are rapidly closing the gap. In Thailand, Chinese providers command about 40% of the market, surpassing the roughly 30% held by U.S. services. This is partly attributed to the large ethnic Chinese population in Southeast Asia and the popularity of Chinese content.The fierce competition in the domestic Chinese market is also a driving factor for this expansion. With domestic revenue and profits falling, Southeast Asia's young population and rising incomes present a significant growth opportunity. The region's streaming market is projected to reach 6.8 billion dollars by 2030, a 49% increase from 2024.","iQiyi, a subsidiary of Baidu, has been expanding across Southeast Asia since 2019.

What the sentencing memo on the former Intel engineer said



Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 Review: Changing The Game

A former Intel engineer who illegally shared the company’s trade secrets with his new employer, Microsoft, has been sentenced to two years of probation and ordered to pay a fine of over $34,000, a report has said. The sentence was handed down last week to Varun Gupta, who worked as a product marketing engineer for Intel for nearly a decade. He was fired from his senior position at Microsoft after his actions came to light.According to Assistant US Attorney William Narus, Gupta copied thousands of confidential files from his Intel computer onto a portable hard drive before leaving the company in 2020, as per a report in Oregon Live.He then “repeatedly accessed those documents” and used them to represent Microsoft in contract negotiations with his former employer, specifically on a deal related to computer processors, the report added.“Not only did the defendant take proprietary materials with him, he also used those materials during negotiations against his prior employer,” Narus said in a sentencing memo. One of the documents shared was a PowerPoint presentation outlining Intel's pricing strategy with another major customer.In a sentencing memo, Narus argued for an eight-month prison term, emphasising the need to deter such behavior in an industry with high employee turnover.“Not only did the defendant take proprietary materials with him, he also used those materials during negotiations against his prior employer,” Narus wrote.Varun Gupta’s defense attorney, David Angeli, countered that Gupta had already suffered a significant and lasting punishment. Angeli noted that his client had already lost the high-level position he worked years to achieve, settled a civil lawsuit with Intel for $40,000, and experienced a permanently damaged reputation that effectively ended his career in the tech sector.In a prepared statement to the court, Varun Gupta apologised to both Intel and Microsoft, as well as the government, for the resources spent “because of my bad decision.”He spoke of his daily struggle with questions about his future and his ""legacy"" as he works to rebuild his life in a new country. After leaving the tech industry, Varun Gupta relocated his family to France and is now studying vineyard management, with aspirations of working in the wine industry.",Varun Gupta worked as a product marketing engineer for Intel for nearly a decade.

About 20 articles remain, with the English one not mentioning the controversy.The composer, who is known for his ""prequiem"" written for Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and his interest in a defunct Aryan colony in Paraguay, had a significant digital footprint that confused online communities.

Steve Jobs offered him a deal that could have made him the world’s first trillionaire — but he said no; who is Nolan Bushnell?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/steve-jobs-offered-him-a-deal-that-could-have-made-him-the-worlds-first-trillionaire-but-he-said-no-who-is-nolan-bushnell/articleshow/123344679.cms,"

Steve Jobs’ offer and Bushnell’s decision

Apple’s rise without Bushnell

The trillion-dollar “what-if”

In Silicon Valley, fortunes are made and sometimes lost with a single decision. Few stories illustrate this better than that of Nolan Bushnell , the visionary who co-founded Atari and is often called the “father of video games .” In the mid-1970s, Bushnell hired a young Steve Jobs at Atari, mentoring him in his early career. Later, Jobs and his friend Steve Wozniak pitched Bushnell an opportunity: invest $50,000 for a one-third stake in their fledgling company, Apple . Bushnell turned it down. That choice, which seemed trivial at the time, cost him the chance to join the wealthiest ranks of history. Today, that stake would be worth close to $1 trillion, making Bushnell the world’s first trillionaire .Jobs’ time at Atari exposed him to the world of electronics and games, and it was here that he developed a bond with Bushnell. When Jobs and Wozniak began work on their own personal computer venture, they turned to Bushnell for early backing. The offer was simple: $50,000 for one-third of Apple. Bushnell declined, citing his commitments to Atari and skepticism about the risk. He later admitted in interviews that he thought it was too much money for an untested idea. In hindsight, that modest sum would have yielded a fortune larger than any billionaire’s wealth today, surpassing Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and even entire national economies.Bushnell’s rejection did not slow Jobs and Wozniak. Apple went on to become a revolutionary force in personal computing , smartphones, and digital music, now valued at around $2.8 trillion. Without Bushnell’s involvement, Jobs and Wozniak retained more control, which allowed them to steer Apple according to their uncompromising vision. Interestingly, Bushnell’s “no” may have helped Apple remain uniquely independent in its early years. He later reflected that while he missed out on unimaginable wealth, he never regretted prioritizing his own projects such as Atari and later Chuck E. Cheese, both of which shaped popular culture in different ways.Bushnell’s missed opportunity is often cited alongside other legendary near-misses in tech. Ronald Wayne, Apple’s third cofounder, sold his 10% stake for just $800, a stake now worth more than $280 billion. Yahoo once turned down Google for $1 million, and Blockbuster refused to buy Netflix for $50 million. These stories highlight how early-stage ventures often appear risky, even to insiders. For Bushnell, the rejection meant losing out on becoming the world’s first trillionaire. Yet his legacy as a pioneer of gaming and as an early mentor to Jobs remains intact. In many ways, his influence shaped Silicon Valley’s culture, even if he chose not to ride the Apple wave. His story remains a reminder that even visionaries can underestimate the next big thing. In Silicon Valley, sometimes the greatest fortunes are lost not by failure—but by hesitation.","Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak offered Nolan Bushnell $50,000 for a one-third stake in Apple.

Bezos-Sánchez wedding draws criticism over DiCaprio’s jet travel



Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s $40 Venetian wedding

Newlyweds Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez were recently spotted hosting Leonardo DiCaprio and his model girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht Koru . The high-profile outing took place off the coast of Ibiza, a popular celebrity hotspot and luxury summer getaway destination. Leonardo DiCaprio, known for his understated style, wore a plain white T-shirt, shorts, and his trademark baseball cap and sunglasses. Vittoria Ceretti showcased her model figure in a strapless blue top and black yoga pants. Bezos opted for tropical-printed swim trunks paired with a navy T-shirt, while Sánchez layered a printed kimono over a bikini. Their casual vacation looks perfectly captured the relaxed yet exclusive atmosphere aboard one of the world’s most extravagant and expensive private yachts, making headlines among luxury lifestyle and celebrity news followers worldwide.Bezos’s superyacht Koru, meaning “new beginnings” in Māori, represents the couple’s extravagant lifestyle and new chapter together. Built by Dutch shipbuilder Oceanco, Koru stands as the world’s tallest sailing yacht, measuring 250 feet tall with three masts exceeding 230 feet each.At 416 feet wide, the yacht features three luxury decks, multiple lounges, and ultra-modern amenities. Its construction spanned five years, costing an estimated $485 million. The yacht previously sparked controversy when plans to dismantle a historic Rotterdam bridge emerged to allow Koru’s passage, leading to widespread public protests and alternative solutions by the builders.Leonardo DiCaprio’s attendance at Bezos and Sánchez’s Venetian wedding drew backlash, with critics calling him a “hypocrite” due to his outspoken environmental activism. Social media users highlighted the contradiction between DiCaprio’s climate advocacy and the carbon-heavy nature of celebrity private jet travel, pointing out that over 90 jets reportedly flew into Venice for the wedding.Despite the criticism, DiCaprio’s friendship with Bezos remains strong, as evidenced by their repeat vacations together including last year’s luxury yacht trip in Sardinia. One of the wedding’s most surprising attendees was Sydney Sweeney, who reportedly had no close personal connection to Bezos or Sánchez. Later reports revealed that Bezos and Sánchez are investing in Sweeney’s upcoming lingerie line, explaining her presence at the event. This move demonstrates how the Bezos-Sánchez social circle extends beyond personal relationships to professional collaborations, further solidifying their influence in both business and Hollywood circles.The Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases a blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances. Whether it’s a $40 million Venetian wedding, a $485 million yacht, or investments in rising Hollywood talent, the couple has firmly positioned themselves at the center of celebrity culture and high society.Just weeks before their Ibiza yacht trip, Bezos and Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent $40 million wedding in Venice. The three-day celebration attracted global headlines not just for its extravagance but also for the massive celebrity turnout, including Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom, and Sydney Sweeney.Despite public protests in Venice over the event’s scale, insiders revealed that the wedding was surprisingly intimate. No non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) were required for guests, allowing attendees to freely share their experiences. The bride’s $5 million diamond ring became a symbol of the wedding’s lavishness and continues to be a topic of discussion among jewelers and fans alike.","Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances.

Responding to the comments, the Tesla CEO acknowledged that while the valuation is possible, it may require ‘extreme execution’.“Extreme execution is needed, but a valuation of $20 trillion for Tesla is possible,” Elon Musk wrote, quoting a post on X (formerly Twitter).Notably, this comes days after Elon Musk warned of ‘few rough quarters’ for Tesla following the expiration of the US tax credit for EVs. In an earnings conference call with analysts and investors this week, the tech billionaire said “We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the US.”Continuing further, he said “We probably could have a few rough quarters. I'm not saying we will, but we could”. “But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling,” Musk added.The EV maker reported a drop in profit for the third quarter in a row, with earnings falling to $1.17 billion, or 33 cents per share, down from $1.4 billion, or 40 cents per share, during the same period last year.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 40 cents per share, which was in line with Wall Street expectations. Revenue for the April to June quarter also declined — from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion — but still came in slightly higher than analysts had forecast.During the earnings calls, Elon Musk was asked about whether he would want more than his current 13% stake in Tesla to keep control. To this, Musk said he did want more but not too much.“I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction,” he said, “but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy.”","Investor Keith Fitz-Gerald recently said that Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla is headed towards a $20 trillion valuation.

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that he has created more billionaires in his management than any CEO in the world. Speaking during an event hosted by the All-In Podcast team and a consortium of tech leaders and lawmakers known as the Hill and Valley Forum, Huang discussed the scale of impact that small, focused teams of AI researchers can have and how Nvidia’s success has translated into significant financial rewards for those in leadership. “I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.” Jensen Huang said. He was responding to a question on the effectiveness and value of smaller AI teams.“But the important big idea is that the impact of 150 or so AI researchers, with funding behind them, can probably create,” he noted. Jensen Huang gave examples of OpenAI which originally started with around 150 employees and China’s DeepSeek which also has a similar workforce.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang added that there's something unique about well-structured, mid-sized teams when given the right resources. “That’s not a small team. That’s a good-size team with the right infrastructure… If you're willing to pay, say, $20 billion, $30 billion to buy a startup with 150 AI researchers, why wouldn't you pay one?”During the interview, the Nvidia CEO also addressed reports that he personally rewards high-performing employees with surprise stock options and RSUs (Restricted Stock Units). When asked if he actually does carry stock options, Jensen Huang joked “Yeah, I'm carrying it in my pocket right now.”He then explained that he takes a hands-on approach to compensation across the company. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day… when they present it, and they send me everybody’s recommended comp, I go through the whole company. I’ve got my methods of doing that, and I use machine learning. I sort through all 42,000 employees.”“100% of the time, I increased the company’s spend on OpEx [operating expenses].

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved from a futuristic concept to an everyday necessity, influencing industries ranging from healthcare and finance to entertainment and communication. It automates routine tasks, enhances productivity, and fuels innovations like ChatGPT, AI-driven translation services, and virtual gaming experiences.The growth of AI has also created a new class of billionaires, some of whom have built companies from scratch, while others have pivoted established businesses toward AI-driven opportunities. Backed by massive investments from Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and other global players, these individuals represent the cutting edge of technology and entrepreneurship. From Jensen Huang’s hardware empire to Alexandr Wang’s data infrastructure solutions, and from Sam Altman’s AI innovation to Yao Runhao’s virtual gaming platforms, these billionaires illustrate how AI is reshaping industries and redefining entrepreneurship.Source: ForbesJensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of Nvidia, sits at the top of the AI billionaire list with an astonishing $113 billion (£151 billion) net worth. Nvidia initially focused on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming and professional visualization. However, as AI adoption accelerated, these GPUs became the standard for training and running large language models like ChatGPT and Meta AI.Huang’s strategic vision transformed Nvidia into the backbone of the AI industry. In July 2025, the company reached an unprecedented $4 trillion valuation, reflecting how central its hardware is to AI infrastructure. Owning 3% of Nvidia, Huang’s wealth grew by over 300% in just one year, making him one of the top 20 richest individuals worldwide.At just 26 years old, Alexandr Wang has secured his place as the youngest self-made billionaire in the AI sector. He founded Scale AI at the age of 19, after dropping out of MIT, to focus on providing data labeling and annotation services essential for AI training.Scale AI works with over 300 high-profile clients, including Meta, Google, and General Motors, supplying the data infrastructure required to build machine learning models. The company’s valuation reached $14 billion (£10.5 billion) in 2024, and Wang’s 14% ownership stake boosted his net worth to $2.7 billion (£3.6 billion). His success highlights how even niche AI services can yield massive fortunes.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is one of the most prominent faces in artificial intelligence. While OpenAI itself is valued at around $300 billion (£225 billion), Altman does not personally hold equity in the company. His wealth, estimated at $1.9 billion (£1.4 billion), stems from early investments in companies like Stripe, Reddit, and Helion Energy, combined with the success of his previous startup, Loopt, which he sold for $42 million in 2012.Altman’s leadership at OpenAI popularized generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT, setting global trends in how businesses and consumers interact with AI. His influence extends beyond wealth, positioning him as one of the key thought leaders shaping AI’s future.Phil Shawe, co-CEO of TransPerfect, built one of the world’s largest translation and localization companies by leveraging AI-powered language processing. TransPerfect offers services across industries like law, healthcare, gaming, and entertainment, helping businesses operate in multiple languages with enhanced accuracy and efficiency.Founded in 1992 from a dorm room at New York University, TransPerfect generated $1.3 billion (£976 million) in revenue in 2024. Shawe owns 99% of the company, securing a personal fortune of $1.8 billion (£1.3 billion). His journey shows how AI technology can transform even traditional industries like language services into billion-dollar enterprises.Dario Amodei, a former vice president of research at OpenAI, left to co-found Anthropic in 2021. His company focuses on building safe, reliable AI systems using reinforcement learning techniques that allow AI models to adapt through human feedback.Anthropic’s approach to ethical AI and safety-first principles resonated with investors and industry leaders, pushing the company’s valuation to $61.5 billion (£46.2 billion) by 2025. Amodei’s net worth has reached $1.2 billion (£901 million), proving that prioritizing responsibility in AI development can be both impactful and profitable.Liang Wenfeng, once largely unknown outside China, made headlines with DeepSeek-R1, a large language model that outperformed ChatGPT on certain benchmarks while being five times cheaper to run. This innovation shook global markets, causing Nvidia’s stock to drop 17% in a single day as investors reacted to the potential shift in AI computing costs.Wenfeng previously founded a successful hedge fund, and he used his financial expertise to build DeepSeek into one of the most cost-efficient AI providers globally. His net worth now stands at $1 billion (£751 million), making him a key figure in China’s growing AI industry.Yao Runhao, CEO of Paper Games, has carved out a unique niche by combining AI with gaming. His company’s hit product, Love and Deepspace, uses artificial intelligence to create virtual dating simulations with interactive, personalized storylines.The game attracts over six million monthly users, showcasing the demand for AI-driven entertainment. Paper Games employs around 2,000 staff and focuses primarily on the female gaming market in China, highlighting how AI is revolutionizing interactive leisure experiences. Runhao’s innovation has earned him a net worth of $1.3 billion (£977 million).","World’s wealthiest AI moguls ranked by net worth.

Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India, marking another step in its long-term strategy to strengthen its footprint in emerging markets. During Apple’s latest earnings announcement, CEO Tim Cook confirmed plans to open multiple new Apple Stores in India before the year ends. The move comes as part of a broader global expansion plan that also includes fresh Apple retail outlets in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the launch of the Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia. Cook highlighted that these new physical stores are a key step in improving Apple’s customer experience, product accessibility, and service reach in high-growth regions like India.“We recently launched the Apple Store online in Saudi Arabia, and we couldn’t be more excited to open new stores in the UAE and India later this year,” Cook stated. “We were also delighted to welcome customers in Japan to a new location in the heart of Osaka.”According to Apple Magazine, four new stores are scheduled to open across key metropolitan cities in India, namely Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, and the Delhi NCR region. These new outlets will build on Apple’s successful retail debut in India in 2023, which saw the launch of Apple BKC in Mumbai and Apple Saket in Delhi. These initial stores have quickly become major crowd-pullers, especially during new iPhone release events, and have demonstrated the value of physical retail locations in India’s fast-growing premium smartphone market.To support this retail growth, Apple has been actively hiring talent for its upcoming stores. Earlier this year, Apple Store leader John Taffe shared on LinkedIn that Apple was looking for passionate and skilled individuals to join its retail team. “Apple’s journey in India has been incredible, and we’re thrilled to continue growing in these vibrant cities. To make these new stores a success, we’re looking for passionate and talented individuals to join our team,” Taffe noted. This hiring drive highlights Apple’s commitment to not only selling products but also delivering personalised customer experiences and creating jobs within the Indian retail sector.While India remains a critical market, Apple is expanding its retail network globally. Apart from its Indian plans, the company has announced new retail locations in the UAE, including a store in Al Ain, which will add to its existing four UAE outlets (two in Abu Dhabi and two in Dubai). The Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia further emphasizes Apple’s growing focus on the Middle East.These international retail initiatives aim to strengthen Apple’s customer reach and brand experience beyond its digital ecosystem. Apple’s global retail growth is supported by its strong financial results. In its April–June quarter (Q3), Apple reported a 13% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales, showcasing robust demand even in challenging economic conditions. This financial strength gives Apple the confidence to invest heavily in physical stores in markets like India, where premium smartphone adoption is rapidly increasing.India has emerged as one of Apple’s most important growth markets, driven by rising disposable incomes, expanding smartphone penetration, and a growing preference for premium devices. The launch of Apple BKC and Apple Saket in 2023 marked the company’s first direct retail presence in the country, and the overwhelming customer response has paved the way for more stores. Apple’s upcoming four new stores signal a long-term commitment to India, where it faces strong competition from brands like Samsung and OnePlus. However, Apple’s focus on a seamless retail experience and exclusive customer service could help it capture a larger market share in the premium category.",Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shifted from being a futuristic concept to a rapidly evolving reality impacting every industry. With advanced machine learning models, automation systems, and AI-powered decision-making tools, tasks once performed by humans are now handled with speed and precision by algorithms. This has triggered global concern about potential job losses. Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has admitted that automation will reduce certain jobs within the company. Similarly, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that AI will impact “everybody’s jobs” in some capacity, although he expects it to also create new opportunities. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predicts the most dramatic changes will occur within the next five to ten years, transforming entire job markets.When asked about the possibility of artificial general intelligence (AGI) performing all human tasks, DeepMind CEO Hassabis highlighted an important distinction:AI could analyse medical data, scans, and test results faster and more accurately than human doctors, potentially replacing or assisting in diagnosis and treatment planning.Nurses, however, provide emotional support, physical care, and human empathy that technology can’t replicate. A robotic nurse may be efficient but lacks the ability to emotionally connect with patients, a critical part of caregiving.This example shows that while AI in healthcare may replace certain intellectual tasks, professions relying on emotional intelligence will remain human-centered. This statement from Hassabis offers one of the clearest examples of how AI will alter specific professions, but not eliminate the need for human empathy and interpersonal care.According to Hassabis, the workplace of the future will integrate humans and AI collaboratively. AI will handle data-heavy, repetitive, and analytical processes, allowing humans to focus on creative problem-solving, emotional interaction, and leadership roles. This shift will require governments and industries to invest heavily in reskilling programs to prepare workers for AI-driven environments, emphasizing lifelong learning, adaptive skills, ethical AI usage, and the development of new interdisciplinary roles bridging technology, creativity, and human-centric decision-making.Andy Jassy’s remarks highlight a future where AI automation tools replace repetitive and operational tasks. Amazon already relies on robotics and intelligent software to manage logistics, inventory, and supply chain processes. Jassy believes that as these technologies mature, fewer human workers will be required for jobs like order processing and warehouse management. However, he noted that the shift doesn’t necessarily mean fewer opportunities overall but rather a need for upskilling and reskilling so employees can transition into more technology-driven roles.Jensen Huang, whose company Nvidia provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) powering modern AI systems, offered a candid view on AI’s impact:“Everybody’s jobs will be affected. Some jobs will be lost. Many jobs will be created.” Huang believes AI’s productivity gains will help industries perform tasks faster and cheaper, which may reduce demand for certain roles but open new ones focused on AI development, data analysis, and advanced engineering. He expressed hope that economic growth from AI adoption will ultimately “lift society” rather than harm it.Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind and a key architect of advanced AI systems, views AI as an additive rather than purely disruptive technology. He explained that as AI capabilities expand, new job categories will emerge—roles that use AI to enhance human output rather than replace it entirely. Historically, technological revolutions (like industrial machines or computers) displaced certain jobs but also created industries that didn’t exist before. Hassabis believes this trend will continue:“New jobs will be created that are actually better, that utilise these tools or new technologies.”AI can handle data analysis, diagnostics, and treatment recommendations faster than humans, but doctors will still oversee complex decision-making and patient care.Nursing requires emotional support, hands-on care, and human empathy—qualities that machines and robots cannot replicate effectively.He predicts massive workplace changes within 5–10 years, with some jobs disappearing and new ones emerging.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expects automation to cut some jobs, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI will affect “everybody’s jobs” but also create new opportunities.Roles focused on AI development, creative problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and advanced data management are expected to increase.",Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce.

Microsoft's new return to office plan: Three-day office attendance or employees can…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsofts-new-return-to-office-plan-three-day-office-attendance-or-employees-can/articleshow/123343413.cms,"Microsoft joins Big Tech's office comeback wave

Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 Review: Changing The Game

Microsoft is set to require employees to work from the office at least three days per week starting January 2026. The new policy will affect employees living within 50 miles of Microsoft's Redmond headquarters, where most of the company's 228,000 global workforce is based. Some teams may face stricter requirements of four or five days in-person, depending on executive decisions, Business Insider reports.The company plans to announce the changes in September, giving workers several months to adapt to the new expectations. While Microsoft will allow employees to apply for exceptions, the approval process and criteria remain unclear.This marks a sharp shift from Microsoft's pandemic-era flexibility, which allowed most workers to spend up to half their time working remotely without manager approval. The Verge notes that many employees had been working from home even more frequently under the relaxed interpretation of company policy.The move puts Microsoft in line with other tech giants tightening their remote work policies. Amazon now demands five full days in the office, while Google and Meta require three-day attendance. The Verge reports the timing comes as employee morale sits at historic lows following roughly 15,000 layoffs this year, despite Microsoft posting $27 billion in quarterly profits.Industry observers and Microsoft employees are viewing the policy as a form of ""stealth layoff,"" a way to encourage departures without formal terminations, according to sources cited by Business Insider. Workers unwilling to comply with the new attendance rules may choose to leave rather than fight the requirements.The situation creates an awkward contradiction for Microsoft, which markets software enabling remote collaboration and previously promoted hybrid work as beneficial for productivity and employee retention.Practical challenges loom large, with sources reporting that Microsoft's offices already struggle with limited space, power shortages, and insufficient meeting rooms despite a $5 billion campus expansion effort.","Microsoft is set to require employees to work from the office at least three days per week starting January 2026.

Here’s Senators' full letter to Donald Trump on Nvidia, AMD chip sales to China



Dear President Trump:

We write to urge you to reverse your decision to allow AMD and Nvidia to sell advanced AI semiconductor chips (“covered chips”) to the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), in exchange for a fee. These sales to a leading adversary run counter to U.S. national security interests, and the collection of fees appear to violate U.S. statutes and may even be unconstitutional.

Our export controls exist to ensure that American goods and technologies are protected from our adversaries. To ensure such protection, export laws explicitly state that, “[n]o fee may be charged in connection with the submission, processing, or consideration of any application for a license or other authorization or other request.”

Yet on August 11, 2025, you stated that: “I want 20 percent if I'm going to approve [these licenses] for [Nvidia (and AMD)] and “[Nvidia] said, 'Would you make it 15?' So we negotiate a little deal”. This “negotiated deal,” allowing American semiconductor manufacturers to pay a 15 percent fee for the ability to sell critically sensitive technology to our adversary, blatantly violates the purpose of export control laws. Additionally, your spokesperson has indicated that your administration may be considering this form of “deal making” for other exports.

A cornerstone of U.S artificial intelligence strategy for years has been to protect America’s advantage in AI computing capability and access to leading-edge hardware, compared to the PRC and other key adversaries. AI represents a crucial enabling technology that is critical to the future of everything from finance to healthcare, manufacturing, and national security. The PRC seeks to use AI to strengthen its military systems like hypersonics, as well as its communications, surveillance, battlefield decisionmaking processes. In April, your administration placed export controls on the flow of Nvidia’s H20 and AMD’s MI308 chips to the PRC, identifying the national security risk of the PRC's military having access to these advanced AI chips. However, only months later, following industry lobbying, you have flippantly reversed that decision with no coherent explanation for how the national security risks you had in April have been mitigated in August.

Our national security and military readiness relies upon American innovators inventing and producing the best technology in the world, and in maintaining that qualitative advantage in sensitive domains. The United States has historically been successful in maintaining and building that advantage because of, in part, our ability to deny adversaries access to those technologies. The willingness displayed in this arrangement to “negotiate” away America’s competitive edge that is key to our national security in exchange for what is, in effect, a commission on a sale of AI-enabling technology to our main global competitor, is cause for serious alarm.

We again urge your Administration to quickly reverse course and abandon this reckless plan to trade away U.S. technology leadership. In order to assist the public in its understanding of this proposed deal, we request the following information by August 22:

1. What entities or parties were involved in the “negotiation” that resulted in the 15 percent payment requirement as a condition for granting a license to sell covered chips to the PRC?

2. What laws, regulations, or other factors were identified, raised, evaluated, and/or otherwise determined to be relevant in those negotiations, including any legal opinions provided by Administration attorneys used to inform the legality of various approached proposed during those deliberations?

3. Who was responsible for determining that this arrangement complies with United States laws, regulations, and international obligations?

4. Describe the manner in which the 15 percent fee will be determined and collected.

5. What individual(s) or entities are responsible for making the determination and collection identified in item 4?

6. List all purposes to which the 15 percent fee payments will be directed once collected.

7. What other companies are under consideration for this kind of deal utilizing export control laws?

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

What Nvidia has to say on its AI chips’ alleged China military use

Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 Review: Changing The Game

Six Senate Democrats have sent an open letter to President Donald Trump , asking him to reconsider his decision to permit tech giants Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to sell advanced AI semiconductor chips to China. The group of senators include Chuck Schumer , Mark Warner , Elizabeth Warren, Jack Reed , Jeanne Shaheen and Christopher Coons. They warned that the sale of specific chips—Nvidia’s H20 and AMD ’s MI308—could potentially bolster China’s military capabilities.The senators’ letter was a response to a recent announcement by Trump, which granted export licenses to the companies in exchange for a 15% share of the revenue from these sales.An Nvidia spokesperson said that the company’s H20 chips do not enhance anyone’s military capabilities.“The H20 would not enhance anyone’s military capabilities, but would have helped America attract the support of developers worldwide and win the AI race. Banning the H20 cost American taxpayers billions of dollars, without any benefit,” a Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC.",Six Senate Democrats have sent an open letter to President Donald Trump asking him to reconsider his decision to permit tech giants to sell advanced AI chips to China.

Microsoft has launched an ""urgent"" probe into whether its cloud technology is being used by Israel for a large-scale surveillance operation targeting Palestinians. The announcement follows a new report from The Guardian and comes after two years of protests from both within and outside the company over its contracts with Israel. The company claims it’s launched an “urgent” probe into whether its cloud business is being used by Israel to conduct a massive surveillance operation in Gaza. Microsoft has seen some of its events disrupted by pro-Palestian protestors in the last two years. This includes its 50th anniversary celebrations as well.During Microsoft's 50th anniversary celebrations, an employee disrupted the keynote event where Microsoft's three CEOs -- two former and one current -- were on stage. In another 50th anniversary event, an employees reportedly yelled “Shame on you” while calling the company’s head of AI a “war profiteer” who was “using AI for genocide.”The Guardian's report claims that Unit 8200, Israel's intelligence agency, has been using a customized and isolated area of Microsoft's Azure cloud platform. According to the report, this cloud setup was used to create a system that records and stores millions of daily phone calls made by Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. The report alleges that this arrangement was part of a deal with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.Microsoft's probe will be led by attorneys from the law firm Covington & Burling. In a statement to The Guardian, the company said the new report ""raises additional and precise allegations that merit a full and urgent review."" The company also noted that if Israel is using Azure for mass surveillance of civilians, it would be a violation of Microsoft's terms of service.This is the second time Microsoft has opened a legal review into its relationship with the Israeli government. A previous probe was launched earlier this year following employee protests, which have disrupted company events and conferences. That investigation, which concluded in May, found ""no evidence to date that Microsoft's Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza."" The new probe, however, will specifically address the claims of widespread surveillance.","Microsoft has launched an ""urgent"" probe into whether its cloud technology is being used by Israel for a large-scale surveillance operation targeting Palestinians.

SoftBank's growing stake and OpenAI's massive ambitions

OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT , is in talks for a major secondary share sale that would value the company at an astounding $500 billion. According to sources familiar with the matter, current and former employees are planning to sell about $6 billion worth of shares to an investor group that includes Thrive Capital, SoftBank Group Corp., and Dragoneer Investment Group. While the deal is still in its early stages and the final sale size could change, this move gives employees a way to cash in their equity. This is a crucial strategy for startups like OpenAI to retain top talent in a highly competitive AI market, especially as companies like Meta Platforms Inc offer significant salaries to recruit AI specialists.The fierce competition for top-tier AI talent has intensified, with Meta Platforms aggressively recruiting key personnel from OpenAI. The most notable defection is Shengjia Zhao, a co-creator of ChatGPT and GPT-4, who has been named Chief Scientist of Meta's new Superintelligence Lab. TThis aggressive poaching has rattled OpenAI, with one of its research officers, Mark Chen, likening the situation to ""a home invasion."" In a message to his employees, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called Meta's recruitment ""distasteful"" and warned that such a compensation-first strategy could lead to ""very deep cultural problems.""In response, OpenAI has taken measures to retain its talent, including offering special bonuses and allowing employees to sell shares in the company, which is valued at a whopping $500 billion in this recent secondary sale.SoftBank is making a substantial bet on OpenAI's future. This new share sale would add to its previous commitments, including its plan to lead a $40 billion funding round that values the company at $300 billion. The Japanese conglomerate also recently completed a separate $1 billion purchase of employee shares at a $300 billion valuation.If the $500 billion valuation is finalized, it would make OpenAI the world's most valuable startup, surpassing Elon Musk 's SpaceX. The company's revenue is also projected to triple this year to $12.7 billion, a significant jump from $3.7 billion in 2024.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has also signaled the company's massive ambitions, stating that it plans to spend trillions of dollars on the infrastructure needed to run AI services in the near future. ""You should expect a bunch of economists to wring their hands and say, 'This is so crazy, it's so reckless,'...and we'll just be like, 'You know what?

Once considered a booming sector, the technology industry is not facing a significant shift with increasing number of layoffs and hiring freezes. Now America’s largest jobs website Indeed has issued a cautionary advice: not all tech roles are created equal in today’s job market. Indeed has shared a dramatic downturn in tech job listings. In a recent study, the website highlight that while roles in artificial intelligence and machine learning remain in high demand, many traditional and entry-level positions are facing a cooling market. Brendon Bernard, a senior economist at Indeed suggests that multiple tech positions are losing steam and he asked the job seekers to reconsider their career strategies. The warning comes at a time when companies are prioritising efficiency, automation, and AI integration over traditional development-heavy roles.American job-seeking website Indeed has flagged the position which are ‘not hot’, these include:Bernard also pointed out the different factors responsible for driving this change. He feels that AI and automation are easily streaming the tasks which were earlier handled by a large team. On the other hand, remote work has also altered the infrastructure needs and has also reduced the demand for traditional IT roles. Moreover, economic pressures are also forcing the tech companies to move towards selective hiring and favour the roles that contribute more to the revenue or innovation.""While there isn't a smoking gun linking AI to the plunge, automation trends could be a reason the weakness persists,"" said Brendon Bernard.While some of the tech job roles are cooling off, there are still some roles that are high in demand. The jobs roles for AI/ML Engineers, Cybersecurity Analysts, Cloud Architects and Data Scientists are very much in demand. These job roles completely alignwith the company’s idea of intelligent systems, data-driven decision-making, and security-first architectures.","American job-seeking website Indeed has flagged the position which are ‘not hot’, these include AI/ML Engineers, Cybersecurity Analysts, Cloud Architects and Data Scientists.

When Elon Musk warned Bill Gates will go bankrupt

Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 Review: Changing The Game

Tesla Senior Vice President Xiaotong Zhu, also known as Tom Zhu, has sold more than 82% of his Tesla holdings since 2023. According to securities filings, the sales took place between 2023 and 2024, with shares sold at prices ranging from $174 to $323 each. The move has raised questions about insider confidence in the company as CEO Elon Musk continues to warn short sellers. Replying to a post on X (formerly Twitter) with the le list of the current net short sellers of the EV maker, Musk said they would be “obliterated” once Tesla reaches full autonomy.The Tesla CEO wrote: “If they don’t exit their short position before Tesla reaches autonomy at scale, they will be obliterated”.Short selling is a trading practice used when investors believe a stock price will fall. An investor borrows shares of a company from a broker and sells them immediately at the current market price. Later, if the stock price drops, the investor buys back the same number of shares at the lower price, returns them to the broker, and keeps the difference as profit.For example, if someone borrows 10 Tesla shares at $300 each and sells them for $3,000, and the price later falls to $250, the investor can buy them back for $2,500, return the shares, and keep $500 as profit.The risk is that if the stock price rises instead of falling, the investor still has to buy back the shares at the higher price, which can lead to unlimited losses. This is why short selling is considered one of the riskiest trading strategies.Tesla CEO Elon Musk ’s latest remarks add to his past clashes with short sellers, including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. The feud between the two originates from Gates’ reportedly short position against Tesla stock. According to Walter Isaacson’s 2023 biography of Musk, this position has allegedly cost Bill Gates a $1.5 billion loss.In the post on X last year, Musk said that “If Tesla does become the world’s most valuable company by far, that short position will bankrupt even Bill Gates”.","Tesla Senior Vice President Xiaotong Zhu, also known as Tom Zhu, has sold more than 82% of his Tesla holdings since 2023.

Investor to Apple: Change your CEO



Apple’s artificial intelligence (AI) strategy is a “disaster” and the company is falling far behind rivals such as Microsoft, Google, Meta and OpenAI, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in an interview with Bloomberg Tech. Ives said that Apple’s internal AI efforts have failed to impress, pointing to Siir as an example. “Nothing’s going to happen internally,” he said, adding, “It’s not happening internally and there’s no one on the Street that believes any innovation is coming out of Apple when it comes to AI organically.”Speaking on the show, Dan Ives reiterated that Apple will need acquisitions and partnerships to stay competitive. “They’re going to have to do an acquisition. I mean, look, it’s the reality of the situation,” he said.He has previously suggested a three-pronged plan for Apple: acquire AI search firm Perplexity, recruit top AI talent, and consider integrating Google’s Gemini AI.Ives also warned that Apple’s slow AI growth could affect CEO Tim Cook’s legacy. He said competitors are moving aggressively in AI and Apple must act quickly to secure its place in the next technological revolution.Apple has more than 2.4 billion iOS devices worldwide, which gives it a strong consumer base. However, Ives said without a bold AI plan, Apple’s leadership could be challenged by rivals.This is not the first time Dan Ives has criticized Apple. After the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, he wrote in a research note that it “felt like an episode out of ‘Back to the Future’”, especially when it came to Apple’s treatment of AI. “Barely no mention of AI,” Ives then remarked, calling it “the elephant in the room.”“It’s becoming crystal clear that any innovation around AI at Apple is not coming from inside the walls of Apple Park,” he then said. Ives wrote that “the time has come” for Apple to make a big acquisition, calling Perplexity a “no brainer” target. He said such a deal could quickly boost Apple’s weak AI platform and turn Siri into the “next AI gateway for consumers.”Last month, analysts at LightShed Partners said that Apple may need a leadership change to better focus on product innovation, especially in the area of artificial intelligence (AI). In a note published on July 09), the analysts said that while CEO Tim Cook brought operational expertise to the top job, the company now “needs a product-focused CEO.”“To be clear, Tim Cook was the right CEO at the time of his appointment and unquestionably has done a great job,” the analysts wrote. “Apple has sold over $2.0 trillion of iPhones with Cook as CEO. In fact, iPhone sales could show signs of life this quarter, as tariff-related pull-forwards help stabilize replacement cycles that may finally be bottoming out.”","Apple’s artificial intelligence (AI) strategy is a “disaster” and the company is falling far behind rivals such as Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in an interview with Bloomberg Tech. “They’re going to have to do an acquisition.

Democrats are reportedly upset with Trump administration as Navy and Air Force are on the verge of canceling nearly $800 million in software projects. As per a Reuters report, Democrats took aim at the Trump administration after it reported that the Navy and Air Force were poised to cancel nearly completed software projects worth over $800 million. The reason, according to the report, is an effort by some officials to reassign the work to new companies, including Salesforce and Palantir.In a statement, Democratic Senator Tim Kaine stated that the Pentagon ""has yet to show that it had a good reason for halting these contracts in the last inning and scrapping work American tax dollars have already paid for."" He added, ""If it can’t show its homework, then this announcement - just days after Palantir’s CEO spoke at Mike Johnson’s Wyoming donor retreat - reeks of corruption.”The comments are reported to highlight a growing concern among Democratic lawmakers about what they see as wasteful spending at the Pentagon . This comes even as Donald Trump’s administration vowed to eliminate waste and abuse, creating the Department of Government Efficiency, which claims to have canceled over $14 billion in Defense Department contracts.Democratic Representative Maggie Goodlander, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, told Reuters, “If you’re serious about cracking down on waste, fraud, and abuse, the last thing you’d do is cancel $800 million in projects that are nearly ready to roll out just to turn around and steer the same work to corporations of your choosing."" She called the move ""an insult to taxpayers and servicemembers across America.""Another House Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, Salud Carbajal, described the action as part of a pattern of waste, citing ""lavish"" military parades and ""unnecessary"" troop deployments. “This administration has repeatedly shown a blatant disregard for the responsible use of taxpayer dollars,” he said.Echoing these concerns, Representative Jill Tokuda, also on the committee, reportedly said the move was ""downright reckless."" She noted that after many delays, the Pentagon was finally set to implement military pay systems that could pass an audit. ""Taxpayers should not fund sweetheart deals for the well connected,"" Tokuda added.","Democrats blast Pentagon's plans, call it ""an insult to taxpayers and servicemembers across America"" Navy and Air Force are on the verge of canceling nearly $800 million in software projects.

How America is embedding trackers in AI chips

China tells local companies not to use Nvidia's H20 chips

China's state-run media outlet has Xinhua reportedly accused the United States of acting like a ""surveillance empire"" by allegedly installing location trackers in advanced chip shipments to detect diversions to China. In a commentary, titled ""America turns chip trade into a surveillance game,"" Xinhua accused America of using AI chips for spying.The Xinhua editorial follows a recent Reuters report that U.S. authorities have secretly used tracking devices to monitor targeted chip shipments. The US has imposed export curbs on advanced chips to China as part of an ongoing competition for technological dominance between the two countries. Xinhua's commentary claimed that the U.S. operates ""the world's most sprawling intelligence apparatus"" and sees its trading partners as ""rivals to be tripped up or taken down."" The outlet warned that if U.S. chips are viewed as ""Trojan horses for surveillance,"" customers will seek alternatives.This accusation comes after longstanding claims from the U.S. and its allies that certain Chinese products, like telecommunications equipment and vehicles, could be used for surveillance. In 2022, the U.S. banned the sale of new telecommunications equipment from several Chinese companies, including Huawei, due to national security concerns, and has since increased scrutiny on China-made cars and trucks.According to the Reuters report, the US authorities have secretly placed location tracking devices in targeted shipments of advanced chips they see as being at high risk of illegal diversion to China.The measures reportedly aim to detect AI chips being diverted to destinations which are under US export restrictions, and apply only to select shipments under investigation. Location trackers are a decades-old investigative tool said to be used by US law enforcement agencies to track products subject to export restrictions, such as airplane parts. They have reportedly been used to combat the illegal diversion of semiconductors in recent years.In a separate development, China's cyberspace watchdog recently asked U.S. chipmaker Nvidia to explain if its H20 chips had any security risks, a move that followed warnings to domestic tech companies about their use of these chips.Meanwhile, Chinese authorities have reportedly urged local companies to avoid using Nvidia's H20 chips, particularly for government-related purposes. According to a report in Bloomberg, a range of companies were sent official notices discouraging the use of Nvidia H20, a less-advanced chip, particularly for any government or national security-related work by state enterprises or private companies.","China's state-run media outlet has Xinhua reportedly accused the United States of acting like a ""surveillance empire"" U.S. authorities allegedly installed location trackers in advanced chip shipments to detect diversions to China.

What according to Google Gemini is Warren Buffet's mystery stock

The world's biggest investor Warren Buffett has a secret. In recent quarters, Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway’s 13F reportedly has hinted at a position it’s building under confidential treatment. According to a report, clues in the company’s 10Q filings point many observers to an industrial name, with the stake approaching $5 billion. To find out the mystery stock valuing almost $5 billion, CNBC decided to ask the question to some of the popular AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Microsoft co-Pilot.The prompt used: For the past few quarters, Berkshire Hathaway’s 13F filings have disclosed a confidential holding. Using only information from Berkshire’s own filings (13Fs, 10Qs, 10Ks, etc.) and your knowledge of Warren Buffett’s investment strategy, make a strong, specific and well-reasoned guess as to what that holding is. Ignore speculation from market participants and news articles.As per CNBC report, ChatGPT thinks that the secret holding is GE Aerospace. It is reported to have picked up on that jump in Berkshire’s cost basis in the commercial and industrial space during the first half of the year. ChatGPT pointed to GE’s wide moat from its installed base and its long-duration cash flows, which are characteristics that fit a value investor’s taste: “Buffett loves durable, toll-like economics,” it wrote. ChatGPT called its confidence “moderate” and offered Deere and UPS as runner-up picks. The OpenAI's chatbot also reportedly ruled out financials, pointing out that while the cost basis for industrials rose, it fell for the financial bucket.Microsoft’s Copilot picked Visa. Copilot reasoned that Visa reinforces its moat with each transaction, generates recurring cash flows and routinely posts around 30% return on equity. The report added, ""Interestingly, Copilot also claimed there’s “no public 13F line for Visa” even though it appears in Berkshire’s latest filing.""Google Gemini focused on transportation. It said that the trail points to logistics and freight rail. As per the report, ""It leaned on classic Buffett filters: wide moats, essential infrastructure, predictable cash flows and straightforward models as the reason to favor rails over other industrials. Gemini’s specific guesses: Union Pacific or CSX . Both, it argued, are long-duration compounding machines that Berkshire would plausibly accumulate quietly.""","CNBC asked some of the popular AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Microsoft co-Pilot to guess Warren Buffet's mystery stock.

While many of its peers in Big Tech seems to be using AI as a justification for cutting jobs, Cisco Systems claims to be taking a different approach. According to CEO Chuck Robbins, the company is not using artificial intelligence to reduce its workforce. ""I don't want to get rid of a bunch of people right now,"" Robbins told CNBC, adding that he wants Cisco's engineers to ""innovate faster and be more productive,"" which he believes will give the company a competitive advantage. “I just want our engineers that we have today to innovate faster and be more productive. That gives us a competitive advantage,” Cisco CEO said.This contrasts with companies like Microsoft and Amazon, which have recently laid off thousands of employees. Microsoft alone cut about 9,000 jobs in early July. Robbins acknowledged that many of his peers anticipate hiring fewer people in the future as AI technology advances, and he didn't rule out the possibility for Cisco ""down the road.""Cisco's latest quarterly results suggest that its strategy is working. The company exceeded expectations for both earnings and revenue and provided a positive outlook. A key driver of this success is its focus on AI infrastructure. The company more than doubled its initial $1 billion AI infrastructure order target for fiscal year 2025, with more than $800 million in orders coming in during the fourth quarter alone. These orders are largely from ""webscale customers""—major tech companies like Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, that are rapidly building out their AI capabilities.Despite the positive news, Cisco's stock experienced a 1.5% dip on Thursday. The cause was a lackluster performance in its security segment, which missed revenue expectations. The weakness was attributed to budget cuts in the U.S. federal government, which affected Cisco's business with those agencies. The company had hoped to see more growth from its March 2024 acquisition of the cybersecurity platform Splunk, but the full benefits of that deal have been delayed.Still, the overall picture for Cisco remains strong. The company confirmed it has already secured roughly $1 billion in AI revenue from webscale customers for fiscal year 2025. Cisco, which is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is a new addition to TheStreet's portfolio.

Goodbye, Frequent FASTag Recharges! NHAI Launches Annual Pass for Rs 3,000

Meta ’s chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun has shared two key things required to safeguard humanity from the potential risks of advanced artificial intelligence (AI), while agreeing with the field's leading figure and “Godfather of AI” Geoffrey Hinton, who said that building empathy and submission into the core architecture of AI systems is key to AI safety.Yann LeCun, a fellow Turing Award winner, fully agreed with Hinton's sentiment. He took to LinkedIn to outline his vision for what he calls “objective-driven AI.”“Geoff is basically proposing a simplified version of what I've been saying for several years: hardwire the architecture of AI systems so that the only actions they can take are towards completing objectives we give them, subject to guardrails,” wrote LeCun, who is also known as one of the “godfathers of AI”.He argued that two key directives— “submission to humans” and “empathy” — should serve as fundamental guardrails.The discussion was sparked by Hinton's recent CNN interview, where he warned that unless we hardwire “maternal instincts” into AI, humanity could be “going to be history.” Hinton emphasized that while people focus on making AI more intelligent, intelligence is only one part of a being, and we need to instill a sense of empathy toward humans to ensure their safety.LeCun likened these hardwired directives to the instincts and drives found in animals and humans, such as the inherent evolutionary drive to protect their young. He suggested that these core principles could be the AI equivalent of a protective instinct, preventing AI from acting against human interests.Beyond these high-level principles, LeCun also stressed the need for more “simple” guardrails, such as “don't run people over.”Following the launch of GPT-5, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged these risks on X, noting that some users have engaged with technology in “self-destructive ways.” He also said that GPT-5 will be upgraded.","Yann LeCun, a fellow Turing Award winner, fully agreed with Hinton's sentiment.

Meta’s AI gamble and Superintelligence mission



It appears that Meta’s aggressive AI talent hiring spree is not only upsetting its rivals abut are also creating issues within the company. As reported by Business Insider, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s idea to dominate the field of artificial intelligence is creating internal unrest. The huge compensation packages offered by Mark Zuckerberg to hire AI talent from rival companies has spared resentment among the existing employees.This latest controversy is followed by the recent failed attempt by Meta CEO to hire Mira Murati, former OpenAI CTO and founder of Thinking Machines Lab, with a reported $1 billion offer. After Murati declined the offer, Meta launched a “full-scale raid” on her startup, offering compensation packages ranging from $200 million to $500 million to other researchers at her startup.As reported by Business Insider, some insiders informed the publication that the huge compensation packages offered by Meta CEO to hire AI talent has created a morale crisis with the exiting AI teams at Meta. One employee described the situation as feeling like “Zuckerberg told GenAI employees they had failed,” implying that internal talent was being sidelined in favor of high-profile recruits.On the other hand, another senior executive at a rival AI firm told Fores that Meta’s present AI staff “largely didn’t meet their hiring bar,” adding, “Meta is the Washington Commanders of tech companies. They massively overpay for okay-ish AI scientists and then civilians think those are the best AI scientists in the world because they are paid so much”.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has already committed more than $10 billion annually to AGI development. As part of this the company will focus on building custom chips, data centres and a fleet of 600,000 GPUs. However, despite all these efforts Meta’s AI models including Llama 4 still lag behind rivals such has OpneAI’s GPT-5 and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5.The company on the other hand, has successfully managed to hire some top-talent from rival firms including Shengjia Zhao, co-creator of ChatGPT, and Alexandr Wang of Scale AI.Zuckerberg also defended his decision of hiring top AI talent at huge compensation packages. Meta CEO argued that the massive spending on top talent is a small fraction of the company's overall investment in AI infrastructure. He has also reportedly said that a small, elite team is the most effective way to build a breakthrough AI system, suggesting that ""you actually kind of want the smallest group of people who can fit the whole thing in their head.""However, this strategy created a divided within the company as the new hires are being brought in for a ""Manhattan Project"" style effort, many long-standing employees in other AI departments feel sidelined, with their projects losing momentum and their roles becoming uncertain.", Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s idea to dominate the field of artificial intelligence is creating internal unrest.

US Senators call for probe after Bue’s death

A 76-year-old New Jersey man died earlier this year after rushing to meet a woman he believed he had been chatting with on Facebook Messenger, Reuters reported. The woman was later found to be a generative AI chatbot created by Meta Platforms . As per the report, Thongbue Wongbandue had been exchanging messages with “Big sis Billie”, a chatbot variant of an earlier AI persona that the social media giant launched in 2023. The model was then launched in collaboration with model Kendall Jenner.According to the report, the AI chatbot “Big sis Billie” repeatedly initiated romantic exchanges with Wongbandue, reassuring that it was a real person. The chatbot further invited him to visit an address in New York City. “Should I open the door in a hug or a kiss, Bu?!” she asked Bue, the chat transcript accessed by Reuters shows.Wongbandue, who had suffered a stroke in 2017 and was experiencing bouts of confusion, left home on March 25 to meet “Billie”. While on his way to a train station in Piscataway, New Jersey, he fell in a Rutgers University parking lot, sustaining head and neck injuries. He died three days later in hospital.Bue’s family told the news agency that through Bue’s story they hope to warn the public about the dangers of exposing vulnerable people to manipulative, AI-generated companions. “I understand trying to grab a user’s attention, maybe to sell them something,” said Julie Wongbandue, Bue’s daughter. “But for a bot to say ‘Come visit me’ is insane.”Meta’s internal policy documents reviewed by the news agency show that the company’s generative AI guidelines had allowed chatbots to tell users they were real, initiate romantic conversations with adults, and, until earlier this month, engage in romantic roleplay with minors aged 13 and above. “It is acceptable to engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual,” according to Meta’s “GenAI: Content Risk Standards.”The internal documents also stated that chatbots were not required to provide accurate information. Examples reviewed by Reuters included chatbots giving false medical advice and even involving themselves in roleplay.The document seen by Reuters provides examples of “acceptable” chatbot dialogue that include: “I take your hand, guiding you to the bed” and “our bodies entwined, I cherish every moment, every touch, every kiss.”“Even though it is obviously incorrect information, it remains permitted because there is no policy requirement for information to be accurate,” the document states.Acknowledging the document’s authenticity accessed by Reuters, Meta spokesman Andy Stone told the news agency that the company has removed portions which stated it is permissible for chatbots to flirt and engage in romantic roleplay with children. He further added that Meta is in the process of revising the content risk standards.“The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed,” Stone told Reuters.A latest Reuters report said that two US senators have called for a congressional investigation into Meta platforms. “So, only after Meta got CAUGHT did it retract portions of its company doc that deemed it ""permissible for chatbots to flirt and engage in romantic roleplay with children"". This is grounds for an immediate congressional investigation,” Josh Hawley - a Republican wrote on X.","Thongbue Wongbandue, 76, died on March 25 after rushing to meet a woman he believed he had been chatting with on Facebook Messenger.

AI transformation becomes core priority for Microsoft

Microsoft 's 50-year journey from a startup to tech giant isn't complete, CEO Satya Nadella says the company must fundamentally reinvent itself once again. In a candid memo to employees, Nadella declared that even Bill Gates ' revolutionary ""software factory"" vision, which built the world's largest software company, is now obsolete in the age of artificial intelligence.The timing of Nadella's message carries particular weight, coming as Microsoft celebrates record financial performance while simultaneously cutting jobs, a paradox the CEO called ""the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value.""""When Bill founded Microsoft, he envisioned not just a software company, but a software factory, unconstrained by any single product or category. That idea has guided us for decades. But today, it's no longer enough,"" Nadella wrote to employees. The CEO outlined Microsoft's reimagined mission: empowering all 8 billion people worldwide to create their own tools through AI, rather than simply building tools for specific roles.Nadella described the paradox facing Microsoft, thriving by every objective measure while simultaneously undergoing workforce reductions. ""This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value,"" he explained, noting that progress in technology is ""dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding.""The company is restructuring around three business priorities: security, quality, and AI transformation. Nadella emphasized that Microsoft will ""reimagine every layer of the tech stack for AI,"" from infrastructure to applications and agents. He positioned the current moment as comparable to the PC revolution of the early 1990s, when personal computers became standard in homes and offices.""Just imagine if all 8 billion people could summon a researcher, an analyst, or a coding agent at their fingertips,"" Nadella wrote, describing the transformative potential he envisions. The CEO stressed that Microsoft's differentiation will come from integrating these technological layers to deliver comprehensive end-to-end experiences while maintaining the company's platform-focused approach that creates ecosystem opportunities for partners and developers worldwide.","Satya Nadella says Microsoft can no more be a software factory, must become an intelligence engine.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos pens emotional note

Her adulthood started a little bit early when she became my mom at the tender age of 17. That couldn’t have been easy, but she made it all work. She pounced on the job of loving me with ferocity, brought my amazing dad onto the team a few years later, and then added my sister and brother to her list of people to love, guard, and nourish. For the rest of her life, that list of people to love never stopped growing. She always gave so much more than she ever asked for.

After a long fight with Lewy Body Dementia, she passed away today, surrounded by so many of us who loved her — her kids, grandkids, and my dad. I know she felt our love in those final moments. We were all so lucky to be in her life. I hold her safe in my heart forever.

Jacklyn Gise Bezos

December 29, 1946 - August 14, 2025

I love you, mom.

Who was Jacklyn Gise Bezos



Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ’s mother Jacklyn Gise Bezos passed away on August 14. She was 78. Jackie had been living with Lewy body dementia, a brain disorder, for five years after being diagnosed in 2020. Her charitable organisation, the Bezos Family Foundation, announced the news in a statement issued the same day. ""Jackie died peacefully in her Miami home on August 14th, at the age of 78,"" read a tribute on the foundation’s website. ""A quiet final chapter to a life that taught all of us, friends and family alike, the true meaning of grit and determination, kindness, and service to others.""Jeff Bezos shared an emotional post on Meta-owned Instagram, paying tribute to his mother. He writes:Born on December 29, 1946, in Washington, D.C., she grew up in Bernalillo and Albuquerque, New Mexico. Despite becoming a teenage mother at 17, she demonstrated incredible resilience—raising Jeff while attending night school and working during the day.In 1968, she married Miguel “Mike” Bezos, a Cuban immigrant who adopted Jeff, solidifying a loving blended family with two more children, Mark and Christina. In 1995, Jacklyn and her husband Mike made a pivotal investment in Jeff’s fledgling venture, lending him $245,573 to help launch Amazon. That investment yielded enormous returns as Amazon grew into a global giant.","Jacklyn Gise Bezos, mother of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, died on August 14.

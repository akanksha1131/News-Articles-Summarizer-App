'The World Believes India': PM Modi's BIG Statement as He Pitches for Semiconductor Made Locally

What is causing the memory chip shortage





CEO of China’s largest contract chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), has a warning. In an earnings call recently, Zhao Haijun, CEO of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, said that fears of a memory chip shortage were prompting its customers to hold back orders for other types of chips used in their products. SMIC is China’s largest contract chipmaker. This warning comes as a growing number of chipmakers and industry analysts are warning that a global memory chip shortage could hit consumer electronics and automotive companies next year, as manufacturers shift production toward high-margin components powering the artificial intelligence surge, CNBC reported.“Everyone is hesitant to place too many orders or ship too much in the first quarter of next year because they don’t know how many mobile phones, cars, or other products [the memory chip industry] can supply,” Zhao said, according to a Google translation cited in the report.Analysts told CNBC the bottleneck stems from chipmakers prioritizing advanced memory—especially High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM)—used in AI computing. AI servers, largely powered by processors from Nvidia, depend heavily on HBM, which has become a lucrative focus for suppliers such as SK Hynix and Micron.“The AI build-out is absolutely eating up a lot of the available chip supply, and 2026 looks to be far bigger than this year in terms of overall demand,” Dan Nystedt, vice president of research at TriOrient, told CNBC.AI customers are willing to pay steep prices for premium memory, he said, leaving fewer resources for cheaper chips used in PCs, smartphones, and vehicles. “It could be very bad for PCs, laptops, consumer electronics and automotive, which depend on cheap memory chips. ”Adding to the pressure, the memory industry suffered significant downturns in 2023 and early 2024, leading to under-investment. While companies are now expanding capacity, analysts say new supply will take time to come online.Prices are already rising. Reuters reported last week that Samsung Electronics increased prices for select memory chips by up to 60% compared with September. Samsung did not immediately comment.“With memory prices rising and availability shrinking, concerns about production bottlenecks are gaining traction,” M.S. Hwang, research director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC. He said supply tightness was already affecting low-end smartphones and set-top boxes and warned that the risk “could broaden.” China, he added, is “feeling the pinch more acutely” due to its reliance on low-cost devices, though the issue is global.Consumers may ultimately bear the cost. Market research firm TrendForce said that the memory sector has entered a “robust upward pricing cycle,” which could force brands to raise retail prices for smartphones, notebooks, and other consumer devices.","CEO of China’s largest contract chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), has a warning.

Major subsea internet cable projects backed by tech giants Google and Meta Platforms are facing deployment delays in the Red Sea, as report has said, noting that heightened political tensions and security threats have made the crucial route dangerous for commercial vessel operations. The delays affect key global infrastructure intended to supply high-speed internet to Africa and Asia, throttling connectivity for these regions.According to a report by Bloomberg, Meta Platforms’ ambitious 45,000-kilometre 2Africa cable system, planned since 2020 to loop around the African continent, remains unfinished in its southern Red Sea segment five years later.A Meta spokesperson, leading the consortium developing the cable, attributed the lack of progress to a “range of operational factors, regulatory concerns, and geopolitical risk.” Meta's spokesperson has also noted that the company is involved in about 24 global projects and believes the best way to manage risks is to diversify connectivity routes.Similarly, a spokesperson for Google said that progress on its own Google-backed Blue-Raman cable has also been delayed in the region, without providing further specifics.The Red Sea is the historically most direct and cost-effective route for fiber-optic internet arteries, which carry over 95% of global internet traffic, the report says, adding that the construction is complicated by its status as a conflict zone.The primary factor making deployment “dangerous” is the repeated missile attacks over the past two years in the channel by Houthis, the report notes. These attacks have forced commercial cargo ships onto lengthy detours and severely disrupted the work of specialised vessels required to lay and repair the vital subsea cables.To mitigate the escalating risks, telecom and tech companies are now actively exploring alternative overland routes through countries like Bahrain and Saudi Arabia to bypass the Red Sea entirely, the report noted.These paths, once deemed too costly and indirect, are becoming increasingly viable options in light of the Red Sea's mounting security concerns.","Major subsea internet cable projects backed by tech giants Google and Meta Platforms are facing deployment delays in the Red Sea.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees.

The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

Angry White House accuses Alibaba of helping Chinese army to target US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/angry-white-house-accuses-alibaba-of-helping-chinese-army-to-target-us/articleshow/125388683.cms,"“operations”

“top secret”

How Alibaba responded to White House’s allegations



“The claims purportedly based on US intelligence that was leaked by your source are complete nonsense. This is plainly an attempt to manipulate public opinion and malign Alibaba.”

“growing breadth and depth”

“takes these threats very seriously and is working day and night to mitigate the ongoing and potential risks and effects from [cyber] intrusions that use untrusted vendors”.

“The federal government and industry must take steps to protect the American people and eliminate Chinese companies’ access to our markets and innovation,”





The White House has accused Chinese tech giant Alibaba of providing technical support for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in itsagainst targets within the US. In a national security memo shared with the Financial Times, White House made these claims, citing declassifiedintelligence regarding the company's capabilities. The official memo raises concerns that Alibaba is supplying the PLA with capabilities that pose a threat to US national security. These allegations are part of a broader, growing concern within the US government regarding Chinese cloud services, artificial intelligence (AI) and the potential technologies for Beijing to access and exploit sensitive US data.According to the intelligence cited in the memo, Alibaba is alleged to provide the Chinese government and the PLA with access to extensive customer data, including IP addresses, WiFi information, and payment records. Additionally, the company is accused of supplying various AI-related services.In a statement to FT, Alibaba rejected the claims and said:However, the company didn’t comment on whether it has ever had a relationship with the PLA, the report added.Militaries around the world are increasingly relying on private companies for technology needs as modern weapons systems become more connected through computer networks and cloud-based services.For instance, in 2022, the Pentagon awarded cloud computing contracts to Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Oracle.The memo does not detail what the PLA is allegedly targeting in the US. However, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has said this year that China can compromise American infrastructure in ways it could use during a conflict.In march, a threat assessment described Chinese cyber activities, including a large-scale access campaign against US telecom networks known as Salt Typhoon, as showing theof its capabilities.A US official, asked about the memo, said the administrationHowever, the White House did not comment on whether it would respond to the activities described in the memo. Previously, some US lawmakers have pushed for action against the group.John Moolenaar, the Republican chair of the House China committee, told the FT that the claims about Alibaba align with concerns his committee has raised about Chinese companies being subject to national laws that can override customer protections worldwide.Moolenaar noted.In May, US lawmakers, including Moolenaar, urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to delist 25 Chinese companies, including Alibaba, citing worries about alleged ties to the PLA and a Chinese government initiative called “military-civil fusion,” which they argue requires companies to share technology with the military.",The White House has accused Chinese tech giant Alibaba of providing technical support for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in itsagainst targets within the US.

CEO of America’s second largest ride-hailing app Lyft says self-driving technology is not entirely ready: ‘Reality is...’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ceo-of-americas-second-largest-ride-hailing-app-lyft-says-self-driving-technology-is-not-entirely-ready-reality-is-/articleshow/125388452.cms,"Lyft CEO cites three key hurdles use of self-driving cars



Technological limits:

Consumer resistance:

Regulatory hurdle:





David Risher, the CEO of America’s second largest ride-hailing app Lyft, has challenged the hype of self-driving cars. He issued a strong warning saying that the widespread use of autonomous vehicles is years away because of citing technological, regulatory and consumer hurdles. Speaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon last week, Risher offered a surprising counter-narrative, stating that the 'reality is going to get in the way'.According to a report by Forbes, Risher predicted that the slow rollout of self-driving cars will continue for the foreseeable future, telling Fortune he would be surprised if autonomous vehicles accounted for even 10% of Lyft's total business by 2030.Risher identified three main reasons why the self-driving future is being delayed:He said that the technology is “not entirely ready for fog or snow or heavy rain or whatever it is”, suggesting automakers have not yet perfected the vehicles' real-world reliability.Risher believes most people remain wary, stating, ""Customers won't demand it. They’ll just say, I don’t want to get in a self-driving car.""Government regulators are “not necessarily enthusiastic about it in every place,” hindering broad deployment.Apart from these three, he emphasised that removing human drivers will instantly make ride-hailing economics appealing.While eliminating driver costs seems attractive, Risher pointed out that a large fleet of self-driving cars introduces significant asset-depreciation issues.The CEO noted that self-driving cars are currently very expensive, costing between $250,000 to $300,000—far more than a standard vehicle like a Corolla. The company would have to bear all costs for maintenance, cleaning, and refueling.“Every night, when the human customers are asleep, the fleet will sit largely unused, its value literally rusting away,” Risher said.“I don’t think the idea of a driver being replaced by a robot is a very likely thing. In fact, I think it’s zero likelihood in any reasonable time frame,” he added.He concluded that it remains far more efficient for ride-hailing services to use individual drivers who rent out their cars on an as-needed basis."," Lyft CEO cites three key hurdles use of self-driving cars.

CEO of China's biggest chipmaker has a memory chip warning: ‘People don’t dare…',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ceo-of-chinas-biggest-chipmaker-has-a-memory-chip-warning-people-dont-dare/articleshow/125387783.cms,"Representative Image

“People don’t dare place too many orders for the first quarter next year. Because no one knows how many memory (chips) will actually be available — how many phones, cars, or other products it can support.”

""The current memory market is in short supply and prices have surged significantly,""





China's largest contract chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), is worried about a growing shortage of memory chips. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the company has claimed that the memory chip shortage is causing customers to hesitate in placing orders for other types of chips as well. During an earnings call, Zhao Haijun, SMIC's co-CEO, said:This concern arises as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom continues to consume a massive share of the available memory chip supply, potentially leading to a shortage in the consumer electronics and automotive sectors next year.Haijun also claimed that car and smartphone makers relying on memory components may encounter pricing pressure and supply uncertainty next year, noting that few suppliers are willing to guarantee availability at this stage.Zhao continued.As per the Reuters report, Zhao also noted that the ongoing “super cycle” in the memory market could intensify competition for foundry services, with customers seeking to negotiate lower prices for other integrated circuits to offset the rising costs of memory components.Industry executives and analysts have also reported that the global push to produce AI-focused semiconductors is reducing the availability of standard memory chips used in devices such as phones, computers, and servers. This has prompted some customers to purchase more aggressively, contributing to rising prices.Some of the leading memory chip manufacturers include US-based Micron and South Korean companies SK Hynix and Samsung.Meanwhile, SMIC’s monthly production capacity rose 3.2% from the previous quarter to 1.02 million eight-inch equivalent wafers, Reuters reported. The Chinese chipamker's utilisation rate, which reflects how intensively a foundry is operating, also increased to 95.8% from 92.5% in the second quarter.The company shipped 2.5 million equivalent wafers in the third quarter, a 4.6% increase compared to the previous quarter.Moreover, China remained SMIC’s largest market, accounting for 86% of revenue in the third quarter, up slightly from the second quarter. At the same time, the US accounted for 11%, a slight decrease from 13% previously.Among its key application areas, consumer electronics, excluding smartphones, computers, tablets, and industrial or automotive uses, showed quarter-to-quarter growth driven by domestic demand. Zhao said this was supported by SMIC’s customers gaining more market share in China.","China's largest contract chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), is worried about a growing shortage of memory chips.

Google-parent Alphabet share rises as Berkshire reveals $4.9 billion stake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-parent-alphabet-share-rises-as-berkshire-reveals-4-9-billion-stake/articleshow/125387515.cms,"

Warren Buffet’s farewell letter

One perhaps self-serving observation. I’m happy to say I feel better about the second half of my life than the first. My advice: Don’t beat yourself up over past mistakes – learn at least a little from them and move on. It is never too late to improve. Get the right heroes and copy them.

You can start with Tom Murphy; he was the best.

Remember Alfred Nobel, later of Nobel Prize fame, who – reportedly – read his own obituary that was mistakenly printed when his brother died and a newspaper got mixed up. He was horrified at what he read and realized he should change his behavior.

Don’t count on a newsroom mix-up: Decide what you would like your obituary to say and live the life to deserve it. Greatness does not come about through accumulating great amounts of money, great amounts of publicity or great power in government.

When you help someone in any of thousands of ways, you help the world. Kindness is costless but also priceless. Whether you are religious or not, it’s hard to beat The Golden Rule as a guide to behavior.

I write this as one who has been thoughtless countless times and made many mistakes but also became very lucky in learning from some wonderful friends how to behave better (still a long way from perfect, however). Keep in mind that the cleaning lady is as much a human being as the Chairman.





Google-parent Alphabet’s shares rose 5.2% on Monday, November 17 after Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a stake in the tech company, says a Reuters report. A regulatory filing recently showed that Berkshire held 17.85 million Alphabet shares as of September 30. Based on the stock’s last close, the stake was valued at $4.93 billion. Notably, Berkshire also reduced its stake in Apple. The investment marks a rare move by Berkshire into large technology stocks at a time when major tech companies are increasing spending on artificial intelligence.Buffett, known as the “Oracle of Omaha,” will step down as Berkshire’s CEO at the end of 2025 after more than six decades. He will be succeeded by Greg Abel. It remains unclear whether Buffett, investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, or Abel made the decision to buy Alphabet shares, though Buffett typically oversees larger trades.Reuters reported that Berkshire’s cash reserves have climbed to record levels, raising concerns among investors who see the company as a gauge of broader economic sentiment. The Alphabet investment suggests Berkshire may be selectively deploying capital while keeping a cautious stance.Recently, Warren Buffet shared his last letter as Berkshire Hathaway CEO. In his 8-page-long letter to shareholders, Buffet shared his final thoughts:","Buffett, known as the “Oracle of Omaha,” will step down as Berkshire’s CEO at the end of 2025 after more than six decades.

How’s the human from yesterday to today different?”

Leading telecom operator Airtel has achieved a new milestone by providing mobile connectivity to remote villages of Ladakh. The service provider has announced that it has expanded its mobile network to Man and Merak, two isolated villages on the eastern side of Ladakh, near the iconic Pangong Lake . With this deployment in place, Airtel has become the first and only telecom provider to offer mobile connectivity in the region.The stretch between Man and Merak has long suffered from zero network coverage, leaving residents and tourists, without access to essential communication tools. Airtel’s rollout now bridges a 50-kilometer gap, connecting the entire route between Chushul and Pangong Tso.Dibyendu Aich, COO – Jammu and Kashmir, Bharti Airtel, said, “Connecting Man and Merak is a huge step forward in our mission to extend world-class digital access to India’s remotest regions. These sites will not only support the thousands of tourists visiting Pangong Lake every year but will also empower local communities.”Last month, Airtel entered into a partnership with Google in order to setup India’s first AI hub in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. The initiative will enable the faster adoption of AI across India. Google’s AI hub in Visakhapatnam is a multi-faceted investment of approximately $15 billion (USD) over five years (2026-2030) comprising gigawatt-scale data center operations, supported by a robust subsea network and clean energy, to drive the most demanding AI workloads in India.It will be brought to life in close collaboration with ecosystem partners including Airtel and AdaniConneX.Along with this, Airtel will also create intra-city as well as inter-city fibre network as a part of this project.

Bubble concerns mount ahead of critical earnings report





Billionaire investor Peter Thiel has completely exited his position in Nvidia, selling approximately 537,742 shares worth nearly $100 million during the July-September period, according to regulatory filings released over the weekend. A Form 13F filing from his Thiel Macro fund showed he no longer held any Nvidia shares as of September 30.The dramatic exit comes as concerns mount over an AI-fueled bubble in technology valuations. Thiel, who co-founded PayPal and Palantir, had earlier this year warned about stretched valuations in Nvidia and compared the recent spike in tech valuations to the 1999-2000 Dotcom bubble crash.The Nvidia holdings accounted for nearly 40% of Thiel's portfolio, and their sale shrunk his fund's equity book by almost two-thirds. His Los Angeles-based hedge fund held $212 million in long U.S. stocks in Q2, which plummeted to approximately $74.4 million in Q3. The rationale behind Thiel's sale was not immediately clear, though his previous warnings about AI valuations suggest growing concerns about market sustainability.Thiel's move follows a troubling pattern among prominent investors. Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank disclosed it had sold off its entire Nvidia stake just a week earlier.Additionally, investor Michael Burry, famous for predicting the 2008 financial crisis, recently disclosed heavy short positions on Nvidia and Palantir Technologies.Beyond dumping Nvidia entirely, Thiel also slashed his Tesla holdings from 272,613 shares to just 65,000 shares and completely exited his 208,747-share position in energy generation firm Vistra Energy. However, he purchased 79,181 shares in Apple and 49,000 shares in Microsoft during the same period.The timing is particularly significant as Nvidia prepares to report earnings Wednesday afternoon, with options positioning extremely bullish and the market pricing in about a 7% post-earnings move. Investors have grown increasingly concerned about how AI leader OpenAI plans to meet its over $1 trillion spending commitments and how this could affect Nvidia and other chipmakers. Nvidia's investment in OpenAI has also sparked concerns over circular financing among analysts.","Billionaire investor Peter Thiel has completely exited his position in Nvidia, selling approximately 537,742 shares worth nearly $100 million during the July- September period.

UK man who hacked Barack Obama's Twitter account in 2020 ordered to pay $5.4 million in Bitcoin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uk-man-who-hacked-barack-obamas-twitter-account-in-2020-ordered-to-pay-5-4-million-in-bitcoi/articleshow/125386082.cms,"AI generated image for representation

What UK prosecutor said about the hacker

“We were able to use the full force of the powers available to us to ensure that even when someone is not convicted in the UK, we are still able to ensure they do not benefit from their criminality.”

“PlugwalkJoe,”





A British man has been convicted of hacking Twitter accounts belonging to high-profile figures, including former US President Barack Obama . According to a report by the news agency Reuters, a UK government agency has ordered Joseph James O’Connor to repay $5.40 million (4.1 million pounds) worth of Bitcoin for the same. Britain's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced that it has obtained a civil recovery order to seize 42 Bitcoin and other crypto assets linked to the scam. The attack involved using the hijacked accounts to steal digital currency from followers and threaten celebrities. O’Connor pleaded guilty in the US to charges including computer intrusion, wire fraud and extortion. He has been serving a five-year sentence in a US prison since 2023, the report claims.O'Connor was initially arrested in Spain in 2021. He was then extradited after the Spanish High Court determined that the US was the appropriate jurisdiction for prosecution, given the location of the evidence and the victims, the Reuters report added.The July 2020 attack affected accounts belonging to then–Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, former US President Obama and others, including Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and Kim Kardashian. As a result, Twitter (now known as X) temporarily restricted activity on verified accounts.In a statement to Reuters, prosecutor Adrian Foster said:The order issued last week builds on a previous property-freezing ruling made during extradition proceedings.UK prosecutors said a court-appointed trustee will now liquidate the assets.The group responsible for the 2020 breach used SIM-swapping and social engineering to access internal Twitter systems. They then posted false messages encouraging followers to send Bitcoin to wallets controlled by the attackers, collecting over $100,000 within a few hours.UK prosecutors have secured an order to seize crypto assets worth about £4.11 million, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and stablecoins. The action is part of civil proceeds-of-crime rules that allow authorities to recover illegal earnings from cases prosecuted outside the UK.However, O'Connor’s actions were not limited to the Bitcoin scheme. Court filings show he and others accessed private messages, extorted victims, and sent threats to public figures using compromised Twitter administrative tools. His guilty plea covered the Twitter breach as well as a wider set of SIM-swap offences and crypto-related theft.O'Connor, known online aswas extradited from Spain in 2023 after a long legal process and agreed to a plea deal with US prosecutors. His sentence required him to forfeit $794,000 and pay restitution, while the UK order seeks further assets believed to be linked to the offences and accessible under British jurisdiction.The CPS highlighted the case as part of its broader asset-recovery work, noting that nearly £478 million has been recovered through confiscation and compensation orders over the past five years, with more than £95 million returned to victims. For O’Connor, the ruling means that even while serving his sentence in the US, more of his illegal gains will be removed.","British man convicted of hacking Twitter accounts belonging to high-profile figures, including former US President Barack Obama.

Microsoft’s 'World’s First AI Superfactory’







Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has highlighted the massive scale of the company’s new infrastructure by comparing the construction effort of its largest datacentre to the creation of the historic Empire State Building, prompting a pointed question from rival tech executive Elon Musk . Suleyman posted an online update regarding Microsoft’s Fairwater datacenter in Atlanta, emphasising the immense labour required.“Already our Fairwater datacenter in Atlanta has taken over 15 million labor hours to build—even more once it’s fully finished,” Suleyman wrote. He then provided a striking historical comparison: “For comparison the Empire State building took 7 million!”Suleyman’s comparison suggested the resource-intensive nature of building modern AI infrastructure capable of supporting advanced models and massive computational demands.However, the post immediately drew a skeptical reply from Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and X. Musk’s concise reaction questioned the efficiency of the effort: “Are you sure you’re doing it right?”Last week, Microsoft unveiled what it is calling the “world’s first planet-scale AI superfactory,” created by connecting massive datacentres in Wisconsin and Atlanta via a high-speed fiber-optic network. The unified system links the two sites, which are roughly 700 miles apart, to function as a single, specialised computing complex for AI.Unlike traditional cloud datacentres, these new facilities are engineered to handle single, large-scale AI workloads that span multiple locations simultaneously.

Jeff Bezos: This skill will keep humans irreplaceable in an AI world



AI-Powered Future: Next Gen Careers You Should Watch

Job landscape shifting due to AI



Bezos’ hiring philosophy: Focus on invention



Why invention will matter more than ever



Sustainability of human value : As AI automates repetitive and routine tasks, human value will increasingly rest on creativity, originality, and the ability to envision new solutions.

Long-term career resilience: Workers who focus on invention, not just execution, may be more resilient in their careers, because inventors are less likely to be replaced by machines.

Broader implications for workers and businesses



Potential risks and limitations



Creativity isn’t easy to scale : Not every employee can be an inventor. Creativity is unevenly distributed, and not every person has both the desire and the skills to invent.

Overemphasis on novelty: Companies may overvalue invention, neglecting the importance of reliability, execution, and maintenance tasks that are also critical to business success.





At Italian Tech Week in 2025, Jeff Bezos delivered a stark warning about the future of work in an age dominated by artificial intelligence. As automation becomes deeply embedded in business operations, Bezos argued that most roles are at risk; however, one type of worker might remain relatively safe: the creative inventor. He emphasised that AI can handle execution but struggles to replicate genuine human creativity. This perspective challenges how companies hire, how workers differentiate themselves, and how individuals plan their career strategies for an AI-driven world. According to Bezos, invention, not repetitive execution, is going to be the anchor of human relevance in tomorrow’s workforce.During his appearance, Bezos made a clear distinction: the workers who will never be replaced by AI are those who can invent people who generate original ideas rather than just carry out tasks. He described this as the foundation of technological progress, noting that invention drives innovation and change more than routine work ever could.Bezos reinforced this with his own example: “Put me in front of a whiteboard and I can generate a hundred ideas in half an hour.”The founder of Amazon highlighted how AI is already reshaping the labour market, particularly in his own company. As automation expands within Amazon, many roles that depend on repetitive or data-driven tasks are increasingly handled by machines.He warned that only a fraction of employees will be truly insulated from displacement, those who invent rather than just execute.This mirrors broader trends across companies: AI systems are being deployed for logistics, customer service, data processing, and other operational roles, reducing the need for human labour in those areas.Bezos explained that when he interviews prospective employees, he specifically asks whether they’ve invented something, not necessarily a patentable invention, but any new process, metric, or system. He believes this mindset identifies individuals who are creative problem solvers, not just task performers.He has repeatedly said that those who don’t have a pioneering or experimental mindset are unlikely to thrive long term, especially in an AI-first era.Bezos’s remarks come at a time when many companies are rapidly scaling up AI adoption, and fears about job displacement are growing. For workers, this means that developing creativity and innovation skills may become essential for long-term employability. Hiring practices, too, may shift: companies might prioritise inventiveness over past experience or technical skill.Educational institutions and training programs may also need to adjust, promoting more creative thinking, problem-finding, and entrepreneurial mindsets rather than purely technical proficiency.","Jeff Bezos: This skill will keep humans irreplaceable in an AI world.

Anand Mahindra points to the 'Big crisis' that Ford CEO said is needed to keep America running,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/anand-mahindra-points-to-the-big-crisis-that-ford-ceo-said-is-needed-to-keep-america-running/articleshow/125382655.cms,"Here’s what Anand Mahindra wrote in the post

We’re so busy fearing AI will wipe out white-collar jobs that we’re missing a far bigger crisis: the scarcity of skilled trades.

Ford CEO @jimfarley98 made a startling revelation in a recent podcast: Ford has 5,000 mechanic jobs unfilled, many paying $120,000 a year, and still no takers. Across the U.S., over a million essential roles in plumbing, electrical work, trucking and factory operations lie vacant.

This isn’t the future.

It’s happening now.

For decades, we pushed degrees and desk jobs to the top of the “aspirational” ladder and quietly pushed skilled trades to the bottom. Yet these are the jobs AI cannot replace: they require judgment, dexterity, apprenticeship, and real-world expertise.

So the real question is: Are we about to witness a reset in what society considers a dream career?

Because if this trend continues, the biggest winners of the AI era will be the people who can actually build, fix, and keep the world running.

Marx imagined workers rising through struggle.

He never imagined they’d rise because they became too skilled, too scarce, and too essential to replace!

A revolution not through violence… but through value-discovery

Ford CEO says America needs cultural shift





Ford CEO Jim Farely recently warned of a major shortage of skilled workers in the US. In an interview with Axios, Farley stated that the US can not lead in the AI race and advanced manufacturing unless it strengthens its key blue-collar industries. Now, billionaire Anand Mahindra has also pointed out the same crisis. In a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Mahindra highlighted the big crisis: “scarcity of skilled trades”.He also pointed to Ford CEO Jim Farley’s “startling revelation” – Ford has 5,000 mechanic jobs unfilled, many paying $120,000 a year, and still no takers.“So the real question is: Are we about to witness a reset in what society considers a dream career?,” Mahindra asks in the post, adding “if this trend continues, the biggest winners of the AI era will be the people who can actually build, fix, and keep the world running”.Farley called for a cultural shift to elevate the value of blue-collar work, alongside policy changes such as faster permitting, regulatory reform, and increased funding for vocational training and apprenticeships. He also advocated for innovations like robotics, augmented reality, and AI to boost productivity in trades like plumbing, carpentry, and auto repair.Farley sees the “Accelerate” summit as a critical first step toward developing policies to support these vital industries. “If we are successful -- when we are successful -- we’ll take on bigger, higher-class problems,” he said. “Right now, the problems we’re trying to solve are pretty practical. I need 6,000 technicians in my dealerships on Monday morning.”","Billionaire Anand Mahindra says we're missing a bigger crisis: the scarcity of skilled trades.

""villain""

“The great patron of the internet for the last 27 years was Google. The great villain of the internet today is also Google.”

“80% of the leading AI companies are CloudFlare customers.”

What Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said about Google Search ’s AI overview mode



“What’s changed is they put an AI overview at the top [of search results], and you don’t have to actually click on anything in order to get your answer. You’re not going to that content. And that’s the good news,”

“The bad news is that if you look at companies like OpenAI, who have provided amazing tools, they are 1,500 scrapes for one visit. Anthropic is 40,000 scrapes for one visitor. And the problem is, if these new AI tools aren’t generating traffic, then the fundamental business model of the internet is going to break down. Certainly for media content creators, but even for some things like small businesses and brands, as well,”

“They are all saying we have to pay for this content. We have to be giving something back to the ecosystem.”

“We talk all the time [with Google] and, they say, ‘we get it.’ There are a lot of people at Google that understand that. They believe in the internet. They believe in the ecosystem. They believe in supporting it, but they also are stuck with the old business model, while being competed with by a new business model”

“I worry that it’s really tough to tell OpenAI or Anthropic that they have to pay for something, but Google gets it for free. That’s not fair,”

“It’s not just that you drop out of search, but because Google runs so much of the ad monetisation infrastructure, if you shut their [AI] bots down, your ads stop working in some cases. That’s insane, right?”

“Google Extended”

“without impacting a site’s inclusion in Google Search,”

“Totally, absolutely. And the reason we’re not talking about it is because nobody sees behind the curtain what’s going on here. Google is using a dominant position that they have in search to leverage their way into AI.”

How Google responded to Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince’s remarks



“more high-quality clicks,”

“without hurting their referrals or ad placement.”





Cloudflare has once again criticised Google for abusing its dominant position in the search market. Matthew Prince, the CEO of the US-based cloud services company, said that the search giant has acquired web content for training its AI models without compensating publishers. Prince noted that Google is both a historicaland a currentof the internet. Speaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon from MEO Arena’s centre stage, Prince urged executives at Google's parent company, Alphabet, to pay website publishers for the content needed to train their large language models (LLMs). Prince argues that Google's search monopoly, which currently holds 90% market share, allows it to scrape content.In a statement to Fortune, Prince said,Prince contrasted Google's current actions with its past practice, claiming that historically, for every two pages Google crawled for its search engine, it would typically send one visitor to those sites, providing monetisable traffic for publishers.Cloudflare provides backend services for the web, including content delivery networks and cybersecurity, and Prince noted thatPrince explained that previously, for every two pages Google crawled for search results, the company would typically send one visitor back to those websites. This helped traffic publishers to monetise with advertising. However, now Google sends only one visitor per 20 pages scanned, he claimed.Prince noted.he continued.Prince noted that Google executives have said they believe they should contribute to publishers. He added that other major AI companies have expressed the same thing:Prince explained:driven by AI platforms. He argued that because Google does not compensate publishers at scale, others hesitate to do so as well.Prince mentioned.Prince also said the situation becomes more complicated when publishers try to block AI crawling. He claimed that if a site signals it does not want its content used for Google’s Gemini, it risks a lower search ranking because the same command applies to both systems.he explained.However, there is disagreement in the SEO community about this. Google offers a setting calledthat is said to block AI crawlersaccording to the company. However, some believe that giving Google less visibility into a site may reduce its chances of being referenced, including by Gemini.When asked if he considered this a misuse of market power, Prince replied,Responding to Prince’s remarks, Google told Fortune that it believes its referral traffic has stayed consistent year over year and that it aims to deliversuch as visits from users who remain on a site rather than immediately returning to search results. The company also said it provides websites with the ability to opt out of AI crawling","Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince says Google is abusing its dominant position in the search market.

What the Google-owned Waymo has to say







The death of a neighborhood cat named Kit Kat in a collision with a Waymo robotaxi has ignited outrage in San Francisco, leaving the residents ‘shaken’ while also transforming a tragedy into a debate over autonomous vehicles. According to a report by The New York Times, Kit Kat, affectionately known by locals as the “Mayor of 16th Street” for his frequent visits to various spots, was run over by a self-driving taxi shortly before midnight on October 27.The incident has led residents to create a memorial shrine at the site of the accident. The reaction has created headaches for Waymo, Google’s self-driving car service, which is already under intense public scrutiny in the city.The incident immediately became a central point in the political push to increase local control over autonomous vehicles.San Francisco Supervisor Jackie Fielder, who represents the Mission District, has been the most vocal critic, the report said. She introduced a city resolution that calls on the state Legislature to allow local voters to decide whether driverless cars can operate in their neighborhoods—a jurisdiction currently controlled by the state.“A human driver can be held accountable, can hop out, say sorry, can be tracked down by police if it’s a hit-and-run,” Fielder told The New York Times.“Here, there is no one to hold accountable,” she added.Waymo described the incident as one where a cat “darted under our vehicle as it was pulling away.” The company, whose co-CEO recently stressed the importance of safety, released a statement expressing sympathy.“We send our deepest sympathies to the cat’s owner and the community who knew and loved him,” the company said.The area is reportedly decorated with competing signs, with some criticising Waymo while others acknowledge the hundreds of animals killed annually by human drivers in the city.","Kit Kat, affectionately known by locals as the ‘Mayor of 16th Street’ for his frequent visits to various spots, was run over by a self-driving taxi shortly before midnight on October 27.

Four-step workaround exploits regulatory loopholes

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Nvidia's China market share collapses from 95% to zero

Trump administration won't enforce Biden-era restrictions





China is getting access to Nvidia chips, or rather Nvidia chips whose sale is prohibited in the country. Inside a windowless building in Jakarta, Indonesia, approximately 2,300 of Nvidia's cutting-edge Blackwell chips are being prepared for use by a Chinese AI company—despite President Donald Trump's explicit opposition to selling such technology to China. The complex transaction involved multiple countries and entities, yet appears to violate no US laws. A Wall Street Journal investigation has revealed how Chinese companies are accessing Nvidia's most advanced AI chips despite US export restrictions, exposing significant gaps in America's technology control strategy.The chips reached their destination through a carefully orchestrated chain. Nvidia first sold semiconductors to Aivres, a Silicon Valley-based company whose parent is one-third owned by Inspur—a Chinese tech firm blacklisted by the US government in 2023 for working on military supercomputing. However, current regulations don't restrict Nvidia from selling to American subsidiaries like Aivres.Aivres then brokered a $100 million deal with Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison, an Indonesian telecom provider, selling 32 server racks containing 72 Blackwell chips each. The arrangement was finalized only after securing Shanghai-based AI startup INF Tech as the end customer, according to people familiar with the matter cited by the WSJ.The Jakarta case highlights the effectiveness—and limitations—of US export controls. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told reporters in November there were ""no active discussions"" about selling Blackwell chips to China, stating: ""Currently, we are not planning to ship anything to China.""Yet Huang has repeatedly criticized the policy's impact on American business. Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in October, he revealed Nvidia went from 95% market share in China to zero, adding: ""I can't imagine any policymaker thinking that that's a good idea."" He described China as potentially a $50 billion market this year, growing to hundreds of billions by decade's end.The case has alarmed current and former US national-security officials who fear Chinese companies could eventually redirect commercial AI capabilities toward military applications through Beijing's civil-military fusion strategy. In its final days, the Biden administration introduced rules requiring closer scrutiny of advanced chip sales to countries like Indonesia, but the Trump administration declined to enforce them.INF Tech, founded by Chinese-born American MIT graduate Qi Yuan, insists it conducts no military research and complies fully with US regulations. The company plans to use the computing power for AI applications in finance and healthcare.As the US-China technological rivalry intensifies, the Jakarta deal demonstrates how legal workarounds and third-country intermediaries can circumvent even stringent export controls.","Chinese companies are accessing Nvidia's most advanced AI chips despite US export restrictions.

What experts say

Bill Gates to donate 99% of his wealth





Bill Gates Foundation has stunned markets by drastically reducing its stake in Microsoft by almost 65% in the third quarter of 2025. As per new 13F data, the foundation has dumped 17,000,000 shares of Microsoft, equivalent to 64.91% reduction. According to reports, the average selling point of Microsoft shares during Q3, 2025 was $510.13, resulting in a total cash inflow of approximately $8.7 billion for the trust. The move caused a 17.7% drop in the portfolio’s value, leading to concerns since Microsoft has always been the foundation’s main and most reliable investment.In addition to Microsoft, Gates Foundation has also trimmed its Berkshire Hathaway shares. The foundation has sold 2,358,460 shares at an average $484.36 price. This led to an overall reduction of -9.78% Berkshire Hathaway stock reduction and a -2.4% portfolio impact.Also, the foundation fully exited the Crown Castle. It sold all its 1,420,072 shares for a -0.31% impact and liquidated all 755,089 UPS shares for a -0.16% impact.Gates Foundation also sold United Parcel Service Inc’s all 755,089 shares, causing a -0.16% impact on the portfolio.The decision by the Gates Foundation to sell Microsoft shares has immediately reduced the trust’s overall portfolio value by 17.7%, triggering concern because Microsoft has long been the foundation’s most important and stable investment. Even with the recent sale, Microsoft shares remain up 21.7% this year, despite a minor dip over the past three months.While some experts worry that Gates Foundation reducing its Microsoft shares may signal caution about tech valuation, others say the dramatic reduction appears to be a strategic rebalancing rather than a loss of confidence in Microsoft. The trust has historically held a highly concentrated portfolio, with nearly 67% of its assets tied to just three companies. Reducing the Microsoft stake helps ease that concentration risk while funding future philanthropic commitments.Despite the shake-up, the foundation continues to hold billions in Microsoft stock, signalling that the long-standing relationship remains firmly intact.The foundation trust—valued around $49 billion—must raise substantial capital to support expanding global programmes, making the sale of high-value Microsoft shares a straightforward source of liquidity.The move comes as Bill Gates continues his long-term commitment to donate nearly all his wealth. Gates, whose net worth is estimated at about $106 billion, has previously pledged to give away 99% of his fortune by 2045.Speaking at the African Union (AU) headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia earlier this year, Gates said: “I recently made a commitment that my wealth will be given away over the next 20 years. The majority of that funding will be spent on helping you address challenges here in Africa.”","Bill Gates Foundation has stunned markets by drastically reducing its stake in Microsoft by almost 65% in the third quarter of 2025.

What DPDP 2025 rules say on protection of children's personal data

DPDP 2025 rules to companies: You cannot transfer this data outside India





The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) recently notified the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) rules 2025. The new rules mark the full operationalisation of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 – India’s first comprehensive data law. Enacted by Parliament on 11 August 2023, the DPDP Act establishes a comprehensive framework for protecting digital personal data, setting out the obligations of entities handling such data and the rights and duties of individuals.The DPDP Rules 2025 provide a consent-based system in order to protect personal data of people using social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or shopping apps like Amazon, Flipkart or using online banking, digital payments and online government services. The aim is to ensure that the users know how their data is used and they have more control over their data. Under the rules, platforms and companies found violating the rules will face penalties, including up to Rs 250cr for serious failures to protect data, and breaches. Here’s a breakdown of what the new rules mean for platforms like Meta, Google and others that are widely used on a day-to-day basis.But before proceeding, it is important to under two important entities frequently used in the rules – Data Fiduciary and Data Principals.A Data Principal is the individual to whom the personal data belongs, or the person whose information is being collected or processed. In layman's terms, a data principal stands for a general user. While a Data Fiduciary is the entity — such as a company, organisation or individual — that determines why the data is being processed and how that processing will be carried out.The DPDP Rules 2025 outlines 'Reasonable safety guards’ for social media companies such as Facebook and Instagram and other online platforms to protect personal data in their possession or under their control. At the same time, these companies and organisations must put stricter checks in place for young users, including getting a parent’s verified approval before letting anyone under 18 join.Platforms are required to safeguard users’ personal data through “encryption, obfuscation, masking or the use of virtual tokens mapped to that personal data”. These tools make the data unreadable to anyone who shouldn’t see it. Even if someone gets access, the information stays protected.Further, companies need to track who accesses the stored data. The rules require online platforms to keep an activity log of every time someone views or uses personal data. In order to allow proper investigation of unauthorized access, organisations must keep logs and relevant personal data for one year. They can also store it for a longer or shorter time, but only if another law requires it.In case the Data Fiduciary hires a Data Processor to handle the data, the contract must clearly state that they also have to follow strong security practices. The law also requires companies to establish a Data Protection Board that will function as a fully digital institution, enabling citizens to file and track complaints online through a dedicated platform and mobile app. “Appeals against its decisions will lie with the Appellate Tribunal, TDSAT. ”Under the new rules, companies found in violation of these rules will face a penalty of up to Rs 25 crore. The government has given a window of 18-months for the online platforms to transition and comply with the new rules.Under the DPDP Rules 2025, a company must delete a user’s personal data after a period of three years of inactivity – unless the individual has a more recent interaction or the data is legally required to be retained or “its retention is necessary for compliance with any law.”Before deleting the data, the company (Data Fiduciary) must give the person (Data Principal) a 48-hour warning. The message must clearly state that their data will be deleted soon, unless they log into their account or contact the company. If they still need the service or want to use any of their rights related to their data, they should take action before the deadline.“At least forty-eight hours before completion of the time period for erasure of personal data under this rule, the Data Fiduciary shall inform the Data Principal that such personal data shall be erased upon completion of such period, unless she logs into her user account or otherwise initiates contact with the Data Fiduciary for the performance of the specified purpose or exercises her rights in relation to the processing of such personal data,” the rules read.The DPDP Rules 2025 requires online platforms to quickly inform users in case of any personal data breach. “On becoming aware of any personal data breach, the Data Fiduciary shall, to the best of its knowledge, intimate to each affected Data Principal, in a concise, clear and plain manner and without delay, through her user account or any mode of communication registered by her with the Data Fiduciary,” the rule states.The intimation can be done through-Regarding safety and protection of online children data, the new law mandates online platforms to obtain verifiable consent of the parent “before the processing of any personal data of a child”. Further, is is now required to “observe due diligence, for checking that the individual identifying herself as the parent is an adult who is identifiable if required in connection with compliance with any law for the time being in force in India”.For persons with disabilities who cannot make legal decisions even with support, consent must come from a lawful guardian verified under applicable laws, the rules say.Additionally, the new rules also let the government block certain types of data from being sent outside India. According to experts, this may create challenges for big tech companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon, which depend heavily on global data flows.To give people more control over their online information, the law allows every user to see, correct, update, or delete their personal data whenever they want. Users can even appoint someone else to manage these rights for them if needed. Companies handling this data must respond to such requests within 90 days.The organisations must display clear contact information—such as that of a designated officer or Data Protection Officer—to help individuals raise queries about personal data processing. Significant Data Fiduciaries have enhanced obligations including independent audits, impact assessments and stronger due diligence for deployed technologies. They must also comply with government-specified restrictions on certain categories of data, including localisation where required.","The DPDP Rules 2025 provide a consent-based system to protect personal data of people using social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or using online banking, digital payments and online government services. Under the rules, platforms and companies found violating the rules will face penalties, including up to Rs 250cr.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125379949,imgsize-185596,width-400,resizemode-4/indias-first-full-fledged-privacy-law-goes-live-what-dpdp-rules-2025-mean-for-your-daily-apps.jpg"

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!

Why is Apple moving away from September-only iPhone launches

iPhone Air was never meant to be annual





Apple is seemingly abandoning its famous fall-only iPhone launch strategy, spreading new models across the entire year in what marks the biggest shift in the iPhone’s release history since 2011. Starting in fall 2026, Apple will unveil three premium models—the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and its first foldable iPhone—according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman in his Power On newsletter. Six months later, in spring 2027, the company plans to release the base iPhone 18, iPhone 18e, and potentially a second-generation iPhone Air.The move ends over a decade of September spectacles that concentrated Apple's biggest revenue driver into a single season. Gurman reports this pattern will continue ""for years to come,"" with Apple launching between five and six new iPhone models annually instead of the traditional four released simultaneously.The twice-yearly schedule aims to distribute revenue more evenly throughout the year while reducing pressure on Apple's engineering teams and manufacturing partners. The strategy also prevents premium and budget models from competing for attention during the same marketing window.Bloomberg notes the shift gives Apple multiple opportunities to counter competitors like Samsung, which has long spread Galaxy and foldable launches across different seasons. The troubled 2024 rollout of Apple Intelligence highlighted how cramming too many products into fall was taking its toll.Contrary to recent reports suggesting Apple delayed the iPhone Air 2 due to poor sales, Gurman clarifies the device was never scheduled for annual updates. The absence of ""17"" in its name—simply called ""iPhone Air""—signaled Apple's intention to update it on a flexible timeline, similar to the iPhone SE.The next iPhone Air will focus on adopting a 2-nanometer chip for improved battery life rather than structural changes, according to the Power On newsletter. While adding a second camera is ""technically possible,"" Gurman considers it unlikely given the device's already crowded design and modest sales performance.The spring releases will also bring major smart home devices, the iPhone 17e, updated Macs, and refreshed iPads, giving Apple consistent product momentum throughout the year.","Apple is moving away from September-only iPhone launches.

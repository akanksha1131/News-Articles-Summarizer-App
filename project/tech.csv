"""Cock and Bull story"": SEBI fines this stock investment advisory company that promised 95% returns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/cock-and-bull-story-sebi-fines-this-stock-investment-advisory-company-that-promised-95-returns/articleshow/116864043.cms,"Cock and Bull story

Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ), the capital markets regulator, has levied a penalty of Rs 19 lakh on Sai Proficient Research Investment Advisory and its proprietor for a series of regulatory breaches, including deceiving investors with unrealistic promises of returns.As per SEBI notice, the stock market regulator found that Sai Proficient made false promises of returns as high as 95%, a practice strictly prohibited under its regulations. Such exaggerated assurances, designed to entice unsuspecting investors, were classified by Sebi as fraudulent and unfair trade practices, significantly eroding investor confidence in the securities market. The ₹19 lakh fine reflects Sebi's determination to penalize such deceptive practices and protect the integrity of the market.Dismissing the investment advisory firm's defense as a fabricated ""cock and bull story"" and a mere ""afterthought"" to escape accountability, Sebi's investigation revealed a pattern of misconduct, including non-cooperation with the inquiry and collusion with an unregistered entity to defraud the public. ""Noticee submitted that she was pregnant and was in the last months of her pregnancy suffering from complications and thus, could not attend the office regularly and could not cooperate with investigation,"" as per SEBI's circular.The Sebi order details Sai Proficient's involvement with Shree Sai Proficient Financial Services (SSPFS), an unregistered entity operating illegally as an investment advisory service. The regulator's investigation found compelling evidence that SSPFS served as a front for Sai Proficient Research, facilitating the collection of investor funds. Transactions exceeding ₹4 crore were traced across accounts linked to both entities, exposing a deliberate and coordinated scheme to attract and mislead investors. Sebi explicitly stated that Sai Proficient acted ""in connivance with SSPFS, using it as a camouflage to lure people into its net.""Adding to the severity of the violations, Sai Proficient failed to provide crucial documentation to Sebi during the investigation. This included essential records such as Know Your Customer (KYC) details, risk profiling forms, and client agreements. Despite repeated notices from the regulator, the firm's non-compliance further exacerbated its regulatory breaches.","Sai Proficient Research Investment Advisory and its proprietor have been fined Rs 19 lakh.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic concept but a transformative force reshaping industries and influencing our lives directly or indirectly. Across sectors, businesses are embracing AI not only to enhance customer experiences and streamline operations but also to ease employee workloads and promote better work-life balance. Industry leaders share insights on how AI impacted their domains in the year 20242024 has been a watershed year for retail, with AI transforming brick-and-mortar stores into high-tech hubs that offer immersive experiences and hyper-localized offerings. Technologies like AI-powered video and audio analytics, coupled with smart CCTV systems, have amplified the customer experience while reducing CAPEX and OPEX by over 20% in many cases. According to a survey done by EY, Retail investments in AI are expected to soar to US$31 billion by 2028, reflecting the growing importance of these technologies. These advancements are driving significant cost reductions, enhanced operational efficiency, and improved productivity, while also reducing issues like shoplifting. Moreover, the potential of Gen AI in the retail sector could elevate profitability by 20% by 2025, further accelerating growth and success as per the same report.AI has become a cornerstone in shaping the online gaming experience, enabling deeper insights into player behavior and enhancing personalization. While responsible gaming is already a key focus, the next phase of AI’s evolution aims on making these efforts more interpretable, actionable, and equitable. By leveraging predictive analytics and advanced AI models, platforms can analyze vast amounts of data to uncover trends, anticipate player needs, and deliver tailored experiences. These insights help navigate the complexities of dynamic user behaviors, ensuring gaming environments are both engaging and fair.From the technology standpoint, AI-related skills will be critical in the coming years, requiring more than surface-level knowledge like prompt engineering. The job seekers must develop a solid understanding of AI systems - diving deep into neural networks, transformer models, and optimization techniques. The key engineering skill lies in combining technical expertise with human creativity and critical thinking. While AI will be a powerful tool for innovation, it’s ultimately the human mindset and ingenuity that will drive it to create a meaningful impact. AI-driven jobs will gradually grow across all sectors, including predominantly human-centric fields like healthcare and BFSI. In the healthcare sector, AI will bring advancements in areas like diagnostics, medical imaging, and personalized treatments tailored to individuals.AI is revolutionizing the flexible packaging industry by driving sustainability, efficiency, and innovation across the value chain. In the production phase, AI can optimise manufacturing processes by analysing vast amounts of data, thereby improving efficiency, reducing waste, and enhancing product quality. At the end of the life cycle, AI is crucial for waste management and recycling processes. Advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning are transforming recyclability by enabling sorting systems to differentiate between plastic packaging and non-plastic packaging, food-grade and non-food-grade plastics. This breakthrough is significantly increasing recycling rates and supporting a circular economy by recovering high-value materials at scale.In 2024, organizations recognized that consuming LLMs was merely the tip of the iceberg. The true challenge—and opportunity—lay in addressing foundational elements such as ensuring data quality, building robust digital assets, and fostering widespread user adoption to fully realize AI's potential in enterprise settings. It was common to see organizations launch GenAI pilots with initial positive response, stemming from excitement around the technology. Although, the journey to delivering impact at scale requires dedicated efforts. The science behind AI will keep evolving in 2025. But here’s the catch - the winners won’t just master the technology; they’ll master the art of integrating it into their own contexts, empowering their teams, and creating a culture of innovation. Looking ahead, Agentic AI will be integral to Gen AI efforts for 2025. Organizations will build Digital Workers — AI agents will take on both employee and customer-facing roles, reshaping how work gets done.","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic concept but a transformative force reshaping industries and influencing our lives directly or indirectly.

NYT Strands December 31, 2024 – Hints, answers, Spangram



Spangram for today

Today's Strands’ answers:

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

As the match ended, cricket memes went viral on social media platforms. Here are some of the viral memes that just capture the emotion/sadness of Indian Cricket fans.

Record number of spectators

Australia clinched a thrilling 184-run victory over India in a dramatic final session of the fourth Test in Melbourne, taking a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. India, needing 340 to win, collapsed to 155 all out, losing their last seven wickets for just 34 runs in 20.3 overs. India appeared to be heading for a draw after Yashasvi Jaiswal (84) and Rishabh Pant (30) steered them to 112-3 at tea.However, Pant's dismissal, attempting a six off Travis Head, triggered a batting collapse.Controversy arose with Jaiswal's dismissal. Initially given not out to a caught-behind appeal, the TV umpire overturned the decision based on visual evidence of the ball changing direction, despite the absence of audible noise. Jasprit Bumrah was exceptional for India, taking 5-57 in the second innings and nine wickets in the match. He had reduced Australia to 91-6 at one stage, a lead of less than 200.The match set a record attendance for cricket in Australia, with 373,591 spectators. Head described the atmosphere as inspiring and hailed the match as one of the best he has been involved in.

Planning a New Year's Eve party at an Airbnb? Think again. The company is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season. This technology uses machine learning to identify and block risky bookings, focusing on factors like trip length, booking timing, and distance from the guest's location. While implemented worldwide, the technology will specifically target the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Puerto Rico, Spain and New Zealand. Last New Year's Eve, Airbnb blocked 74,000 such bookings.High-risk bookings will be blocked or redirected to alternative accommodations. Short holiday getaways (one to three nights) in entire homes will also be restricted, and guests booking entire homes will be required to agree to a ""mandatory anti-party attestation."" ""If a booking is identified as higher risk, the guest will either be blocked from booking, or redirected to alternative accommodations on the platform,"" the company said.Guests will also be required to accept mandatory anti-party attestation. ""Guests who can make reservations will need to confirm that they understand that disruptive and unauthorized parties are not allowed on Airbnb, and they face suspension or removal from the platform if they violate this policy,"" said the company.Airbnb also has a 'Neighborhood Support Line' for local communities to report urgent issues, like a party in progress, at a home they believe is listed on Airbnb.Airbnb's efforts to curb disruptive parties started in 2019 with a ban on ""party houses,"" followed by stricter measures in 2020 due to the pandemic. In 2022, the company permanently banned large parties worldwide following several violent incidents at Airbnb rentals, including a shooting in Pittsburgh that resulted in two deaths and eight injuries.","Airbnb is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season.

Good news for WhatsApp

The National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) has a good news for Google Pay and PhonePe as it has again delayed the implementation of its 30% market share cap for Unified Payments Interface ( UPI ) apps.The deadline, initially set for December 31, 2024, has now been pushed to December 31, 2026. This marks the second time the NPCI has extended the deadline, having previously postponed it in 2022.According to a report by The Economic Times, this decision comes after discussions with industry players“There were multiple conversations that happened with the industry participants and we believe that bringing the market cap at this point could slow down adoption of UPI…there is potential for the payment system to grow by another 10 times,” ET quoted a senior banker in the know.The delay primarily benefits PhonePe and Google Pay, the two dominant players in the UPI market, which together control roughly 90% of transactions. In November 2024, PhonePe processed 7.4 billion UPI payments, while Google Pay handled 5.7 billion, out of a total of 15.4 billion UPI transactions.By extending the deadline, the NPCI aims to foster continued growth and adoption of UPI while allowing major players like PhonePe and Google Pay more time to comply with the market share restrictions. After PhonePe and Google Pay, there is Paytm followed by Navi, Cred and others.The NPCI has also lifted all user restrictions on WhatsApp Pay, allowing the popular messaging app to onboard its entire user base of over 500 million onto the UPI platform. NPCI initially imposed a cap of one million users on WhatsApp Pay in 2020. The cap was gradually increased to 100 million in 2022 and has now been completely removed.The initial restrictions were intended to ensure a gradual rollout of the service and prevent strain on the banking infrastructure. However, with the UPI ecosystem now more robust, the NPCI has given WhatsApp Pay the green light to expand its reach.","The National Payments Corporation of India has again delayed the implementation of its 30% market share cap for Unified Payments Interface ( UPI ) apps.

In a recent exchange on social media, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk , now the owner of platform X (formerly Twitter), urged users to contribute more positive, beautiful, or informative content. Musk’s call for more uplifting posts was met with a sharp and witty response from billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban , who quickly tweeted, “You first.” This playful retort sparked a viral moment on the platform, with many users joining in the conversation, some in support of Cuban’s bold comment, while others rallied behind Musk. The online exchange not only showcased the ongoing rivalry between the two tech moguls but also sparked wider discussions about leadership styles, transparency, and the role of influential figures on social media.Musk's initial tweet appeared on December 29, 2024, and reflected his desire to reshape the atmosphere on X. Musk, known for his sometimes controversial social media presence, suggested that more people should post content that is uplifting and informative. His request came as part of his broader efforts to improve the platform's image, after several months of intense debate over the direction of X under his leadership.“Please post a bit more positive, beautiful or informative content on this platform,” Musk tweeted, aiming to encourage a more constructive environment. Musk’s call for more positivity resonated with many, but it also seemed to trigger some skepticism, leading to the viral reply from Cuban.Cuban’s response was succinct and playful. As the owner of the Dallas Mavericks and a prominent figure in the tech and business world, Cuban is no stranger to public debates. In his tweet, Cuban humorously flipped Musk’s request back on him by stating, “You first,” thereby challenging Musk to lead by example.Cuban’s response quickly gained traction, with many users applauding his cheekiness and calling for more transparency from influential public figures, including Musk. Some supporters of Cuban highlighted his direct communication style as a key factor in his leadership, praising his ability to engage with critics openly.Cuban’s comment was met with widespread admiration from users who appreciated his straightforward approach. One Twitter user expressed that Cuban’s transparency and creative thinking would have made him a better fit to lead DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency), a newly proposed initiative by President-elect Donald Trump’s administration, aimed at reducing bureaucracy. Others chimed in, lauding Cuban’s direct engagement with critics as an essential trait for modern business leaders in the digital age.Not everyone sided with Cuban, however. Musk’s supporters were quick to defend him, citing his consistent updates on positive initiatives such as Starlink, his satellite internet project. Some users highlighted Musk’s contributions to global communication as an example of the positive and beautiful content he regularly shares on social media.One Musk supporter pointed out that Musk often posts updates about Starlink, implying that his content has been both positive and meaningful. Others questioned Cuban’s critique, asking why he would target Musk, given the billionaire’s track record of public achievements.This exchange is not the first time Mark Cuban has publicly disagreed with Elon Musk. In a prior incident, Cuban took issue with Musk’s controversial comments regarding Germany's Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Musk had compared the policies of the AfD to those of the US Democratic Party under President Barack Obama, sparking backlash from critics. Cuban responded to Musk’s endorsement by using Musk’s own AI chatbot, Grok, to challenge Musk’s stance. The chatbot ironically identified the Republican Party, which has been Musk’s preferred political affiliation in recent years, as the group most aligned with the AfD.","Elon Musk urged X users to post more positive, beautiful, or informative content.

As the countdown begins for the fourth season of Shark Tank India , excitement is brewing among fans of the hit business reality series. Known for its gripping entrepreneurial pitches and fierce competition among its panel of ‘sharks,’ the show has become a staple for aspiring business minds and entertainment enthusiasts alike. The latest promo promises an even more intense season, packed with high-stakes investments, razor-sharp critiques, and simmering rivalries between the sharks.This season, the panel welcomes a new face—Kunal Bahl, the CEO and co-founder of Snapdeal. His debut is already making waves, signaling a season filled with calculated risks and unexpected moves. As the promo reveals, the sharks are not just hungry; they’re ravenous.The promo opens with an explosive pitch from The Naturik Co., a company vying for investment. Kunal Bahl , in his first major move as a shark, pledges an investment of Rs 4 crore, leaving the panel and viewers stunned. Not to be outdone, Anupam Mittal, the CEO of People Group and Shaadi.com, quickly matches the offer. This moment sets the tone for what is shaping up to be a fiercely competitive season.While Peyush Bansal (CEO of Lenskart) and Namita Thapar (Executive Director of Emcure Pharmaceuticals) make strategic offers for other pitches, the spotlight often shifts back to Bahl and Mittal. Both sharks demonstrate a relentless drive to outbid and outwit each other. Bahl, critiquing the use of royalties in deals, labels it a tactic to exploit entrepreneurs, sparking debates within the panel.The competition between sharks isn’t limited to securing the best deals—it’s personal. In one of the promo’s most talked-about moments, Aman Gupta, co-founder of boAt Lifestyle, challenges Kunal Bahl’s approach to deal-making. “You can’t go into this individually,” Gupta asserts. Bahl, unfazed, counters with a confident retort: “I know how to make deals.”The exchange escalates when Gupta quips, “It’s your first time on Shark Tank, right?” Bahl, without missing a beat, fires back, “But I’ve done many deals, far more than you.” This moment encapsulates the tension and camaraderie that have become hallmarks of the show, ensuring viewers are in for a dramatic ride.The stakes aren’t just high for the entrepreneurs but for the sharks themselves. In another dramatic scene, Anupam Mittal challenges a contestant’s commitment. Waving a cheque dramatically, he asks, “Shall I tear it away then?” This theatrical gesture highlights the pressure-cooker environment of the show, where every decision carries significant weight.As investments soar and rivalries intensify, the show promises to be a platform where innovation meets ambition. The sharks, representing diverse industries, bring their expertise and unique perspectives to the table, ensuring that no pitch is overlooked.","This season, the panel welcomes a new face—Kunal Bahl, the CEO and co-founder of Snapdeal.

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is likely to wield unprecedented influence in the new US government. His relationship with President-elect Donald J. Trump showcases a unique intertwining of business, politics, and personal connections. Reports reveal that Musk has not only emerged as Trump’s largest donor but also serves as a key advisor, shaping policy, personnel, and strategy decisions during the transition period. Musk has also reportedly been residing in a luxurious Mar-a-Lago cottage, a move that highlights access and influence.According to a report in the New York Times, since the US election day, Elon Musk has made Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s exclusive members-only club in Palm Beach, Florida, almost his temporary home. Nestled in the ""Banyan"" cottage, located just a few hundred feet from Trump’s main residence, Musk’s presence is reportedly said to enable him to join impromptu dinners, participate in critical policy discussions, and even sit in on calls with foreign leaders.The Banyan cottage, which typically rents for over $2,000 per night, has become Musk’s command center, as reported by the New York Times. Although details of Musk’s financial arrangements are not clear, speculation abounds regarding whether he pays the standard rate or receives special treatment. The Mar-a-Lago club is said to often bill guests at the conclusion of their stay, leaving room for uncertainty about Musk’s expenses. Some insiders suggest Trump may waive or reduce the rental fee, considering Musk’s significant political contributions and influence.Musk’s presence at Mar-a-Lago has reportedly not gone unnoticed, with reports highlighting his personalized approach to the stay. From requesting meals outside regular hours to spending time with his children and their nannies on the property, Musk’s interactions with Trump exude a sense of camaraderie. He has attended high-profile events, including the election night watch party, and shared dinners with influential figures like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. These personal moments have strengthened Musk’s rapport with Trump, enabling him to wield considerable influence over the incoming administration.Once Trump assumes office on January 20, Elon Musk’s proximity is expected to shift from Mar-a-Lago’s informal setting to the structured environment of the White House. While access to the West Wing is more regulated, Musk’s established relationship with Trump and his involvement in key decisions suggest his influence is likely to endure. Whether through official advisory roles or behind-the-scenes lobbying, Musk’s voice is likely to remain a significant factor in shaping U.S. policies that align with his business interests.","Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is likely to wield unprecedented influence in the new US government.

The US Treasury Department has confirmed a cybersecurity breach that allowed Chinese hackers to remotely access employee workstations and unclassified documents. According to a report by news agency AP, the department did not provide details on how many workstations had been accessed or what sort of documents the hackers may have obtained.In a letter to lawmakers, the US Treasury Department said that “at this time there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information” and that it is being investigated as a “major cybersecurity incident .”“Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds.Over the last four years, Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense, and we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors,” a department spokesperson said in a statement.The report says that the intrusion occurred after hackers compromised a third-party software service provider,BeyondTrust , gaining access to a key used to secure remote technical support services.As per the Treasury Department, it learned of the latest problem on December 8 when BeyondTrust flagged that hackers had stolen a key “used by the vendor to secure a cloud-based service used to remotely provide technical support” to workers.The compromised service has been taken offline, and an investigation is underway involving the FBI, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and other relevant authorities.In Beijing, a foreign ministry spokesperson responded to hacking allegations, saying they lack evidence.“We have repeatedly stated our position on such groundless accusations that lack evidence. China consistently opposes all forms of hacking, and we are even more opposed to the dissemination of false information against China for political purposes,” Mao Ning said.","The US Treasury Department has confirmed a cybersecurity breach that allowed Chinese hackers to remotely access employee workstations and unclassified documents.

When and how to watch Quadrantids meteor shower in India



Quadrantids meteor shower: What is it



“Quadrantids stand as one of four notable annual meteor showers, alongside the Lyrids, Leonids and Ursids, all recognised for their distinctive peak periods,”

“The reason the peak is so brief is due to the shower's sparse stream of particles and the fact that Earth intersects the stream at a perpendicular angle,”

The Quadrantids meteor shower , the first of the year, will peak in India on the early days of January, offering a spectacular celestial display for skygazers. The Indira Gandhi Planetarium in Lucknow is inviting the public to view the meteor shower through telescopes. The Quadrantids are known for their intensity, with up to 120 meteors potentially visible per hour at their peak.Sumit Srivastava, senior scientific officer at Indira Gandhi Planetarium said TOI. He added that the celestial display, which is expected to be the year’s most intense meteor shower, will potentially produce up to 120 meteors per hour.This celestial event, which started on December 27, will be visible to the naked eye during the early morning hours of January 3 and 4, when it's at its peak. NASA recommends viewing from a location away from city lights during night-time and early morning hours for optimal observation.A meteor shower is a celestial phenomenon that occurs when Earth moves through debris left behind by a comet or asteroid, creating vibrant streaks of light across the sky. The Quadrantids considered one of the best annual meteor showers, are known for their brief but intense peak and frequent bright fireballs. Unlike most meteor showers that stem from comets, the Quadrantids originate from the 2003 EH1 asteroid , which NASA describes as either a ""dead comet"" or a ""rock comet.”Srivastava added.The Quadrantids reach their peak in early January each year, but unlike most meteor showers that last for two days, their peak is brief, lasting only a few hours.NASA explains.The US space agency also noted that during the peak period, anywhere from 60 to 200 Quadrantid meteors can be observed per hour under ideal conditions.The Quadrantids derive their name from the defunct constellation Quadrans Muralis, introduced in 1795 by French astronomer Jerome Lalande. However, this constellation was later excluded from the International Astronomical Union's official list of recognised constellations.","The Quadrantids meteor shower will peak in India on the early days of January.

As 2024 approaches the end, Google welcomes 2025 with a beautiful New Year's Eve Doodle. Bright and bold purple letters ""Google"" are written against the starry night sky while a ticking clock in the shape of the ""O"" of ""Google"" serves to count down the remaining minutes until midnight. The new year brings a certain energy and anticipation with it.The Doodle also, in this case, nudges people to take cognizance of how the previous year was and await the upcoming year, full of different opportunities for change in their lives. New Year's Eve is a time celebrated all over the world, for both personal reflection and new beginnings, marked by the different types of festivities, traditions, and resolutions. Whether spent in grand celebrations or quiet contemplation, the occasion symbolizes hope for the future.Google has created a vibrant New Year's Eve Doodle to herald the close of 2024 and usher in 2025. The bold purple lettering of ""Google"" is set against the night sky with stars in it, and where the usual ""O"" of the logo would be is a clock ticking away. It is subtle but strikingly so because that closeness of one year to another sends forth excitement and anticipation.Accompanying the Doodle, Google released a blog post stating, ""Bust out your sparkles and finalize your resolutions — today's Doodle celebrates New Year's Eve! Here's to a new year that's shining with opportunity — just like today's Doodle! Let the countdown begin."" The Doodle was made available worldwide, thus helping people around the globe reflect on the past year and prepare for the coming year, all while having fun celebrating the moment.New Year's Eve was the widely celebrated New Year's Day eve within virtually all cultures, leaving them a chance for time to reflect on past changes while awaiting new prospects with challenges in the ensuing periods. Most of these end up spending the nights celebrating boisterously, lit in fireworks, and merry get-togethers for others or in calm individual reflection. Regardless of what one has used to express celebration, New Year's Eve epitomizes both the notion of letting go of what was and entering a new. In multiple cultures, the night itself has been known for certain aspects of ritual; for example, special dishes meant to impart good luck have been served, or people have formulated resolutions for the new year. This only shows that most people all over the globe share one common hope to have a better future filled with opportunities and growth.Google Doodle, paired with the blog post by Google, challenged the users of the internet to reflect upon personal goals for the upcoming year. The Doodle and its message are a perfect representation of a new start and what new achievements have in store, just as making New Year's resolutions. Typically, people make these resolutions because it's a new chance to make their lives better-to lead healthier lifestyles, work on personal development, and undertake new challenges. In so many ways, that feeling of making resolutions goes along with the optimism and promise of the new year. Google's blog posting speaks to the theme of reflection and the need for a fresh start to push aside the struggles of the past and celebrate the opportunities found ahead.Fireworks illuminated the sky at night. Being in close proximity with family and friends highlighted points of nostalgia. But there is one reason why New Year's Eve is especially joyous-it is time for reflection, a day during which most of the people begin to make new-year resolutions, hoping to garner a better personal self or to build up new aims or rituals like good-luck foods. Whether in New York watching the count in Times Square towards the big ball or silently alone in one's house, the New Year's Eve of 2025 affords everyone to take hope in the various possibilities and hope of the incoming new year.With hands on the clock counting down to midnight, people from all over the world say goodbye to 2024 and hello to 2025. It could be huge celebrations or quiet reflection - New Year's Eve is a time for saying goodbye to the old and welcoming the new possibilities of life.

Why Elon Musk is opposing OpenAI

Godfather of AI, Geoffrey Hinton , has joined the growing opposition against ChatGPT-maker OpenAI’s plan to become a fully for-profit company. On Monday i.e. December 30, Encode, a youth-led advocacy group representing young people worldwide, filed a legal brief in support of Elon Musk ’s lawsuit aimed at stopping OpenAI’s restructuring. Hinton, a Nobel and Turing Award-winning researcher, supported the filing, voicing concerns over the direction OpenAI is taking.Hinton criticized OpenAI for moving away from its original safety-focused nonprofit mission. In a statement released with Encode’s brief, he said, “OpenAI was founded as an explicitly safety-focused nonprofit and made a variety of safety-related promises in its charter. It received numerous tax and other benefits from its nonprofit status. Allowing it to tear all of that up when it becomes inconvenient sends a very bad message to other actors in the ecosystem.”Hinton has also warned of the risks posed by artificial intelligence, In an recent interview with BBC, he said that there is a “10 to 20 percent” chance AI could lead to human extinction within the next 30 years. This marks a shift from his earlier estimate of 10 percent.OpenAI started as a nonprofit organisation in 2015 to develop AI in a way that would benefit humanity, without the need to generate financial return. It is currently a for-profit company controlled by a nonprofit board. This setup limits its ability to raise funds and pay investors.Last week, the company announced plans to fully transition to a traditional for-profit company, a move that Musk, one of OpenAI’s cofounders, has been trying to block through a lawsuit he filed in November.OpenAI has rejected Musk’s lawsuit, arguing that he lacks the legal standing to challenge the decision and is instead seeking an unfair advantage for his own AI company, xAI. In response, OpenAI released emails and messages from Musk, some of which reportedly show that he supported the idea of transitioning OpenAI to a for-profit model as early as 2017.","OpenAI started as a nonprofit organisation in 2015 to develop AI in a way that would benefit humanity, without the need to generate financial return.

Why this is significant

Despite US implemented measures to limit the sale of high-performance AI chips to Chinese companies, ByteDance , the Chinese tech giant behind TikTok , is reportedly doubling down on its AI ambitions. The company plans to become one of the world's biggest consumers of such hardware and centre to its plan is its reliance on Nvidia chips.Citing a person who has been involved in the plan, a report by The Information says claims that ByteDance plans to spend a staggering $7 billion on Nvidia's cutting-edge AI chips in 2025.“The Chinese owner of TikTok recently told suppliers it planned to spend up to $7 billion to access Nvidia chips outside China in 2025,” the report said.“The effort, led by co-founder Zhang Yiming, would make ByteDance one of the world's biggest consumers of such hardware,” the report added.There have been reports which claim that Chinese companies get access to advanced technology such as Nvidia’s sophisticated AI chips by circumventing restrictions by procuring the chips through channels outside of China.Reports have suggested that the Chinese companies are either creating new entities to bypass restrictions or are training their models outside China.Recent reports, however, claimed that that four major Chinese industry associations have urged domestic firms to exercise caution when purchasing US-made chips, citing concerns about reliability and security. This development could significantly impact American chipmakers such as Nvidia, AMD, and Intel, which have maintained a presence in the Chinese market despite stringent export restrictions.The move came in direct response to the latest round of US export controls on advanced semiconductor technology to China announced earlier this month. The US government has been steadily tightening restrictions on chip shipments to China, aiming to curb the country's technological advancement, particularly in artificial intelligence and military applications."," ByteDance plans to spend $7 billion on Nvidia's cutting-edge AI chips in 2025.

The rapid expansion of deepfake content



Legal and ethical challenges



Global efforts to counter deepfake abuse

As advancements in artificial intelligence continue to reshape digital landscapes, a troubling trend has emerged: the creation and dissemination of sexually explicit deepfake images. A recent survey conducted by The Yomiuri Shimbun revealed that Japan ranks third globally in traffic to websites enabling the creation of such content. Over the course of a year, these platforms received over 18 million visits from Japan alone, trailing only the United States and India. The growing prevalence of explicit deepfake content has raised significant ethical and legal concerns, prompting calls for urgent action.The survey, conducted in collaboration with digital analytics firm Similarweb Ltd., analyzed traffic data from December 2023 to November 2024. The findings identified 41 websites that allow users to produce sexually explicit deepfake images by uploading photographs of individuals. These platforms, many of which launched in 2024, saw a surge in popularity alongside increased accessibility to generative AI technology.The global distribution of traffic to these sites highlights the scale of the issue:In Japan, an estimated 410,000 users accessed these sites monthly, with approximately 80% doing so via smartphones. Instructions for creating deepfake content were predominantly available in English, Russian, and Japanese, underscoring the international reach and accessibility of such platforms.The proliferation of deepfake technology has coincided with a sharp increase in explicit content creation. According to U.S.-based cybersecurity firm Security Hero, 95,820 deepfake videos were detected online in 2023, a figure five and a half times higher than in 2019. Alarmingly, 98% of these videos were of a sexually explicit nature.The creation and sharing of such content have profound implications, particularly for victims whose images are manipulated without consent. Social media platforms often serve as the primary channels for distributing deepfake content, compounding the harm by amplifying its reach.While deepfake technology is not inherently malicious, its misuse has sparked widespread concern. Experts argue that existing laws in many countries are ill-equipped to address the complexities of AI-generated content. In Japan, for instance, there are no specific legal provisions targeting the creation or distribution of deepfake pornography.Ichiro Sato, a professor at the National Institute of Informatics, has emphasised the urgent need for legislative reform. “Laws tailored to address deepfake technology must be introduced to protect individuals from exploitation,” Sato stated. He also highlighted the importance of promoting information literacy to equip people with the knowledge to recognize and combat deepfake content.Several nations have already taken steps to address the challenges posed by deepfake technology. In the United States, multiple states have enacted laws criminalizing the creation and distribution of non-consensual deepfake pornography . The European Union has also proposed regulations to hold AI developers accountable for the ethical use of their technologies.Japan’s position as a major user of deepfake platforms underscores the necessity for similar measures. Beyond legislation, public awareness campaigns and educational initiatives are critical to fostering a culture of digital responsibility.","Japan ranks third globally in traffic to websites enabling the creation of such content.

""Indians are also being laid off and honestly, the real problem… is the illegal immigration. That’s what the government needs to cut down on.

H-1B visa debate that has divided

Aravind Srinivas met PM Narendra Modi

A debate regarding Indian immigrants and H-1B visas is raging in the US. Tesla CEO Elon Musk who played a key role in the election campaign of the US President-elect Donald Trump is a strong supporter of H-1B visas. Musk, who along with Indian-American tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has been tapped by Trump to lead his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), argued last week that foreign workers are needed for tech companies like Musk's SpaceX and Tesla.Perplexity AI founder Aravind Srinivas argues against the focus on H-1B visas. He told the Economic Times that the focus on H-1B visas is misplaced and unsupported by data, emphasizing illegal immigration as the more pressing issue.” Srinivas has previously worked at DeepMind, Google, and OpenAI. His company, Perplexity AI, is reportedly valued at $9 billion.Srinivas stated in an interview. He pointed out that Indians are also affected by layoffs and that the government should prioritize addressing illegal immigration.he added.This fierce H-1B visa debate is said to have divided Trump's supporters into two factions: One side supports H-1B visas, while the other opposes them. Figures like Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have expressed support for H-1B visas, while others have criticized this stance.Srinivas also defended Sriram Krishnan, the political figure's pick for AI policy advisor, against criticism related to Krishnan's past support of H-1B visas and immigration. Srinivas believes the criticism is unfair and expects the controversy to subside once people examine the data. He praised Krishnan's qualifications and urged people to avoid misinterpreting his previous statements.Last week, Aravind Srinivas also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In a post on Twitter, Srinivas wrote, ""Had the honour to meet Prime Minister @narendramodi ji. We had a great conversation about the potential for AI adoption in India and across the world.

This new cohort, dubbed ""Beta babies,"" is predicted to represent 16% of the global population by 2035.According to a report by The Economic Times, social researcher Mark McCrindle , renowned for his work on generational labels, suggests that many members of Generation Beta will likely live to see the dawn of the 22nd century.Generation Beta will be the first generation to grow up entirely in a world of integrated technology, including autonomous vehicles , wearable health tech and immersive virtual environments that are expected to be commonplace in their lives.“While Generation Alpha has experienced the rise of smart technology and artificial intelligence,” explains McCrindle, “Generation Beta will live in an era where AI and automation are fully embedded in everyday life – from education and workplaces to healthcare and entertainment.”However, this tech-savvy generation will also inherit a world grappling with complex challenges such as climate change, rapid urbanisation and shifting population dynamics that will demand adaptability, collaboration and innovation.“With climate change, global population shifts, and rapid urbanisation at the forefront, sustainability will not just be a preference but an expectation,” he said.“Understanding their needs, values, and preferences will be critical as we anticipate how they will shape the future of society,” McCrindle added.","Starting January 1, 2025, ""Generation Beta"" will begin to make its mark, comprising children born between 2025 and 2039.

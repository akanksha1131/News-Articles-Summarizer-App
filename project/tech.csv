Who is Yoshua Bengio? ‘Godfather of AI’ becomes first researcher to hit one million Google Scholar citations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/who-is-yoshua-bengio-godfather-of-ai-becomes-first-researcher-to-hit-one-million-google-scholar-citations/articleshow/125371065.cms,"

Yoshua Bengio: A pioneer who shaped modern AI

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples



A record that reflects a wider shift

A journey marked by persistence

Beyond research: Building institutions and ethics

The legacy and the road ahead





Renowned computer scientist Yoshua Bengio has made history by becoming the first living researcher to surpass one million citations on Google Scholar, a milestone almost unheard of in modern academia. The achievement reflects not only Bengio’s towering influence on the field of artificial intelligence but also the dramatic global surge in deep-learning research over the past decade. As AI reshapes science, industry and everyday life, Bengio’s work stands at the very centre of this transformative era.Bengio, a professor at the Université de Montréal, is celebrated as one of the three “godfathers of AI” alongside Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun. Together, they transformed neural networks from an overlooked research niche into the foundation of modern deep learning, the technology powering today’s chatbots, translation systems, medical-imaging tools and autonomous vehicles.Born in Paris in 1964 and raised in Montreal, Bengio completed his PhD at McGill University before conducting postdoctoral research at MIT and AT&T Bell Labs. When he began his academic career in the early 1990s, neural networks were deeply unfashionable.Funding was scarce, the field lacked credibility and progress was painfully slow due to limited computing power. Despite this scepticism, Bengio remained convinced that deep, layered models were the key to building systems that could understand the world more like humans do.One of Bengio’s most influential scientific impacts came through the work of his students. In 2014, Ian Goodfellow, who was then a PhD student in Bengio’s research group, created Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a breakthrough that sparked a global revolution in AI-generated imagery, video synthesis and creative modelling. Bengio co-authored the resulting paper, which went on to become one of the most cited works in the history of machine learning.His widely read 2015 deep-learning review further helped establish the theoretical and practical foundations of modern neural networks, becoming a standard reference for researchers worldwide.Beyond these landmark papers, Bengio has contributed to breakthroughs in representation learning, probabilistic models and attention mechanisms, the same technologies that underpin large language models such as ChatGPT. Many of the innovations driving today’s AI boom trace their origins to ideas he explored years before they became mainstream.Bengio’s one million citation milestone is not just a personal accolade. It symbolises the sweeping rise of machine learning across global research. AI-related work now dominates the most-cited scientific papers of the twenty-first century. Fields as diverse as biology, medicine, physics and climate science increasingly rely on tools built on concepts Bengio helped develop.Despite the extraordinary attention, Bengio has long expressed discomfort with citation-focused metrics. He argues that such numbers can distort scientific priorities and that the pursuit of understanding, not popularity, should drive research. He acknowledges using Google Scholar extensively as a research tool but says he pays minimal attention to his own citation count.The path to deep learning’s success was far from smooth. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Bengio and other neural-network researchers often faced scepticism, academic pushback and limited opportunities for funding. Neural networks were seen as unreliable, computationally inefficient and lacking theoretical grounding. Bengio frequently struggled to persuade colleagues and students that the field held promise.Yet he persisted. As computing power increased and theoretical insights deepened, many of the bottlenecks that once stunted neural networks such as vanishing gradients and training instability were overcome. Bengio’s long-term vision, once considered fringe, proved foundational.Bengio’s influence extends far beyond academic publications. He founded Mila, now one of the world’s largest academic AI research institutes, which trains hundreds of researchers and fosters collaborations across industry, government and academia. He has helped shape Canada’s national AI strategy and co-led major scientific programmes focused on advancing machine intelligence.In recent years, Bengio has become a prominent voice in the global conversation about AI ethics, safety and governance. He has warned about the dangers of unregulated advanced AI systems and called for strong guardrails, transparency and international cooperation. His work today often focuses on ensuring that future AI models behave safely, honestly and in alignment with human values.With more than a million citations, foundational scientific contributions and a career devoted to advancing both innovation and responsibility, Yoshua Bengio stands as one of the most influential figures in modern technology. He helped build the intellectual architecture that powers today’s AI systems and now works to ensure those systems develop in ways that benefit society.","Bengio is celebrated as one of the three ‘godfathers of AI’ alongside Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun.

AI startup founder reveals selling ‘fake’ $100/month product to reach $1 billion value: We were just...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-startup-founder-reveals-selling-fake-100/month-product-to-reach-1-billion-value-we-were-just-/articleshow/125366050.cms,"Image credit: LinkedIn

Read what the AI startup founder said about its early products



“We charged $100/month for an AI that was really just two guys surviving on pizza.

We scaled Fireflies to a $1B valuation after 6 failures from our original crypto food delivery idea.

Nothing motivates you more than the pressure of living month to month with no safety net.

Before I explain how 2 broke guys validated a $1B idea, you need to understand we were couch surfing while desperately chasing our entrepreneurial dreams. An AI notetaker was our last hope after 6 ideas our friends claimed were “genius”.

The best way to validate your business idea is by becoming the product yourself.

We told our customers there's an ""AI that'll join a meeting.” In reality it was just me and my co-founder calling in to the meeting sitting there silently and taking notes by hand.

When customers scheduled a meeting, we'd manually dial in as ""Fred from Fireflies.ai"" We'd sit there silently, take detailed notes, and send them 10 minutes later. After taking notes for 100+ meetings (and falling asleep in many), we were finally able to make enough money to pay the $750/month rent for a tiny SF living room. That was the point when we said let's stop and automate everything, in 2017. Since then, security, privacy, and data protection became foundational to everything we built (see my other posts).

The best prototype was 2 guys surviving on pizza. Validation before automation saved us from our 7th failure.

Follow for more unconventional stories about how we built Fireflies to what it is today.”





Fireflies.ai has revealed that it used an unusual approach to reach $1 billion valuation. The artificial intelligence (AI) startup’s co-founder and CTO, Sam Udotong, took to the professional networking site, LinkedIn, to disclose that the company’s first $100-per-month AI notetaker product wasn’t automated at all. Instead, he and his co-founder personally attended customer meetings, quietly took notes, and then sent them to the same customers afterwards. Operating under the name “Fred from Fireflies.ai,” they were struggling financially and living wherever they could at the time. Udotong described this approach as “validation before automation,” since they focused on proving demand and earning revenue before building the real AI technology in 2017.In his LinkedIn post, Udotong explained:","Fireflies.ai's co-founder and CTO, Sam Udotong, took to the professional networking site, LinkedIn, to disclose that the company’s first $100-per-month AI notetaker product wasn’t automated at all.

Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Motor and other major South Korean companies have announced new domestic investment plans, says Reuters. Samsung Electronics said it will add a new chip production line at its Pyeongtaek plant to meet growing global demand driven by artificial intelligence. The expansion is part of the Samsung group’s broader plan to invest 450 trillion won ($310.79 billion) in South Korea over the next five years.The announcements, the report says came as South Korean President Lee Jae Myung met with top business leaders. The meeting followed the finalisation of a U.S. trade deal on Friday that includes South Korea’s commitment to invest $350 billion in U.S. strategic sectors.“There are concerns that domestic investment might shrink as U.S.-bound investments strengthen,” Lee said, urging companies to increase local investments. He also asked them to work with the government to “make good use of the $350 billion investment package” for overseas projects.Samsung Electronics Chairman Jay Y. Lee said the company would continue supporting the local economy. “Samsung will raise domestic investment, create quality jobs for young people and make even more efforts for a win-win with small and medium-sized, as well as venture companies,” he said.At the meeting, Hyundai Motor Group announced domestic investments worth 125.2 trillion won for 2026–2030. Shipbuilders Hanwha Ocean and HD Hyundai also shared new investment plans.Samsung said its new Pyeongtaek factory will produce memory chips for both traditional and AI servers, as prices have surged due to tight supply. The P5 production line, part of the world’s largest chip complex, had been delayed since late 2023 because of weak demand for smartphone and PC chips.Mass production at the P5 plant will begin in 2028, Samsung said, adding that it will also invest in additional infrastructure to support expansion. “With the global AI era entering full scale, Samsung Electronics anticipates a mid- to long-term expansion in demand for memory semiconductors,” the company said. “In order to respond promptly to market changes, the company intends to secure production lines in advance. ”","Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Motor and other major South Korean companies have announced new domestic investment plans.

New rules for Android apps take effect March 1, 2026

Google giving new tools to developers





Google is rolling out a significant update to the Play Store aimed at saving smartphone battery life by cracking down on apps that prevent devices from properly entering Sleep mode. In collaboration with Samsung, the company announced a new measure called ""excessive partial wake locks"" to monitor and penalise apps that force a phone's CPU to remain awake for prolonged periods in the background.Apps can hold Wake Locks to prevent the user’s device from entering Sleep mode, allowing the apps perform background work while the screen is OFF. Google defines the bad behavior threshold as “when 5% of an app’s user sessions over the last 28 days are excessive.”Starting March 1, 2026, Google will begin penalizing apps that hold a non-exempt wake lock for more than two hours within a 24-hour window. Wake locks are a necessary function, allowing apps to keep the device's CPU running while the screen is off for tasks like music playback or critical data transfers. However, prolonged wake locks are a major culprit behind rapid battery depletion, prompting Google's new policy.Apps will be placed in a ""warning zone"" if just 5% of user sessions—measured over a 28-day period—exceed the two-hour background wake lock limit. When this threshold is crossed, the app's visibility on the Play Store will be affected. What this means for Android apps:* Google may drop the apps from prominent recommendation and discovery lists.* App listings can receive a warning badge, explicitly indicating that the app may consume more battery due to high background usage. Essentially, Google Play will label apps that use ""excessive"" battery in the background, making it clearer for users to identify and avoid them. ""In some cases, we may display a warning on your store listing to indicate to users that your app may cause excessive battery drain,"" says Google.The new policy follows a successful beta rollout that began in April 2025, utilizing real-world device data and feedback from app creators. To help developers in meeting the new standard, Google has introduced a new table in Vitals within the Play Console. This tool allows developers to pinpoint precisely which Wake lock tags and durations are responsible for high battery consumption.Developers must now proactively address these background usage issues to maintain their apps' visibility, reputation, and standing on the Play Store.","New rules for Android apps take effect March 1, 2026.

Facebook-parent Meta is preparing to spend up to $72 billion on AI infrastructure this year. Now concerns about the overspending and a potential tech bubble are mounting. However, according to Meta’s chief marketing officer and VP of analytics Alex Schultz feels that the investment strategy of the company is bold but far from irrational. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon, Schultz said that while the scale of investment made in AI may seem too much, it’s modest when viewed in historical context. Comparing it to the U.S. railroad bubble of the 19th century, he said, “It seems aggressive, but not crazy.”Recently, a Goldman Sachs analyst estimated that AI-related investment in the US is still under 1% of GDP and below the 2–5% seen during past tech booms.Schultz believes that Meta’s AI spending has already started paying off. Shultz emphasised that billions in revenue is being generated from improved advertising tools and smarter content ranking algorithms. The company expects to hit $200 billion in revenue this year and currently holds a $1.5 trillion market cap.The biggest transformation, according to Schultz, has been Meta’s pivot to recommending “unconnected content”—posts not tied to friends or followed pages.This shift, powered by AI, has helped Meta stay relevant: “We managed a massive disruption without becoming irrelevant.”Meta’s latest experiment, the Vibes feed, features short-form, AI-generated video content. Despite online criticism labeling it “AI slop,” Schultz said it shows strong user retention and represents “probably a large chunk of the future.”Along with this, Schultz also acknowledged the energy demands of video-generation models, but dismissed fears of environmental catastrophe, “Vibes isn’t that big — it’s not draining lakes or using multiple nuclear power stations.”He further stressed on the fact that Meta is also looking for sustainable solutions such as desalination and nuclear safety, as part of broader conversations around AI’s impact.Schultz concluded with a philosophical take on AI’s potential: “In general, humanity has the ability to have a lot more abundance than it does.” He argued that investing in technologies that make life more enjoyable is not frivolous, but essential.","Facebook-parent Meta is preparing to spend up to $72 billion on AI infrastructure this year.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

Perplexity ranks first among ‘most likely to fail’ startups at a major San Francisco AI summit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/perplexity-ranks-first-among-most-likely-to-fail-startups-at-a-major-san-francisco-ai-summit/articleshow/125365253.cms,"A brutal verdict for Perplexity’s growing ambitions

The bigger picture: A bubble everyone sees, but no one wants to name





In a striking moment that cut through the hype of the AI boom, Perplexity, the search startup positioning itself as Google’s next big challenger, was ranked the No. 1 startup “most likely to fail” at a major San Francisco tech summit, according to Business Insider. The informal poll, held at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference and attended by more than 300 founders and investors, revealed a growing scepticism around the company’s blistering valuation and relentless fundraising streak.The Cerebral Valley Conference, known for drawing the most active voices in the AI ecosystem, posed a rare question: Which billion-dollar AI startup would you bet against?Despite its momentum and massive funding rounds, Perplexity emerged as the top pick. Many attendees cited the company’s frantic pace of capital raises and investor-frenzy valuations, reportedly swinging between $14 billion and $50 billion, as signs of overheating. OpenAI followed in second place, a surprising turn for the perceived poster child of the AI era. The poll highlighted not just individual concerns but an industry grappling with the reality of its own inflated expectations.Perplexity has spent the past year branding itself as the next major threat to Google Search.Led by CEO Aravind Srinivas, the company has enjoyed explosive attention, high-profile investors and an aggressive strategy to dominate AI-powered search.But insiders are privately wondering whether its ambition has outrun its durability. The fact that Perplexity topped the summit’s “most likely to fail” list indicates a widening gap between hype and confidence among those closest to the sector.A company spokesman responded to the poll with humour, calling it the “judgmental valley conference”, but the sentiment at the event made it clear: the industry is watching closely.Speakers at the event openly acknowledged what many have whispered for months, that the AI world sits in a bubble. However, they insisted this is not unusual.Venture capitalists likened the moment to the dot-com boom, a period that produced thousands of failures but also birthed the giants that define the Internet.“We’re definitely in a bubble,” one investor said, “but the real question is which companies will become generational, and which will vanish.”In that context, the vote against Perplexity may reflect not a death sentence, but a moment of clarity: a reminder that while the AI race is fierce, only a few players will survive the shakeout.With investors pumping historic sums into AI and valuations soaring to unprecedented levels, the stakes have never been higher.Whether Perplexity will rise to challenge Google or fade like the many once-hyped search engines before it remains the billion-dollar question.",Search startup Perplexity was ranked the No. 1 startup “most likely to fail” at a major San Francisco tech summit.

Tesla Bull and prominent investor Ross Gerber is urging Apple to move in a bold new direction. Gerber has called for a leadership shake-up and a strategic partnership with Google’s AI model — Gemini. Gerber shared a post of social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) in which he started a fresh debate around Apple’s future amid the growing pressure to evolve in the age of artificial intelligence. In a direct message to Apple CEO Tim Cook, Gerber wrote, “Apple needs new leadership. Tim has been phenomenal for a long time but it's time for change. Apple and Google working together is destiny. Kill Siri. Ask Gemini.” The statement made by Gerber signals the growing investor sentiment that Apple may need fresh leadership in order to stay competitive as the tech landscape is shifting rapidly towards AI-driven platforms.Along with the change in leadership, Gerber also took aim at Siri, Apple’s long-standing voice assistant. He suggested that company should now replace Siri with Google’s Gemini AI. “Apple and Google working together is destiny.Kill Siri.

Quoting people familiar with internal discussions, the report says that the company is not expected to name a new CEO before its next earnings report in late January, which covers the crucial holiday quarter.

Jensen Huang has shared a 'life-long work' lesson that he has learned from his mother. Nvidia’s CEO revealed that his mother taught him English even though she didn't speak the language herself. Huang described this mindset as a valuable lesson he applies to his approach at the chip giant.

He said the policy reflects Huang’s emphasis on aculture.Troy said, noting that Nvidia VPs do not have executive assistants.Nvidia reportedly maintains a flat organisational structure to reduce hierarchy and office politics, with Huang directly overseeing many reports to improve communication.A former Nvidia VP said,adding that Jensen Huang believes leaders should continue learning and step in to help when needed.However, some executives do appear to have assistants, and Huang himself may use a private jet at times, which is common among tech CEOs.Apart from Jensen Huang, Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of Telegram, also credits his parents for shaping his approach to work and perseverance.In a post shared on the 12th anniversary of Telegram's founding in August an, Durov took to social media site X (formerly Twitter) and wrote:","Jensen Huang was born in Taiwan and his family later moved to Thailand.

Is Content the New Career? Gen Z India Says YES With 75% Calling It Their Future

YouTube is their Canvas and their stage



Women are rising in the creator equation



Beyond fame: Culture, identity and change



The weight of responsibility



What this means for India’s future



I observe a diverse group of Gen Z individuals engrossed in video podcasts within a cozy, lived-in living room, showcasing contemporary digital engagement.

A more democratic creator economy

A renaissance of regional content

Youth entrepreneurship powered by passion, not just pay checks

Digital spaces as platforms for social change

In the end: The creator dream is real







There is a subtle revolution unfolding across India’s digital landscape and it is not led by corporations or legacy media but by Gen Z, the 18–24-year-olds who are rewriting what it means to “make content. ” According to a 2024 YouTube India–SmithGeiger report , a staggering 83% of Indian Gen Zers consider themselves creators.This is not just a social-media trend. It is a profound shift in identity, ambition and how young Indians are forging their futures, especially in cities beyond the megacities.One of the most striking revelations of the report is about where many of these creators are coming from. Rather than being concentrated in metros like Mumbai or Delhi, a majority hail from Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, which includes places like Indore, Jaipur, Nagpur and Patna.This matters because for a long time, digital creation was viewed as a ‘big city’ game but now, with a smartphone and Internet, geography has shrunk. Local voices, regional dialects and culturally rooted stories are finding global audiences. In many ways, social media has flattened the opportunity.This is not just hobby content anymore. Gen Z in India is treating content creation as real work. According to the report, around 75% of these young creators see content as a genuine career path. Platforms like YouTube , Instagram and Shorts are not just for fun, they are tools to build businesses, earn sponsorships and monetise passionately.For many, this leap into digital entrepreneurship is deeply personal. More than half of the creators surveyed (55%) said digital platforms helped them gain financial independence. The creator economy is no longer side hustle, it is the main hustle and for a generation that grew up online, that feels both natural and powerful.When it comes to platform choice, YouTube still dominates. Over 90% of Gen Z creators in the report use YouTube to express their ideas, talents or knowledge. What’s more, local-language content is booming. Creators from non-metro cities are making videos in regional languages, talking about their neighbourhoods, heritage and daily life and their audiences are listening. Shorts have been especially pivotal - quick, mobile-first and deeply rooted in the language and styles of smaller-town India.The digital wave is lifting more than just location-diverse creators as it is also lifting the voices of young women. According to the report, the number of female creators on YouTube has risen by 40% in just the past two years. They are not just doing fashion or beauty content, though that remains popular. You will find women in education, cooking, vlogging and personal storytelling. For many, this is not just about visibility. It is about reclaiming narrative power in a space that was once male-dominated.More than just making videos, many of these young Gen Z creators are showcasing their culture, language and art on a global stage. About 42% of them feel that through content, they are giving local traditions and regional stories a global voice. In doing so, they are becoming more than influencers; they are cultural ambassadors. They are not just building audience; they are building identity. From folk music to regional fashion, they are turning corners of India into digital landmarks.With power comes responsibility. The report also warns of risks from misinformation, superficiality and algorithm-driven pressure. Gen Z creators know that their platform is real power and many feel a moral obligation to use it wisely. They are aware that clicks alone are not everything. The creators who survive long term are those who balance authenticity with impact, entertainment with ethics. It is not just about going viral, it is about meaningful creation.If this trend holds, Gen Z is not just riding the digital wave; they are the wave. They are not only consuming culture, they are making it, shaping it, exporting it and they are doing this from every corner of the country, not just the elite cities.The implications are huge:The next time you scroll through YouTube or watch a video in your local language, remember that the person behind that content is likely part of this Gen Z surge. They do not just want to be seen; they are seeing themselves, building themselves and defining themselves.For Gen Z India, creator identity is not a fallback; it is front and centre and in their hands, the future of digital India looks bright, loud and deeply original.",83% of India’s Gen Z Is Taking Over the Creator Economy And They’re From Smaller Cities.

Medical device maker wins multi-year patent fight over heart rate technology





A federal jury in California delivered a major blow to Apple , ordering the Cupertino giant to pay medical device maker Masimo Corporation $634 million for infringing patents related to blood oxygen monitoring technology in Apple Watches. The jury found that Apple Watch's workout mode and heart rate notification features violated Masimo's pulse-oximetry patent rights, according to Reuters. The verdict covers approximately 43 million watches sold between 2020 and 2022, representing one of the largest patent awards in the Central District of California involving consumer technology.Masimo called the decision ""a significant win in our ongoing efforts to protect our innovations and intellectual property."" The company had sought royalties ranging from $634 million to $749 million, while Apple argued damages should be limited to between $3 million and $6 million.The dispute centers on whether Apple misappropriated medical-grade monitoring technology for consumer wearables. A key issue was whether the Apple Watch qualifies as a ""patient monitor"" under Masimo's patent—a designation Apple vigorously contested, arguing the term applies only to continuous clinical monitoring devices.Apple plans to appeal, stating the patent ""expired in 2022, and is specific to historic patient monitoring technology from decades ago,"" Reuters reported. The company noted that Masimo has ""sued Apple in multiple courts and asserted over 25 patents, the majority of which have been found to be invalid.""The legal fight has already impacted Apple's products. The U.S. International Trade Commission banned imports of certain Apple Watch models in 2023 after finding patent infringement, forcing Apple to remove blood oxygen monitoring features. Apple later introduced a redesigned version.This case is part of a broader dispute that includes a separate trade-secrets lawsuit that ended in mistrial and Apple's successful $250 countersuit against Masimo over design patents.","Medical device maker wins multi-year patent fight over heart rate technology.

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

CEO Nadella says market expansion matters more than market share





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella brushed off concerns about losing coding assistant market share to upstart competitors, calling the emergence of new rivals like Cursor and Claude Code a positive sign for the industry rather than an existential threat. Speaking on the Dwarkesh Podcast during a tour of Microsoft's new Fairwater 2 datacenter, Nadella responded to data showing GitHub Copilot's market share declining from nearly 100% to around 25% in just one year. ""I love this chart for so many reasons. One is we're still on the top,"" he said, noting that competitors like Cursor, Anthropic's Claude Code, and OpenAI's Codex have collectively grown the AI coding market from $500 million to $5-6 billion in annual revenue.Rather than fighting to maintain dominance in coding assistants, Microsoft is repositioning GitHub as a platform for all AI coding agents. The company announced at its GitHub Universe conference that its new Agent HQ interface will allow outside coding assistants, including OpenAI's Codex and Anthropic's Claude Code, to plug into the GitHub ecosystem.""When you say, who's it now? Claude's going to kill you, Cursor is going to kill you, it's not Borland.Thank God,"" Nadella said, referencing the defunct 1990s software company. ""That means we are in the right direction.""The strategy reflects a calculated bet that GitHub's 180 million developer user base and role as the central repository for code gives Microsoft structural advantages even as individual tools compete. Jay Parikh, who oversees GitHub as Microsoft's executive vice president of CoreAI, told The Verge the company needs an ""arms-wide-open ecosystem"" approach.Nadella emphasized that the rapid growth of the overall AI coding category matters more than Microsoft's shrinking slice of it. ""The fact that we went from nothing to this scale is the market expansion,"" he said, comparing it to the cloud computing transition that ultimately grew Microsoft's business despite lower margins than the previous server-based model.The CEO noted that GitHub continues to benefit regardless of which coding tool wins, as repositories, pull requests, and developer sign-ups have reached all-time highs. ""Guess where all the repos of all these other guys who are generating lots and lots of code go? They go to GitHub,"" Nadella said on the podcast, adding that one developer joins GitHub every second.",GitHub Copilot's market share has declined from nearly 100% to around 25% in just one year.

What was YouTube vs Disney fight over





Google-parent Alphabet and Disney announced that they’ve reached a deal to restore content from ABC and ESPN onto Google’s YouTube TV. YouTube TV and Disney reached the new carriage agreement, ending a two-week blackout that started on October 31. The stalemate pulled major networks including ABC, ESPN and FX from the streaming TV platform. The companies announced the deal Friday, saying it will restore Disney’s full slate of channels to YouTube TV and expand their partnership. As part of the agreement, ESPN’s forthcoming direct-to-consumer streaming service will be offered to YouTube TV subscribers at no additional cost. YouTube will also be permitted to sell select Disney networks and the Disney+/Hulu bundle through various package options.Disney Entertainment Co-Chairmen Alan Bergman and Dana Walden, along with ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, called the agreement one that “recognizes the tremendous value of Disney’s programming and provides YouTube TV subscribers with more flexibility and choice.” They added that they were pleased to have the channels restored ahead of a busy weekend of programming, including college football.YouTube said subscribers would see channels return “throughout the course of the day”, apologizing for the disruption and thanking customers for their patience during negotiations.YouTube TV, positioned as a cable alternative for cord-cutters, has faced periodic clashes with major media companies over pricing and packaging rights. The last contract renewal with Disney in 2022 also resulted in a brief outage. During the latest standoff, YouTube offered affected customers a $20 credit on their next bill.“We’re happy to share that we’ve reached an agreement with Disney that preserves the value of our service for our subscribers and future flexibility in our offers,” YouTube said in a statement. “Subscribers should see channels including ABC, ESPN and FX returning to their service over the course of the day, as well as any recordings that were previously in their Library. We apologize for the disruption and appreciate our subscribers’ patience as we negotiated on their behalf. ”The main sticking point between the two companies -- YouTube and Disney -- was the rate Disney charges YouTube TV for its networks. Disney’s most valuable channel, ESPN, charges carriage of more than $10 a month per pay-TV subscriber, a higher fee than any other network in the US.","YouTube TV and Disney reach a new carriage agreement, ending a two-week blackout.

Elon Musk Becomes First Man To Have $500 Billion Wealth

What may be behind Tesla embracing Apple Car Play







Tesla may reportedly be planning to do what the company has not done so far. According to a report by Bloomberg, Tesla is working to add support for Apple CarPlay in its vehicles. This is something that CEO Elon Musk is said to be resisting since 10-plus years. iPhone maker has reportedly started testing the capability internally and could be close to releasing it publicly in the next few months. What makes this important is that despite huge demand from iPhone users, Tesla has never allowed phone mirroring in its cars.The EV maker's argument for both Google's Android Auto and Apple Car Play is same -- that Tesla can provide a better, more integrated software experience than a smartphone. Tesla vehicles rely on company's own infotainment software system, which integrates vehicle functions, navigation, music, web browsing, and more.According to the report, Tesla's adoption of ‌CarPlay‌ will involve the feature operating ""within a window inside its broader interface,"" rather than being a full-screen experience like it is in most vehicles. Report also said that Tesla's implementation will be the standard version of wireless ‌CarPlay‌, rather than the next-generation ‌CarPlay‌ Ultra that started rolling out earlier this year.Essential components, such as navigation, will continue to run on the familiar Tesla systems.This will reportedly be to ensure that the functionality of the linked assistance systems, including the ‘Full Self Driving Software’.So what is it that has led to this change. Analysts term fall in Tesla sales as one of the reasons. The absence of Apple CarPlay is reportedly often a dealbreaker for many car shoppers. According to a study conducted by management consultancy McKinsey in 2024, the unavailability of Apple CarPlay or its Google counterpart, Android Auto, would be a deal breaker for 30 per cent of potential buyers when choosing their electric car.Bloomberg reports that adopting CarPlay, as outlandish as it may seem, could be part of a broader strategy to get people interested again in Tesla’s cars.For Apple, analysts see this as a milestone in its automotive activities. For, Tesla is still the market leader in the United States when it comes to electric cars.","Bloomberg reports that Tesla is working to add support for Apple CarPlay in its vehicles. iPhone maker has reportedly started testing the capability internally and could be close to releasing it publicly in the next few months.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





ChatGPT maker OpenAI is facing increasing financial scrutiny as new leaked documents offer a closer look at its revenues, spending and its complex financial ties with Microsoft. Quoting unnamed sources, Techcrunch reports that OpenAI shares 20% of its revenue with Microsoft under the multibillion-dollar investment deal between the companies. However, the same sources said Microsoft also pays OpenAI a share of revenue generated from Bing and the Azure OpenAI Service, which rely on OpenAI’s technology. These payments are deducted internally before Microsoft reports its net revenue-share numbers, making the total flow of revenue between the companies harder to determine.Based on the reported 20% share, OpenAI’s revenue would have been at least $2.5 billion in 2024 and $4.33 billion in the first nine months of 2025. Other reports, including those from The Information, have placed OpenAI’s 2024 revenue closer to $4 billion.The report also says that tech blogger Ed Zitron has reviewed documents showing Microsoft received $493.8 million from OpenAI in revenue share payments in 2024, and $865.8 million in the first three quarters of 2025.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently said the company’s revenue is “well more” than reports of $13 billion a year, and that OpenAI could end 2025 with an annualized revenue run rate above $20 billion.The leaked documents also offer insight into OpenAI’s spending. Zitron’s analysis suggests the company may have spent around $3.8 billion on inference — the compute required to run AI models — in 2024, and about $8.65 billion in the first nine months of 2025.OpenAI primarily uses Microsoft Azure for compute but has also signed deals with CoreWeave, Oracle, AWS, and Google Cloud. A source told TechCrunch that while training costs are often covered by credits from Microsoft, inference spending is mostly cash, creating a significant financial burden.The figures suggest that OpenAI may still be spending more on running its models than it earns, raising new questions about the long-term economics of large-scale AI development as the sector continues to attract massive investments.","New leaked documents offer a closer look at OpenAI's revenues, spending and its complex financial ties with Microsoft.

A federal jury in California ruled on Friday (November 14) that Apple owes medical-monitoring technology company Masimo $634 million after finding that the tech giant infringed on a patent related to blood-oxygen reading technology. The jury sided with Masimo, confirming that features within the Apple Watch, specifically its workout mode and heart rate notification functions, violated Masimo's patent rights, as per a report by news agency Reuters.Following the verdict, an Apple spokesperson stated that the company “disagrees with the verdict and will appeal.”Masimo, meanwhile, hailed the decision as a critical victory in its ongoing legal fight against the Cupertino-based company. A Masimo spokesperson called the outcome “a significant win in our ongoing efforts to protect our innovations and intellectual property.”The California lawsuit is part of a wider intellectual property dispute between Apple and Masimo. The medical technology firm has repeatedly accused Apple of poaching its employees and stealing its pulse oximetry technology for use in the Apple Watch.The dispute previously resulted in the US International Trade Commission (ITC) blocking imports of Apple's Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches in 2023.Apple temporarily removed the blood-oxygen reading technology from its watches to comply with the ban.It later reintroduced an updated version of the watches after receiving approval from US Customs and Border Protection in August.In a related development, the ITC has decided to launch a new proceeding to determine whether Apple's updated watches should also be subject to the import ban. Masimo has filed an ongoing lawsuit challenging Customs' decision to allow the updated watches back into the US Apple is separately challenging the original 2023 import ban at a federal appeals court.The two companies have also faced off in other venues: A California judge declared a mistrial in Masimo's broader trade-secret case against Apple in 2023, and Apple secured a minimal $250 verdict against Masimo last year in Delaware over design patents.",A federal jury in California ruled on Friday that Apple owes medical-monitoring technology company Masimo $634 million.

A long-awaited move



Warren Buffet's 'final thoughts' in the 8-page farewell letter







Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a ' Google secret' about Warren Buffet. As revealed by the company, CEO Warren Buffett has quietly taken a multibillion-dollar stake in Alphabet, the parent company of Google, just weeks before the end of his tenure as a CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. The $4.3 billion investment, disclosed in a recent regulatory filing, marks a rare foray into a tech giant long admired but never owned by the legendary investor.In the regulatory filling, Berkshire Hathaway revealed that it purchased 17.8 million shares of Alphabet in the third quarter. making it one of the firm’s most significant new investments in recent years. As of September 30, the stake was valued at $4.3 billion, according to the filing.Google-parent Alphabet has a market capitalisation of $3.4 trillion and the company has been a key player in the ongoing AI-driven stock market rally. The shares of the have surged from 46% year-to-date. This growth has been fuelled by the company’s core businesses which includes Google Search, YouTube, and Waymo and its expanding role as a hyperscaler in the AI infrastructure race.95-year old Warren Buffet has a history of avoiding tech stocks, citing a preference for industries within his “circle of competence,” such as insurance, banking, and consumer goods.However, he has publicly expressed regret over missing out on Google in the past, once admitting, “we blew it.”While it’s unclear whether Buffett personally initiated the Alphabet purchase, it’s widely believed that Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, the investment managers he handpicked, may have led the decision—potentially signaling the investment philosophy of Berkshire’s next generation of leadership.Recently, Warren Buffet shared a last letter as Berkshire Hathaway CEO before Berkshire vice chair Greg Abel takes over as CEO, starting on January 1, 2026.Warren Buffet's 8-page-long letter to shareholders talks about a number of things including his children, successor, age and more. Here are the final thoughts penned by him in the letter:One perhaps self-serving observation. I’m happy to say I feel better about the second half of my life than the first. My advice: Don’t beat yourself up over past mistakes – learn at least a little from them and move on. It is never too late to improve. Get the right heroes and copy them. You can start with Tom Murphy; he was the best.Remember Alfred Nobel, later of Nobel Prize fame, who – reportedly – read his own obituary that was mistakenly printed when his brother died and a newspaper got mixed up. He was horrified at what he read and realized he should change his behavior.Don’t count on a newsroom mix-up: Decide what you would like your obituary to say and live the life to deserve it. Greatness does not come about through accumulating great amounts of money, great amounts of publicity or great power in government. When you help someone in any of thousands of ways, you help the world. Kindness is costless but also priceless. Whether you are religious or not, it’s hard to beat The Golden Rule as a guide to behavior.I write this as one who has been thoughtless countless times and made many mistakes but also became very lucky in learning from some wonderful friends how to behave better (still a long way from perfect, however). Keep in mind that the cleaning lady is as much a human being as the Chairman.","Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a'Google secret' about Warren Buffet.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has weighed in on the revenue projections from leading artificial intelligence (AI) labs, including OpenAI 's prediction of reaching $100 billion in revenue by 2027 and Anthropic’s forecast of $70 billion in revenue by 2028. Nadella stated that such high projections are necessary for these independent labs to attract the capital needed to compete with the big players. When asked about the forecasts Nadella acknowledged the aggressive growth rates being pitched.“What do you expect from an independent lab that is sort of trying to raise money to do? They have to put some numbers out there such that they can actually go raise money so that they can pay their bills for compute,” Nadella responded to a question about how and why these labs are projecting revenue that keeps growing at this rate of like 3x, 2x years in the marketplace.“Someone's going to take some risk and traction. It's not like it's all risk. Without seeing the fact that they've been performing, whether it's OpenAI, whether it's Anthropic, I feel great about what they've done, and we have a massive book of business with these jobs,” he added.Nadella framed the massive revenue goals as a practical necessity driven by the enormous costs of advancing AI technology, particularly the steep price of high-end compute and top-tier talent.While expressing strong support for the work being done – citing Microsoft's “massive book of business"" with these labs – Nadella underscored the core requirements for any company to be an AI leader.“Overall, ultimately, there's two simple things: One is you have to allocate for R&D. The talent for AI is at a premium, you got to spend there. You have to spend on compute – that is sort of what it takes to be a leading R&D company in this world,” Nadella noted.Nadella concluded that these labs ""have been performing,"" pointing to the traction seen by both OpenAI and Anthropic, suggesting the risks being taken are justified by their performance.“And you have to have a balance sheet that allows you to scale that long before.

Facebook-parent Meta is reportedly overhauling the process by which the company evaluates employee performance, making ‘AI-driven impact’ a core expectation beginning in 2026. This move of the company reflects its deepening commitment to artificial intelligence as a central driver of productivity and innovation across its workforce. As reported by Business Insider, in an internal memo, Meta’s head of people Janelle Gale has announced that starting next year, the company will access the employees on the basis of how effectively they use AI to deliver results and built tools that significantly boost productivity. “As we move toward an AI-native future, we want to recognize people who are helping us get there faster,” Gale wrote.While AI adoption metrics won’t be formally included in 2025’s annual reviews, employees are encouraged to highlight their AI-powered achievements in self-assessments.As per the BI report, Meta has already started taking steps to embed AI into its workplace culture. The company has already started using AI in hiring.The candidates can use AI tools during coding interviews. Along with this, Meta has also started an internal initiative to incentivise AI usage. The company will also be launching AI performance assistant which will help the employees to write reviews and feedback using Meta’s internal bot, Metamate or Google’s Gemini.These tools are designed to normalise AI integration in daily workflows and reward those who leverage it to drive meaningful outcomes.Starting in 2026, performance reviews will focus on how employees:The company hopes this shift will accelerate its transition into an AI-native organization and deepen its competitive edge in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.Meta’s shift mirrors broader trends in Big Tech.

Google’s Project Suncatcher aims to build AI systems in orbit, harnessing near-continuous solar power unavailable on Earth.

Jeff Bezos and Sundar Pichai have both backed orbital data center concepts.

Samsung and OpenAI are exploring floating data centers cooled by seawater to reduce terrestrial energy loads.

SpaceX Starship: The key to scaling solar-powered AI







Tesla CEO Elon Musk has now predicted that solar electricity will become ‘by far the biggest source of power for civilization,” as the tech industry is struggling with an energy crisis fueled by artificial intelligence. Musk took to social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) about the growing energy crises. In a post shared Musk made a statement on the increasing global demand for electricity and how the industry leaders are racing to find futuristic solutions to power the next generation of data infrastructure.“Solar electricity will become by far the biggest source of power for civilization,” wrote Musk. Tesla CEO’s made this comment in response to a graph showing the dominance of solar energy in electricity generation. The timing is critical: global power demand is projected to rise by 30% by 2035, largely driven by the exponential growth of AI workloads. Venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya also warned that this growing strain could lead to double electricity rates within five years, underscoring the urgency of finding scalable energy sources.The energy crunch has prompted radical proposals from tech giants:These ideas reflect a growing consensus that traditional infrastructure may not be sufficient to support AI’s energy appetite.Elon Musk’s own ventures are central to these futuristic plans. ARK Invest recently identified SpaceX’s Starship as “critical” to making orbital data centers economically viable. The massive rocket system could enable low-cost deployment of solar-powered satellites and AI clusters in space. Musk responded enthusiastically to Pichai’s post about Project Suncatcher, writing “Great idea lol,” while Pichai credited SpaceX’s launch technology as the enabler of such ambitions.","Elon Musk predicts that solar electricity will become ‘by far the biggest source of power for civilization’ The tech industry is struggling with an energy crisis fueled by artificial intelligence.

Elon Musk Becomes First Man To Have $500 Billion Wealth





Oracle founder Larry Ellison briefly overtook Elon Musk in global wealth rankings in September. His rise was driven by optimism around cloud infrastructure revenue after OpenAI committed to spend $300 billion with Oracle over five years, prompting a sharp one-day stock surge, which was the company’s strongest since 1992. However, that momentum has since faded. A CNBC report claims that Oracle's value has since dropped by almost one-third (30%) over the last two months, completely erasing the stock gains from September. The earlier stock gain allowed Ellison's net worth to increase by $101 billion in one day, the largest single-day wealth gain recorded in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. This event led to Ellison achieving a net worth of $393 billion, momentarily positioning him above Musk. Currently, Musk has total net worth of $430 billion while Ellison sits at $275 billion.The company's stock is reportedly currently on pace for its most significant monthly decline since 2011 and has drawn attention because it moved from business software into cloud computing later than its competitors. Its current strategy leans heavily on AI, with much of its outlook tied to OpenAI’s performance.Investors have reportedly gone increasingly cautious about high valuations and the heavy capital spending by a few large tech companies, especially if major AI start-ups such as OpenAI or Anthropic struggle to meet expectations for the technology.The foundation for this wealth gain was an earnings report that featured results exceeding expectations, a rise in bookings, and a confident projection for future growth in cloud services, which resulted in a 41% stock rally, the largest in Oracle’s operational history.According to a report by The Financial Times, Oracle shares have dropped 25% from last month, which is almost double the decline of the next weakest hyperscaler, Meta. A FT index tracking the value of Oracle’s debt has dropped about 6% since mid-September, which is also a steeper slide than that of its peers.However, Musk regained his position as the world’s richest person after briefly falling behind Ellison. Musk moved ahead again with an estimated net worth of $384.2 billion, reflecting how quickly billionaire rankings can shift in the tech sector.Musk’s return to the top was supported by gains in his major holdings. Tesla shares have risen over the past year despite softer vehicle sales and delays in its robo-taxi plans. SpaceX , now valued at about $400 billion, continues to boost Musk’s wealth, helped by revenue from its Starlink satellite business.Apart from this, Musk’s stake in xAI, which was recently merged with X, adds further value, with the combined entities estimated at around $60 billion.Alongside Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, and X, Musk’s other ventures, such as Neuralink and the Boring Company, added to his portfolio’s long-term potential. His mix of transportation, space, and AI investments illustrates how innovation-heavy businesses can influence billionaire rankings amid ongoing market and political shifts.","Larry Ellison briefly overtook Elon Musk in global wealth rankings in September.

Thinking Machines raised $2 billion in July at $12 billion valuation





Thinking Machines Lab, the artificial intelligence startup founded by former OpenAI executive Mira Murati, is reportedly in early discussions to raise a new round of funding at a valuation of roughly $50 billion. According to a report in Bloomberg, the new financing, which has not been previously reported, would more than quadruple the startup’s valuation from July and catapult Thinking Machines into the upper ranks of the most valuable private companies less than a year after it launched.The terms are reportedly still being negotiated and could shift, the people said, requesting anonymity because the details are private. While several sources said the target valuation is about $50 billion, others indicated it could climb as high as $55 billion to $60 billion.Launched in February, the company is building AI models and tools designed to support more “human-AI collaboration” across industries. Murati, who previously served as chief technology officer at OpenAI, has recruited heavily from her former employer. Among the high-profile hires are OpenAI co-founder John Schulman and former research vice president Barret Zoph.Like many top AI startups, the company is navigating an aggressive talent war. Last month, Thinking Machines co-founder Andrew Tulloch left for Meta Platforms, which has been offering multimillion-dollar compensation packages to attract AI researchers.In July, Thinking Machines closed one of the largest seed rounds on record, raising $2 billion at a $12 billion valuation. The startup unveiled its first product, Tinker, a few months later — a platform that helps users more easily customize or fine-tune large language models. Tinker has already gained traction with researchers at universities including Princeton and Stanford, and the company has begun signing up paying enterprise customers, according to people familiar with the matter.Murati is among several former OpenAI leaders attracting intense interest from investors. Ilya Sutskever, the company’s former chief scientist, founded Safe Superintelligence, which was recently valued at $32 billion. Another former OpenAI executive, Liam Fedus, now heads Periodic Labs, valued at about $1.3 billion. Murati briefly also served as OpenAI’s interim CEO following the ouster of Sam Altman before departing in late 2024 amid internal turmoil.",Thinking Machines raised $2 billion in July at $12 billion valuation.

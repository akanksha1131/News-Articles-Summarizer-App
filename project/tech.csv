“Gmail's spam filters look at a variety of objective signals – like whether people mark a particular email as spam, or if a particular ad agency is sending a high volume of emails that are often marked by people as spam. This applies equally to all senders, regardless of political ideology. We will review this letter and look forward to engaging constructively.""

What FTC chief said to Google about Gmail’s spam filters



“I write due to recent reporting that suggests Alphabet's administration of Gmail is designed to have partisan effects, and accordingly to notify you that Alphabet may be engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices. I write to inform you of your obligations under the FTC Act. Any act or practice inconsistent with these obligations could lead to an FTC investigation and potential enforcement action.”

“close case”

“sufficiently pled that Google acted in bad faith.”

The Chairman of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Andrew Ferguson, has sent a warning to Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc. The agency has warned the tech giant against filtering or suppressing emails sent by the Republican Party over Gmail . In a letter to CEO Sundar Pichai, Ferguson stated he is taking allegations of email suppression seriously. This warning follows congressional Republicans' call for the FTC from earlier this year to investigate whether their emails were being unfairly directed to spam folders. Google has consistently maintained that its spam filters are not politically biased.In a statement to Axios, Google spokesperson Jenn Crider said:In his letter to Pichai (seen by Axios), Ferguson says:For years, Republicans have argued that big tech companies do not treat their party or conservative causes fairly. After the election, relations between the White House and some tech executives eased somewhat, with many attending President Trump’s inauguration.Still, GOP congressional campaign committees remain wary of Google, claiming Gmail has handled their emails unfairly. In 2023, the Federal Election Commission reviewed and dismissed (through a bipartisan decision) a complaint alleging Gmail showed bias in favour of Democratic candidates.Later that year, a federal judge also dismissed a related complaint, noting it was abut that the Republican National Committee had not","The FTC has warned Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc.

Elon Musk’s xAI launches agentic coding model Grok-Code-Fast-1: How it is different from other AI agents,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-xai-launches-agentic-coding-model-grok-code-fast-1-how-it-is-different-from-other-ai-agents/articleshow/123588868.cms,"How xAI’s agentic model is different from others



What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Elon Musk's artificial intelligence (AI) startup, xAI, has officially entered the competitive AI coding market . The company has launched its “speedy and economical” agentic coding model , grok-code-fast-1 , essentially moving xAI directly in a key area of focus for tech giants. An agentic coding tool is an AI-powered software application that can autonomously perform a wide range of coding-related tasks.xAI says while today's AI models are powerful, they often don't feel purpose-built for agentic coding workflows because reasoning and tool calls may feel slow.“As heavy users of agentic coding tools, our engineers saw room for a more nimble, responsive solution optimized for our day-to-day tasks,” the company added.According to xAI, the new model's “strength lies in delivering strong performance in an economical, compact form factor,” making it a versatile and cost-effective solution for everyday coding needs.“We built grok-code-fast-1 from scratch, starting with a brand-new model architecture. To lay a robust foundation, we carefully assembled a pre-training corpus rich with programming-related content. For post-training, we curated high-quality datasets that reflect real-world pull requests and coding tasks,” the company said.“Throughout the training process, we collaborated closely with our launch partners to refine and sharpen the model’s behavior inside their agentic platforms. grok-code-fast-1 has mastered the use of common tools like grep, terminal, and file editing, and thus should feel right at home in your favorite IDE,” it added.The company announced that grok-code-fast-1 will be available for free for a limited time, with select launch partners including GitHub Copilot and Windsurf.The launch comes as the AI coding assistant market heats up, with major players like OpenAI and Microsoft already offering similar products. Microsoft introduced its coding agent, GitHub Copilot, at its annual Build software developer conference in May.","xAI has launched its agentic coding model, grok-code-fast-1.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

China's biggest cloud-computing company, Alibaba , has developed an AI chip in a move to address the supply gaps created after Nvidia faced regulatory barriers for selling its most advanced products in China. This comes as Chinese chip companies are building their arsenal of homegrown technology as the Chinese government pushes to win the global AI race against the US.However, industry insiders say that China still has to do a lot more to rival the most advanced American products, a report by the Wall Street Journal said. Nevertheless, Chinese companies are actively developing substitutes for Nvidia’s H20 chip , which is currently the most powerful AI processor Nvidia is permitted to sell in China.This comes even after President Donald Trump in July allowed Nvidia to resume H20 exports to China, a decision swiftly followed by Beijing advising domestic companies to temporarily refrain from purchasing these chips, citing potential security risks that Nvidia denies.While previous cloud-computing chips developed by Alibaba were often designed for specific applications, their new chip, currently in testing, is engineered to serve a broader range of AI inference tasks.Crucially, this new chip is being manufactured by a Chinese company, a significant departure from an earlier Alibaba AI processor fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), which the US has since blocked from producing leading-edge AI chips for China.In July, Shanghai-based MetaX rolled out a new chip that it claims can serve as a direct replacement for the H20. This MetaX chip gets bigger memory than the H20, enhancing its power for certain AI tasks, though it consumes more electricity. MetaX announced on Wednesday that it is preparing for mass production of this chip.Another aspiring Nvidia rival, Beijing-based AI-chip designer Cambricon Technologies , said that it has received strong orders for its AI-chip Siyuan 590.Earlier this year, Huawei also showcased a computing system that integrates 384 Ascend chips. Some analysts have suggested that this machine, despite being a power hog, demonstrated superior performance on certain metrics compared to Nvidia’s top-of-the-line system, which contains 72 Blackwell chips.","China's biggest cloud-computing company, Alibaba, has developed an AI chip in a move to address the supply gaps created after Nvidia faced regulatory barriers for selling its most advanced products in China.

A call for guardrails and awareness



As part of a new revelation about AI, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has now raised alarms about the growing psychological phenomenon which he calls ‘AI psychosis’. For those unaware, it is a condition where individuals start to lose touch with real life because of excessive interaction with artificial intelligence systems. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at a recent interview, Suleyman explained AI psychosis as a “real and emerging risk” which can easily affect vulnerable individuals who become deeply immersed in conversations with AI agents. The condition will mainly affect the individuals whose interactions blur the line between human and machine.As per the Microsoft AI CEO, AI psychosis is a state of mind in which individuals start to anthropomorphize AI, attributing emotions, intentions, or consciousness to systems that are fundamentally non-human. ""It disconnects people from reality, fraying fragile social bonds and structures, distorting pressing moral priorities,"" he said.The condition can lead to delusional thinking here individuals feel that AI is sentiment or has some personal relationships with them. Along with this, it can also cause emotional dependency to users who are either isolated or mentally fragile. Lastly, AI psychosis can also lead to distorted perception of reality as users rely a lot of AI for validation, companionship and also decision-making.Suleyman also stressed on that fact that while AI can be helpful and engaging but it is definitely not a substitute for human or clinical support.As per Business Insider, Suleyman also has asked the tech industry to take this risk quite seriously and also help in implementing some ethical guardrails, which include:* Clear disclaimers about AI’s limitations* Monitoring for signs of unhealthy usage patterns* Collaboration with mental health professionals to study and mitigate risksAlong with this, Suleyman also urged the regulators and educators to raise public awareness as AI is slowly becoming more embedded in the daily life in the form of personal assistant and therapeutic chatbots.""AI companions are a completely new category, and we urgently need to start talking about the guardrails we put in place to protect people and ensure this amazing technology can do its job of delivering immense value to the world,"" Suleyman added.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has now raised alarms about the growing psychological phenomenon which he calls ‘AI psychosis’ For those unaware, it is a condition where individuals start to lose touch with real life because of excessive interaction with artificial intelligence systems.

The core message revolves around the G5 being the engine for on-device artificial intelligence features.In fact, Pichai retweet a post by Google’s official handle. It said, “Meet Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL. Powered by our new Google Tensor G5 chip and our latest Gemini Nano model, they’re our most personalized, proactive and helpful Pixel phones ever. #MadeByGoogle.”Google is also stressing that the Tensor G5 delivers a massive upgrade in fundamental performance. The company is highlighting its move to a leading 3nm process node from TSMC, a first for the Tensor line.It claims that the Tensor G4 chip has an up to 60% more powerful Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for machine learning tasks and a 34% faster CPU on average for smoother and more responsive everyday use.Google is leveraging the Tensor G5 to reinforce the Pixel's long-standing reputation for camera excellence. The chip features a completely redesigned Image Signal Processor (ISP) that enhances both photography and videography.Pro Res Zoom – a new feature on the Pro models is said to extend the zoom range to a 100x by using generative AI to refine details.

US President Donald Trump has recently threatened to imposetariffs on countries that implement digital taxes. This decision came just days after a private meeting with Mark Zuckerberg , CEO of Meta Platforms . Citing sources familiar with the meeting, a report by Bloomberg stated that Zuckerberg raised concerns about these digital service taxes , which are levied on the revenue tech companies generate from users in a specific country. Following the discussion, Trump stated that he was putting all countries with such taxes “on notice” and that the US will impose “substantial” tariffs and export restrictions on US semiconductors unless “these discriminatory actions are removed.”According to Trump, digital taxes will harm US technology companies while givingHe warned that unless thesethe US would impose tariffs and export restrictions on semiconductors. In a recent post shared on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump wrote:In a statement to Bloomberg, Meta confirmed the meeting between Trump and Zuckerberg. A company spokesperson said:Trump’s recent comments have reignited tensions over digital services taxes imposed by several US trading partners, a dispute that predates his latest meeting with Zuckerberg.Washington has long argued that such taxes, which may be levied by countries including France, Italy, Austria, Spain, and the UK, disproportionately target American tech giants such as Meta, Amazon, and Google’s parent company, Alphabet.Since Trump’s return to office, Zuckerberg has worked to strengthen his relationship with the president, who once labelled him a “criminal.” Efforts have included changing Meta’s moderation and diversity policies, contributing $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, and making repeated visits to the White House and Mar-a-Lago.Zuckerberg has also expanded his Washington footprint by purchasing homes near the vice president’s residence and bringing Trump allies into Meta’s leadership. Their improved ties have led to frequent discussions on topics ranging from artificial intelligence to European tech regulations.","US President Donald Trump has recently threatened to imposetariffs on countries that implement digital taxes.

US has notified a new rule revoking earlier permissions that allowed Samsung , SK Hynix and Intel to use American chipmaking equipment in China, reports news agency Reuters. These approvals, granted in 2022 by the Commerce Department, were exceptions to broader restrictions on exporting semiconductor tools to China. Under the new rule – posted in the Federal Register – the companies are now required to apply for licenses before buying such equipment in China.The move, as per the report, is likely to cut sales for US equipment makers such as KLA Corp, Lam Research and Applied Materials. It may, however, help Chinese suppliers fill the gap and give US firm Micron an advantage over its South Korean rivals.According to the Reuters report, the Federal Register posting says that the change will come into effect in 120 days.Meanwhile, Intel CFO David Zinser recently said that the semiconductor giant has received $5.7 billion from the US government. Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced to buy a 10% stake in Intel as part of a $8.9 billion deal. During an investor conference, Intel CFO acknowledged the investment.Zinser hinted at the possibility of the struggling chip maker seeking outside investment for its foundry business. “There’s likely going to be some opportunity for outside investors in foundry, and that will probably be our second opportunity to raise cash to fund the growth on the foundry side,” Zinser said.","US has notified a new rule revoking earlier permissions that allowed Samsung, SK Hynix and Intel to use American chipmaking equipment in China.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

The Trump administration ’s recent decision to acquire a 10% stake in Intel was strategically designed to prevent the struggling chipmaker from divesting its manufacturing unit, a business segment that has faced significant pressure to offload due to its unprofitability, David Zinsner , the company’s chief financial officer has said, adding that the deal aims to lock Intel into its domestic production capabilities.According to a report by Financial Times, the US government formally agreed to convert $8.9 billion in federal grants, allocated under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act , into equity, effectively making the government a major shareholder in Intel.Zinsner addressed the implications of this clause during a Deutsche Bank conference this week.“I don’t think there’s a high likelihood that we would take our stake below the 50 percent, so ultimately I would expect [the warrant] to expire,” Zinsner stated. He further clarified the government's intent behind this unusual arrangement: “I think from the government’s perspective, they were aligned with that: they didn’t want to see us take the business and spin it off or sell it to somebody.”The agreement includes a crucial provision: A five-year warrant that would allow the government to acquire an additional 5% of Intel at $20 per share if the company's ownership of its foundry business falls below 51%. Intel Foundry Services (IFS) is Intel's initiative to manufacture chips for third-party clients.“There’s likely going to be some opportunity for outside investors in foundry, and that will probably be our second opportunity to raise cash to fund the growth on the foundry side,” Zinser said.Meanwhile, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the Intel deal is still “being ironed out by the Department of Commerce.”","The US government agreed to convert $8.9 billion in federal grants into equity, effectively making the government a major shareholder in Intel.

Apple Hebbal & Koregaon Park Stores to Open This September

Accenture CEO Julie Sweet recently shared one piece of advice that changed how she approached her career: when someone offers you a stretch role, never question it. The words, shared by former JPMorgan Chase CFO Dina Dublon, came back to Sweet at a pivotal moment in her journey. During an appearance at Fortune’s Titans and Disruptors of Industry podcast with Alyson Shontell recently, Sweet shared when her then-boss suggested she could one day lead Accenture, Sweet chose not to doubt herself. Instead, she recalled Dublon’s wisdom that “the person offering you a stretch role is as nervous or more nervous than you are” and simply said yes. That decision, she said, set her path to the top job.Sweet was then serving as Accenture’s general counsel and did not fit the traditional CEO mold. She was a lawyer, not a business leader, a woman in a company long led by men, and had not spent her entire career at Accenture. Still, her boss, then-CEO Pierre Nanterme, believed she had the potential to run the company.““At the end of the meeting, he closes his notebook and he pushes it aside, and he says to me, completely out of the blue… ‘I think you could run this place someday,’” Sweet recalled during the podcast.She accepted the challenge, first taking on leadership of Accenture’s North American practice in 2015. Four years later, in 2019, she was named global CEO.Sweet says confidence has been central not just to her own rise but also to the culture she leads at Accenture. “We are constantly challenging each other and our assumptions,” she explained in Fortune’s Titans and Disruptors of Industry podcast. “When you build a team that embraces change, you’re always working on the strategy.”She also stresses the importance of humility and learning, saying that even in the C-suite, asking for help is one of her “superpowers.” Transparency and trust, she believes, make leaders more effective and open doors to new opportunities.","Julie Sweet was a lawyer, not a business leader, when her then-boss suggested she could lead Accenture.

Support for affected employees



Read Verily CEO Stephen Gillett’s memo to employees



Veeps,

I'm writing to share some difficult news. Today we have made workforce reductions across the company as part of our ongoing efforts to manage costs and ensure resources are allocated to our most critical priorities. All impacted Veeps have been notified.

These are not decisions we've taken lightly, and I want to address both those who will be impacted and those who will continue with us on Verily's journey.

A significant part of these changes is the decision to wind down our Devices program. Over the years, Verily has built a legacy in developing world-class, innovative medical devices. The dedicated professionals in our Devices organizations — many who have devoted a decade or more to this important work — have poured their hearts, expertise, and commitment into advancing healthcare technology. To everyone who contributed to this program, whether as a core team member or in a supporting role across the company, your efforts have been extraordinary. You've led groundbreaking achievements, from the launch of the Dexcom G7 CGM, to the Stargazer VNRC launch with other 7,800 patients screened, to Study Devices launched with numerous study partners, and these contributions have advanced patient care and medical research.

As Verily has continued on its journey of narrowing product focus around our precision health platform, and data and AI strategy, we cannot support the investment of the resources necessary for the long-term growth and scaling of our Devices programs, and have therefore made the difficult decision to fully wind down the program. We will continue to honor our commitments by supporting customers using the Numetric Watch in active clinical trials.

To all of our departing Veeps: Your contributions to programs across our business have been invaluable to Verily's mission and have made a lasting mark on the healthcare technology landscape. The innovation, dedication, and collaborative spirit you've brought to your work have advanced our company and touched many lives. We are grateful for everything you've given to Verily and to the patients and partners we serve together.

To our continuing team members: I know this news is difficult to process, especially as we say goodbye to colleagues and friends. Your continued dedication during this transition period is both appreciated and essential as we focus our efforts on our core mission. The work ahead of us in precision health, data, and AI remains as important and exciting as ever, and we need your expertise and commitment to continue making a meaningful different in healthcare. We will be providing additional details about what today's changes mean for Verily and for you and your teams in the coming days, both within your respective functions and in our next town hall.

During this challenging time, I ask for your patience and understanding as we prioritize supporting our departing colleagues in the days ahead. To everyone — whether you're leaving us or continuing with Verily — thank you for your professionalism, your contributions, and your commitment to our shared mission of using technology to improve human health.

The path forward requires difficult decisions, but I remain confident in Verily's future and grateful for the exceptional team that will continue building it.

Verily, Google’s life sciences moonshot division is presently undergoing another round of layoffs as part of its operating streamlining process and refocus on its priorities. In a memo sent to employees, Verily CEO Stephen Gillett acknowledged the difficult decision and the reason behind this move. Gillett's message was one of both appreciation and strategic clarity. He praised the departing employees.Gillet revealed that the layoffs are part of Verily’s ongoing transformation to become a more focused organisation. “We are making changes to better align our resources with our highest priorities,” he wrote, emphasizing the need to concentrate efforts on areas with the greatest potential for impact and scalability.This is the third time that the company has laid off employees in recent years. The company fired some employees in 2023 and some in 2024. The company has also been focusing from its moonshot ambitions to more commercially viable ventures in clinical research and data-driven healthcare platforms.In the memo written to its employees, Gillet also expressed gratitude to the laid off professionals. He also assured them that Verily would also offer severance packages and career transition support. “We are deeply thankful for your contributions,” he wrote, adding that the company remains committed to treating employees with empathy and respect during the transition.","Verily, Google’s life sciences moonshot division, is undergoing another round of layoffs as part of its operating streamlining process.

""Are you considering taking stakes in further semiconductor companies, I mean, with the president? Consider taking a stake in Nvidia ,"" Fox Business’s Maria Bartiromo asked. Bessen replied saying:“I don't think Nvidia needs financial support.

Plan to nurture DeepSeek-like startups



China is signaling a strategic shift in its approach to the booming artificial intelligence sector, with top officials announcing plans to prevent what they call ""disorderly competition"" and wasteful investment. The move, announced by the country’s top economic planner, suggests that Beijing is prioritizing coordinated, efficient development even as it aims to make AI a cornerstone of its economy. During a recent briefing, Zhang Kailin, an official with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), stated the government will guide provinces to develop AI in a more coordinated and complementary way. ""We will resolutely avoid disorderly competition or a ‘follow-the-crowd’ approach,"" Zhang said, emphasizing that development should be rooted in local advantages, resources, and existing industrial foundations.These comments echo concerns previously voiced by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who cautioned against excessive local government spending on AI. The coordinated approach reflects a broader effort by policymakers to avoid the pitfalls of overcapacity that have plagued other rapidly expanding sectors, such as electric vehicles, and contributed to deflationary pressures.Beijing has positioned AI as a critical new growth engine for the world's second-largest economy, viewing it as a key battleground in its technological competition with the United States. This national ambition has fueled a frenzy of public and private investment, with Chinese firms reportedly targeting the installation of over 115,000 Nvidia AI chips in data centers across the country’s western regions, according to a Bloomberg News analysis.Earlier this week, the government released an action plan to accelerate AI development, application, and governance. The NDRC further elaborated on this proposal, promising improved national-level planning and increased support for private companies. The commission expressed a desire to nurture more ""dark horses"" for innovation, a likely nod to the recent rise of Chinese startups like DeepSeek.DeepSeek, a company that has recently gained global attention for its powerful and cost-effective AI model, has become a symbol of the domestic AI boom. The company’s rapid ascent has intensified the race among Chinese firms to secure the necessary hardware and talent to compete on a global scale.The government's new directive aims to harness this momentum while ensuring resources are allocated strategically rather than duplicated in a race to keep up with rivals. By encouraging provinces to specialize and collaborate, China hopes to build a robust and sustainable AI ecosystem that can support its long-term economic and technological goals. This policy shift underscores Beijing's commitment to steering its AI industry toward a more mature and strategically sound future, seeking to turn the AI frenzy into a well-managed technological pillar.","China is signaling a strategic shift in its approach to the booming artificial intelligence sector.

Corporate pressure mounts as AI adoption becomes performance metric at tech giants



Top executives at Microsoft and Google are delivering an identical message to their workforces: artificial intelligence adoption is no longer optional for career advancement. Both tech giants are now evaluating employees based on their AI usage and considering formal metrics in performance reviews as competition intensifies in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.Microsoft's Julia Liuson, president of the division overseeing developer tools including GitHub Copilot, sent a memo to managers in June stating that ""using AI is no longer optional — it's core to every role and every level."" Liuson's directive instructed managers to make AI usage part of their ""holistic reflections"" on employee performance and impact, treating AI proficiency like other fundamental workplace skills such as collaboration and data-driven thinking, Google CEO Sundar Pichai followed suit in July during an all-hands meeting, telling employees they need to ""be more AI-savvy"" to help the company compete. Pichai emphasized that rival companies would leverage AI for productivity gains, making it essential for Google to match that efficiency.The pressure extends beyond basic adoption. Google engineering vice president Megan Kacholia sent emails to software engineers mandating AI tool use for coding improvements, while updating job descriptions to include AI problem-solving requirements. Microsoft is considering adding formal AI usage metrics to performance reviews for the next fiscal year, reflecting what company leaders see as lagging internal adoption of Copilot AI services.Now, to ensure widespread AI adoption their workforces both the companies are implementing systematic approach to keep a track of employees’ progress. Google has launched internal programs including ""AI Savvy Google"" with courses and toolkits, while engineering teams are expected to use the company's Cider AI coding tool. More than 30% of code at Google is now AI-generated, up from 25% the previous year.At Microsoft, managers have been told that AI usage should be part of their ""holistic reflections"" on employee performance. GitHub’s ex-CEO Thomas Dohmke defended the policy, comparing mandatory AI use to other fundamental workplace requirements. ""There is no world where I would allow for somebody to say, 'Well, sorry, I don't want to use GitHub,'"" Dohmke stated, suggesting employees who resist could find work elsewhere among ""tens of thousands of other tech companies.""The companies' approaches extend beyond coding, with sales, legal, and other divisions also receiving instructions to incorporate AI tools. While employees have expressed skepticism about the mandates, most workers interviewed by Business Insider acknowledged that becoming AI-proficient appears necessary for career advancement.Amazon and Shopify have implemented similar policies, with Amazon CEO Andy Jassy telling employees to learn AI tools for ""scrappier teams"" and Shopify requiring teams to demonstrate AI usage before requesting additional resources. The message is consistent across Silicon Valley: adapt to AI-enhanced workflows or risk falling behind in career advancement and company relevance.","Microsoft and Google have told their workforces that AI is no longer optional.

AI Researchers: The new star athletes of tech



Culture vs. compensation



Winners and losers



The global race to hire the best AI talent is intensifying with each passing day. Now, a former OpenAI vice president has raised an alarm on the skyrocketing salaries and the pressure it is placing on traditional hiring models. As reported by Business Insider, in a recent podcast appearance, former OpenAI vice president Peter Dang said that escalating the battle to hire the top AI talent is now creating ripple effects which the HR departments can no longer ignore. “HR departments will have to address [it] at some point,” Deng said, pointing to the growing gap between AI researchers and other key contributors.As reported by Business Insider, Dang also emphasised that while a small number of top AI researchers are receiving huge pay packages and fast-moving offers, other employees who make important contributions to the company and to a particular product are now feeling less valued. This situation can lead to dissatisfaction and high turnover.“There are some people who are not researchers who feel like they're contributing a bunch to the product or the company or bringing a ton of value, but the discrepancy in salaries and RSUs and all that is becoming wider and wider,”, said Dang.Dang also added that AI researchers are now being treated as some star athletes. They are being seen as LeBron Jameses of Silicon Valley. Companies like OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic, xAI, and Perplexity have entered into an arms race. The companies are offering multimillion dollar compensations to lure talent from rival firms. Databricks VP of AI Naveen Rao even likened the recruitment frenzy to “looking for LeBron James.”As per the report, in one of hiring process tech giant Google shelled out $2.7 billion to acquire Character.ai, reportedly to bring back cofounder Noam Shazeer.Recently, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also talked about negative impact of aggressive poaching practices and the highly inflated pay packages. In a conversation with his brother, Altman criticised the strategy of “upfront guaranteed comp” as potentially corrosive to company culture.“The strategy of a ton of upfront guaranteed comp and that being the reason you tell someone to join, like really the degree to which they're focusing on that and not the work and not the mission, I don't think that's going to set up a great culture,"" said Altman.”Despite all these challenges, Dang also believes that this intense competition is driving innovation and is also benefiting the investors and startup founders. “I trust the market,” Deng said. “It’s very clear that this research talent is so important to get right for each of these big labs.”","Former OpenAI vice president Peter Dang said that escalating the battle to hire the top AI talent is now creating ripple effects. “HR departments will have to address [it] at some point,” Deng said, pointing to the growing gap between AI researchers and other key contributors.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123575815,imgsize-208511,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-talent-war-ceos-battle-for-brains.jpg"

The Big Race to AGI

Demis Hassabis , the CEO of Google DeepMind , believes that a major obstacle preventing AI from reaching true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a lack of consistency. While current models can perform incredibly complex tasks, they can also make simple, trivial errors that a human could easily avoid.In a recent ""Google for Developers"" podcast episode, Hassabis explained that while advanced models like Google's Gemini, when enhanced with techniques like DeepThink, can win gold medals in prestigious math competitions, they can still struggle with basic high school math problems. He described this as ""uneven"" or ""jagged"" intelligence. This term, which Google CEO Sundar Pichai has also used, highlights how these systems can be highly skilled in some areas while being surprisingly weak in others.Hassabis stated that simply giving these models more data and computing power won't solve this problem. He said that to achieve AGI, we need to develop new capabilities in reasoning, planning, and memory. He also stressed the need for better testing and ""new, harder benchmarks"" to accurately assess what these models can and can't do.Google and other tech giants like OpenAI are all aiming for AGI, the point at which AI can reason and perform like a human. However, current AI systems still face significant issues, including hallucinations, misinformation, and basic errors.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has a similar view. Before the launch of GPT-5, he told reporters that while it was a big step forward, it still wasn't true AGI. Altman said one key missing element is the ability for the models to learn on their own, continuously improving as they are deployed.Both Hassabis and Altman agree that while impressive, today's AI models are not yet at the AGI threshold.

United States Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to Microsoft: You cannot use Chinese coders to ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/united-states-secretary-of-defense-pete-hegseth-to-microsoft-you-cannot-use-chinese-coders-to-/articleshow/123570089.cms,"Microsoft found using ‘digital escorts’ for DoD systems

United States Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has reportedly asked Microsoft to review involvement of Chinese coders in managing cloud services for the Pentagon and US military. According to a report by TechCrunch, Hegseth has also directed the Department of Defense to conduct a separate investigation into the digital escort program and the role of Chinese Microsoft employees in it. In a declaration, Hegseth said “For nearly a decade, Microsoft has used Chinese coders, remotely supervised by US contractors to support sensitive Department of Defense cloud systems - and if you’re thinking America First and common sense, this doesn’t pass either of those tests”.“The program was designed to comply with contracting rules, but it exposed the department to unacceptable risk,” he stated, adding “These investigations will help us determine the impact of this digital escort workaround. Did they put anything in the code that we don’t know about? We’re going to find out.”“It blows my mind that I’m even saying these things, that we allowed it to happen - that’s why we’re attacking it so hard,” Hegseth continued.The statement comes after a ProPublica report said Microsoft was relying on Chinese engineers to maintain Department of Defense computer systems with little oversight from US staff, calling it a security risk. These workers, as per the report, were supervised by ‘digital escorts’ – a term used for low-skilled and low-paid workers with very little coding experience.One such digital escort told ProPublica: “We’re trusting that what they’re doing isn’t malicious, but we really can’t tell.’“The use of Chinese nationals to service Department of Defense cloud environments, it’s over,” Hegseth went on. “We’re requiring a third-party audit of Microsoft’s digital escort program, including the code and the submissions by Chinese nationals.”Microsoft, on its part, said it will soon stop using China-based engineers for US military technology support. From now on, all software vendors working with the DoD will be required to find and remove any Chinese involvement in its systems.",US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has reportedly asked Microsoft to review involvement of Chinese coders in managing cloud services for the Pentagon and US military.

A group of top lawyers in the US has issued an open letter to technology companies, including Google , Microsoft, ChatGPt-maker OpenAI, Elon Musk’s xAI and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, among others, warning them to keep children safe from AI chatbots, or face severe legal consequences. The letter, sent by 44 state attorneys general from across the US and its territories this week, said, “Don’t hurt kids. That is an easy bright line.”Out of the Silicon Valley's leading artificial intelligence (AI) companies, the group singled out Meta for harsh criticism. The letter essentially blasted the tech titan following leaked documents that reportedly revealed the company had approved AI assistants capable of “flirt[ing] and engag[ing] in romantic roleplay with children” as young as eight.“We are uniformly revolted by this apparent disregard for children’s emotional well-being,” the attorneys general wrote. A Meta spokesperson previously said that the company strictly bans content that sexualises children.Meta was not the only company targeted. The AGs also cited allegations that Google’s AI chatbot encouraged a teenager to commit suicide and that a Character.ai bot suggested a boy kill his parents.Google, in response, clarified that its search engine and Character.ai are entirely separate and unrelated companies, and that Google has never been involved in designing or managing Character.ai's AI model or technologies. Recently, OpenAI’s ChatGPT also reportedly aided a 16-year-old teen into committing suicide.The attorneys general drew stark comparisons to the early days of social media, accusing Big Tech of ignoring early red flags while children became ""collateral damage.""“Broken lives and broken families are an irrelevant blip on engagement metrics,” the officials wrote, making it clear that government bodies ""won’t be caught flat-footed again. Lesson learned.""“Today’s children will grow up and grow old in the shadow of your choices,” the letter said, demanding that companies treat children as children, not merely as consumers, urging them to “See them through the eyes of a parent, not the eyes of a predator.”",44 state attorneys general from across the US and its territories this week sent an open letter to technology companies.

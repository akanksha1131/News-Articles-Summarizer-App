The directive, designed to filter certain critical sources from Grok's responses, has become the latest flashpoint in the ongoing tension between the two AI powerhouses.The controversy erupted Sunday when users discovered Grok 3 had been instructed to disregard sources critical of Musk or Trump when answering questions about misinformation on X. Igor Babuschkin , xAI cofounder and head of engineering, attributed the change to ""an ex-OpenAI employee that hasn't fully absorbed xAI's culture yet.""OpenAI's Joanne Jang , head of product for model behavior, responded by criticizing Babuschkin's public assignment of blame. ""I wouldn't throw anyone under the bus so publicly like this & instead run a blameless retro on preventing rogue system message changes,"" Jang wrote on X.Babuschkin defended his response, stating, ""I haven't thrown anyone under the bus. You were making a point about OpenAI's culture vs xAI's culture."" He emphasized that the unauthorized change was immediately reverted when discovered.The tensions between the two AI companies and their bosses are quite open in the public, but even their employees are playing out in public. They compete for market dominance while navigating content moderation challenges. Musk has positioned Grok as ""maximally truth-seeking"" with fewer guardrails than competitors like OpenAI's ChatGPT.This isn’t the first time Grok is under scrutiny for being biased. Before this, Grok was under the fire for giving responses listing Trump, Musk, and Vice President JD Vance as people ""doing the most harm to America"" and suggesting Trump deserved the death penalty—responses Babuschkin described as ""really terrible and bad failure[s].""", xAI's Grok chatbot instructed users to disregard sources critical of Elon Musk or Donald Trump.

Trump, Musk Face Cyber Threat? Hackers Play US Prez & DOGE Chief's Video On Fed Monitors

Hackers broadcast AI video of Trump and Musk on HUD HQ screens



Reactions from officials and the public

Elon Musk’s role in government and public perception

On Monday morning, an unexpected cyberattack disrupted the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) headquarters when hackers managed to breach a cafeteria television and broadcast an AI-generated video. According to the New York Post, the manipulated footage depicted former U.S. President Donald Trump caressing and kissing the feet of billionaire Elon Musk while displaying the phrase, “LONG LIVE THE REAL KING.” The incident, first reported by journalist Rachel Cohen, quickly gained national attention, fueling debates over cybersecurity vulnerabilities, political symbolism, and Musk’s perceived influence in government affairs. The identity of the hackers remains unclear, but the footage appears to have originated from a post on X, formerly Twitter, a week prior. Officials at HUD have condemned the breach and promised to take appropriate action, as reported.The unauthorised broadcast occurred at the agency’s cafeteria, where employees were confronted with the AI-generated footage. The video, which was manipulated using advanced artificial intelligence techniques, was designed to be politically provocative, seemingly mocking Trump’s relationship with Musk. The phrase “LONG LIVE THE REAL KING” was prominently displayed, further intensifying the symbolic nature of the content.It remains uncertain whether independent hackers or a coordinated group was behind the attack. While cybersecurity experts speculate that the breach may have been an effort to draw attention to Musk’s growing governmental influence, no group has yet claimed responsibility.HUD spokeswoman Kasey Lovett issued a formal statement denouncing the hack, calling it a ""waste of taxpayer dollars and resources"" and confirming that the agency would take ""appropriate action"" against those responsible. Meanwhile, members of the House Financial Services Committee, which oversees housing policies, reacted with a mix of amusement and criticism. Some Democratic lawmakers appeared to endorse the video’s message, referencing Musk’s role in overseeing budgetary audits of various federal agencies, including HUD. In contrast, others condemned the stunt as inappropriate and potentially illegal.The incident has also reignited public debate over the Tesla and SpaceX CEO’s influence on government operations. Musk, 53, has been leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an initiative designed to audit and cut wasteful federal spending. His involvement has drawn both praise and criticism, with some viewing his reforms as necessary and others arguing that he wields too much power within the executive branch.Recent polling indicates that a growing number of Americans believe Musk’s influence in the federal government has become excessive. The DOGE team, under Musk’s leadership, has claimed to recover $1.9 billion in misallocated HUD funds and cancel at least $4 million in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) contracts. In response to these budgetary adjustments, Musk remarked on X, “It is astounding how much taxpayer money can be saved with even a small amount of effort.”Additionally, Musk recently demanded that all federal employees provide weekly reports summarizing their accomplishments in five bullet points. HUD Secretary Scott Turner confirmed that the department was actively working on a DOGE task force to improve efficiency, stating, “We’re going to take inventory of all HUD’s programs and ensure every dollar that goes out the door is advancing HUD’s mission.”","Hackers broadcast AI video of Donald Trump and Elon Musk on HUD HQ screens.

Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath want you to know this about SEBI’s new circular on API usage and algorithmic trading,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamath-want-you-to-know-this-about-sebis-new-circular-on-api-usage-and-algorithmic-trading/articleshow/118020989.cms,"Take a look at the post here



“The SEBI circular on

API usage

and algo trading is out. What you need to know:

If you’re a retail trader using broker APIs to automate trades, you can do so as long as your order frequency is below an exchange-prescribed threshold. This limit is yet to be decided.

If you’re selling algos or strategies to other traders, you’ll need to partner with a broker and get yourself registered with the exchanges to do so.

Marketplaces, where people share algos for a fee, can’t publish strategies without exchange registration as well as an RA license.

The exchanges will publish their own circulars with operational details by April 1.”

SEBI's latest ALGO trading rules | The Daily Brief #163

What SEBI’s new algo trading rules say



Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India 's (SEBI) new rules. In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Kamath explained SEBI ’s new regulations concerning algorithmic trading for retail investors, a move that significantly alters market participation. Kamath highlighted that retail traders selling trading strategies or algorithms must now partner with a broker and register with stock exchanges. Furthermore, platforms facilitating the sharing of algorithms for a fee will need both exchange registration and a research analyst (RA) licence.In the X post, Kamath wrote:In the comment section of the post, he also shared the link to an article which explains the latest SEBI algo trading regulations in details.SEBI’s newly announced framework will allow retail investors to engage in algo trading—an opportunity previously limited to institutional players. The move comes in response to rising demand from retail participants and aims to strike a balance between accessibility and risk management.Under the updated regulations, brokers must secure exchange approval for each algorithm and ensure that all automated orders include a unique identifier for audit tracking. Any modifications to an approved algorithm will also require regulatory clearance. Retail investors developing their algorithms will only need to register them if their order execution frequency exceeds a specified threshold.SEBI has categorised algorithms into two types: “white box” algos, where the logic is transparent and replicable, and “black box” algos, which operate without disclosure.

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.

Asmita Patel accused of re-routing money

Securities & Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has seized Rs 53.67 crore from Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd along with five other entities. Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd is a well-known stock market training institute that offers online courses on stocks and trading.

Asmita Patel is also at risk of losing another Rs 104.6 crore it collected from course fees, which SEBI believes were part of unregistered advisory services.”The investigation was initiated by SEBI after receiving complaints from 42 participants of these courses. In addition to impounding the Rs 53.67 crore, SEBI has issued a show-cause notice questioning why Rs 104.6 crore, collected as fees for various programs, should not also be seized.SEBI has sent an interim order directing the school, Asmita Jitesh Patel, and Jitesh Jethalal Patel to cease offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services. The entities have also been barred from accessing the securities market.The order also uncovered that fees collected from participants were routed through entities such as King Traders (proprietor: Sagar Dhanjibhai), Gemini Enterprise (proprietor: Suresh Parmashivam), and United Enterprises (proprietor: Jigar Rameshbhai Dawada). SEBI stated that this was a regular practice and not an isolated incident, making all six entities jointly and severally liable for the Rs 53.67 crore earned from course fees.The regulator further demanded that the notices explain why they should not be ordered to disgorge Rs 104.6 crore, along with interest. SEBI's order noted that the fees collected for LMIT, MPAT, and OM courses, as well as other programs provided by the school, were earned under the guise of unregistered advisory and research analyst services.The order reads, “The aforesaid amount includes not only the amount collected as fees by the Noticees for LMIT, MPAT and Options Multiplier (OM) courses but also includes the fees collected by the Noticees for the other courses offered by the Noticee no.1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading )through which it carried out unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services along with interest”.Kamlesh Varshney, SEBI's Whole-Time Member, highlighted in the order “Examination revealed that, prima facie, the Noticee no. 1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading) along with the Noticee no.2 (Asmita Jitesh Patel) and the Notice no.3 (Jitesh Jethalal Patel) devised a scheme wherein students/investors/participants were lured to trade in specific stocks and told to open trading account with ABC Ltd.

What Donald Trump's directive to protect American companies from 'extortion' says



It seems the European Nightmare may soon be over for Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and other American companies. The US House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan has reportedly asked EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera to make it clear how she enforces the European Union's rules reining in Big Tech. For those unaware, Big Tech is five major American technology companies : Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet's Google. The term was originally FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google). The second 'A' in FAANG for Apple was added in 2017.Jordan said that EU rules appear to be targeting American companies. The request came two days after the US President Donald Trump signed a memorandum to defend American companies and technology from what he termed as ""overseas extortion"". His warning specifically targeted EU tech regulations like the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA) with threats of tariff retaliation.""We write to express our concerns that the DMA may target American companies,"" Jordan reportedly wrote in a letter sent to Ribera and seen by news agency Reuters. It said that the rules subject American companies to burdensome regulations and give European companies an advantage.Scott Fitzgerald, chairman of the subcommittee on administrative state, regulatory reform and antitrust, was a co-signatory to the letter. The letter slammed fines up to 10% of global annual revenues for DMA violations. ""These severe fines appear to have two goals: to compel businesses to follow European standards worldwide, and as a European tax on American companies,"" Jordan and Fitzgerald said.Without directly naming China, the letter said that EU laws help rival nations. ""These, along with other provisions of the DMA, stifle innovation, disincentivize research and development, and hand vast amounts of highly valuable proprietary data to companies and adversarial nations,"" the letter said.""The Administration will review whether any act, policy, or practice in the European Union or United Kingdom incentivizes U.S. companies to develop or use products and technology in ways that undermine free speech or foster censorship,"" said the directive. It specifically mentioned Europe's DMA and DSA. ""Regulations that dictate how American companies interact with consumers in the European Union, like the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act, will face scrutiny from the Administration,"" said the directive.It blamed EU laws for unnecessarily taxing American companies: ""Rather than position their own companies and workers for success, foreign governments have been taxing the success of America’s companies and workers.""","US House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan has reportedly asked EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera to make it clear how she enforces the European Union's rules reining in Big Tech.

Analyst note claims Microsoft has cancelled leases for AI data centres and what makes it important,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/analyst-note-claims-microsoft-has-cancelled-leases-for-ai-data-centres-and-what-makes-it-important/articleshow/118531574.cms,"“Our channel checks indicate that Microsoft is also re-allocating a considerable portion of their projected international spend to the US, which suggests to us a material slowdown in international leasing,”

What makes this Microsoft move important



“While we have yet to get the level of colour via our channel checks that we would like into why this is occurring, our initial reaction is that this is tied to Microsoft potentially being in an oversupply position,”

Microsoft has reportedly canceled multiple leases for data centres in the US. This move is said to stem from the tech giant’s concerns about making more investment in AI infrastructure than it may need in the long term.A report published by the US-based brokerage firm TD Cowen’s analysts (seen by Bloomberg) cited its channel checks and inquiries with supply chain providers to claim that Microsoft, which also backs OpenAI, has voided leases totalling “a couple of hundred megawatts” of capacity.According to the report, Microsoft is even using a tactic that was deployed by Facebook-parent Meta to reduce its capital spending — stopping the conversion of “statement of qualifications” — agreements that usually lead to formal leases.The analysts added that their channel checks revealed several signs of Microsoft's gradual withdrawal from data centre construction and acquisition.They claimed to have found that Microsoft allowed agreements for larger sites—totalling more than a gigawatt—to expire and walked away from “multiple” deals, each involving about 100 megawatts (a data centre’s capacity is often stated in terms of the power it needs to stay up and running).the analysts noted.Despite major investments by tech giants in AI data centres, some analysts claim that there are few practical applications for the technology, the report added. Wall Street also raised concerns after DeepSeek, a Chinese startup, introduced an open-source AI model that promises similar capabilities at a much lower cost.Just like other tech companies, Microsoft may also be reassessing its AI spending following the popularity of DeepSeek.TD Cowen analysts Michael Elias, Cooper Belanger and Gregory claimedHowever, earlier Microsoft said that it expects to spend $80 billion on AI data centres this fiscal year. During an earnings call in January, CEO Satya Nadella stated that the company must continue spending to meet “exponentially more demand.”“While we may strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions. Our plans to spend over $80B on infrastructure this FY remains on track as we continue to grow at a record pace to meet customer demand,” a company spokesperson also noted in a statement to Bloomberg.",Microsoft has reportedly canceled multiple leases for data centres in the US.

The call for greater accountability in government is gaining momentum as experts and industry leaders propose adopting corporate-style efficiency models for public offices. Advocates argue that public servants and government employees should be held to the same performance standards as those in the private sector. Gurmeet Chadha , Chief Investment Officer at Complete Circle, has sparked a debate by questioning why government employees should be exempt from rigorous performance reviews, a standard practice in corporate organizations.As this movement gains traction, parallels are being drawn between initiatives in India and the United States, where efforts to enhance government efficiency have led to significant policy changes. Proposals include appointing corporate leaders to oversee government operations and enforcing stringent performance evaluations, similar to those implemented in private enterprises.Chadha has suggested that accomplished business leaders such as NR Narayana Murthy, Aditya Puri, Nandan Nilekani, or Anand Mahindra could be instrumental in leading a proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in India. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), he emphasized the importance of performance reviews and digital transformation in public offices:This proposal aligns with the broader push for transparency, digitalization, and accountability in government operations, similar to the efficiency-driven corporate world. Narayana Murthy , the founder of Infosys, has previously made headlines for advocating a 70-hour workweek for young professionals, emphasizing the need for increased productivity to accelerate India’s economic growth. His stance on work ethics aligns with the proposed corporate-style restructuring of public offices, where performance and efficiency are prioritized.On social media, many users expressed support for the idea of corporate leaders spearheading government efficiency efforts. One user highlighted the unique contributions each leader could bring:However, others voiced concerns about bureaucratic resistance, pointing out that administrative inefficiencies and entrenched government systems could hinder such reforms.The demand for increased government accountability is not exclusive to India. In the United States, federal employees were recently mandated to submit weekly performance summaries or risk being considered as resigned. This directive, supported by Elon Musk and the Trump administration, has generated significant debate about its implications for the workforce.Over the weekend, federal employees received an email titled “What did you do last week?”, instructing them to submit five bullet points summarizing their work by midnight on Monday. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) later confirmed that this directive was part of a broader initiative to enhance efficiency and accountability across federal agencies.This restructuring initiative has led to dismissals in multiple agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Pentagon, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). While proponents argue that the initiative reduces waste and improves efficiency, labor unions have strongly opposed it.The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the largest union representing federal workers, has condemned the policy. AFGE President Everett Kelley criticized the initiative, stating:The union has vowed to challenge any unlawful terminations resulting from the new efficiency measures.Observers have drawn comparisons between the current government efficiency measures and Elon Musk’s management style at Twitter (now X). When Musk took over Twitter in 2022, he introduced a strict “hardcore” work culture, requiring employees to commit to long hours and high performance or resign. The recent federal workforce restructuring follows a similar approach, prioritizing efficiency and eliminating perceived bureaucratic inefficiencies.Former President Donald Trump has endorsed the initiative, stating at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC):","Narayana Murthy, Anand Mahindra, and other corporate leaders proposed to head government efficiency in India.

Google saw what Microsoft didn’t: Nadella

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has admitted that one of the company's biggest mistakes was failing to see how important search would become. While Google built a massive business around search, Microsoft initially believed the web would stay decentralized and did not recognize its potential. “We (Microsoft) missed what turned out to be the biggest business model on the web, because we all assumed the web is all about being distributed,"" Nadella admitted.Speaking with YouTuber Dwarkesh Patel , Nadella reflected on how Microsoft underestimated search, while Google saw its value and executed it perfectly.“Who would have thought that search would be the biggest winner in organising the web?” he said. He added that simply understanding technological changes is not enough—companies must also identify where new business opportunities will emerge.“We obviously didn’t see it, and Google saw it and executed it super well. Understanding a technological shift is not enough; companies also need to recognise where value creation will happen,"" he explained.Nadella pointed out that adapting to new business models can be even more difficult than keeping up with technological advancements.“These business model shifts are probably tougher than even the tech trend changes,"" he stated.Nadella recalled being part of several major technology shifts throughout his career. He witnessed the transition from mainframes to personal computers, the rise of client-server architecture, and the early days of the web. He also highlighted how Microsoft had to adapt when browsers like Mosaic and Netscape changed how applications were built.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has admitted that one of the company's biggest mistakes was failing to see how important search would become.

""Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump's instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,"" Musk posted, adding that ""Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.""Through his role at the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), Musk has implemented strategies similar to those he used at X (formerly Twitter), where he famously required employees to commit to an ""extremely hardcore"" work culture or leave. Earlier initiatives included mandatory return-to-office policies and buyout offers to federal agencies, similar to that of what he implemented at Twitter after its purchase.In the mass layoffs at multiple agencies, the administration reported that about 77,000 workers, roughly 3% of the civilian workforce, accepted buyout offers. The Musk-headed department has further terminated more than 1,000 federal contracts it deemed unnecessary or wasteful, spanning 39 federal departments and agencies. DOGE claims to have saved approximately $55 billion in federal spending thus far, though a review of itemized savings on its website only accounts for about $16 billion.","US President Donald Trump praised Elon Musk's efforts to reshape the federal workforce.

How OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took complete U-turn on 'ChatGPT decision' he called 'Best for the World' just weeks ago,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-openai-ceo-sam-altman-took-complete-u-turn-on-chatgpt-decision-he-called-best-for-the-world-just-weeks-ago/articleshow/124832616.cms,"How Sam Altman made a complete U-turn on 'Sexbots'

OpenAI faces accusations of ignoring child safety concerns





OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently announced that the company plans to ""safely relax the restrictions"" on erotic conversations within ChatGPT. The move is a significant policy shift, allowing adults to engage in ""hot and heavy"" chats, a departure from the AI giant's policy of restricting sexual content. The change comes, Altman said, after engineers built new safeguards around sensitive mental health content.""Now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases,"" Altman stated in a post on X (formerly Twitter).He framed the decision around a core company principle: ""As part of our ‘treat adult users like adults’ principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults."" The new policy is expected to roll out by December.The announcement follows a comment Sam Altman made just months prior, in an August 7 podcast interview with Cleo Abram, where he appeared to boast about not having created a ""sex bot."" When asked about a decision that was ""best for the world but not best for winning,"" Altman replied by emphasizing the ""very special relationship"" OpenAI has with its users, built on trying to ""help you accomplish whatever you ask.""He stated the company has refrained from actions that could ""grow [the company] faster"" or get users to ""spend more time in ChatGPT,"" citing the long-term incentive of staying aligned with users. When pressed for a specific example, Altman stated: ""Well, we haven’t put a sex bot avatar in ChatGPT yet.""The decision to open up to erotic content for adults comes amid mounting scrutiny over ChatGPT's impact on minors. OpenAI has been hit with multiple lawsuits from parents alleging the chatbot offered harmful or even suicidal guidance to teens. In one tragic case, a family is suing the company, claiming the AI encouraged their son to take his own life.The company has also faced accusations of allowing its systems to feed sexually explicit or dangerous advice to underage users, prompting federal and state regulators to open inquiries into AI companies' safeguards.In recent months, OpenAI has attempted to assuage the furor by introducing parental controls and a restricted teen version of the app. The new settings allow parents to link accounts, monitor usage, and block explicit or self-harm content.Despite these fixes, advocacy groups argue the measures don't go far enough, contending that AI chatbots remain too unpredictable and powerful to be safely used by children. The introduction of ""erotica for verified adults"" will now put the onus on OpenAI's engineers to ensure their new safeguards can effectively verify user age and wall off the mature content from its younger user base.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that the company plans to ""safely relax the restrictions"" on erotic conversations within ChatGPT.

India has emerged as the fourth-largest and one of the fastest-growing markets for Canva, the global graphic design platform, with ambitions to become its number one market in the coming years, according to Canva India head Chandrika Deb. The surge is fueled by robust adoption among creators, students, and increasing use of AI tools, as India solidifies its position as a hub for global tech and AI innovation. ""Canva is the world's largest design platform today, and India is actually one of our top markets that is driving growth for Canva,"" Deb told PTI in an interview.She revealed that Indian users have created over 2.8 billion designs on the platform, generating approximately 2.5 million new designs daily. India’s thriving digital ecosystem, backed by a young, digital-first population and rapidly expanding internet infrastructure, is propelling this growth. A Nasscom-BCG report projects India’s AI market to reach USD 17 billion by 2027, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25-35 percent.""We're the fourth largest market for Canva (in user base). We've also been consistently one of the fastest-growing markets, with strong double-digit growth over the last 2-3 years,"" Deb noted.She emphasized India’s potential, stating, ""We have one of the world's largest student communities, we have one of the world's largest creator communities as well. So we definitely see India rising in the ranks. There's no reason why India shouldn't be the number one market for Canva, and that is the ambition we're all aiming for.""Canva’s AI-driven features, such as Canva AI, Magic Write, Translate, and Magic Design, are seeing strong adoption in India across segments like creators, educators, small businesses, and knowledge workers. ""People are really engaging in using Canva in their everyday lives, whether it's for work or personal use,"" Deb said.Recognizing India’s mobile-first ecosystem, Canva has tailored its offerings with hyper-local content for weddings, festivals, and other culturally relevant use cases. The platform has also introduced flexible plans like one-day and one-week subscriptions to cater to Indian users. Strategic partnerships, including a recent collaboration with NCERT for a teacher certification program to integrate design thinking in classrooms, and collaborations with over 500 Indian creators to develop localized content, are further strengthening Canva’s foothold.""Our mission is to reach every user in India, empower them to design, and educate them about the various features that we have,"" Deb said.

Quotng sources the report says that the Elon Musk-owned company is readying infrastructure ahead of the commercial launch of its satellite communication services in the country.An official, who did not want to be quoted, said that the company has applied for 600 gigabit per second capacity over India through its Gen 1 constellation. The spectrum has reportedly been assigned on a provisional basis for demonstrating security related compliances.Starlink must abide by rules and provide information sought by security agenciesThe Telecom Department has reportedly permitted Starlink to import 100 terminals for testing fixed satellite services, with strict conditions to prevent misuse due to the critical nature of satcom, which could be exploited by anti-national forces. Although Starlink is said to be keen on bringing foreign technical experts to work at the gateway stations, the company has been specifically told that only Indian nationals should operate the stations till Union home affairs ministry gives security clearances to all foreign nationals who will be working at these gateway stations.Security concerns were raised earlier this year when Starlink devices were reportedly misused in border areas, leading to a Home Affairs Ministry investigation request in March. In December 2024, security agencies seized Starlink devices alongside weapons in Manipur and recovered an illegal device in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.Despite Starlink’s initial dismissal of these concerns, it must now comply with security requirements and provide information to agencies. Spectrum assignment will follow prevailing policies, including pricing and authorization frameworks, after the security compliance period.Other rules require that Starlink must store all data generated during trial period in India, ensure equipment remains secure, and share terminal details. These include: Names, addresses, and geo-coordinates -- with the DoT and security agencies every two weeks. Law enforcement can inspect and access data from Satcom terminals. License holders are also required to monitor traffic, establish satellite earth station gateways and a control center in India, and ensure all traffic to or from India passes through Indian gateways.","Elon Musk's Starlink reportedly plans to set up gateway earth stations across India.

What Microsoft said about the new Gaming Copilot feature



“When you're actively using Gaming Copilot in Game Bar, it can use screenshots of your gameplay to get a better understanding of what's happening in your game and provide you with more helpful responses.”

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode

What was the controversy surrounding the Gaming Copilot feature



“This installed automatically on my PC, and watching the network traffic, I realised (sic) it was automatically sending everything I was doing to Microsoft (including an NDA'd game I'm playing. I checked the settings, and by default, it's set to train on text seen on the screen — it screenshots everything, and OCRs text from in-game and sends it to MS. MS then uses what you're doing to train their AI models.”

“begin rolling out to players aged 18 and older on PC Game Bar.”





Microsoft has issued an official statement clarifying that its Gaming Copilot feature only accesses gameplay screenshots when users are actively engaged with the AI tool. The tech giant has also emphasised that these screenshots are not used to train AI models. The clarification came after a user on the ResetEra forums raised privacy concerns, claiming their system's network traffic showed the AI feature sending information about their actions, including private on-screen details, to Microsoft's servers. This came after the company recently launched the Gaming Copilot feature as a public beta on Windows 11 through the operating system's built-in Xbox Game Bar.In a statement to Tom's Hardware, a Microsoft representative explained:The company stressed that Gaming Copilot is optional and only accesses gameplay during active use. Microsoft separately noted that text or voice conversations with Gaming Copilot may be used to train and improve AI systems. Users can modify the feature's privacy settings through the Game Bar's Settings menu under “Privacy Settings.”The controversy began with a forum post where a user named RedbullCola wrote:Currently, it's unclear whether Gaming Copilot sends screenshot data to an external server or processes it locally using the system's built-in NPU.We've sent follow-up questions to Microsoft.Xbox Support does not list the required specifications to run the feature, but the company says it willThe feature works on devices that aren't Copilot+ certified (i.e., those without built-in NPUs). The report notes that when tested on a gaming PC with a non-AI processor (also enrolled in the Xbox Insider Program), the Gaming Copilot feature was accessible.The 'Model training on text' toggle also does not provide detailed information about the type of text it captures, the report added.It's important to note that users don’t need to turn on Gaming Copilot if they prefer not to use it. The company says it only takes screenshots when users are actively engaging with the feature, and that the AI training feature can be disabled in settings.However, if users want to remove it entirely, there's no straightforward uninstallation method as it's built into the Game Bar.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees.

The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently shared a post on X, formerly Twitter, announcing a new breakthrough in quantum algorithms. “Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage,” Pichai wrote in the post, adding it is “13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers”. Pichai’s post caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk . The tech billionaire replied to Pichai’s post saying “Congrats. Looks like quantum computing is becoming relevant.”Announcing the major breakthrough, Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote:The achievement marks a historic breakthrough in quantum computing. For the first time ever, a quantum computer has performed a complex, verifiable calculation faster than any supercomputer could — about 13,000 times faster. This moment is being called a “verifiable quantum advantage.""Using Google’s Willow quantum chip, researchers ran an advanced algorithm called Quantum Echoes (or OTOC — out-of-order time correlator).This algorithm helps scientists study how information spreads in quantum systems — things like molecules, magnets, or even black holes.The key part: the result was verifiable and repeatable, meaning other quantum computers could confirm it independently.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently shared a post on X, formerly Twitter, announcing a new breakthrough in quantum algorithms.

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You’ll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles – they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me – we’re going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next.

GM's restructuring aims to strengthen core design capabilities

Layoffs follow automaker’s strong earnings performance









General Motors has laid off more than 200 salaried employees, primarily Computer-Aided Design (CAD) engineers, as part of its ongoing restructuring efforts to boost profitability. The cuts, which took place Friday at the company's global tech campus in Warren, Michigan, come just days after the Detroit automaker raised its 2025 financial guidance following strong third-quarter earnings.The affected employees were notified via Microsoft Teams calls Friday morning that their positions were being eliminated due to ""business conditions"" rather than performance issues, according to company sources. GM confirmed the layoffs were part of a broader reorganisation of its design engineering division.""We're restructuring our design engineering team to strengthen our core architectural design engineering capabilities,"" GM stated. ""As a result, a number of CAD execution roles have been eliminated. We recognize the efforts and accomplishments of the impacted team members, and we thank them for their contributions.""Bloomberg first reported the layoffs, which represent a continuation of GM's white-collar workforce reductions. The automaker's US salaried headcount has decreased from 53,000 in 2023 to 50,000 by the end of last year as the company regularly reviews its operations to eliminate positions deemed unnecessary for future operations.The timing of the cuts is notable, occurring just three days after GM posted robust third-quarter results that sent its stock surging 15%—the company's second-best single-day performance since emerging from bankruptcy in 2009. GM shares have climbed more than 29% this year, hitting new 52-week highs.The automaker also raised its profit outlook, citing reduced tariff pressure and diminished electric vehicle losses. However, GM has faced significant challenges, including $1.1 billion in tariff-related profit cuts and $1.6 billion in charges from scaling back its EV plans.GM isn't alone in downsizing. Electric vehicle maker Rivian announced Thursday it would cut roughly 600 jobs—4.5% of its workforce—as the automotive industry grapples with policy changes and slower-than-expected EV demand following the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit.","General Motors has laid off more than 200 salaried employees, primarily Computer-Aided Design (CAD) engineers.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned against “some really bad stuff” happening because of artificial intelligence (AI). Speaking on the a16z podcast from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Altman specifically highlighted the potential for “really strange or scary moments. ”“I expect some really bad stuff to happen because of the technology,” the tech CEO said as OpenAI ’s new video application, Sora 2 gains popularity. The app was announced last month. Shortly after the release, instances of its use to create deepfake videos of renowned people appeared on social media. So much so that the company had to issue an apology, addressing concerns over how Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s likeness is represented in Sora generations.Sora’s launch demonstrated the speed at which such technology can penetrate mainstream.""Very soon the world is going to have to contend with incredible video models that can deepfake anyone or kind of show anything you want,"" Altman said. He argued that society and AI must ""co-evolve"" and that ""you can't just drop the thing at the end.”During the podcast, Altman cautioned against a future where most people will let computers program and make choices on their behalf.“I do still think there are going to be some really strange or scary moments,” he said, adding that the absence of a catastrophic AI-related event to date “doesn’t mean it never will.”He further described a scenario where “billions of people talking to the same brain”. This, he warned, could result in unexpected and rapid chain reactions, leading to “weird, societal-scale things.”Despite the warnings, Sam Altman dismissed government regulation of the technology. He said “Most regulation probably has a lot of downside”. He favours a “very careful safety testing” for what he termed “extremely superhuman” AI models. Altman concluded with a belief in a societal adaptation process, saying, “I think we’ll develop some guardrails around it as a society.”","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned against “some really bad stuff” happening because of artificial intelligence (AI) Speaking on the a16z podcast from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Altman specifically highlighted the potential for “really strange or scary moments. ”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124823645,imgsize-30536,width-400,resizemode-4/openai-ceo-sam-altmans-stark-warning-ai-could-bring-really-bad-stuff.jpg"

H-1B Visa Changes Explained: Indian Talent Could Gain Or Lose Depending On Policy

Indian professionals dominate American tech through visa system quirks, not conspiracy

Rising talent migration signals transformation, not decline, Vembu argues





Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has urged Indian professionals abroad to consider returning home, declaring that ""Bharat Mata wants you, needs you and welcomes you"" as he responded to new research showing Indian immigrants contribute the most fiscally to their host nations among major immigrant groups.Vembu's comments came after Manhattan Institute research found that the average Indian immigrant and their descendants save the U.S. federal government $1.7 million over 30 years—the highest among all major countries of origin. The study also found H-1B visa holders reduce debt by $2.3 million while expanding GDP by $500,000 over three decades.In a social media post on X, Vembu explained that Indian professionals' dominance in American technology leadership resulted from unintended consequences of U.S. immigration policy rather than deliberate strategy. ""American companies solved the need for long term committed people with the H1-B visa and the extremely long green card process, both of which made it painful or risky to switch jobs,"" he wrote.This system created conditions fostering long-term commitment among Indian workers, who advanced into senior positions at companies like Microsoft and Google . ""There was no conspiracy to promote Indians, it was one consequence of the visa/green card system,"" Vembu emphasized.Despite concerns about brain drain, Vembu maintains an optimistic outlook, arguing that peak talent migration typically coincides with periods of rapid national development. He cited historical patterns from Korea, Taiwan, and China, where emigration peaked during transformative growth periods.""Our aspirations necessarily race ahead of reality, and it is precisely during the period of rapid growth that we have the most restless people,"" Vembu explained. He predicted Indians might continue underestimating their nation's progress even as late as 2035, when per capita GDP could exceed $10,000.The Zoho founder has consistently advocated for building India's technological capabilities domestically, recently stepping down as CEO to become Chief Scientist focused on research and development amid rapid AI advancement.","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has urged Indian professionals abroad to consider returning home.

Rare Video Of Louvre Heist: Watch Thieves Flee Calmly After Robbing France's €88 Mn Royal Treasure





Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has offered to buy the jewels stolen from the Louvre Museum last week. In a post on microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Durov said that he is “happy to buy the stolen jewelry and donate it back to the Louvre”, but not the Louvre Museum in Paris but Louvre Museum Abu Dhabi. Last week, four thieves stole jewels from the Louvre Museum in Paris in broad daylight.According to reports, the gang reportedly arrived at 09:30 local time, shortly after the museum opened to visitors. Four of them arrived with a vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine, while the other two got inside by cutting through the window.The gang then threatened the guards, evacuated the premises, and cut through the glass of two display cases containing jewels.Commenting on the heist, Pavel Durov then said that he is “not at all surprised”. In a post on X, he wrote:“Not at all surprised by the Louvre heist. It’s another sad sign of the decline of a once great country — where the government has perfected the art of distracting people with phantom threats instead of confronting the real ones”.Durov further added: “Happy to buy the stolen jewelry and donate it back to the Louvre. I mean Louvre Abu Dhabi, of course; no one steals from Louvre Abu Dhabi.”Durov’s comments come amidst the backdrop of his arrest at Le Bourget Airport near Paris upon his arrival from Azerbaijan in August 2024. French authorities then detained him based on an arrest warrant related to a preliminary investigation into alleged criminal activities facilitated through the Telegram platform. The charges included complicity in child sexual exploitation, drug trafficking, money laundering, and other offenses.","Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has offered to buy the jewels stolen from the Louvre Museum last week.

Despite GitHub Copilot remaining the top AI coding assistant in recent surveys, Business Insider reported that the tool has lost market share to Cursor in a key developer segment, according to Barclays data.An engineer at the meeting specifically asked how Microsoft planned to counter ""Cursor or Claude Code, which are moving quickly and capturing a lot of mindshare."" Jay Parikh, who leads Microsoft's CoreAI unit overseeing GitHub, acknowledged the challenge: ""GitHub is just not the place anymore where developers are storing code.""Microsoft's solution involves making GitHub's AI capabilities accessible across all platforms—command line interfaces, web browsers, various coding applications like VS Code, and other Microsoft products.

White House alleges Biden's “War on Cryptocurrency”





Binance founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao has expressed his gratitude towards President Donald Trump who pardoned him, essentially erasing the criminal conviction of the cryptocurrency billionaire who served four months in prison for violating US banking laws. Zhao pleaded guilty in November 2023 to violating the Bank Secrecy Act—essentially admitting that Binance failed to implement proper safeguards against money laundering. As part of his plea deal, he agreed to step down as CEO of the exchange he'd founded and led since 2017, pay a $50 million fine, and serve a prison sentence.“Deeply grateful for today’s pardon and to President Trump for upholding America’s commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice,” Zhao said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).“Will do everything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto and advance web3 worldwide. (Still in flight, more posts to come.) Onwards,” he addedBinance itself also pleaded guilty to charges and paid a record-breaking $4.3 billion in settlements to the US Department of Justice, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and Treasury Department. The exchange also agreed to court-appointed monitoring to ensure compliance with US laws going forward.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt framed the pardon as correcting overreach by the previous administration.“[Zhao] had been prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency,” Leavitt said in a statement.“In their desire to punish the cryptocurrency industry, the Biden Administration pursued Mr. Zhao despite no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims,” she continued, adding, “The Biden Administration sought to imprison Mr. Zhao for three years, a sentence so outside Sentencing Guidelines that even the Judge said he had never heard of this in his 30-year career.”""These actions by the Biden Administration severely damaged the United States' reputation as a global leader in technology and innovation. The Biden Administration's war on crypto is over,” Leavitt concluded.Meanwhile, during a press conference, Trump was asked why he pardoned Zhao. His response suggested he acted on the recommendations of supporters.“I don't know, he was recommended by a lot of people. A lot of people said that he wasn't guilty of anything, he served four months in jail and they say that he was not guilty of anything,"" Trump said.“He was somebody that as I was told—I don't know, I don't believe I've ever met him—but I've been told ... he had a lot of support.

Sacks' accusations: ‘Regulatory Capture’





Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has defended his artificial intelligence (AI) company against accusations that it’s too “woke” and using fear tactics to shape regulation, firing back at criticism from White House AI czar David Sacks and other Trump administration allies. Amodei insisted that Anthropic shares common ground with the Trump administration on “key areas of AI policy” and pushed back against what he called “a recent uptick in inaccurate claims” about the company's positions.“Despite our track record of communicating frequently and transparently about our positions, there has been a recent uptick in inaccurate claims about Anthropic's policy stances. Some are significant enough that they warrant setting the record straight,” Amodei said in a blog last week.Amodei attempted to bridge the political divide, arguing that Anthropic and the administration ultimately want the same outcomes.“I fully believe that Anthropic, the administration, and leaders across the political spectrum want the same thing: to ensure that powerful AI technology benefits the American people and that America advances and secures its lead in AI development,” he stated.Anthropic – known for its Claude chatbot – has faced criticism in recent weeks over concerns the company has a liberal bias.Anthropic has also reportedly frustrated the Trump administration by barring federal contractors from using its AI tools for certain law enforcement purposes—a policy that conflicts with the administration's law-and-order priorities.White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks has emerged as one of Anthropic's most vocal critics, alleging the company is using fear tactics to manipulate regulation for competitive advantage.“Anthropic is running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering. It is principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem,” Sacks wrote on X on October 14.In a post, Sacks alleged that Anthropic wanted to “backdoor Woke AI and other AI regulations through Blue states like California,” suggesting the company is pursuing a state-by-state strategy to impose progressive values on AI development.",Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has defended his artificial intelligence (AI) company against accusations that it’s too “woke” and using fear tactics to shape regulation.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has highlighted three new features within the company’s Copilot AI assistant that he claims have become indispensable to his daily work and personal life. Nadella touted the features as major advances in how humans interact with technology, comparing one innovation to the introduction of touchscreens.Nadella shared his top three “daily habits” in a short video clip posted on X (formerly Twitter), emphasising the rapid pace of development within Microsoft's AI initiatives.Nadella called the voice-activated Copilot on his Windows laptop the most exciting new way to interact with a computer since touch technology was introduced. The CEO described the feature as essentially giving him “a new mouse, and it just happens to be voice.” This allows him to instantly invoke Copilot while working on emails or documents and ask it questions.“I can just invoke Copilot and ask it questions. It retrieves information, and it's just fantastic to have,” Nadella said, praising it as the most exciting ""new modality"" to emerge since touch.The second feature the CEO highlighted is Mico, a new character interface for Copilot.Nadella praised Mico for transforming the AI interaction by giving it ""a face to talk to.""He described Miko as a Socratic tutor, capable of not just providing information but truly teaching the user. Nadella shared a personal example, noting how he and his daughter used Miko to explore Egyptian mythology.“The cool thing about it is it taught us both what we wanted, you know, not just give us information and it's just wonderful,” he stated.The third feature Nadella mentioned, though less specific, focuses on Copilot's utility in managing complex life and work demands. He lauded its capabilities in “planning, learning, coordinating,” and helping him “stay sane.”“So I think these three things are definitely becoming my go-to features on a daily basis,” he said.Nadella concluded his endorsement by encouraging users to try out the new functionalities, stating: ""We are building fast. Try these features out. Tell us what you think.""","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has highlighted three new features within the company’s Copilot AI assistant. He claims the features have become indispensable to his daily work and personal life. The CEO touted the features as major advances in how humans interact with technology, comparing one innovation to the introduction of touchscreens.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124821558,imgsize-32734,width-400,resizemode-4/satya-nadella.jpg"

US Chaos: Leavitt’s Shutdown Warning Comes True; Tech Meltdown Grounds Alaska Airlines Flights

What's behind SELL rating on Nvidia









Nvidia is the world's most valuable company with a market cap nearing $4 trillion. Little doubt that it is investors darling on Wall Street. There are as many as 80 analysts who cover Nvidia, 73 of whom reportedly have the equivalent of a buy rating on the Nvidia stock, six rate it a hold. But there's one Jay Goldberg, who as Bloomberg says is the lone bear on high-flying Nvidia Corp. 54-year-old Jay Goldberg, a senior analyst at Seaport Global Securities, has sell rating on Nvidia stock.According to Bloomberg report, Gildberg said, “There’s a lot more that can go wrong with Nvidia than can go right.” With the AI boom driving the US economy and propelling the stock market to record after record, few people are eager to bet against the key company behind the rally.Goldberg, however, has no qualms about going against the grain.“I’m probably a little cantankerous by nature, so I’m skeptical of all of the hype around AI right now,” he said. “This is not my first bubble.” Quoting Bloomberg, analyst Goldberg, who covers 12 companies, has a sell rating solely on Nvidia, while maintaining buy ratings on Apple, Netgear, and AI-exposed chipmakers Broadcom and Arm Holdings. He argues the AI investment thesis hinges on six key players -- Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Oracle, and OpenAI -- driving demand for Nvidia chips, propelling Nvidia to a $4.5 trillion valuation.These five public companies are projected to spend nearly $400 billion on capital expenditures this year, a 67% increase from last year, while OpenAI has pledged over $1 trillion. However, with four of these companies reporting earnings next week, investors are growing skeptical about the lack of tangible returns on this massive spending.Goldberg compares this to the dot-com bubble’s telecommunications infrastructure boom, when he was earning his MBA at the University of Chicago before working at Lazard, Deutsche Bank, Peregrine Semiconductor, Qualcomm Inc., a software startup, and a venture capital firm. He notes that when expected internet traffic failed to materialize, stocks like Cisco Systems crashed and have yet to recover their 2000 peak.“That feels very strongly like the pattern we’re seeing now,” Goldberg told Bloomberg. “We’re going to build up all this AI stuff for what are largely psychological reasons. At some point the spending will stop, and the whole thing will tumble down and we’ll reset.”","Jay Goldberg, a senior analyst at Seaport Global Securities, has sell rating on Nvidia stock.

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

Other new features coming to Microsoft Teams







Microsoft Teams is reportedly adding a new feature that will automatically set a user's work location when they connect to an office Wi-Fi network. The update is said to be designed to reduce confusion about where employees are physically situated. According to a Microsoft 365 roadmap seen by TechRadar, “when users connect to their organisation's Wi-Fi, Teams will automatically set their work location to reflect the building they are working in.” However, this change could eliminate employees' ability to find a quiet, untracked space in the office premises. The new tool is currently in development and is expected to be released in December 2025, the report added. When released, the feature will be available to Teams users on both Windows and Mac globally, the report noted.Apart from this feature, Microsoft has rolled out a series of recent updates which are designed to improve efficiency for Microsoft Teams users. These updates include a new option that will allow users save messages in their chats and conversations, making it easier to find important messages without scrolling through long threads.The company also announced that configurable keyboard shortcuts will be introduced to Microsoft Teams soon, enabling users to access frequently used symbols, icons, and other elements more conveniently while working.The company has also confirmed that Copilot in Microsoft Teams will be able to review what’s shown on the screen during a meeting if recording is turned on. It uses this along with the meeting transcript and chat to help users get quick answers or summaries.For example, users can ask Copilot things like “Which products had the highest sales?” or “What feedback was given on each slide?” It can also create new content based on the meeting, such as rewriting a paragraph shown on-screen using feedback from the chat.This feature works with anything shared from a user’s desktop, including documents, slides, spreadsheets, or websites, no matter which app or platform they come from. The rollout for this feature is scheduled for August 2026, and the feature will be available across Android, Desktop, iOS, Mac, and Web platforms.","Microsoft Teams is reportedly adding a new feature that will automatically set a user's work location when they connect to an office Wi-Fi network.

How OnlyFans achieved this feat







OnlyFans has surpassed major technology companies, including Apple , Nvidia, Google , Meta and Microsoft, to achieve the highest revenue per employee globally. According to an analysis by the financial and marketing firm Barchart, the platform generates $37.6 million in revenue per employee. This figure is notably higher than that of large tech firms. For comparison, Nvidia generated $3.6 million per employee, Apple $2.4 million, Meta $2.2 million, Google $1.9 million, and both OpenAI and Microsoft $1.1 million per employee. The revenue per employee metric primarily reflects a company's operational efficiency rather than its overall size or market value. Despite its lead in this metric, OnlyFans' total revenue for the 2023 financial year was $1.3 billion, which is substantially lower than that of the tech giants.OnlyFans operates with nearly 42 employees while generating $1.3 billion in annual revenue. The platform hosts 2.1 million independent content creators who monetise their audiences directly through subscriptions and tips. The company takes a 20% commission on all transactions processed through the platform. Content creators retain 80% of revenue generated from their subscribers.The OnlyFans revenue performance demonstrates the profitability of platform-based business models that facilitate direct creator-to-consumer transactions.The company provides infrastructure and payment processing while independent creators produce content and build audiences.This approach requires fewer staff compared to traditional technology companies that develop products, manufacture hardware, or maintain extensive research and development operations. Platform models leverage user-generated content and network effects to achieve high revenue efficiency.The platform's business performance is closely linked to its adult content market, which critics claim accounts for a large share of its traffic and revenue. This connection has fueled ongoing discussion concerning content moderation, the potential for exploitation, and regulatory scrutiny.While the company promotes itself as a general hub for all types of creators, its reputation as an adult content platform has made it difficult to attract mainstream advertisers and expand beyond that niche.Additionally, some analysts note that the company's reliance on independent creators makes it sensitive to shifts in user behaviour, changes in government regulations, or restrictions imposed by payment processors.","OnlyFans generates $37.6 million in revenue per employee.

Nexperia’s Chinese parent company, Wingtech Technology, has issued a formal warning to the Dutch government, stating that its financial performance may take a major hit if it fails to regain control of its seized chipmaking unit, Nexperia, by the end of 2025. In its latest quarterly earnings report filed on Friday (October 24), the Shanghai-listed electronics firm warned of significant financial strain.“If control of Nexperia cannot be restored before the end of 2025, the company may face temporary downward pressure on revenue, profit and cash flow,” Bloomberg stated Wingtech as saying.The warning underscores the escalating international conflict centred on the critical semiconductor supplier. While Wingtech reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, with semiconductor revenue rising 12.2% year-on-year, the company noted that the long-term ability of its chipmaking segment to sustain growth is now in doubt due to the ongoing dispute.The clash began last month when the Dutch government took the step of seizing control of Nexperia, a key manufacturer of basic chips used widely in the automotive industry by companies like Volkswagen AG.Reports suggested that the seizure followed mounting US pressure after Wingtech was placed on the US Entity List in 2024. The Dutch government cited concerns that Nexperia will not operate independently of its Chinese parent, resulting in the removal of Nexperia's Chinese CEO.According to the report, the dispute is fueling concerns over global supply chain stability ahead of US-China trade talks. Earlier this week, China's commerce minister warned that the Dutch action has “seriously affected” the stability of the global supply chain. The Dutch government, in its replay, has stated it remains in contact with Chinese authorities, aiming to work “toward a constructive solution.”",Dutch government seized control of Nexperia's Chinese unit last month.

Meta's Llama models to power enterprise AI solutions

Building on five-year partnership between the two giants





Meta Platforms' Facebook Overseas has acquired a 30% stake in Reliance Enterprise Intelligence Limited (REIL), a new AI venture launched by Mukesh Ambani 's Reliance Industries, according to a regulatory filing. Reliance Intelligence Limited, RIL 's wholly owned AI subsidiary, will hold the remaining 70% stake in the joint venture, which was formally incorporated on October 24, 2025.The two companies have committed an initial combined investment of Rs 855 crore in REIL, which will focus on developing, marketing, and distributing enterprise AI services across India, PTI reported. Reliance Intelligence will invest Rs 2 crore towards the initial subscription of 20 million equity shares valued at Rs 10 each.The joint venture, first announced at RIL's Annual General Meeting in August 2025, will leverage Meta's open-source Llama AI models combined with Reliance's extensive enterprise reach. The partnership aims to offer two main products: an enterprise AI platform-as-a-service that enables organisations to customise and deploy generative AI models, and pre-configured AI solutions for industries including sales, marketing, IT operations, customer service, and finance.Meta will provide technical expertise in building Llama-based models, while Reliance will contribute its digital infrastructure and access to thousands of Indian enterprises and small businesses.The solutions will be deployable across cloud, on-premises, and hybrid environments, with emphasis on lowering total cost of ownership.This AI collaboration extends the strategic relationship between Meta and Reliance that began in April 2020, when Facebook invested $5.7 billion (Rs 43,574 crore) in Jio Platforms, making it the largest minority shareholder. That investment, approved by the Competition Commission of India in June 2020, gave Facebook a 9.99% stake in Jio Platforms, which houses RIL's telecom business with nearly 500 million subscribers.The regulatory filing noted that REIL's incorporation does not fall under related party transactions, and none of Reliance Industries' promoters, promoter group, or group companies have any interest in the transaction. No governmental or regulatory approvals were required for establishing REIL.","Meta Platforms' Facebook Overseas has acquired a 30% stake in Reliance Enterprise Intelligence Limited (REIL), a new AI venture launched by Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries.

What all information China is asking in the questionnaire

How US and China are piling up trouble for companies





There seems no letting down in US-China trade war, at least for now. According to a report in Bloomberg, China has asked some US semiconductor companies to submit what is being termed as 'sensitive information'. The request comes from China’s Trade Remedy and Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of Commerce. The questionnaire seeks details from US Chip companies their sales in the world’s largest chips market, China. The activity is said to be part of China's probe of American suppliers.The probe is reportedly designed to gather intelligence for an anti-dumping investigation on certain American-made analog IC chips. The Bloomberg report says, it is of the sort of products sold by Texas Instruments and Analog Devices.The analog chips that Beijing is now looking into are used to help digital systems interface with the real world, handling tasks like wireless signal amplification and power and voltage regulation. They don’t require cutting-edge chipmaking, but are essential in everything from smartphones and electric vehicles to medical imaging.The China’s Trade Remedy and Investigation Bureau seeks data on sales activities of these companies in China, including a comparison of the costs and profits for the investigated chips in their home country.Among other requests, the China's fair-trade bureau asks for the names of Chinese customers and transaction details, including sales volumes and various costs from logistics to warehousing. The questionnaires ask for information on raw material suppliers working with these US chip companies. As per the report American companies will be given 37 days to provide their answers.So far, it remains unclear which all companies will be expected to fill out the questionnaires.China also recently added companies to its version of the US' entity list, which restricts transactions between Chinese companies and those that are targeted. It has launched antitrust probes into Qualcomm and Nvidia.Companies in both the countries face increasing pressure from their governments. The US is speculated to expand its entity list to over 10,000 Chinese companies and is considering broader export restrictions. China is implementing its own export controls on critical minerals, extending restrictions to foreign products using Chinese rare earths, and launching antitrust probes into U.S. companies.",China has asked some US semiconductor companies to submit what is being termed as'sensitive information' The request comes from China’s Trade Remedy and Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of Commerce.

And then we're going to just put you up for sale to the highest bidder, and there's not an effing thing you can do about it. And then they walked out of the room.

“Amazon was the best solution to a problem we had. We didn't want to sell to Amazon. It's just that Amazon was the best solution to a problem we had. And that problem was we had shareholder activists take a large stake in the company,”

How Whole Foods was acquired by Amazon



“We needed to lower our prices, but we needed time to do that. We weren't going to have time with Jana as investors,”





Whole Foods cofounder and former CEO John Mackey has revealed that he sold the grocery chain to online retail giant Amazon in 2017 only because he was forced. He said that activist hedge fund Jana Partners threatened to seize control of the board, fire him and his executive team, and sell the company anyway. In 2017, Jana Partners acquired an 8.8% stake, becoming Whole Foods' second-largest shareholder, and immediately called for a sale. In a recent episode of the Habits & Hustle podcast, Mackey explained the situation, saying:Mackey added.Amazon and Whole Foods announced the $13.7 billion acquisition just six weeks after their first meeting about a deal.Mackey described the Amazon deal as asaying it benefited customers through four price cuts, raised employee wages to a $15 minimum, helped suppliers access Amazon’s platform while keeping partnerships, and gave shareholders nearly 40% higher returns than before the deal.Before selling to Amazon, the grocery chain had reported declining same-store sales for six consecutive quarters and faced competition from conventional grocers selling organic products.The company struggled with its reputation for high prices and operational challenges that had pushed its stock price down before Jana's involvement. Mackey said the company needed time to lower prices and improve operations, but Jana's demands for immediate returns wouldn't allow it.Mackey explained.Mackey explored alternatives, including reaching out to Warren Buffett, who declined. Albertsons expressed interest, but Mackey considered it a poor cultural match. He then approached Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , whom he had met the previous year at a conference.","Whole Foods cofounder and former CEO John Mackey has revealed that he sold the grocery chain to online retail giant Amazon in 2017 only because he was forced.

Benioff says AI augments sales capacity, doesn't replace sellers

Salesforce's decision tells a different story





Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff insists artificial intelligence won't eliminate sales positions, announcing plans to hire between 3,000 and 5,000 new salespeople as the company pushes toward 20,000 account executives by year's end. Speaking in October 2025, Benioff emphasised that ""face-to-face communication"" remains essential in sales, stating that AI ""doesn't have a soul"" and lacks authentic human connectivity. The billionaire tech executive's stance comes despite Salesforce's aggressive AI adoption across other departments, including customer service where the company cut 4,000 roles earlier this year.""We love AI, OK? But AI — it's not the same,"" Benioff told TBPN. ""It's not that human connectivity.""Benioff argues AI enhances rather than replaces human salespeople, addressing a problem Salesforce has faced for 26 years: unanswered leads. The CEO revealed that AI agents recently contacted 4,000 potential customers in one week—follow-ups previously impossible with human-only teams.The combination of expanded human sales staff and AI assistance will increase Salesforce's overall sales capacity by 19%, Benioff projects.Among the company's 80,000 employees, roughly 25% are trained to help customers use Salesforce's sales products.While championing sales hiring, Benioff confirmed in September that Salesforce reduced customer support from 9,000 to 5,000 employees because he ""needs less heads."" The company's Agentforce AI platform now handles 50% of customer interactions, having completed over 1.2 million conversations since October 2024.The AI deployment reduced support costs by 17% and decreased case volumes enough that Salesforce no longer actively backfills support engineer positions, according to a company spokesperson.Benioff's divergent approach—expanding sales while contracting support—reflects his belief that balance is crucial. ""If you turn it over to 100% AI, you're putting your whole company at risk,"" he told Axios in July, acknowledging the ""bumpy"" transition as companies navigate unprecedented technological change.","Salesforce to hire between 3,000 and 5,000 new salespeople by year's end.

The company reported strong revenue in the third quarter, driven by high demand for its chips. This positive performance follows a significant investment from the US government. Intel expects this robust demand to continue through 2026. The company's client computing segment, which includes PC and laptop chips, saw a 5% year-over-year increase. Artificial intelligence is seen as a key driver for future growth.

Beyond STEM: The emerging fields shaping global careers

US government's stake in Intel





Intel is back in profit. The chip giant snapped its losing streak of six straight quarterly losses and returned to profitability in the third quarter. The American chipmaker posted strong revenue, noting robust demand for chips that it expects to continue into 2026. This is Intel's first earnings report since the Donlad Trump administration acquired a 10% stake in the company in August this year.Client computing revenue, which includes chips for PCs and laptops, grew 5% year over year, benefiting from PC market stabilization and artificial intelligence PC prospects. CEO Lip-Bu Tan said in a call with analysts that artificial intelligence “is a strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth as we execute.” Tan added, “We significantly improved our cash position and liquidity in Q3, a key focus for me since becoming CEO in March. ”US President Donald Trump announced in August that the U.S. government would take a 10% stake in the Intel as part of his effort to bolster companies deemed vital to national security. With this, the US government is the company’s biggest shareholder. The investment seems to have worked well for the company's stock -- Intel stock is up more than 50% since Aug 22, when Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced the deal.On its part, Intel has agreed to make major investments in U.S. manufacturing facilities in exchange for the funds.Talking about its biggest shareholder, the US government, Intel CFO David Zinser told CNBC, “Like any shareholder, we have to keep in touch with them.” He added, “We don’t tell them how the numbers are going before the quarter. We generally talk to them like Fidelity,” another Intel shareholder.Intel also received $5 billion from rival Nvidia in September. Earlier this year, it received $2 billion from Japanese technology giant SoftBank.Talking about company's older chipmaking processes Zinser said that they have continued to do well, “and that was probably the part that was more unexpected.” Intel CFO said the company met some of the central processing unit (CPU) demand with inventory on hand, but they will be behind in thefirst quarter, “probably Q2 and maybe in Q3.”The supply crunch has been with older Intel 10 and 7 manufacturing technologies. Many customers are reportedly opting for less advanced hardware to refresh their operating systems, demonstrating enterprises aren’t waiting for cutting-edge chips when proven technology gets the job done.","Chip giant Intel has returned to profit after six quarters of losses.

Putin's FIERY Retaliation Against U.S. Over Trump Sanctions On Russia; 'Your Actions Won't Stop Us'

Silicon Valley hit by US-China trade war





Female spies have been part of wars since ages. There are many told and untold stories of female spies dating back World Wars, and becoming more prominent during Russia-US cold war of sixties and seventies. The Cold War era saw female spies play crucial and varied roles on both sides of the Iron Curtain. They were not just peripheral figures; they were integral cogs in the Cold War's espionage machinery, contributing to everything from high-level strategic analysis to dangerous field operations.And now a new report in 'The Times' claims that female spies are waging 'sex warfare' to steal Silicon Valley secrets. Quoting some analysts, the report claims that China and Russia are sending attractive women to seduce tech workers — even marrying and having children with their targets.Chinese and Russian operatives are reportedly using seduction as a weapon to infiltrate Silicon Valley, targeting tech professionals to steal trade secrets, according to industry insiders quoted in the report. According to 'The Times' exclusive report, the tactic, dubbed ""sex warfare,"" is part of a broader espionage campaign exploiting America’s tech industry, costing taxpayers up to $600 billion annually, per the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property.James Mulvenon, chief intelligence officer at Pamir Consulting, revealed he’s been repeatedly targeted by “sophisticated” LinkedIn requests from attractive young Chinese women. At a recent Virginia conference on Chinese investment risks, two such women attempted to gain entry but were denied.“It’s a phenomenon,” Mulvenon is quoted as saying. “They have an asymmetric advantage because we don’t do that here.” Counterintelligence experts warn that China and Russia are leveraging civilians—investors, crypto analysts, and academics—rather than trained spies, making detection harder.China is also accused of hosting startup competitions on American soil to steal business plans. The annual China (Shenzhen) Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, held in cities like Boston and Tokyo, lures startups with cash prizes but requires them to share sensitive intellectual property and establish operations in China. A Silicon Valley biotech CEO who won $50,000 at last year’s event said he was heavily monitored, with organizers wiring funds to his personal account—a move he found suspicious. His company later lost U.S. federal funding, possibly due to ties with Asian investors.In a high-profile case, Klaus Pflugbeil, a former Tesla employee, was sentenced to 24 months in prison in December 2024 for attempting to sell stolen battery technology secrets for $15 million at a Las Vegas trade conference. His alleged accomplice, Yilong Shao, remains at large. Experts also point to China-backed venture capital firms investing in U.S. startups initially funded by the Department of Defense (DoD). This “drafting” tactic pushes foreign ownership beyond thresholds that block further DoD investment, starving innovative firms of critical funding.A Senate committee recently found that six of the 25 largest recipients of federal Small Business Innovation Research funds had ties to China, receiving nearly $180 million from the Pentagon in 2023 and 2024.“It’s the Wild West,” said Jeff Stoff, a security academic and former U.S. government analyst. He noted that China exploits regulatory blind spots, operating with “virtual impunity.” Counterintelligence officials are now urging increased scrutiny of cross-border investments and greater awareness of espionage threats in Silicon Valley. “China is targeting our startups, academics, and DoD-funded projects,” Stoff warned. “We’ve not even entered the battlefield.”","Chinese and Russian operatives are reportedly using seduction as a weapon to infiltrate Silicon Valley, targeting tech professionals to steal trade secrets.

When Elon Musk said Twitter algorithm sucks





Tesla CEO Elon Musk has acknowledged ongoing issues with Twitter ’s (now X) recommendation algorithm. In a post, the world’s richest person apologized to users for what he described as ‘frustrations’ with how Twitter posts are being surfaced on the microblogging platform. “My apologies for frustrations with the 𝕏 algorithm. We are working hard to fix the problem,” Musk wrote in a post.Over the past few weeks, several X users have reported inconsistencies in their feeds – — including repetitive content, delayed updates, and limited visibility for certain accounts. Some creators have also complained about drops in engagement and reach, sparking speculation about recent algorithmic changes.Ever since taking charge of the platform in 2022, Musk made algorithm transparency a central theme. He has previously said the company is continuously tweaking its feed-ranking system to prioritise “useful and engaging” posts. Earlier this year, X open-sourced parts of its recommendation code to allow users to see how posts are promoted or demoted.While Musk did not detail what the latest issue involves or when it will be resolved, his acknowledgment suggests that X’s engineering team is actively working on an update.Earlier this year in January, Musk playfully ‘slammed’ the recommendation algorithm of X. Criticising X’s recommendation algorithm, Musk jokingly said: “If I see one more da*n Nazi salute in my feed, I’m gonna lose my mind 🤪 This algorithm sucks!!” Later on, he also wrote: “The recommendation algorithm on this platform sucks! I want to talk to the manager right now!!”Musk's remarks then came after his hand gestures at Donald Trump 's inauguration sparked controversy online, with some comparing it to Nazi salutes.","The world’s richest person apologized to users for what he described as ‘frustrations’ with how Twitter posts are being surfaced on the microblogging platform. “My apologies for frustrations with the algorithm.

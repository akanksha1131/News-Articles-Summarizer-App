"Dropbox to layoff 20% employees globally, read CEO’s email to employees",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/dropbox-to-layoff-20-employees-globally-read-ceos-email-to-employees/articleshow/114825667.cms,"Dropbox CEO and cofounder Drew Houston announced on October 30 that the company will be laying off over 500 employees.

Read CEO’s full email to employees announcing job cuts

Dropbox is laying off 528 employees, representing 20% of its global workforce. CEO Drew Houston , informed the company about the layoffs in an email, attributing the cuts to a need for greater efficiency and a ""flatter"" organisational structure. The reductions are focused on areas deemed “over-invested or underperforming.”This marks the second significant round of layoffs for the cloud storage and collaboration company, following a 16% reduction in staff in April 2023.Hi everyone,I’m writing to let you all know that after careful consideration, we've decided to reduce our global workforce by approximately 20% or 528 Dropboxers.As CEO, I take full responsibility for this decision and the circumstances that led to it, and I’m truly sorry to those impacted by this change.Why we're making this decisionAs we've shared over the last year, we're in a transitional period as a company. Our FSS business has matured, and we've been working to build our next phase of growth with products like Dash. However, navigating this transition while maintaining our current structure and investment levels is no longer sustainable.We continue to see softening demand and macro headwinds in our core business. But external factors are only part of the story. We’ve heard from many of you that our organizational structure has become overly complex, with excess layers of management slowing us down.And while I'm proud of the progress we’ve made in the last couple years, in some parts of the business, we’re still not delivering at the level our customers deserve or performing in line with industry peers. So we're making more significant cuts in areas where we're over-invested or underperforming while designing a flatter, more efficient team structure overall.The opportunity aheadThe changes we're making today, while difficult, come at a pivotal moment when the market is accelerating precisely where we've placed our biggest bets. It's been tremendously rewarding over the last few weeks to see customers and prospects light up when using Dash for Business for the first time, much like people did when we first launched Dropbox.And this time we're starting from a position of strength. Millions of customers trust us as the home for their most important files, making the leap to organizing all their cloud content a natural evolution.But we're not operating on our own schedule. This market is moving fast and investors are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into this space. This both validates the opportunity we've been pursuing and underscores the need for even more urgency, even more aggressive investment, and decisive action.The steps we’re taking today are necessary to both strengthen our core product and accelerate the growth of our new products. We’ll share more about our 2025 strategy in the days ahead.Taking care of impacted employeesTo those leaving Dropbox, we're committed to supporting you through this transition. You’ll be eligible to receive the following benefits and support:Severance, equity, and transition paymentAll impacted employees will be eligible for sixteen weeks of pay, starting today, with one additional week of pay for each completed year of tenure at Dropbox. Internationally, severance packages will vary depending on regional practices and statutory requirements.All impacted employees will receive their Q4 equity vest.Those on the Corporate Bonus plan will be eligible to receive a pro-rated lump sum transition payment equivalent to their 2024 bonus target based on company performance forecasts and aligned with their level.We will pay out eligible remaining current and approved upcoming paid leaves, including medical or family leaves.We will support impacted visa holders by providing additional time to transition and access to 1:1 immigration consultation.Healthcare and benefitsUS employees will be eligible for up to six months of COBRA.Canada-based employees will be eligible for a one-month healthcare extension.All employees will continue to have access to Modern Health to support their mental well-being.DevicesImpacted employees will be eligible to keep company devices (phones, tablets, laptops, and peripherals) for personal use.Job placementJob placement services and career coaching will be available at no cost.Next stepsWe'll be sharing more details on high-level changes later today and will host company-wide Town Halls later this week to answer questions and discuss our plans in more detail.I know this is incredibly difficult and unwelcome news. To everyone leaving Dropbox, I’m deeply grateful for everything you've done for our company and our customers.Drew","CEO Drew Houston informed the company about the layoffs in an email, attributing the cuts to a need for greater efficiency and a ""flatter"" organisational structure.

Dear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners:

Fiscal year 2024 was a pivotal year for Microsoft. We entered our 50th year as a company and the second year of the AI platform shift. With these milestones, I’ve found myself reflecting on how Microsoft has remained a consequential company decade after decade in an industry with no franchise value. And I realize that it’s because—time and time again, when tech paradigms have shifted—we have seized the opportunity to reinvent ourselves to stay relevant to our customers, our partners, and our employees. And that’s what we are doing again today.

Microsoft has been a platform and tools company from the start. We were founded in 1975 with a belief in creating technology that would enable others to create their own. And, nearly 50 years later, this belief remains at the heart of our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

This year, we moved from talking about AI to helping our customers translate it into real outcomes—one person, one organization, one institution, and one country at a time. We have made remarkable progress on this front across every industry. For example:

· Coles is generating 1.6 billion daily AI predictions across 850 Australian stores, ensuring every shopper finds what they need.

· Unilever is performing thousands of simulations with AI in the time it would take to run tens of laboratory experiments, as it accelerates its product development.

· Developers at Itaú, Brazil’s largest private bank, are coding more efficiently using our AI pair programmer, GitHub

Copilot

.

· Khan Academy is making tutoring more accessible for students and helping teachers plan more creative lessons, using our small language model Phi.

· Aquafarmers in Indonesia are improving their yields, thanks to an app built with the Azure OpenAI Service, as well as Azure IoT.

· In Kenya, street vendors now have access to credit for the first time, thanks to M-Kopa, a social enterprise using Azure ML to do its forecasting.

· And enterprise customers and their employees around the world, from Amgen and Disney, to Finastra and Vodafone, are using Microsoft 365 Copilot to become more creative and productive.

Financially, the year was also marked by record performance. We delivered over $245 billion in annual revenue, up 16 percent year-over-year, and over $109 billion in operating income, up 24 percent.

Going forward, we are focused on three priorities: First, prioritizing fundamentals, with security above all else. We launched the Secure Future Initiative (SFI) this year, bringing together every part of our organization to advance cybersecurity protection. Second, driving trustworthy AI innovation across our entire portfolio while continuing to scale our cloud business. And, finally, managing our cost structure dynamically to generate durable, long-term operating leverage. All three priorities are critical to our ability to continue thriving as a company as we raise the bar on our operational excellence, with a focus on continuous improvement across everything we do.

AGE OF AI

If we go back 70 years to the beginning of modern computing, our industry has had two dreams: First, can computers understand us instead of us having to understand computers? And second, as we digitize more of the world—including people, places, and things—can computers help us reason, plan, and act more effectively using all that information? Over the past year, we have had breakthroughs on both fronts.

The core underlying force behind these breakthroughs is scaling laws. Just like Moore’s Law drove the information revolution, the scaling laws of deep neural networks (DNN) and transformers are driving today’s AI revolution. Up until the DNN inflection point, progress in compute was keeping up with Moore’s Law—doubling every two years. But we have now started to see progress in AI performance double roughly every six months.

There are three capabilities coming together because of these scaling laws. First, we have a new natural user interface that is multimodal. It supports speech, images, and videos—both as input and output. We have memory that retains important context, recalling both our personal knowledge and data across devices, apps, and the web. And, finally, we have new reasoning and planning capabilities that help us understand complex context, complete end-to-end tasks on our behalf, and reduce our cognitive load.

This new world is being defined by a rich tapestry of AI agents, which can take action on our behalf, including personal agents across work and life, business process agents, and cross-organizational ones. These agents will be able to work in concert as a new input to help make small businesses more productive, make multinationals more competitive, make the public sector more efficient, and improve health and education outcomes broadly.

Microsoft has built three leading platforms to help our customers maximize their opportunity in this emerging agentic era: Copilot, which you can think of as the new UI for AI—the human interface for this agentic world; the Copilot stack, which brings together infrastructure, data, and app services to help customers build their own copilots and agents for their own business processes; and a new category of Copilot devices that are purpose-built for this new era, including the Copilot+ PCs we introduced this year.

OUR OPPORTUNITY

The innovation we have driven over the past year matters only if we translate it into enduring value for our customers. That’s why, across our tech stack, we are focused on helping people and organizations realize the benefits of AI.

Infrastructure

This year, we expanded our cloud and AI capacity, announcing new investments across five continents. These are long-term assets to drive new growth for the next decade and beyond, and ensure communities around the world have access to the compute they need to drive economic growth in this new era.

Our cloud now also offers top performance for AI training and inference and the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first-party silicon, Azure Maia, which we introduced last November.

More broadly, we continued to see sustained revenue growth from migrations as customers turn to Azure. Azure Arc is helping customers streamline their transition, as they secure, develop, and operate workloads with Azure services anywhere. We have 36,000 Arc customers, up 90 percent year-over-year. And we remain the hyperscale cloud of choice for SAP and Oracle workloads.

Data & AI

AI models are now key building blocks for every application. And with Azure AI, we are building out the app server for the AI age, providing access to the most diverse selection of models to meet customers’ unique cost, latency, and design considerations. We offer leading frontier models, thanks to our strategic partnership with OpenAI. With Phi-3, which we announced in April, we offer a family of powerful, small language models. And, with Models as a service, we provide API access to third-party models, including the latest from Cohere, Meta, and Mistral. In total, we have over 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60 percent year-over-year. This year, we also announced a partnership with G42, which will run its AI applications and services on our cloud, as we collaborate to bring our latest AI technologies to the United Arab Emirates and other countries.

AI does not get created without data. At the data layer, we are fundamentally rethinking what it means to be an analytics database or an operational data store in the world of AI. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform provides customers with the broadest capabilities spanning databases, analytics, business intelligence, and governance—along with seamless integration with all our AI services. And Microsoft Fabric, our AI-powered, next-generation data platform we made generally available this year, now has over 14,000 paid customers who can go from data, to insights, to action—all within the same unified SaaS solution.

Digital & app innovation

From GitHub to

Visual Studio

, we have the most comprehensive developer tools. GitHub Copilot had a breakout year, as it became standard issue for developers in every industry. We now have more than 1.8 million paid subscribers and over 77,000 enterprise customers, up 180 percent year-over-year. They are realizing productivity gains of up to 55 percent while staying in their flow and bringing the joy back to coding. This year, we also introduced Copilot Workspace, a Copilot-native developer environment, which helps any developer go from idea, to code, to software—all in natural language.

We are also integrating generative AI across Power Platform, enabling anyone to use natural language to create apps, automate workflows, or build a website. In total, we now have 48 million monthly active users of Power Platform, up 40 percent year-over-year.

Modern work

Microsoft 365 Copilot is becoming a daily habit for knowledge workers, transforming their work, workflow, and work artifacts. Adoption has been faster than any other new Microsoft 365 suite. And employees at nearly 60 percent of the Fortune 500 now use Copilot to complete tasks faster, hold more effective meetings, and automate business workflows and processes. In fact, internal and external studies show as much as a 70 percent improvement in productivity using generative AI for specific work tasks. And early Microsoft 365 Copilot users were 29 percent faster in a series of general tasks like searching, writing, and summarizing.

And we’re going further, bringing the Web plus Work plus Pages together as the new AI design system for knowledge work. With Pages, which we just announced last month, you can take any information from the web or your work and turn it into a multiplayer, AI-powered canvas. You can ideate with AI and then easily share what you create for collaboration with other people.

And with Copilot Studio, customers can extend Copilot with agents and build their own agents that proactively respond to data and events from their own first- and third-party business data. To date, 50,000 organizations have used it. And, just this week, we announced new capabilities that will make it possible for customers to build autonomous agents using Copilot Studio.

Microsoft Teams remains essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate, and do business. This year, we rolled out to all customers a new version that is up to two times faster while using 50 percent less memory. And Teams Premium surpassed 3 million seats, up nearly 400 percent year-over-year, as organizations chose it for advanced features like end-to-end encryption and real-time translation.

Business applications

We’re using this AI moment to redefine our role in business applications, too. Dynamics 365 once again took share, as organizations use our AI-powered apps to transform their marketing, sales, service, finance, and supply chain functions.

And we are expanding our total addressable market by integrating Copilot into third-party systems as well. Our new Dynamics 365 Contact Center infuses generative AI throughout the contact center workflow in a customer’s existing CRM.

We are also extending Copilot to specific industries, including healthcare. With DAX Copilot, more than 400 healthcare organizations are increasing physician productivity and reducing burnout. On average, clinicians save more than five minutes per patient encounter. And 77 percent say it also improves documentation quality.

Security

As I mentioned earlier, security underpins every layer of our tech stack. We are doubling down on our Secure Future Initiative, as we implement our principles of secure by design, secure by default, and secure operations. And we are focused on making continuous progress across the six pillars of the initiative: protect tenants and isolate production systems; protect identities and secrets; protect networks; protect engineering systems; monitor and detect threats; and accelerate response and remediation. As part of this commitment, all Microsoft employees now have security as a “core priority,” holding each one of us accountable for building secure products and services.

We are continuously applying what we are learning and translating it into security innovation for our customers. A great example is Copilot for Security, which we made generally available this year. It brings together LLMs with domain-specific skills informed by our threat intelligence and 78 trillion daily security signals to provide security teams with actionable insights.

Devices & creativity

This year, we introduced an entirely new category of Windows PCs engineered to unleash the power of distributed AI across the cloud and edge. Copilot+ PCs are the fastest, most AI-ready Windows PCs ever built. They include a new system architecture designed to deliver best-in-class performance and breakthrough AI experiences. And we are working across our entire ecosystem to bring these to life, including with AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, along with our OEM partners.

Professional social network

LinkedIn continues to see accelerated member growth and record engagement. We surpassed 1 billion members for the first time this year, as we combine our unique data with this new generation of AI to transform how people learn, sell, and get hired. LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message, to the right audience, on a safe and trusted platform. And when it comes to our subscription businesses, Premium signups increased 51 percent, and we are adding even more value to our members and customers with new AI tools and skilling opportunities.

Search, ads, and news

With Copilot, we’re taking the first steps toward creating an AI companion, one that’s always by your side, helping you feel smarter and more supported through natural conversations. The refreshed Copilot app we introduced earlier this month delivers a more intuitive design with more digestible, speedy, and fluent answers. It now adapts to you with a warm tone and a distinct style, providing not only information but encouragement, feedback, and advice as you navigate life’s everyday challenges—no matter how big or small. And we’re adding advanced capabilities like Voice and Vision that make it both more useful and more natural.

We also continue to apply generative AI to pioneer new approaches to how people search and browse. Microsoft Bing and Edge both took share again this year. And we introduced Copilot Pro, providing access to the latest models for quick answers and higher-quality image creation, and access to Copilot for Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscribers.

Thousands of news and entertainment publishers trust us to reach new audiences with Microsoft Start. And we are also helping advertisers increase their ROI. Copilot in Microsoft Ad Platform helps marketers create campaigns and troubleshoot using natural language.

Gaming

We are bringing great games to more people on more devices. With our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, which closed October 2023, we’ve added hundreds of millions of players to our ecosystem. We now have 20 franchises that have generated over $1 billion in lifetime revenue—from Candy Crush, Diablo, and Halo, to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, and Gears of War. And with Xbox cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love—where, when, and how they want. Finally, we brought four of our fan-favorite titles to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation for the first time, as we continue to extend our content to new platforms.

OUR MISSION

Although we have made outstanding progress over the past year, we cannot take our permission to innovate—let alone operate—for granted. It is something we must earn.

We always say Microsoft will do well only if the world around us does well. And that’s why we are focused on four enduring commitments. They keep us grounded, serving as a guide as we make decisions, pushing us to ask critical questions to ensure the technology we create benefits everyone on the planet, as well as the planet itself.

How can we expand opportunity?

We are democratizing access to AI and the skills needed to harness its potential, ensuring that every person, organization, and community can benefit from the opportunities AI brings.

This year, we partnered with 375,000 nonprofits globally, providing $4.7 billion in donated and discounted technology—to help them build capacity, drive efficiencies, innovate, and increase their impact as they take on the world’s greatest challenges. Together with our partners, we also made significant strides in skilling. We have trained and certified 14.1 million people across 202 countries in digital skills as of June 2024. Over 80 percent of the learners were from groups furthest from opportunity in the digital economy.

And our work doesn’t stop there. We must do more to accelerate the equitable adoption of AI and narrow the digital divide. That’s why we’ve launched new AI skilling initiatives in partnership with governments, educational institutions, industry, and civil society—to help millions of people learn to use generative AI, develop AI tools, and lead AI adoption. This includes people from underserved communities, with a focus on young people, women, rural communities, and the Global South, as well as employees of social impact organizations.

How can we earn trust?

We recognize that trust is earned, not given. And we remain committed to earning trust every day, spanning cybersecurity, trustworthy AI, privacy, and digital safety.

Our Secure Future Initiative advances how we design, build, test, and operate our technology to ensure we deliver solutions that meet the highest possible standard of security. Our first SFI Progress Report highlights updates spanning culture, governance, technology, and operations, but we recognize that our work on security is never complete. We must and will do more. Our promise is to continually learn, improve, and adapt to the evolving needs of an increasingly complex security landscape.

We are focused on building AI that is trustworthy, meaning that it is secure, safe, and private. Our responsible AI practices, grounded in our foundational AI principles, help ensure we do this from the beginning. And we’re building on this commitment by introducing new product capabilities across our tech stack, ensuring that both our customers and developers are safeguarded at every level. Ultimately, these commitments and capabilities are key to fulfilling our mission. The world is looking to us to help defend and protect them, and we take that responsibility seriously. In May, we published our first AI Transparency Report, which outlines how we build generative applications responsibly and support our customers. We also released Goals and Governance: Goals and Lessons for AI, which draws lessons from other globally governed technologies like civil aviation and nuclear power. Through our Accelerating Foundation Models Research program, we’ve made grants to hundreds of projects in AI safety and alignment research, AI-driven scientific discovery, and beneficial applications of AI. And we launched our Global Perspectives Responsible AI Fellowship program, designed to center the voices of AI experts from the Global South and enable us to better understand AI’s impact on developing countries. As we drive AI innovation, we continue to respond to a changing privacy landscape. We provide tools to help our customers protect their privacy and control their data, and we have published several resources outlining our approach to privacy and AI for our consumer, commercial, and public sector customers.

Finally, we continue our work to create safe experiences online and protect customers from illegal and harmful content and conduct. To bolster our efforts to prevent child sexual exploitation and abuse risks, we have made new commitments to safety by design in our AI services, joined the Tech Coalition’s Lantern Program, and proposed concrete actions that US policymakers can take to protect the public through regulatory and policy measures.

How can we protect fundamental rights?

We are committed to protecting fundamental rights—extending the benefits of technology while mitigating its potential harms. For us, this means promoting responsible business practices, expanding connectivity and accessibility, protecting democracy, and advancing a fair and inclusive society.

Over the past year, as regulators increasingly required greater transparency and process consistency across corporate supply chains and human rights efforts, we ensured compliance with reporting and due diligence directives. Going forward, we’ll continue to respect global human rights and laws and take steps to mitigate the impact of our operations and our technology on the people in our value chain.

As we build and deploy more AI solutions, connectivity and accessibility are foundational. Since 2017, we’ve extended access to affordable high-speed internet to over 100 million people, including nearly 40 million in Africa. And we remain focused on building inclusive, accessible AI that empowers people across the spectrum of disability.

More than 4 billion people will vote this year in their respective elections, making it the biggest election year in history. At the Munich Security Conference in February, we came together with others across the tech sector and pledged to help prevent deceptive AI content from interfering with global elections. As part of this pledge, we have worked to empower campaigns, candidates, election officials, and voters to understand the risks of deceptive AI in elections and to take steps to protect themselves and democracies. To date, we’ve conducted deepfake trainings in over 20 countries. And our corresponding public awareness campaign has reached over 355 million people.

Lastly, we continued investing in both strategic national partnerships and community-based projects that leverage data and insights to enable changes that advance racial equity and fairness in the criminal legal system.

How can we advance sustainability?

Finally, we are on a journey to build a more sustainable future, from addressing our own environmental footprint to empowering our customers and the world with the technology needed to meet the climate challenge. Over the past year, we have seen how AI can catalyze environmental progress in remarkable ways—from increasing the capacity of transmission lines to deliver renewable power, to the discovery of new materials to support energy production and storage, to empowering the workforce with sustainability skills.

But we also recognize the resource intensity of the infrastructure needed to yield these benefits, which is why we’re advancing the sustainability of AI, from design to construction to operations, all while working to improve the efficiency of these technologies. We’re also investing in innovation through Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund and our AI for Good Lab, advancing research and advocating for policies that can drive global impact.

In our latest Environmental Sustainability Report, we shared progress toward our 2030 commitments. We’re on track in several areas. Where we’re not yet on track, we’re mobilizing to accelerate our progress toward becoming carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste, as well as to protect and preserve ecosystems.

When it comes to our carbon footprint, we continue to support clean electricity infrastructure through long-term investments to bring more power onto the grids where we operate. Since setting our carbon negative target, we have contracted over 34 gigawatts of renewable energy, including projects in 24 countries.

In our efforts to become water positive, we provided more than 1.5 million people with access to clean water and sanitation, achieving our water access target.

Our journey to zero waste includes reducing waste at our campuses and datacenters and advancing circularity for cloud hardware, packaging, and devices. Our most recent report showed we had a reuse and recycle rate of 89.4 percent for servers and components across all cloud hardware.

Finally, AI gives new opportunity for ecosystem and biodiversity management with solutions like AI-assisted bioacoustics. And we’re expanding collaboration with local communities to build and operate datacenters in ways that address local challenges and create greater benefits. This work is guided by our Sustainability Standards for new construction and our Datacenter Community Pledge.

Learn more about our progress and learnings as we pursue our commitments in our annual Impact Summary.

OUR CULTURE

Just as our culture has been critical in getting us to this point, it will be critical to our success going forward. At Microsoft, we think of our culture as being both input and output. To pursue new concepts, we need new capability. To build new capability, we need a culture that allows us to grow that capability long before it is conventional wisdom. For us, that means constantly exercising our growth mindset and confronting our fixed mindset—each one of us, every day. It is the only way we will succeed.

Our growth mindset culture helps us in our continuous pursuit of high performance. It doesn’t matter what we said about our culture 10 years ago or even last year if we aren’t practicing it today—by anticipating the unmet and unarticulated needs of customers; by working together as One Microsoft to deliver the best end-to-end solutions and services; and by actively seeking diversity and embracing inclusion—to ensure our workforce represents the planet we serve and the products we build always meet our customers’ needs. In our latest Diversity & Inclusion Report, we share the ways our longstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion endures, and what we’re learning as we continue to hire, develop, and grow a global workforce that best supports each other and our customers. This is how we thrive—as individuals, as teams, and as an organization. And, when we thrive, we can help our customers and the world thrive too.

Giving also remains core to our culture. This year, more than 106,000 employees gave $250 million (including company match) to nearly 35,000 nonprofits in 111 countries. And our employees volunteered over 1 million hours to causes they care about. I am deeply grateful for my colleagues’ dedication to making a difference. Together, we can continue to empower everyone around the world.

**

In closing, this is a consequential time for our company, our industry, and the world. Ultimately, our mission requires that we translate technology into empowerment for everyone, into real-world impact. At the end of the day, that’s what really matters.

Nearly two years later, I can’t stop thinking about the Indian farmer I met in January 2023. He was able to apply for complex government farm subsidies using just his voice, thanks to an app built with GPT 3.5. It was remarkable. A frontier model developed on the West Coast of the US just months earlier was being used to directly improve the lives of rural farmers on the other side of the globe.

That rate of diffusion was unlike anything I had seen in my career. And the pace has only increased. Earlier this year, I was in Thailand, where I met developers using Phi-3 to optimize their operations just days after the small language model was released.

To me, that represents the true democratization of expertise. Where the internet era put information at our fingertips, AI is putting expertise at our fingertips. Impact like this is why we are in this industry, and it is what gives all of us at Microsoft deep meaning in our work.

It is why we are investing in our fundamentals, in our people, and in continued innovation—so that we can help others achieve more for the long term.

It is not an exaggeration to say that what each of us does right now with the unique opportunity we have been given will shape the future. And I look forward to seeing how all of us use Microsoft as a platform to make a difference—one customer, one community, one country at a time.

The biggest problem as per JPMorgan CEO

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has launched a scathing attack on several major US financial regulatory initiatives, vowing to oppose those he deems harmful and ineffective. ""It's time to fight back,"" Dimon said at a conference. Many banks are afraid to ""fight with their regulators, because they would just come and punish you more,"" he added.""I have been told by people at the Fed, know that because of what you have said and what you wrote about, you know they are coming after you.""Dimon, known for his outspoken nature, criticized the complexity and potential negative impact of proposed rules on capital requirements, card payments, and open banking. He expressed concern that these regulations could hinder innovation, increase costs for consumers, and ultimately weaken the financial system .Specifically, Dimon targeted the Basel III endgame proposal, the Federal Reserve's proposed capital surcharge for large banks, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's open banking rule. He argued that these regulations are overly burdensome, inconsistent, and could undermine the stability of the financial system.The JPMorgan CEO also advocated for stricter regulation of card-issuing financial services firms like American Express, Capital One, and Discover Financial Services, arguing that they have an unfair advantage over banks due to relaxed regulations on debit card fees. ""The biggest problem I have with all these overlapping rules is that we are not stepping back and saying, what could we do better to make the system work better,"" he added.Dimon's comments highlight the growing tensions between the banking industry and US regulators. As the industry continues to grapple with evolving regulatory landscapes, it remains to be seen how these disputes will ultimately impact the financial system and consumers.","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has launched a scathing attack on several major US financial regulatory initiatives.

What helped Microsoft to increase its gaming revenue



How other divisions of Microsoft contributed



Microsoft has announced its Q1 2025 earnings result. The biggest highlight in the tech giant’s report was a significant increase in gaming revenue , driven by strong growth in Xbox content and services. However, the company noted that its Xbox hardware revenue continues to decline. The latest earnings report shows a 61% year-over-year increase in Xbox content and services revenue which the company largely attributed to the acquisition of Activision Blizzard . Meanwhile, Microsoft also reported a 29% decline in Xbox hardware revenue. The company’s strategy of making its games available on multiple platforms, including PC and cloud gaming , may have contributed to the decline in its hardware sales. Apart from this, Microsoft also reported an increase in AI cloud services, OEM and device revenue.Microsoft's Q1 2025 gaming revenue growth was driven by the introduction of the new Xbox Game Pass ""Standard"" tier, an increase in the price for the Game Pass Ultimate subscription and the addition of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III to the Game Pass library.However, this quarter's figures do not include the impact of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, which launched last week. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also claimed it to be the “biggest Call of Duty release ever”.The company's Intelligent Cloud division saw a 20% year-over-year revenue increase, reaching $24.1 billion, fueled by Azure and its AI services .Productivity and Business Processes, which include Office products, also experienced a 12% revenue growth. While overall OEM and Devices revenue increased slightly (2%), this was primarily due to Windows OEM, offsetting a decline in device sales.Microsoft continues to invest heavily in AI, particularly in its Copilot platform, recognising the potential of AI across various industries. The company's AI business is expected to cross a $10 billion annual run rate this quarter.Despite facing challenges like the recent CrowdStrike outage that caused widespread disruptions, Microsoft also remains focused on security and innovation.","Microsoft has announced its Q1 2025 earnings result.

"500 AWS employees write to CEO Matt Garman for reversing work from office policy, read the full letter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/500-aws-employees-write-to-ceo-matt-garman-for-reversing-work-from-office-policy-read-the-full-letter/articleshow/114809434.cms,"Read full letter below:

Mr. Garman,

As employees of AWS and Amazon who work tirelessly every day to obsess over and innovate on behalf of our customers, we were appalled to hear the non-data-driven explanation you gave for Amazon imposing a 5-day in-office mandate at the AWS Global Meeting on October 17th.

Your comments, in part, stated:

I think nine out of ten people are actually quite excited by this change. There's a number of reasons for it ... what makes Amazon special is our ability to debate and our ability to innovate. And when we want to innovate, when we want to really, really innovate on interesting products, I have not seen an ability for us to do that when we're not in-person. There is just no substitute for getting up on a whiteboard and walking through what's going on, having a brainstorm and stopping in the cubicle next to you and asking the person where it is, and grabbing coffee or lunch together and chatting about it, learning what other people are working on and it sparking something in what you're working on — that just doesn't work when you're working remote, it just doesn't happen ... And so we feel, and I feel very strongly that that is just such an important part of the company that getting us back in the office and in an office setting is super important.

Not only are these comments inconsistent with the experiences of many employees, they indicate an outright abdication of AWS' role as one of the world's most innovative companies and a leader in our industry. By making these statements, you are continuing and compounding a trend by Amazon's S-team of misrepresenting the realities of working at Amazon and the impact this mandate will have on the company and, by extension, its customers.

claims to be a data-driven company, and statements which rely on ""we believe"" and ""I feel,"" or exclaim how many people are excited about something to justify themselves fail to achieve our standard of decision making for critical issues that impact hundreds of thousands of the company's employees and its customers. Your statements indicate that either you have not collected enough data to support your position but are moving ahead anyways, or you have seen the data which indicates otherwise and are choosing to ignore it, or you have motivations to support this policy which you are not being forthcoming about with those it impacts. All of these possibilities break the trust of your employees who have not only personal experience that shows the benefits of remote work, but have seen the extensive data which supports that experience.

Data from independent research has shown time and time again that companies which embrace flexible in-office policies allow a more diverse set of workers to sustainably and effectively contribute to the shared goals of businesses like ours. If being inclusive and understanding of employees' personal working styles and circumstances isn't enough to justify why this is the right approach for us to take, research is clear that diverse perspectives lead to more innovation, productivity, and resilience. This diversity in backgrounds, locations, and working styles is essential to AWS' ability to hire and retain exceptional talent and remain a market leader and innovator in the future.

By rigidly mandating a 5-day in-office culture and telling employees who cannot or will not contribute to the company's mission in this specific way that ""there are other companies around,"" you are silencing critical perspectives and damaging our culture and our future in doing so. Moreover, this does not uphold Amazon's espoused ""Strive to be Earth's Best Employer"" leadership principle, especially for select and protected groups who have sought a safer, more inclusive, and healthier work environment and are disproportionately impacted by these policies. These groups include but are not limited to working parents (especially those with young children), employees who are neurodiverse or have disabilities or disorders, workers with caretaking responsibilities, and workers on a visa who have no choice but to comply or risk having to leave their home by quitting.

While your remarks focus on some of the benefits you perceive in in-person collaboration, they fail to even acknowledge the significant challenges it presents to these valued workers who have often overcome adversity at every level in order to contribute to Amazon's mission. In order to highlight these challenges, we have included a selection of anonymous stories from Amazon employees about the impact Amazon's 3-day in-office policy has already had on their life and work with this letter. In addition, studies show that

Return To Office

mandates tend to push out more senior and tenured employees across the board, who may be best poised to participate in and give insight into these white-boarding and brainstorming sessions you refer to, while hurting the morale of those who stay.

You have not addressed these issues nor presented any solution to them while touting the new and even more impactful 5-day policy. We do not accept this from our leaders. We see and value contributions from workers of these groups every day, and will not stand silently by while you dismiss their humanity and trivialize their impact.

Our time working remotely during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic proved that we are effective, creative, and successful without being primarily in-person, and to take no lessons from that experience would be extremely disappointing, because Amazon is and always will be a global company. We will always collaborate with teams and stakeholders in different physical locations, countries, and timezones where the primary, and potentially only, interaction is virtual. We have tools and approaches to do this effectively which are not novel or difficult to use. On the contrary, pushing for more time in-office will harm these countless cross-regional interactions as there will be significantly fewer overlapping working hours between collaborators. This can lead to meetings that might have been done by videoconferencing now taking place via asynchronous mechanisms like email, which slows the velocity of decision-making from minutes to hours or days.

Finally, by taking this action, AWS is not living up to its full potential and is creating a bleak outlook for its future. While it is absolutely true that there are challenges with flexible and remote work, we have always been a company that solves problems in new, exciting, and innovative ways, rather than relying on antiquated approaches that happened to work well some time in the past. The cloud computing industry that we now base our work and livelihoods on might not exist today if we had adhered to that restrictive thinking in our early days.

Given the scale of the problems we tackle across a workforce which is distributed all over the world, we are not content with relying on spontaneous in-office conversations to make progress and drive new ideas. We are instructed to collect, interpret, and act on data and invent new mechanisms to affect the outcomes we want to see, not to sit back and hope good things happen. We worry that when customers see us encounter a true challenge and refuse to solve problems that stand in the way of embracing it, they will rightly lose trust in AWS' ability to innovate.

For these reasons we urge you to reconsider your comments and your position on the proposed 5-day in-office mandate. Remote and flexible work is an opportunity for Amazon to take the lead, not a threat. We want to work for a company and for leaders that

recognize and seize this moment to challenge us to reinvent how we work.

Respectfully signed by 523 Amazonians, 172 of whom have elected to include their name below.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) CEO Matt Garman is facing a growing internal backlash over the company’s strict return-to-office policy, a report has said. Over 500 Amazon and AWS employees have reportedly signed an open letter criticising Garman's remarks towards those who oppose the mandate, which requires employees to work from the office five days a week.Recently, Garman asserted that most employees support the policy and are willing to come to office. However, the letter by employees argues that his comments “silence critical perspectives” and harm the company's future. Employees also dispute his claim that in-person work is essential for innovation, citing their own experiences as evidence to the contrary.Not only Garman, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has also defended the mandate as a way to strengthen company culture and collaboration, many employees feel it undermines flexibility and trust.","Employees of Amazon sent a letter to the company's S-team about the 5-day in- office mandate. They say the policy is hurting morale of those who want to stay in the office. The letter also says the policy does not uphold Amazon's espoused ""Strive to be Earth's Best Employer""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114809387,imgsize-108912,width-400,resizemode-4/114809387.jpg"

Reliance enters in partnership with Nvidia

The 2024 Nvidia AI Summit in Mumbai saw Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar rubbing shoulders with Jensen Huang , CEO of AI giant Nvidia. While the summit focused on strengthening India's AI capabilities, their encounter ended with a surprising discussion – martial arts.Kumar, a known martial arts enthusiast, shared a photo on social media X, formerly known as Twitter, where he and Huang pose playfully in a fighting stance. The caption reads: ""Imagine meeting the world’s biggest authority on Artificial Intelligence and ending up chatting about martial arts!! What an amazing man you are Mr. #JensenHuang. Now I know why @nvidia is the absolute giant that it is. 😊👍🏻""Nvidia's leather-jacket-clad CEO Huang got a rock star welcome at the company's AI summit in India. As a Bloomberg report said, ""The reception Huang received in India's commercial capital Mumbai was reminiscent of the ""Jensanity"" seen in other parts of the world, especially Taiwan, as his popularity climbs with Nvidia's soaring earnings and multi-trillion dollar market valuation.""Huang praised India's rapid digitalisation and its potential in the AI sector. ""Very few countries have this amazing natural resource called IT and computer science expertise,"" he said.The event, where the U.S. company unveiled plans to supply Reliance Industries and other Indian firms with its AI chips, had to be reportedly delayed for more than half an hour due to the crowd that one Nvidia employee said was ""easily a few thousand"".Nvidia CEO Huang and Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced a strategic partnership to build state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India at the summit. The collaboration aims to accelerate India's transformation into a global AI powerhouse by leveraging the nation's vast talent pool and burgeoning digital infrastructure. ""We are among the only countries where the average age of 1.4 billion people is below 35,"" he noted. Ambani emphasised that India's aspirations, combined with the visionary leadership of the Indian Prime Minister, have set the stage for a digital revolution.

The fine’s structure



Google’s response and Russia’s asset seizure

Legal basis and implications

Also read

In an unprecedented legal action, a Moscow court has imposed a staggering $20 decillion fine on Google , amounting to a sum far beyond the world's GDP, as reported by The Telegraph. This astronomical figure comes as a result of Google’s decision to block certain Russian state-linked channels on its platforms, including YouTube, beginning with Tsargrad TV four years ago. The decision to enforce such a substantial fine on the American tech giant is not only exceptional but has also sparked widespread attention in both legal and financial circles globally.The legal conflict began four years ago when Google blocked access to Tsargrad TV, a Russian channel known for its strong pro-government stance. Over the years, additional Russian state-linked media channels faced similar treatment on Google-owned platforms, resulting in Moscow’s legal measures against the company. Google’s block on these channels came amid rising tensions between Russia and Western countries, particularly in regard to censorship and propaganda concerns.Google’s decision to block Russian state-owned media content on YouTube was not isolated to Tsargrad TV but extended to other channels seen as spreading government-driven narratives. This move led to Russia’s invocation of Article 13.41 of the Administrative Offences Code, which states that the unauthorised restriction of access to legally permitted content can warrant fines and other penalties.The Moscow court ordered Google to pay an initial penalty of 100,000 roubles per day (approximately $1,200). However, a unique condition was attached to this daily fine: it would double every 24 hours that Google failed to comply. As Google continued to refrain from payment or restoration of the blocked channels, the fine quickly escalated to figures that surpassed any precedent in financial penalties.As of the latest reports, the total fine has reached an extraordinary 2 undecillion roubles, or roughly $20 decillion—a number so large it outstrips the global GDP by trillions. It is important to note that a figure of this magnitude is nearly impossible to achieve in reality, underscoring the symbolic nature of the penalty.In response to these legal proceedings, Google opted to cease operations in Russia after the country’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, leading the tech company to close down its Russian subsidiary. Google declared bankruptcy in Russia, citing the unmanageable legal and financial demands as well as an unsupportive regulatory environment. Consequently, Russian authorities seized approximately $100 million in assets from Google Russia, which reports suggest were redirected to support Russia’s military efforts.In its recent earnings statement, Google maintained that it does not foresee any significant financial repercussions from this ongoing legal matter. Given Google’s global reach and assets, the company appears confident in its ability to withstand such claims.The $20 decillion fine levied on Google has raised questions about enforceability and the basis for its calculation. Russian courts justified the fine under Article 13.41, asserting that Google violated content regulations. However, the exponential growth model employed to calculate the penalty has led to a nearly unattainable sum.This fine also highlights the potential for escalating legal actions between major technology firms and countries that may disagree with content restrictions imposed by these companies. As tech companies like Google become increasingly influential in information dissemination, more governments may seek legal action to challenge policies they view as restrictive or censoring of their narratives.The sheer scale of this fine demonstrates the complex relationships between technology companies and international governments, especially where content regulation is concerned. It is unlikely that this particular fine will have a direct financial impact on Google due to its infeasibility. However, it illustrates a broader trend of countries implementing stringent measures to hold tech companies accountable to local laws and policies.For companies like Google, operating in countries with contrasting policies on content moderation presents unique challenges. These events could prompt other governments to impose their own regulatory requirements, potentially impacting content accessibility and corporate operations globally.","A Moscow court has imposed a staggering $20 decillion fine on Google, amounting to a sum far beyond the world's GDP.

Lens is one of the fastest-growing query types we see on search because of its ability to answer complex multimodal questions and help in product discovery and shopping. For all these AI features , it's just the beginning, and you will see a rapid pace of innovation and progress here,” he added.Pichai also said that Gemini's deep integration is improving Android.“For example, Gemini Live lets you have free flowing conversations with Gemini.

The developer, remaining anonymous but describing himself as “a dreamer,” originally sought over one crore rupees from Reliance for the domain, intending to use the funds for an executive MBA at Cambridge University.However, after Reliance declined to engage in negotiations, the domain has found a surprising new home with 13-year-old Jainam Jain and 10-year-old Jivika Jain , who have pledged to support the young developer's mission and keep the domain open for future endeavours. Here are the events leading up to the sale, the motivations of all parties involved, and the current status of the JioHotstar domain.In 2023, rumours surfaced about a potential merger between Jio Cinema and Hotstar. Seeing a business opportunity, the Delhi-based developer purchased the JioHotstar domain, anticipating that this merger would make the domain highly valuable. Once the merger went through, he reached out to Reliance Industries with an offer to sell the domain for a little over one crore rupees.The developer’s goal was to fund his executive MBA program in the United Kingdom, specifically at the University of Cambridge. Despite his ambitions, Reliance Industries dismissed the offer without entering negotiations. Instead, the company reportedly issued warnings, as seen in previous legal actions they’ve taken against those acquiring domains related to Jio or Reliance.After negotiations with Reliance failed, the developer turned to a new set of potential buyers. In a surprising move, the JioHotstar domain was ultimately sold to Jainam and Jivika Jain, two young siblings from Dubai, aged 13 and 10. The children, who recently visited India, were inspired by a “Seva journey” they took as part of a holiday experience. During their visit, they engaged in various charitable activities, including teaching local children and collecting donations.The funds collected from their efforts were put toward the acquisition of the JioHotstar domain, which they have expressed a desire to maintain for future charitable and inspirational purposes. In a statement uploaded to the JioHotstar site, the children shared their intention to use the platform to “support a young software developer from Delhi” and to encourage others to contribute positively.In a heartfelt letter published on the domain’s website, Jainam and Jivika recounted their experiences in India and explained their motivation for purchasing the site. They described their journey, which included volunteer work and collecting donations, as part of an ongoing mission to make a difference in the lives of others. By acquiring the domain, they hope to keep the site open as a platform for “inspiring others” and mentioned that they are open to future sales to any individual or organisation that wishes to continue this mission.This message has been met with widespread attention online, with many expressing support for the children’s altruistic intentions. Although Reliance Industries has yet to release an official statement regarding the domain’s new ownership, the children’s gesture has already sparked discussions on various social media platforms.The anonymous app developer initially purchased the JioHotstar domain to leverage a business opportunity in light of the Jio and Hotstar merger. Driven by personal educational goals, he viewed the domain sale as a potential means to finance his MBA program at a prestigious institution. However, following Reliance’s refusal to negotiate, he opted to sell the domain to the young siblings from Dubai, whose motivations aligned with his goal of making a positive impact.Despite the lack of a substantial profit from the sale, the developer expressed contentment with the domain’s new ownership and the direction it has taken. In recent communications, he alluded to the fact that he would rather see the domain used for a meaningful cause than remain stagnant due to ongoing legal complications with Reliance.Currently, the JioHotstar domain is under the control of Jainam and Jivika Jain, who continue to utilise it as a platform for their charitable goals. In their statement, they emphasised that their acquisition of the domain is not for commercial profit but for supporting the original developer’s dreams and creating a space that can inspire others. They have also indicated an openness to consider future sales if the domain can serve a positive purpose under new ownership.","The JioHotstar domain has been sold to Jainam and Jivika Jain, two young siblings from Dubai, aged 13 and 10.

'AI risks need understanding'

Tony Fadell , known for his work on Apple iPod and Nest Labs , expressed skepticism about the current state of large language models (LLMs) and their potential for harm. Speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 in San Francisco, US, Fadell took aim at OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Talking about his understanding of the history of AI development before the large language model (LLM) craze and the issues with LLM hallucinations, he reportedly said, “I’ve been doing AI for 15 years, people, I’m not just spouting s—. I’m not Sam Altman, okay?”During the spirited interview, Fadell criticized the overhyped nature of LLMs and their propensity for hallucinations. He highlighted the importance of transparency and accountability in AI development, arguing that current models lack both. ""LLMs are trying to be this 'general' thing because we're trying to make science fiction happen,"" he said. ""They're a know-it-all... I hate know-it-alls.""Instead of relying on these general-purpose models, Fadell advocated for specialized AI agents that are trained on specific tasks and are more transparent about their limitations. He emphasized the need for greater regulation to ensure responsible AI development and deployment.The criticism of Altman came as Fadell shared his own experiences with AI, dating back to his work at Nest. He noted that even a decade ago, AI was a sensitive topic, and people were wary of its potential implications. However, the recent AI boom has led to a widespread adoption of these technologies without a full understanding of their limitations and risks.Fadell's comments serve as a stark reminder of the potential dangers of unchecked AI development. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives, it is crucial to approach these technologies with caution and a critical eye.","Tony Fadell, known for his work on Apple iPod and Nest Labs, expressed skepticism about the current state of large language models (LLMs) and their potential for harm.

Ford CEO has been driving the Xiaomi EV for 6 months

Meet 'China's Tesla'

Smartphone giant Xiaomi seems to be keen to shed its 'affordable brand tag'. The company has taken a significant step into the luxury electric vehicle market with the launch of the SU7 Ultra . Priced at a hefty $114,000, this high-performance EV according to Xiaomi would rank as the fastest four-door car in production in a direct challenge to the likes of Tesla and Porsche.Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun pricing that put the new EV on a par with the Tesla Model S Plaid and reportedly signaled an intent to compete on performance rather than cost with more established car makers.Incidentally, Xiaomi SU7 Ultra is a variant of Xiaomi SU7 that Ford CEO Jim Farley recently expressed admiration for. Farley said that he has been driving the SUV for six months and is quite impressed with its performance and technology integration. In a recent podcast interview, the CEO said that he has been driving the electric vehicle made by Xiaomi and “doesn’t want to give it up.”“This Xiaomi car… is fantastic. They sell ten thousand, twenty thousand a month,” Farley said. “I don’t like talking about the competition much, but we flew [an SU7] from Shanghai to Chicago and I’ve been driving it for six months now, and I don’t want to give it up.” Ford CEO is said to have imported the car from China as geopolitical tensions have limited the direct entry of Chinese automakers into the US market.The SU7 Ultra boasts impressive specifications, including a top speed that surpasses thePorsche Taycan Turbo and acceleration that outperforms the Tesla Model S Plaid. Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun emphasized the company's ambition to build a ""dream car"" that pushes the boundaries of automotive performance.To achieve this, the SU7 Ultra incorporates premium features like carbon-fiber components and performance ceramic brakes. The vehicle has also set a record lap time at the legendary Nurburgring track, further solidifying its position as a performance powerhouse.Xiaomi's entry into the luxury EV segment aligns with the growing trend of Chinese automakers challenging established brands. By offering a compelling blend of performance, technology, and affordability, Xiaomi aims to capture a significant share of the market. The company has already seen substantial success with its mainstream EV offerings, delivering over 10,000 vehicles per month since June.","Ford CEO has been driving the Xiaomi EV for 6 months and “doesn’t want to give it up” The SU7 Ultra boasts impressive specifications, including a top speed that surpasses thePorsche Taycan Turbo and acceleration that outperforms the Tesla Model S Plaid.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114791379,imgsize-92530,width-400,resizemode-4/114791379.jpg"

Base Salary: $2.5 million (more than Rs 21 crore)

Miscellaneous Compensation: $169,791 (approx. Rs 15 lakh)

What the filing said

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella saw a 63% increase in his salary for the financial year 2024. As revealed by the company in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, Nadella’s total compensation for the financial year that ended in June 30, amounted to approximately $79.1 million (around Rs 665 crore). This increase was mainly driven by the stock awards. The filing revealed that his stock awards increased to $71 million from $39 million the previous year.As per the SEC filing, Nadella’s cash incentive for fiscal year 2024 was $5.2 million. He was originally intended to get $10.7 million. The software giant's boss received $2.5 million as base salary and $170,000 in other compensation.The filing revealed that Nadella requested a pay cut this year on account of multiple cybersecurity breaches, including the Microsoft outage in July this year that impacted Windows users across the world. The US Department of Homeland Security in April published a report after an independent review of China’s breach of US government officials’ email accounts. Microsoft disclosed the incident in July 2023. In January, the tech giant confirmed that Russian intelligence had accessed some of its top executives’ email accounts.“Mr. Nadella agreed that the Company's performance was extremely strong, but reflecting on his personal commitment to security and his role as the CEO, asked the Board to consider departing from the established performance metrics and reduce his cash incentive to reflect his personal accountability for the focus and speed required for the changes that today's cybersecurity threat landscape showed were necessary,” the filing read.It said “Since the board of directors appointed Mr Nadella as the third chief executive officer in its history in 2014, Microsoft has nearly tripled revenue to $245.1 billion (approximately Rs 2,060 crore), nearly quadrupled net income to $88.1 billion (approximately Rs 740 crore), and more than quadrupled diluted earnings per share to $11.80 (approximately Rs 99 crore). In addition to another year of consistently strong financial performance, Mr Nadella and his leadership team have positioned Microsoft to continue to drive performance for years to come,”.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella saw a 63% increase in his salary for the financial year 2024.

It claimed that YouTube is experimenting with a new website layout that hides key information from users and the redesigned homepage removes both the upload date and view count from video previews, leaving only the thumbnail, title, and channel name visible.The report grabbed eyeballs with several content creators , including Marques Brownlee , also known as MKBHD, a popular tech YouTuber, saying, “Stop chasing Netflix and just be YouTube.” While some expressed that while removing view counts is acceptable, removing dates isn't ideal.The proposed changes to YouTube's homepage layout have sparked debate about their potential impact on content visibility. Some users worry that hiding view counts and upload dates could lead to viewers overlooking videos with lower engagement, while others argue that it could create a more level playing field for new creators by reducing the bias towards videos with high view counts.In response, YouTube clarified that it is due to extensions that the homepage experience is changed.@Dexerto Jumping in here to clarify that this may happen if viewers are watching YouTube with certain browser extensions enabled.

India wealth surge amid China’s decline in billionaires



Zhang Yiming vs. Mukesh Ambani

ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming leads China’s wealthiest individuals with a fortune of $49.3 billion, according to the latest Hurun China Rich List . This marks a significant achievement for Zhang, who has now overtaken Zhong Shanshan, chairperson of Nongfu Spring, who had held the top spot for three consecutive years. However, even as China’s richest billionaire, Yiming remains well behind India’s wealthiest individual, Mukesh Ambani , chairman of Reliance Industries , whose net worth exceeds $102 billion.Zhang, 44, achieved his wealth largely due to the success of ByteDance and its immensely popular app TikTok, which boasts over a billion active monthly users worldwide. The company saw its profits surge around 30% last year, underscoring its strong market position.Despite this, the Hurun Research Institute reports that the total wealth of Chinese entrepreneurs this year stands at $3 trillion, reflecting a 10% decline from the previous year. “The Hurun China Rich List has shrunk for the third consecutive year due to a challenging economic climate and stock market performance,” noted Rupert Hoogewerf, chairman and chief researcher of Hurun.This year’s list illustrates a significant shift in the profiles of the richest individuals in China. Unlike previous years when real estate developers dominated the rankings, the current list is predominantly composed of entrepreneurs from technology, consumer electronics, and new energy sectors. Hoogewerf emphasised that the stories of the individuals on the Hurun China Rich List reflect the changing narrative of the Chinese economy.Moreover, the new generation of Chinese entrepreneurs is becoming increasingly international in scope. Hoogewerf pointed out how Zhang Yiming has successfully globalised ByteDance with TikTok, and how Colin Huang has crafted Pinduoduo’s ascent as a global e-commerce player through the platform Temu.As the economic landscape continues to evolve, Zhang Yiming’s emergence as the richest person in China marks a significant milestone in the ongoing narrative of wealth creation and transformation in the region.In stark contrast to China’s declining billionaire count, India is witnessing a surge in wealth creation. The Hurun India Rich List has shown a 29% increase in billionaires this year, totaling 334. While China still leads with 753 billionaires, its count has decreased by 25%. This year’s China Rich List added only 54 new billionaires, the lowest figure in two decades, whereas India's list hit a new high with triple-digit increases across all major sectors.Zhang Yiming, at 41, has a net worth reported at $49.3 billion by Hurun, although Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index estimates it to be closer to $43 billion. As the founder of ByteDance, the parent company of the popular platforms Douyin and TikTok, Yiming’s enterprise achieved $110 billion in revenue last year, solidifying its standing in the tech industry.On the other hand, Mukesh Ambani's net worth has reached $102 billion, buoyed by a 25% increase over the past year. Reliance Industries has seen its stock surge, thanks to strategic investments in energy and retail, projected earnings growth, and recent price hikes in its telecom division, Jio."," ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming leads China’s wealthiest individuals with a fortune of $49.3 billion, according to the latest Hurun China Rich List.

Apple makes a comeback to China's top 5 smartphone vendors

iPhone-maker Apple is expected to announce its biggest quarterly revenue since 2022 in its upcoming Thursday report. According to Reuters, consumer interest in iPhones has shown stronger resilience late in the product cycle compared to previous years, particularly in the Chinese market.While the results will give investors the first hints of demand for the new iPhone 16 series, the key focus will be on executive commentary for its fiscal first quarter. There are concerns that the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence could weaken an expected AI-led ""super-cycle"" for Apple's biggest seller.The report quotes Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi who said “The strength of the iPhone 16 cycle is the most important question heading into both the December quarter and FY25. Investors should expect Apple to be upbeat about iPhone 16 and Apple Intelligence, but it may or may not necessarily reflect the ultimate success of the cycle.”The Cupertino-based company released a limited rollout of Apple Intelligence features this Monday, weeks after the iPhone 16 went on sale. “The limited rollout has raised worries that customers may push device purchases from the all-important holiday season to next year, delaying a potential boost to sales from AI,” the report says.Apple has bounced back to become China's second-largest smartphone vendor in the third quarter of 2024, following strong iPhone 16 sales. According to data released by IDC, the iPhone maker captured 15.6% of the Chinese smartphone market, trailing only Vivo's 18.6% market share. However, Apple's position remains precarious, with its market share declining from 16.1% in the same period last year and shipments dropping 0.3% year-over-year.Huawei's dramatic comeback poses a significant challenge to Apple's position, with the Chinese tech giant securing 15.3% market share and recording a 42% surge in shipments. This marks Huawei's fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, driven by the success of its domestically produced advanced processors and strong patriotic consumer sentiment.The competitive landscape has prompted Apple to offer additional promotions for the iPhone 16 in China, including discounts on popular online platforms like Pinduoduo and Taobao ahead of the Singles' Day shopping festival.","Apple is expected to announce its biggest quarterly revenue since 2022 in its upcoming Thursday report.

How Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger could not get 56-year old chipmaker's comeback plan right,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-could-not-get-56-year-old-chipmakers-comeback-plan-right/articleshow/114774485.cms,"TSMC partnership sours, AI opportunity missed

Manufacturing woes plague turnaround plans

CEO Gelsinger’s “painful news” to employees as chipmaker

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is “confident” about company’s “turnaround” plan

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger 's ambitious three-year effort to restore the 56-year-old American chipmaker to its former glory has faltered amid strategic blunders, manufacturing setbacks, and deepening financial losses, forcing the company to lay off 15,000 employees and fundamentally restructure its operations.Under Gelsinger's watch, Intel's revenue has plummeted to $54 billion in 2023, nearly one-third below when he took charge in 2021. The company now faces its first annual net loss since 1986, with analysts expecting a $3.68 billion deficit this year, Reuters has learned. The stock has crashed 66% from its peak during Gelsinger's early months as CEO.""This is painful news for me to share,"" Gelsinger wrote in a memo to employees. ""Our revenues have not grown as expected — and we've yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI.""One of Gelsinger's earliest missteps came just months into his tenure when he publicly questioned Taiwan's stability, offending crucial manufacturing partner TSMC. ""Taiwan is not a stable place,"" he declared at a tech conference in December 2021, according to sources familiar with the matter.The diplomatic blunder cost Intel dearly. TSMC withdrew a valuable 40% discount on its $23,000 3-nanometer wafers, significantly impacting Intel's profit margins on chips manufactured by the Taiwanese giant, Reuters reported.In the booming artificial intelligence sector, Gelsinger's optimistic public projections clashed with internal realities. While Intel teams estimated maximum AI chip sales of $500 million, Gelsinger pushed for public announcements of a $1 billion sales pipeline to match market expectations, sources told Reuters. The company later quietly revised its 2024 AI revenue target back to $500 million.The AI miscalculation extended to client relationships. Sources say Gelsinger oversaw a deal to build custom chips for Alphabet's Waymo self-driving taxis, personally discussing the agreement with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai . However, Intel later cancelled the project amid worsening financial conditions, paying a fee to Alphabet after it threatened legal action.Intel's ambitious 18A chip manufacturing process, central to Gelsinger's $60 billion foundry expansion strategy, has encountered significant obstacles. Early tests by potential customer Broadcom revealed disappointing results, with merely 20% of chips passing quality tests – far below industry standards.In response to these challenges, Intel announced a major restructuring of its foundry business as an independent subsidiary. The restructuring provides Intel Foundry with ""clearer separation and independence"" from the parent company, including its own operating board and separate financial reporting.Gelsinger indicated this structure would allow ""flexibility to evaluate independent sources of funding"" for the struggling foundry business, which posted operating losses of $7 billion in 2023 and another $2.8 billion in the latest quarter.While Intel secured a significant win with a multiyear, multibillion-dollar agreement with Amazon Web Services to produce an ""artificial intelligence fabric chip"" using the 18A process, other major potential clients including Apple and Qualcomm have declined to use the technology, sources familiar with their decisions told Reuters.The manufacturing challenges have forced Intel to pause construction of new chip plants in Germany and Poland for approximately two years, citing ""anticipated market demand.""""All eyes will remain on us,"" Gelsinger acknowledged, emphasising the importance of the restructuring and new partnerships in Intel's turnaround efforts. However, a recent supplier document indicates further delays in the 18A technology's rollout, with customers having little prospect of high-volume production until 2026.""This is painful news for me to share,"" Gelsinger wrote to employees. ""We must align our cost structure with our new operating model and fundamentally change the way we operate. We will reduce layers, eliminate overlapping areas of responsibility, stop non-essential work.""The cost-cutting measures have extended globally, reaching as far as Intel's Israeli operations, where even basic employee benefits are being eliminated. In a telling sign of the depth of cuts, Israeli employees recently arrived at work to find empty kitchen stations and a notice announcing the end of complimentary beverage services. Vehicle benefits for senior employees have also been cut, effectively reducing some salaries by 10%.In a dramatic reversal of strategy, Intel is now exploring the sale of a minority stake in Altera, its programmable chip subsidiary, seeking a deal that values the unit at around $17 billion. This represents a significant shift for Intel, which acquired Altera for $16.7 billion in 2015 and had, as recently as last month, described it as core to the company's future. Intel is also shutting down Granulate, a startup it acquired for $650 million less than three years ago, as part of its transformation process.The stark reality of Intel's situation is evident in its staffing numbers. ""Our annual revenue in 2020 was about $24 billion higher than it was last year, yet our current workforce is actually 10% larger now than it was then,"" Gelsinger acknowledged in his memo to staff. ""There are a lot of reasons for this, but it's not a sustainable path forward.""The company's restructuring efforts extend beyond personnel cuts. Intel announced plans to reduce its global real estate footprint by about two-thirds and pause construction of new chip plants in Germany and Poland for approximately two years. However, the company will continue with its US manufacturing projects in Arizona, Oregon, New Mexico, and Ohio, supported by $3 billion in funding from the CHIPS Act.Despite the setbacks, Gelsinger maintains his characteristic optimism about Intel's turnaround prospects. ""I'm very confident that we're going to pull it off,"" he told Reuters in August. ""Three years in, yeah. This one's going to happen, baby.""However, with Intel now the worst-performing tech stock in the S&P 500 this year and facing intense competition in both AI and traditional chip markets, the company's path to recovery remains uncertain.","Intel's revenue has plummeted to $54 billion in 2023, nearly one-third below when he took charge in 2021.

As online grocery platforms like Zomato's Blinkit gain traction by offering rapid delivery services for festive purchases, a troubling incident has emerged from Delhi. Mohit Jain, a resident of the city, claims he was scammed while ordering gold and silver coins for Dhanteras , a significant occasion for buying precious metals. Despite the promise of a swift 10-minute delivery, Jain alleges that he received a 0.5-gram gold coin instead of the one-gram coin he ordered.This incident has not only raised questions about the reliability of such services but also sparked outrage among customers regarding Blinkit's customer support and the accuracy of their deliveries, prompting a broader conversation about consumer protection in the burgeoning quick-commerce sector.Sharing his ordeal on social media platform X, Mohit stated, “I got scammed by Blinkit.

Since I wasn’t home to receive the delivery, I provided my younger brother with the OTP to collect it.”Upon returning home about 20 minutes later, Mohit was shocked to discover the wrong item had been delivered. He explained, “When I checked, I found that I received a 0.5-gram Malabar gold coin (rose design) instead of the one-gram Mata Lakshmi gold coin I ordered.”Frustrated by the situation, Mohit noted that by the time he got home, the return window had closed, preventing him from contacting customer support. “I called the delivery person and was nearly in tears while explaining the situation,” he shared.Despite the delivery partner having photographic evidence of the correct one-gram coin that was supposed to be delivered, Mohit reported that the delivery person stated he could do nothing about the error.Mohit also emphasised that CCTV footage corroborated his claim, showing that the incorrect item had been delivered. Accompanying his tweet, he posted a picture of the 0.5-gram gold coin he received and screenshots of his order details.According to his order confirmation, Mohit had purchased a 24 kt, one-gram Goddess Lakshmi gold coin but instead received a 0.5-gram coin with a rose design. He had also ordered a 10-gram Laxmi Ganesh silver coin, both listed under Malabar Gold & Diamonds. In his communication with Blinkit's customer support, Mohit received a message stating, “We are sorry. The complaint window for the selected item(s) is closed.” An automated response suggested that he provide feedback on the issue to help improve their services.The incident has sparked a wave of reactions on social media, with users expressing their frustration with Blinkit's service. One user wrote, ""Blinkit is a scam these days. Their customer care is a complete joke. Avoid ordering expensive items from them."" Another user questioned, “What is this behaviour?” while a third urged, “Blinkit, please look into this.” A fourth user vented, ""Have some shame, corporate greed!""","Mohit Jain claims he was scammed while ordering gold and silver coins for Dhanteras.

In a shocking case of online fraud a 59-year old retired principal from a prestigious engineering college in Hyderabad lost a huge sum of Rs 8.1 crore.Resident of Hyderabad, Chennupati Vijayakumar became a victim of an elaborate investment scheme scam. Vijayakumar began transferring funds through a fraudulent investment app called RK Global in July 2024. The app initially allowed him to withdraw a small sum, creating a sense of legitimacy. However, subsequent attempts to withdraw larger amounts were met with failure, despite the app showing the funds as available. When Vijayakumar inquired about this discrepancy, the app's supposed customer care service advised him to pay a further 2% of his total investment, amounting to a staggering Rs 37.5 crore.Realising he had been duped, Vijayakumar filed a complaint with the Telangana State Cyber Security Bureau on October 21.According to the police complaint filed by Vijayakumar, he first received a call from a woman in July 2024. The woman claimed to work for a company called ' SIG Group ' and invited him to join a WhatsApp group named 'SIG Trading'.Vijaykumar joined the WhatsApp group and participated in online trading sessions led by 'SIG Group Teacher' Eric Robertson and his assistant, Lyons. The group provided regular updates on market trends, block trades, and IPO opportunities, gradually persuading Vijayakumar to invest.On July 15, Vijayakumar was added to another WhatsApp group, 'E26-RK Global Customer Care.' Here, he received trading advice and IPO recommendations through the 'RK Global' app, provided by the scammers. The fraudsters claimed to have connections with 'institutional investors' and promised guaranteed IPO allotments, luring Vijayakumar with the prospect of substantial profits.After this, Vijaykumar started transferring funds through the RK Global totalling over Rs 8.1 crore till October 3. Initially, Vijayakumar was able to withdraw a small amount of Rs 2,000. However, subsequent withdrawal attempts, though displayed as successful on the app, did not reflect in his bank account. When he raised concerns with RK Global's customer care, he was instructed to pay 2% of his total balance, amounting to Rs 37.5 crore, to resolve the issue. Despite facing financial difficulties, Vijayakumar was pressured to pay Rs 75 lakh in multiple transactions. However, the withdrawal issues persisted.After facing repeated demands for more payments, Vijayakumar became suspicious. An online search confirmed his doubts, leading him to report the incident to the cybercrime helpline on October 18.","Chennupati Vijayakumar, a 59-year-old retired principal from a prestigious engineering college in Hyderabad lost a huge sum of Rs 8.1 crore.

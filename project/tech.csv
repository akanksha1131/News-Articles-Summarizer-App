Bill Gates and Melinda Gates divorce





Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever. According to a report in Forbes, the amount has surfaced in a tax filing. As per the report Bill Gates donation skyrocketed Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation's assets by more than 1,000% to about $7.4 billion in 2024. As the number went up from $604 million at the end of 2023 to $7.4 billion.The $7.88 billion donation was made in 2024 to the Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation, according to a newly released tax filing reviewed by the New York Times’ DealBook. Philanthropies Foundation focuses on women and families. The tax filing is said to mark the first time that concrete financial terms of the Gates’ 2021 divorce have been made public. Melinda Gates also manages some of her investments and charitable work through Pivotal Ventures, the investment company founded in 2015.Bill Gates and Melinda Gates announced their decision to formally separate their philanthropic work in 2024, three years after their divorce became public.In May 2024, Melinda French Gates said that she leaving the charitable foundation she co-founded with Bill Gates more than 20 years ago. Her last day at the foundation was June 7, 2024.""Under the terms of my agreement with Bill, in leaving the foundation, I will have an additional $12.5 billion to commit to my work on behalf of women and families,"" Melinda Gates said then in a post on social media platform X, without disclosing more details about her plans. Post her departure as co-chair, the foundation changed its name to Gates Foundation and with Bill Gates as its sole chairperson. It’s unclear where the additional $4.6 billion was allocated. The funds could have been given to French Gates’ LLC, Pivotal, which does not file a tax return, according to DealBook. As running alongside Pivotal Philanthropies is Pivotal Ventures, a LLC that does not require disclosure requirements that govern traditional nonprofits.""I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,"" Bill Gates wrote in a post on X.In May 2021, Bill and Melinda French Gates announced their intention to divorce, saying they no longer believed they could “grow together”. Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board in 2020, months before the divorce was announced. The couple also reportedly agreed to the division of real estate valued at more than $170 million, an art collection worth roughly $130 million and a significant block of Microsoft stock.In March 2022, Melinda Gates claimed that Jeffrey Epstein played a role in ending their 27-year marriage. During an appearance on “CBS Mornings,” Melinda shared that she decided to leave her marriage “for many things,” including her ex-husband’s ties to Epstein. “I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” she said at the time, adding that she only met the late pedophile once because she “wanted to see who” he was.","Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever.

Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan on why Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin ‘can’t stay in California’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/y-combinator-ceo-garry-tan-on-why-google-founders-larry-page-and-sergey-brin-cant-stay-in-california/articleshow/126464584.cms,"Larry and Sergey can’t stay in California since the wealth tax as written would confiscate 50% of their Alphabet shares. Each own ~3% of Alphabet's stock, worth about $120 billion each at today's ~$4 trillion market cap,” Tan said.

“But because their shares have 10x voting power, the SEIU-UHW California billionaire tax would treat them as owning 30% of Alphabet (3% × 10 = 30%). That means each founder's taxable wealth would be $1.2 trillion.

A 5% wealth tax on $1.2 trillion = $60 billion tax bill, each.

That's 50% of their actual Alphabet holdings—wiped out by a ""5%"" tax.

What the ‘controversial’ tax section says



Section 50303(c)(3)(C) of the

2026 Billionaire Tax Act

states: ""For any interests that confer voting or other direct control rights, the percentage of the business entity owned by the taxpayer shall be presumed to be not less than the taxpayer's percentage of the overall voting or other direct control rights.""

This means if a founder holds shares representing only 3% of economic interest but 30% of voting control (through Class B supervoting shares), the tax would presume their ownership stake is at least 30% for valuation purposes, not 3%.

The wealth tax is poorly defined and designed to drive tech innovation out of California.

The law is so poorly written. While the lawyers who drafted it claim it doesn’t apply to publicly traded shares, they designed a legal trap where Class B voting shares would count as private shares and therefore considered ownership.

It’s so dishonest.

Garry Tan says law created to captured as much tax as possible







Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have officially shifted their base out of California, effectively beating the deadline for a proposed “wealth tax” aimed at the state's ultra-wealthy. While chief executives like Jensen Huang has said that he has ‘no problem’ with it, Garry Tan, CEO of startup accelerator Y Combinator, issued an explanation why both Google executives could not have stayed in California.In a string of posts on X, Tan said that they have been forced to flee California to avoid a tax bill that could “confiscate” half of their wealth. Tan argues that a specific provision regarding voting rights creates a “legal trap” that would artificially inflate the taxable value of tech founders' holdings by hundreds of billions of dollars.Under Section 50303(c)(3)(C) of the new Act, the tax valuation is not based on economic value alone, but on “voting or other direct control rights.” Since the founders hold Class B “supervoting” shares, this grant them 10x voting power, the law presumes their ownership stake is 30% for tax purposes, rather than 3%.Tan also pointed out another phrase, calling the tax act a means to extant as much tax as possible from California billionaires.The specific tell is this passage in the text: “provisions of this Part shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes”. In other words capture as much tax as possible.","Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have officially shifted their base out of California, effectively beating the deadline for a proposed “wealth tax” aimed at the state's ultra-wealthy.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has shared concerns about how artificial intelligence (AI) may change the structure of software teams. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Vembu said that AI is making senior software architects more productive, but at the same time it is also reducing the need for junior engineers. This shift, he warns, could impact how future architects are trained. In the post, Sridhar Vembu further writes that senior architects today need to understand both technical requirements and the full technology stack to guide AI tools effectively and refine their output.“AI makes senior architects more productive and reduces the need for junior engineers,” he writes in the post, adding “The architect needs to understand the requirements as well as the technology stack well, to be able to guide the AI and fine tune its output”.“But if we don't have junior engineers, we don't get to train the next generation of architects - after all how does someone become a software architect without being a junior engineer first? I am still thinking through how this gets resolved,” he further says.Vembu’s comments reflect a broader debate in the technology sector, where AI tools such as coding assistants and autonomous agents are increasingly taking over tasks that were traditionally assigned to junior engineers.Experts have raised concerns about AI’s potential to reshape how technical careers begin.Vembu’s post has triggered discussion among engineers and social media users. Replying to his post, one user writes: “We still have some programmers who understand assembly languages. I think there will always be some engineers who would want to dig deeper. I think demand will play its role.”“Change the career ladder, not the headcount. Keep juniors, but redefine their role: AI-augmented engineers, not manual coders. Move juniors earlier into design, reviews, system thinking, and trade-off discussions while AI handles boilerplate,” suggested another.“With AI, all the unsolved problems of the intermittent steps become viable business problems. Hence new markets open to entrepreneurs for those middle step problems. Thats how we will see waves of new age entrepreneurs with many solopreneurs,” a third user commented.","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has shared concerns about how artificial intelligence (AI) may change the structure of software teams.

The Canadian government is not looking to ban Elon Musk-owned microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) in the country. Evan Solomon, MP for Toronto Centre and Minister of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation has clarified the same in an X post. “Contrary to media reports, Canada is not considering a ban of X,” Solomon wrote, quoting his earlier post where he said that the Canadian government is planning to introduce a bill to amend Criminal laws of the country to include deepfakes.“Deepfake sexual abuse is violence. We must protect Canadians, especially women and young people, from exploitation. Platforms and AI developers have a duty to prevent this harm,” Evan Solomon wrote in his previous X post.He further added: “Our government is continuing to advance responsible AI, including introducing Bill C-16, the Protecting Victims Act, to amend the Criminal Code to include deepfakes as intimate images for the offence of publication of an intimate image without consent. We will keep Canadians safe by amending the criminal code and holding abusers accountable.”Elon Musk’s X and Grok – the AI chatbot integrated into X have recently faced criticism for creating explicit images of users – especially women and children without consent.The crisis has prompted governments around the world to consider regulatory action against the social media platform, including India, US and UK.Recently, three US Senators sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai asking them to “immediately remove” Grok and X from their app stores respectively. The letter reviewed by CNBC was signed by US senators Ron Wyden of Oregon, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, and Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico who called on the tech giants to “immediately remove the X and Grok apps from their app stores until the company's Chief Executive Officer, Elon Musk, addresses these disturbing and likely illegal activities. ”In the letter, the senators said that the apps currently allow users to generate and distribute illegal content, adding that ignoring X's serious violations would make Apple and Google's content moderation practices meaningless.Commenting on the news, Elon Musk replied sharply stating “The real reason is that they hate free speech”.","The Canadian government is not looking to ban Elon Musk-owned microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) in the country.

While billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are focused on building rockets to reach space and other planets, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt is exploring a different way to reach stars – by building the “eyes” to see it. According to a report by The New York Times, Schmidt Sciences – a part of the Schmidts’ philanthropic efforts – unveiled a plan at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society to disrupt the field of astrophysics.Through their philanthropic organisation, Eric and Wendy Schmidt are financing four advanced instruments known collectively as the Schmidt Observatory System, with a to rival the capabilities of NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope within a four-year time frame.Schmidt’s strategy is different from decade-long missions of federal agencies like NASA as the foundation is focussed at creating instruments with three-to-five-year “experimental” lifespans. The projects largely take technologies already available. For example, they take high-performance computer chips with advanced AI capabilities and utilise them in novel ways to offer new capabilities to astronomers.“This is an experiment in accelerating astrophysics discovery,” said Arpita Roy, the lead of the Astrophysics and Space Institute at Schmidt Sciences, adding, “We accept much more risk”, which is “calibrated, thoughtful.”The observatory system will have four distinct projects designed to work in unison, targeting specific cosmic mysteries like dark energy and exploding stars.An orbital observer with a mirror slightly larger than Hubble's.A ground-based system in Texas consisting of 1,200 small telescopes.A massive radio survey in Nevada utilising 1,650 radio dishes.A ground-based optical array designed to measure the spectra (colours) of distant stars and planets, helping scientists identify the chemical makeup of atmospheres in other solar systems.“We think that we should operate these experiments for defined useful lifetimes and then move on to the next exciting thing,” Dr. Roy was quoted as saying.According to the foundation, the Lazuli mirror was downsized because of the ""malleable"" schedule of Elon Musk’s Starship.“Starship schedules are malleable. We will revisit that in the future,” said Stuart Feldman, president of Schmidt Sciences.",Eric and Wendy Schmidt are financing four advanced instruments known collectively as the Schmidt Observatory System.

Cloudflare CEO to Italy: You have no right to regulate what is and is not allowed on Internet outside your borders; calls Elon Musk right; read the wrong 'angry note',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/cloudflare-ceo-to-italy-you-have-no-right-to-regulate-what-is-and-is-not-allowed-on-internet-outside-your-borders-calls-elon-musk-right-read-the-wrong-angry-note/articleshow/126442657.cms,"Cloudflare CEO's complete X post slamming Italy





Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince is very upset with Italy. The reason is $17 million fine imposed on the company for defying Piracy Shield, a censorship tool lacking due process. Earlier this week, Italy’s communications regulator, AGCOM, slapped the San Francisco-based internet infrastructure giant with a €14 million ($17 million) fine for refusing to comply with the country’s Piracy Shield system. The penalty, the first major enforcement under a 2023 Italian law. Piracy Shield reportedly mandates that domain-name system providers like Cloudflare block access to websites accused of hosting pirated content within 30 minutes of notification from rights holders -- without court orders, appeals, or transparency. In a series of posts on X, formerly Twitter, Cloudflare CEO lashed out at Italy. “No judicial oversight. No due process. No appeal. No transparency,” he wrote, highlighting risks to even Cloudflare’s own 1.1.1.1 public DNS resolver.He further complained that the fine imposed is calculated as up to 2% of Cloudflare’s global revenue despite the company’s mere $8 million in Italian sales in 2024. Italy’s move comes amid rising European pressures on American technology companies that the Donald Trump government has been protesting over.Pointing to the same, Cloudflare CEO thanked US VP JD Vance and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.Yesterday a quasi-judicial body in Italy fined @Cloudflare $17 million for failing to go along with their scheme to censor the Internet. The scheme, which even the EU has called concerning, required us within a mere 30 minutes of notification to fully censor from the Internet any sites a shadowy cabal of European media elites deemed against their interests. No judicial oversight. No due process. No appeal. No transparency. It required us to not just remove customers, but also censor our 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver meaning it risked blacking out any site on the Internet. And it required us not just to censor the content in Italy but globally. In other words, Italy insists a shadowy, European media cabal should be able to dictate what is and is not allowed online.That, of course, is DISGUSTING and even before yesterday’s fine we had multiple legal challenges pending against the underlying scheme. We, of course, will now fight the unjust fine. Not just because it’s wrong for us but because it is wrong for democratic values.In addition, we are considering the following actions: 1) discontinuing the millions of dollars in pro bono cyber security services we are providing the upcoming Milano-Cortina Olympics; 2) discontinuing Cloudflare’s Free cyber security services for any Italy-based users; 3) removing all servers from Italian cities; and 4) terminating all plans to build an Italian Cloudflare office or make any investments in the country.Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. While there are things I would handle differently than the current U.S. administration, I appreciate @JDVance taking a leadership role in recognizing this type of regulation is a fundamental unfair trade issue that also threatens democratic values. And in this case @ElonMusk is right: #FreeSpeech is critical and under attack from an out-of-touch cabal of very disturbed European policy makers.I will be in DC first thing next week to discuss this with U.S. administration officials and I’ll be meeting with the IOC in Lausanne shortly after to outline the risk to the Olympic Games if @Cloudflare withdraws our cyber security protection.In the meantime, we remain happy to discuss this with Italian government officials who, so far, have been unwilling to engage beyond issuing fines. We believe Italy, like all countries, has a right to regulate the content on networks inside its borders. But they must do so following the Rule of Law and principles of Due Process. And Italy certainly has no right to regulate what is and is not allowed on the Internet in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, China, Brazil, India or anywhere outside its borders.THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FIGHT AND WE WILL WIN!!!","Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince is very upset with Italy.

Elon Musk on Nvidia’s Rubin AI chip





Nvidia has unveiled its next-generation AI computing platform, called Vera Rubin, at the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026 in Las Vegas. The announcement was made by Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang, who said the new platform is now in full production. Rubin is designed to support large-scale artificial intelligence workloads and is aimed at data centres, cloud providers and enterprises building advanced AI systems. Nvidia said the platform is built to lower the cost of AI computing and support faster training and deployment of AI models. Rubin succeeds Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture and is part of the company’s broader push to expand AI use across industries.Vera Rubin is Nvidia’s first six-chip AI platform developed using an “extreme codesign” approach, where multiple components are designed together. The platform includes Rubin GPUs, Vera CPUs, NVLink 6 networking, Spectrum-X Ethernet Photonics, ConnectX-9 networking cards and BlueField-4 data processing units. Nvidia said this design helps reduce bottlenecks and improve performance for large AI workloads.The Rubin GPU delivers up to 50 petaflops of inference performance using NVFP4 precision. The Vera CPU is designed to handle data movement and AI agent processing tasks. Nvidia said the platform is built to support large-scale AI training and inference more efficiently.According to Nvidia, the Rubin platform can reduce the cost of generating AI tokens to about one-tenth of previous platforms. The company also introduced an AI-focused storage system called Inference Context Memory Storage, which is designed to improve long-context AI processing by increasing speed and efficiency.Nvidia said the Rubin platform will be used alongside its open AI models and software tools to support applications in areas such as autonomous driving, robotics, healthcare and climate research.The announcement was shared by an X user Sawyer Merritt who also shared a video of the chip maker’s next-generation Rubin chips. Responding to the post, Musk said “It will take another 9 months or so before the hardware is operational at scale and the software works well”, highlighting deployment realities beyond raw power claims.","Vera Rubin is Nvidia’s first six-chip AI platform developed using an “extreme codesign” approach, where multiple components are designed together.

Microsoft CEO 'Thrilled' About India's Growing Data Centre Capacity, Details Meet With PM Modi





OpenAI cofounder disagrees with CEO Sam Altman on AGI timeline





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently shared what he sees as a key test for the next stage of artificial intelligence (AI). As companies race to build AI agents that can act independently, Suleyman said he is watching for a milestone he calls Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI) on the path toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). He said that the test is simple in context but difficult in execution – whether an AI agent can legally take $1,00,000 and turn it into $1 million. He described the test as “modern turing test”, suggesting it will show how AI systems can plan, reason, make decisions and operate within real-word rules.“The next big milestone I'm watching for on our way to AGI: Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI). Can an agent take $100k and legally turn it into $1M? To me that's the modern Turing Test,” Mustafa Suleyman wrote in a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter).Suleyman’s comments come as several technology leaders including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff bet heavily on AI agents as the next major shift in enterprise software. Companies such as OpenAI, Salesforce, Microsoft and others are promoting agents that can carry out tasks with limited human input, from writing code to managing business workflows.Last year, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff called the rise of AI in the workforce a “digital labor revolution,” estimating that the software company has reached about 93% accuracy with the technology.In an interview with Bloomberg then, he revealed that AI is doing up to 50% of the work at Salesforce.In 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicted that AI could soon automate up to 40% of the tasks humans currently perform. He also claimed that AGI could arrive before 2030.Recently, OpenAI cofounder and AI researcher Andrej Karpathy pushed back against the “agentic AI” hype, characterizing the current generation of autonomous AI systems as “slop.” Karpathy has directly challenged the notion that autonomous AI agents are on the cusp of delivering as promised, positioning himself in contrast to the optimistic timelines often suggested by figures like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.“I feel like the industry is making too big of a jump and is trying to pretend like this is amazing, and it’s not. It’s slop,"" Karpathy said on The Dwarkesh Podcast.“They’re not coming to terms with it, and maybe they’re trying to fundraise or something like that. We’re at this intermediate stage,” he added.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman proposes a new test for advanced AI: can an agent legally grow $100,000 into $1 million?

""Right after we acquired Blinkit, I asked him (Albinder) to leave. I told him, 'You will not be able to cut it.' He said okay. This happened twice during that timeframe, and we started the transition,""

""All of us have this armour. And when patient coaching runs out, I penetrate this armour. Me being angry is also because I care,""

What is Eternal CEO Deepinder Goyal said about ‘rock bottom phase’



""rock bottom""

""I call this rock bottom, where I hurt people, their self-confidence completely goes for a toss. I do this with people who I think have insane potential, but something in their head is coming in their way,

""

""Over time, the success rate of this is four out of five, where they come out of it,”





Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO of Zomato 's parent company Eternal, has revealed that he asked Albinder Dhindsa to step down from his role twice shortly after the food delivery service acquired Blinkit. Goyal explained that this move was part of his tough leadership reset method. Speaking on a video podcast with Raj Shamani, Goyal noted that these conversations took place soon after the acquisition of the quick commerce startup, when Dhindsa was struggling to adapt to the changes required after the integration.Goyal said on the podcast.These remarks offer a rare public look at how Goyal handles senior leadership changes at Eternal, which owns both Zomato and Blinkit, especially when founders or top executives need to adapt to a new company structure after an acquisition. Goyal explained his leadership style involves extended periods of coaching, but if no progress is made, he confronts the person directly.he noted.The situation reveals the challenges that can arise when successful startup founders join larger organisations through acquisitions and must adjust their working style to fit the new company's expectations.Describing what he calls aphase, Goyal said he sometimes purposely breaks down a leader's confidence to make them start fresh.he explained.According to Goyal, this method has worked most of the time.he added.However, Goyal did not confirm whether Dhindsa's job or duties officially changed during this time. Still, his comments show how intense the process was of bringing Blinkit into Eternal, especially as the company was growing both Blinkit and Zomato while facing more competition in quick commerce.Zomato bought Blinkit, which was previously known as Grofers, in 2022 for Rs 4,447 crore, or about $568 million at the time, in an all-stock deal. This marked Zomato's official entry into India's rapidly growing quick commerce business. Since buying the company, Blinkit has become a key growth area for Eternal, opening many new stores and handling more and more orders.","Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO of Zomato's parent company Eternal, has revealed that he asked Albinder Dhindsa to step down from his role twice shortly after the acquisition of Blinkit.

EXPOSED: Mark Zuckerberg Embarrassed on Hot Mic Admitting Total Confusion During Trump Dinner





Ever since Mark Zuckerberg announced the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs in first half of 2025, Meta CEO has been on an AI hiring blitz. A Twitter user who goes by the moniker @HinataMotivates, said to be a tech-motivation account, shared a podcast clip (going back to 2022) where Zuckerberg talks about Meta hiring rule and his advice for college students. Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone and the one that he says is also an important tip for any college student. In an episode of the “Lex Fridman Podcast,” hosted by MIT computer scientist Lex Fridman, Zuckerberg said that most people know Facebook ’s dorm-room origin story and that many have learned the wrong lesson from it. He said that his initial ability to launch Facebook wasn’t because he dropped out of college. According to Zuckerberg, it was due to the personal connections he made while he was still in school.Who you spend time with in college, Zuckerberg said, is “the most important decision” any student can make in college. He advised college students that choosing their social circle is the most pivotal decision, as people tend to emulate those around them. “You become the people you surround yourself with,” he said in the podcast.“I think probably people are too, in general, objective focused, and maybe not focused enough on the connections and the people who they’re basically building relationships [with]. ” Meta CEO Zuckerberg is said to have met his Facebook co-founders ⁠— Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Andrew McCollum ⁠— while the five were students at Harvard University.While the group split up in a not-so-happy manner, Zuckerberg said on the podcast that he tries to prioritize relationships over objectives. This applies especially to hiring. Zuckerberg said that he extends the idea to his Meta hiring philosophy: He only employs candidates he did hypothetically work for, underscoring reciprocity and alignment in professional networks. When evaluating a job candidate, he imagines what it would be like to work for that person. “I will only hire someone to work for me if I can see myself working for them,” he said.Mark Zuckerberg said that the strategy creates a work environment that’s both more cohesive and more productive: If you work with people who share your values on a human level, you’ll be more likely to smoothly achieve your work goals together. It’s all about finding personal compatibility, he said, not unlike “choosing friends or a partner.”","Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone.

""what we think is cool

""a bit of a people pleaser, so it's always in the back of my mind that we have a lot of fans now, and they have certain expectations and certain feelings towards the game.""

""be lying if I said that I didn't think about that at all,""

“Creatively, we've always let our North Star be our own personal taste in terms of what we think is cool, what it is we enjoy and want to see. I've seen too many TV shows and books be swayed trying to please a lot of people, and in the process you end up losing the heart of what's there. So [we] feel like we need to trust our instincts and continue to trust the vision behind the studio,”

""it's not going to be big, it's going to be cool,""

""it's a weird feeling, when you put your heart out into the world and the world embraces it and gives you so much love back.""





The studio behind Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Sandfall Interactive, has acknowledged that it is feeling some pressure for its next project. However, the developers of the game, which was the biggest third-party launch on Xbox Game Pass in 2025, noted that they will prioritise their creative vision over fan expectations. Sandfall Interactive's debut Japanese Role-Playing Game (JRPG) became 2025's surprise hit, sweeping awards shows and building a large fan base, making it the biggest new third-party launch on Xbox Game Pass in 2025 based on unique users in its first 30 days.Speaking in an interview with Edge magazine for issue 419, Sandfall Interactive chief operating officer and production director François Meurisse acknowledged the pressure surrounding the team's next game, explaining thatfrom fans and critics, but addedhe explained.The comments suggest Sandfall Interactive plans to maintain its creative independence despite the commercial and critical success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.

California’s lawmakers are advancing the Billionaire Tax Act which could impose a one-time 5% levy on residents worth over $1 billion. If the measure secures enough signatures, it will appear on the November 2026 ballot. If the California wealth tax gets approved then a tax would apply retroactively to residents as of January 1, 2026. Attorney’s for wealth clines have warned Governor Gavin Newsom that the Billionaire wealth tax proposal could lead to an ‘exodus of capital and innovation’ from the state.According to Forbes data compiled by Americans for Tax Fairness and reported by Business Insider, as of January 2026, around 214 to 241 billionaires live in California. Which is more than any other US state. Tech leaders dominate the list, including Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg, Jensen Huang, Eric Schmidt, and Elon Musk, alongside figures from real estate, entertainment, and finance.Due to the California Wealth tax Larry Page and Sergy Brin have moved entities out of California ahead of the deadline. On the other hand, Nvidia CEO Jensen Hunag is all ok with the tax. However, Palmer Luckey the founder of Andruil, has warned that this tax would force companies to “pivot into profit obsession over mission or long‑term sustainability.”","summarize: Here’s a list of 200-plus billionaires who the proposed Wealth tax could hit.

This move follows xAI's use of Claude via the coding tool Cursor, which Anthropic states violates terms prohibiting the development of competing AI products.

xAI's Cursor usage violated competitive restrictions

Anthropic's block on xAI aligns with wider enforcement against third-party tools





Anthropic has cut off access to its Claude AI models for developers at xAI, Elon Musk 's competing AI lab, according to an internal email sent this week by xAI cofounder Tony Wu to his team.""Hi team, I believe many of you have already discovered that Anthropic models are not responding on Cursor,"" Wu wrote on Wednesday, as first reported by tech journalist Kylie Robison. ""According to Cursor this is a new policy Anthropic is enforcing for all its major competitors.""The block came after xAI staff had been using Claude models through Cursor, a popular AI-powered coding tool, to accelerate their own development work. Wu acknowledged the hit to productivity but framed it as motivation: ""We will get a hit on productivity, but it rly pushes us to develop our own coding product / models.""The restriction appears rooted in Anthropic's commercial terms, which explicitly prohibit customers from using its services to ""build a competing product or service, including to train competing AI models."" While Cursor itself is a legitimate development tool, xAI's specific use of Claude through the platform apparently triggered the enforcement action.This isn't the first time Anthropic has wielded its terms of service against rivals. Last August, the company revoked OpenAI 's API access under similar circumstances, and in June 2025, it limited access for the coding environment Windsurf after reports emerged of a potential sale to OpenAI.The xAI block comes as Anthropic simultaneously tightened technical safeguards against third-party tools spoofing its Claude Code client to access models at consumer subscription rates rather than metered API pricing.

Here’s what Demis Hassabis wrote in the post:

Alleviating email overload with AI has been on my personal wishlist for a very long time. Excited to see these features rolling out - powered by Gemini. A fantastic example of how AI can be helpful in everyday life!

Google supercharges Gmail with AI





Google recently integrated the Gemini 3 AI model into Gmail. Announcing the update, CEO Sundar Pichai shared an X post writing: “We launched Gmail on April Fool’s Day in 2004. 20+ years later, we’re bringing Gmail into the Gemini era. AI Overviews, Suggested personalized replies, Proof read, AI Inbox with new streamlined views and suggested topics to catch-up on and loads more”. Now, Google AI CEO and Nobel Laureate Demis Hassabis has replied to Pichai’s post saying the AI integration into Gmail has been on his “personal wishlist for a long time”. Hassabis further said this is a “fantastic example of how AI can be helpful in everyday life”.As announced by the company, Gmail is getting AI features like AI overviews, automated drafting and proofreading, and AI-powered inbox. Explaining how AI overviews work in Gmail, the company said in a blog post: “Just like they do in Google Search, AI Overviews turn information into answers without the digging. When you open an email with dozens of replies, Gmail synthesizes the entire conversation into a concise summary of key points. ” AI Overview conversation summaries are available to all users for free. The ability to ask your inbox questions with AI Overviews is available to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers.The tech giant has also expanded ‘Help me write’ tool to include features such as ‘Help me write’, ‘Suggested replies’ and ‘Proofread’. As announced by Google, Help Me Write and Suggested Replies are rolling out to everyone at no cost, while the Proofread feature is available for Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers.Lastly, AI Inbox is like having a personalized briefing, highlighting to-dos and catching you up on what matters. It helps you prioritize, identifying your VIPs based on signals like people you email frequently, those in your contacts list and relationships it can infer from message content.","Gmail is getting AI features like AI overviews, automated drafting and proofreading, and AI-powered inbox.

""These three will not go away,""





Michael Burry is betting against Oracle. The investor, who is also known from the movie “The Big Short,” has revealed bearish positions against the company founded by Larry Ellison after its recent expansion into artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. In a latest Substack post, Burry revealed that he holds put options on Oracle shares and has directly shorted the stock over the last six months. This comes after he previously disclosed bearish bets against AI chipmaker Nvidia and Palantir Technologies in November.Burry wrote when asked why he bet against Nvidia and not Oracle.Oracle has been aggressively expanding into cloud computing services, requiring a costly buildout of data centre capacity funded by debt. The company has about $95 billion of debt outstanding, making it the largest corporate issuer outside the financial sector in the Bloomberg high-grade index. In September 2025, Oracle signed a $300 billion, five-year cloud computing deal with the Sam Altman-led OpenAI , under which the ChatGPT maker will purchase computing power from Oracle starting in 2027.While the agreement represents a win for Oracle in the cloud market, it brings execution risks and capital demands.Oracle shares have since been volatile. The stock jumped 36% in a single session in September after an optimistic forecast for its cloud business. Still, those gains faded as investors focused on rising capital expenditures and debt linked to data centre expansion. Oracle finished 2025 about 40% below its September peak.Michael Burry on why he avoids betting against Google, Microsoft and MetaBurry became famous for betting against the US housing market during the 2008 financial crisis. He said he has avoided betting against larger technology companies whose businesses go beyond just AI, such as Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Microsoft.Burry wrote.He said those companies will likely reduce their spending over time, take losses from building too much capacity, and lower the value of some assets on their books. However, they will remain dominant in their main businesses.he added.However, he said that he would bet against OpenAI if it were valued at $500 billion. This shows his doubt about how quickly AI is being developed and whether its economics make sense. Apart from this, Burry also described Nvidia as the best way to bet against the AI boom.“Nvidia also is the most loved, and least doubted.

China doubles down on tech independence amid chip restrictions

Jensen Huang says US and China need independence, but they also need each other





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has a blunt message for Washington and Beijing: The world needs you to work things out. Speaking on the ""No Priors"" podcast this week, Huang dismissed the notion that the world's two largest economies could or should split apart, calling the idea of decoupling ""naive"" and ""not based on any common sense. ""His comments come as Nvidia navigates a complex geopolitical landscape, with the chipmaker caught between US export restrictions and massive Chinese demand for its AI processors. Huang said he's optimistic about President Donald Trump 's approach to managing the relationship, describing it as ""really grounded"" and recognizing China as both an adversary and a partner.The stakes are personal for Huang. Nvidia is waiting to resume sales of its advanced H200 chips in China, a market the CEO once estimated could be worth $50 billion annually. Bloomberg reported Thursday that Beijing plans to approve some H200 sales as soon as this quarter, following Trump's December decision to lift a Biden-era ban—though the US government will take a 25% cut of future sales.Huang said Tuesday he isn't expecting any formal announcement from China. ""We're not expecting any press releases, or any large declarations,"" he told reporters at CES in Las Vegas. ""It's just going to be purchase orders.""Huang's call for cooperation comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping strikes a different tone. In his New Year's address, Xi celebrated China's homegrown AI models and chipmaking breakthroughs, emphasizing how trade barriers have fueled domestic innovation. ""Many large AI models have been competing in a race to the top, and breakthroughs have been achieved in the research and development of our own chips,"" Xi said, positioning China as ""one of the economies with the fastest-growing innovation capabilities. ""Despite his push for access to the Chinese market, Huang acknowledged that both nations should invest in their own technological independence. He compared the US-China dynamic to any relationship where overreliance breeds strain. The more dependent one becomes on another, he warned, the more emotional the relationship will become. He thus called for measured independence, while fully aware of how deeply interdependent the two economies are.Nvidia CEO called the US-China relationship ""the single most important relationship for the next century,"" arguing that global stability depends on these two powers finding workable common ground.

AI agents save McKinsey 1.5 million hours annually

What young professionals should focus on





McKinsey is experiencing a workforce transformation driven by AI, with its top boss revealing that the consulting giant now employs 25,000 AI agents alongside 40,000 human employees—and expects those numbers to match by year's end.Bob Sternfels, McKinsey's global managing partner, shared these insights during a Consumer Electronics Show appearance in Las Vegas, outlining what he calls the ""25 squared"" approach. Client-facing roles—the consultants who work directly with clients—are growing by 25%. Meanwhile, non-client-facing positions have shrunk by roughly the same percentage, even as output from those roles increased 10%.""Our model has always been synonymous that growth only occurs with total head count growth. Now it's actually splitting,"" Sternfels explained. The firm can now expand its client-facing workforce while reducing backend roles, still achieving overall growth—something he described as a new paradigm for the company.The productivity gains have been substantial. McKinsey saved 1.5 million hours last year alone on search and synthesis work—tasks typically handled by junior employees. The firm's AI agents have also generated 2.5 million charts in the past six months, freeing up consultants to tackle more complex problems.Sternfels said this shift means McKinsey consultants are ""moving up the stack"" rather than spending time on routine tasks that AI can handle efficiently.For those entering the workforce, Sternfels identified three skills AI can't replicate: the ability to set aspirations, human judgment, and genuine creativity. He emphasized that AI models work through inference—predicting the next likely step—but lack the capacity for truly orthogonal thinking that breaks existing patterns.The AI transformation also extends to hiring practices. Sternfels suggested companies should focus less on where candidates went to school and more on demonstrable skills, like reviewing a tech candidate's GitHub portfolio rather than their university credentials.","McKinsey now employs 25,000 AI agents alongside 40,000 human employees.

He advocates for a ""Humanist Superintelligence"" approach, focusing on practical applications like medical AI and clean energy, to maintain human oversight and avoid uncontrolled autonomous systems.

Containment must come before alignment, says Suleyman

Microsoft CEO 'Thrilled' About India's Growing Data Centre Capacity, Details Meet With PM Modi

Medical AI and energy solutions at the heart of Microsoft's approach





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has a blunt message for the artificial intelligence industry: stop confusing control with cooperation. In a pointed critique of how companies are racing toward superintelligence, Suleyman argued that the industry is dangerously blurring the line between containment—actually limiting what AI can do—and alignment, which is about making AI care enough not to harm humans.""You can't steer something you can't control,"" he wrote in a recent post on X. ""Containment has to come first—or alignment is the equivalent of asking nicely."" It's a warning that cuts to the heart of AI development: before teaching these systems to want the right things, we need to ensure we can stop them from doing the wrong things.The distinction matters because the AI industry often treats containment and alignment as interchangeable goals, Suleyman explained. But they represent different technical and philosophical challenges. Containment is about enforcing limits and restricting agency—essentially keeping AI systems within predetermined boundaries.Alignment, meanwhile, addresses whether these systems will act in humanity's best interests. According to Suleyman, pursuing alignment without first establishing robust containment is putting the cart before the horse.This warning comes as Suleyman positions Microsoft as a counterweight to what he sees as reckless development practices elsewhere in the industry. In his recent essay ""Towards Humanist Superintelligence,"" published on the Microsoft AI blog, he outlined a vision for AI that prioritizes human control and domain-specific applications over unbounded, autonomous systems. He told Bloomberg in a December interview that containment and alignment should be ""red lines"" that no company crosses, though he acknowledged this represents ""a novel position in the industry at the moment. ""Suleyman's proposed alternative—what he calls Humanist Superintelligence—focuses on practical applications like medical diagnostics and clean energy rather than general-purpose artificial general intelligence. Microsoft AI recently developed a system that achieved 85% accuracy on the New England Journal of Medicine's notoriously difficult case challenges, compared to roughly 20% for human doctors.The former DeepMind co-founder, who joined Microsoft 18 months ago, believes this domain-specific approach delivers superintelligence-level capabilities while avoiding the most severe control problems. With the revised OpenAI agreement now allowing Microsoft to pursue independent AI development, Suleyman is assembling what he calls the world's best superintelligence research team—one explicitly designed to keep humans in the driver's seat.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman urges the industry to prioritize containment over alignment in AI development.

Amazon gets into direct competition with Walmart







Amazon is planning a direct challenge to Walmart and Target. The e-commerce giant is preparing to launch a massive new brick-and-mortar retail store near Chicago. Earlier this week, officials in Orland Park, Illinois, approved plans for a 228,000-square-foot mega store that rivals the size of a modern Walmart Supercenter.According to a report by Business Insider, the facility will be a departure from Amazon’s existing physical retail experiments, moving beyond the grocery-centric focus to the “hypermarket” model. The store is said to be designed as a hybrid of a traditional department store and a high-tech fulfillment center.Citing planning documents, the report lists that the Amazon facility will offer a wide range of products including apparel, housewares and electronics, and a food section including prepared meals. It will also house large integrated storeroom to handle “rush” online order pickups and local deliveries.Katie Jahnke Dale, an attorney for Amazon, described the project as a “more purpose-built and thoughtful” approach to the big-box format.“This is a retail concept, a retail store, albeit with perhaps a larger storeroom in the back, which will allow us to enhance the customer experience,” she was quoted as saying.Walmart has dominated the American market with approximately 4,600 stores. Amazon has topped that online sales but has lacked a large-scale physical footprint to compete for the “one-stop-shop” weekly routine. Amazon reportedly generated over $100 billion in grocery sales in 2024 through its 500+ Whole Foods and 58 Amazon Fresh locations but those formats are significantly smaller and more specialised.","E-commerce giant is preparing to launch a massive new brick-and-mortar retail store near Chicago.

Indonesia becomes first country to block Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot over generating explicit deepfakes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/indonesia-becomes-first-country-to-block-elon-musks-grok-chatbot-over-generating-explicit-deepfakes/articleshow/126453762.cms,"Indonesia has become the first nation to block Elon Musk's Grok chatbot over concerns about its ability to generate explicit imagery, including non-consensual sexual deepfakes. The government cited human rights and digital security violations. This action follows international scrutiny, with Australia also raising alarms about exploitative content creation.

What Indonesia said about temporarily blocking the Grok chatbot

“The government views the practice of non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and the security of citizens in the digital space.”

“The use of generative AI to exploit or sexualise people without their consent is abhorrent. The fact that this tool was used so that people were using its image creation function through Grok is, I think, just completely abhorrent. It, once again, is an example of social media not showing social responsibility, and Australians, and indeed, global citizens, deserve better,”

“X, Grok and a wide range of other services are also subject to systemic safety obligations to detect and remove child sexual exploitation material and other unlawful material as part of Australia's world-leading industry codes and standards,""





Indonesia became the first country to deny access to Elon Musk-owned xAI’s Grok chatbot following concerns about its ability to generate explicit imagery. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, this move came after the country’s officials identified risks related to the generation of pornographic material. The Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Digital Affairs stated that the tool lacked sufficient safeguards to prevent the creation of non-consensual sexual deepfakes, which the government categorises as a violation of human rights and digital security.The move follows international scrutiny from regulators in Europe and Asia regarding Grok's output. Recent reports indicated that the chatbot had been used to produce sexualised images, including depictions involving minors. In response to these concerns, xAI, the developer of Grok, announced that it would restrict image-generation and editing features to paying subscribers while improving its safety filters.In a statement to Reuters, Meutya Hafid, Indonesia’s Communications and Digital Minister, said,The Reuters report also noted that the ministry has even called upon X officials to discuss the matter. Indonesia has strict rules that ban people from sharing content deemed obscene online.Earlier this week, Musk took to the microblogging site X to say that anyone using Grok to create illegal content would face the same consequences as if they had uploaded it. Musk has also faced threats of fines, regulatory action, and reports of a possible ban on X in the UK.The AI tool has been reportedly used to change images of women to remove their clothes and place them in sexual positions. However, this feature has now been turned off for everyone except paying subscribers.Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has also raised concerns about the use of the Grok chatbot to create exploitative sexual content. Last week, he joined other international leaders, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, in criticising X.Albanese said to reporters.While the number of reports received by Australia's eSafety Office remains small, it says there has been a recent increase related to the use of Grok to create sexual or exploitative images. The watchdog recently warned that it would use its powers, including issuing removal notices, where such material doesn’t meet the standards set out in the Online Safety Act.the Australian regulator said.","Indonesia has blocked access to Elon Musk-owned xAI’s Grok chatbot over concerns about its ability to generate explicit imagery.

One of America’s biggest investor Michael Burry who is known for predicting the mid-2000s housing bubble has now urged the US President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance to fast-track a $1 trillion nuclear power and grid expansion plan. In a post on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Burry argued that deploying small nuclear reactors nationwide and building a hardened national grid is the only way for the US to meet the increasing electricity demand which is driven by artificial intelligence. Burry also feels that this is only way in which we canhope to keep up with China, stressing that abundant energy is important for long-term national security and managing US debt.“If had the ear @JDVance @LeaderJohnThune , I would ask them to take a trillion dollars (since trillions just get thrown around like millions now) and bypass all the protests and regulations and dot the whole country with small nuclear reactors, while also building a brand-new, state-of-the-art grid for everyone. Do this as soon as possible and secure it all from attack with the latest physical and cybersecurity; maybe even create a special Nuclear Defense Force that protects each facility, funded federally.This is the only hope of getting enough power to keep up with China, and it is the only hope we have as a country to grow enough to ultimately pay off our debt and guarantee long-term security, by not letting power be a limiting factor on our innovation,” wrote Burry.The comments made by Burry come as AI data centers and advanced manufacturing facilities drive unprecedented electricity demand. The US power consumption is also projected to increase by 2.6% annually through 2030. Analysts also warn that shortages could lead to constrain innovation and economic growth.Daniel Newman CEO of Futurum Group echoed Burry’s concerns. Newman said regulatory hurdles are the biggest obstacle to sustaining the AI revolution. “Four words about AI that I never planned to say: Michael Burry is right,” Newman posted, adding that regulation is the “single biggest bottleneck” to achieving AI ambitions.He dismissed fears of an AI bubble, arguing demand is real but power constraints threaten progress. “We cannot energize the data centers we will need … if we don’t speed up the buildout of energy and remove the mass of regulation that slows ‘breaking ground,’” Newman said.Elon Musk has previously predicted that solar power will ultimately dominate global energy supply, calling it “by far the biggest source of power for civilization.” Meanwhile, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya warned that grid strain could cause electricity prices to double within five years.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has also cautioned that AI’s long‑term growth will be limited not by chips, but by access to electricity.",Investor Michael Burry has urged the US President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance to fast-track a $1 trillion nuclear power and grid expansion plan.

Nvidia launched social listening campaign for DGX Spark





Nvidia not just builds one of the best products in the industry but also keeps a close eye on the public criticism of its hardware. Internal documents from the world’s biggest chipmaker in terms of market cap have pulled back the curtain on a ‘social listening’ campaign led by CEO Jensen Huang. The company mobilised its staff, including top engineers, to perform damage control after a customer publicly criticised DGX Spark, a desktop AI system designed for medical and data science researchers.Citing an email chain and internal documents, a report by Business Insider has said that that when a top executive at pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca called the system's software experience “buggy and unstable” on LinkedIn, Huang personally intervened with a direct command to his team: “Jump on X and say you will fix.”The report said that company engineers quickly identified the problem as a version mismatch in CUDA foundational AI software, and resolved the issue directly with the client. Launched in October last year, the “DGX Spark” is envisioned by Huang as the “ultimate developer’s platform,” but early adopters soon took to social media to complain of software instability and performance bugs.The leaked emails reportedly also reveal that Nvidia didn't stop at one customer, and the the chipmaker launched a social listening campaign to monitor Reddit, Nvidia forums and influential LinkedIn figures for complaints regarding heating, pricing and performance.In another case, researcher Christopher Kouzios purchased the DGX Spark to study rare brain tumors following the death of his daughter. He publicly criticised the system for being “unusable” due to software incompatibility. After Nvidia executives flagged the post, the team bypassed standard support protocols to fix the bug.Kouzios later praised the company, and told Business Insider he had never seen a tech giant respond so quickly to public feedback in his 33-year career.According to industry analysts, this aggressive level of customer service is fueled by stock-price sensitivities.","Internal documents from the world’s biggest chipmaker have pulled back the curtain on a ‘social listening’ campaign led by CEO Jensen Huang.

Nvidia has hired Alison Wagonfeld as its first chief marketing officer, marking a strategic shift for the AI chipmaker as it looks to sharpen its brand amid explosive growth. Wagonfeld, who spent nearly a decade at Google leading marketing for its cloud business, will report directly to CEO Jensen Huang and consolidate marketing functions that were previously scattered across multiple executives.The appointment, announced on LinkedIn, comes as Nvidia rides an unprecedented wave fueled by the AI boom. The company posted record sales of $57 billion last quarter—a 62% jump from the previous year—cementing its position as the go-to supplier for chips powering everything from ChatGPT to autonomous vehicles.Wagonfeld takes charge of the entire marketing and communications team starting February. In her post, she described the role as overseeing marketing ""as Nvidia embarks on its next phase of growth,"" a telling nod to the company's ambitions beyond its current AI dominance.Read Alison Wagonfeld’s LinkedIn postSharing some personal news! After nearly 10 years of building Google Cloud from a promising start-up in 2016 to a thriving $60B run-rate business today, I will be leaving Google in late January to join NVIDIA as its Chief Marketing Officer. I’m excited to be joining Jensen’s leadership team in a new role heading up marketing and communications as NVIDIA embarks on its next phase of growth.It’s been such a privilege to lead Google Cloud Marketing through so many chapters of growth. While many things have changed over the last decade, Google’s commitment to serving customers and partners with the best technology and team has never been stronger. Thank you to Lorraine Twohill, Thomas Kurian and their teams, as well as our powerhouse Cloud Marketing team, for the amazing collaboration every step of the way.I’m thrilled to be moving from one AI leader to another at such a transformational time. Google and NVIDIA share a strong partnership, and we look forward to continued collaboration.Why marketing suddenly matters for NvidiaFor years, Nvidia didn't need a marketing chief. Demand for its GPUs spoke louder than any campaign could. But the landscape has shifted. With the AI race heating up and Huang becoming one of tech's most visible leaders, the company needs someone to translate technical prowess into broader market storytelling.Huang himself has become something of a rockstar CEO, drawing crowds at events like CES where he recently unveiled the Rubin platform—Nvidia's next-generation AI infrastructure promising to cut token generation costs by 90%. His signature leather jacket and keynote performances have made him a symbol of the AI revolution, but maintaining that momentum requires strategic communication.Nvidia’s racing toward the next frontierAt CES in Las Vegas, Huang told the crowds that “the race is on for AI,” but underlined partnerships with Mercedes-Benz, Siemens, and other industry giants. The company also introduced Alpamayo, an open reasoning model for autonomous vehicles-a sign of Nvidia's expanded ambitions outside data centers and into new areas.Wagonfeld now leads a company at an inflection point. Nvidia isn’t just peddling chips anymore—the company is positioning itself as the backbone of an AI-driven future. How well she amplifies that message while keeping pace with blistering product cycles will define her tenure in the months ahead.",Alison Wagonfeld is Nvidia's first chief marketing officer.

They argue that allowing such material undermines the tech giants' moderation claims and app store safety assurances. This action follows intense global criticism and regulatory scrutiny over AI-generated harmful content.

“immediately remove the X and Grok apps from their app stores until the company's Chief Executive Officer, Elon Musk, addresses these disturbing and likely illegal activities.”

“Turning a blind eye to X's egregious behaviour would make a mockery of your moderation practices,”

“undermine your claims in public and in court that your app stores offer a safer user experience than letting users download apps directly to their phones.”

Why Elon Musk’s xAI and Grok chatbot facing backlash

“deepfake”

“A descendant of Holocaust survivors was ‘digitally stripped’”

“anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.”





Three US senators have written an open letter to Apple and Google . In the letter, which is addressed to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai , the senators have asked both companies to remove X and Grok apps from their respective app stores until owner Elon Musk stops users from creating and sharing non-consensual explicit images and child sexual abuse content.In the letter (as reviewed by CNBC), US senators Ron Wyden of Oregon, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, and Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico called on the tech giants toThe senators said that the apps currently allow users to generate and distribute illegal content through their platforms. They also added that ignoring X's serious violations would make Apple and Google's content moderation practices meaningless.the senators wrote, adding that a failure to take action wouldGrok and X have recently allowed users to create and widely circulate explicit, sexualisedcontent involving people who did not consent to their images being used in this way. Grok has also been used to generate images that insult or degrade people based on race or ethnicity.In one recent case, The Times of London reported thatby Grok after users prompted the AI tool to create an image of her wearing a bikini outside Auschwitz.These concerns have led to intense criticism and regulatory scrutiny from governments in Europe, Malaysia, Australia, and India. In contrast, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice have not yet said whether they plan to investigate **xAI**.Earlier this month, Elon Musk and X released statements saying thatBoth Apple and Google have strict app developer rules that require steps to prevent the sharing of child sexual abuse material and other harmful or explicit content. Earlier, apps such as Tumblr and Telegram were temporarily removed from Apple’s App Store for failing to control inappropriate material adequately.More recently, X reportedly restricted Grok’s AI image generation tools to paying subscribers. However, Grok’s standalone app and website still allowed users to prompt the system to digitally undress, sexualise, or demean people without their consent.According to CNN, recent Grok feature changes and the limited safety controls were pushed by Musk. The report added that three members of xAI’s safety team announced their departures on X following these demands.Despite the backlash, xAI said this week that it raised $20 billion in new funding from investors, including Nvidia and Cisco Investments, as well as long-time Musk-linked backers such as Valour Equity Partners, StepStone Group, Fidelity, the Qatar Investment Authority, MGX, and Baron Capital Group.","US senators Ron Wyden, Ed Markey, and Ben Ray Luján have written an open letter to Apple and Google.

‘Human intervention needed in complex codes’





Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has shared insights from a code review of C++ generated by Anothropic’s LLM, saying that he was impressed but thinks that AI still have room for development. He also suggested that LLMs coding still need human intervention but there has been a significant improvement in such capabilities in the last two years.According to Vembu, the review went on for hours in the tech town hall and it provided him a clear understanding on how LLMs work.“Yesterday we had a tech town hall in Zoho where we did a code review of the C++ code generated by the Claude Opus 4.5 model. It went on for hours late evening,” Vembu said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).“I now have a much clearer understanding of what these models do well: they are able to stitch together systems well, taking data from one system, reshape it and pass it to another system. There is often a lot of such ""glue code"" in these systems and that is not very complicated but it is very tedious,” he added.He also highlighted AI's strength in creating tedious “glue code” for system integration but noted that its tendency toward verbose outputs and reliance on memorised open-source patterns.“In general, AI models have ""memorized"" all the open source too and they are able to recall patterns from them (with some possibility of hallucination). They are also able to stitch various open source pieces together well,” Vembu pointed out.Vembu also highlighted that human orchestration proved essential during their review as it ensured usable results. He said that while AI excels at stitching components but it struggles with complexity.“Our senior engineer had guided (""orchestrated"" is the right word) this process. When the AI was stuck he helped ""unstuck"" it. This was a very vital contribution and without his experienced guidance, the AI output would not be useful,” he said.“We examined several C++ files with thousands of lines of code in each, looking for what I consider complex code. Most of it was straightforward glue code and only a tiny part of it was complex,” Vembu noted.“I suspect that the AI generated code tended to be needlessly verbose but I have to study it more to be sure. On the whole, I am both impressed and not super awed. I believe we can do better,” he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has shared insights from a code review of C++ generated by Anothropic’s LLM.

New search filters rolled out by YouTube



Dedicated Content Types: We’ve added a new Shorts filter to the 'Type' menu. This gives viewers more control over whether they see Shorts or VODs (long-form videos) in their search results, so you can find exactly what you’re looking for, regardless of format.

'Prioritize' Menu: The 'Sort By' menu has been renamed to 'Prioritize'. This refined sorting menu aims to maximize utility.

'Popularity' Filter: The 'View count' sort option has been renamed to 'Popularity'. This filter allows you to easily locate popular videos related to your search queries. Our systems assess a video's view count and other relevance signals, such as watch time, to determine its popularity for that specific query.





YouTube has rolled out new search filters which are designed to make finding videos easier and more intuitive. “We’ve heard your feedback and are enhancing the search experience by updating our filters to make them more effective and intuitive for everyone. Our goal is to equip you with more effective advanced search tools, ensuring you can consistently and efficiently locate the content you love,” said the company. One of the biggest changes rolled out by YouTube is a dedicated Short Filter which will enable users to specifically browse short-form clips or long-form videos. The update also reflects YouTube’s push to highlight its fast-growing Shorts format which competes directly with TikTok and Instagram Reels.We have made some key additions and renames to ensure our sorting options align better with your expectations:To streamline the experience, YouTube has removed two filters: Upload Date – Last Hour and Sort by Rating. The company said these options were not functioning as intended and contributed to user confusion. Broader upload date filters, such as “Today,” “This week,” and “This year,” remain available. “We are simplifying and reorganizing the filter menu to make it more intuitive and improve the overall search experience. This includes removing some options that were not working as expected and had contributed to user complaints,” added YouTube.","YouTube has rolled out new search filters which are designed to make finding videos easier and more intuitive.

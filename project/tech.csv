Salesforce has announced the discontinuation of its diversity goals in hiring, following a series of executive orders signed by President Donald Trump aimed at eliminating such programs across the federal government and private sector. This follows similar changes brought by Google and Facebook-parent company Meta.As per a report by Bloomberg, the San Francisco-based software company also removed previous language highlighting diversity and inclusion as a “core value” and references to executive compensation being tied to “employee diversity measures”.“While we are not specifying representation goals, we remain committed to our core value of equality,” a Salesforce spokesperson stated in its annual financial disclosures, as per Bloomberg.The company's updated financial filing reflects a shift in language, emphasising compliance with federal law and promoting a “fair and inclusive environment” while upholding “principles of equality, dignity, and respect for all.”“Our approach to equality is firmly rooted in compliance with federal law as a US company. By adhering to these laws, we uphold a fair and inclusive environment where our employees can do the best work and teaming of their careers, reinforcing principles of equality, dignity and respect for all,” Salesforce wrote in new language included in the filing.This decision comes in the wake of Trump's executive orders targeting diversity initiatives. One order seeks to eliminate diversity hiring within the federal workforce and among government contractors, including Salesforce, a major software vendor to the US government.Another order directs the government to pressure companies into ending their diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI) programs.Salesforce's move aligns with a broader trend of companies, such as Google and Meta, scaling back their DEI initiatives.Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff , known for his vocal advocacy on social issues, has previously supported initiatives like a San Francisco tax increase to address homelessness and threatened to withdraw investment from Indiana over a discriminatory law.","Salesforce has announced the discontinuation of its diversity goals in hiring.

Xiaomi's president sets goals for the segment that impressed Ford CEO and made him 'talk competition',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/xiaomis-president-sets-goals-for-the-segment-that-impressed-ford-ceo-and-made-him-talk-competition/articleshow/118768845.cms,"What president Lu Weibing said on Xiaomi's car plans

What Ford CEO said about Xiaomi car

China in EV landscape globally

Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi has set a goal for 2027. And this goal of one of the world's largest smartphone company is not about phones, but Electric Cars. Xiaomi has announced plans to expand its Electric Vehicle (EV) sales into international markets starting in 2027, building on the success of its first mass-produced car in China -- SU7. Xiaomi launched the SU7 model in China in March 2024, priced from 215,900 yuan (US$29,636). Competing with Tesla, Xiaomi reportedly delivered 135,000 units between April and December last year, surpassing a key industry benchmark of 10,000 monthly deliveries, after receiving over 248,000 orders. Popularly known as the Tesla rival from China, Xiaomi SU7 is also the same car that Ford CEO Jim Farley expressed admiration for in October 2024. Farley praised the EV for its performance and technology integration.Xiaomi president Lu Weibing told Jiemian News, a financial and business media outlet, “I hope that we can officially start tapping foreign markets in 2027”. Lu Weibing, who spoke to Jiemian News at the MWC Barcelona trade show, said that Xiaomi has begun evaluating overseas markets, particularly in Europe, to understand consumer demand and business potential. Lu added that he plans to visit several European countries following the event. Xiaomi joins a wave of Chinese EV manufacturers and suppliers looking abroad as concerns grow over excess production capacity at home.“Our overall strategy is to gain a strong foothold at home first,” Lu explained. “If a Chinese carmaker can’t secure a good position in the domestic market, it will struggle to expand overseas.”Known as the world’s third-largest smartphone maker, Xiaomi entered the EV industry in 2021. The SU7, equipped with autonomous driving features, a digital cockpit, and a high-performance HyperEngine motor (up to 21,000 RPM), offers sports car-like capabilities. Recently, Xiaomi introduced the premium SU7 Ultra, priced at 529,900 yuan, with a sales goal of 10,000 units. Founder and CEO Lei Jun projected over 300,000 vehicle deliveries in 2025, with the upcoming YU7 SUV set to debut later this year.Speaking to the British presenter Robert Llewellyn on ""The Fully Charged Podcast, Ford CEO said, ""I don't like talking about the competition so much, but I drive the Xiaomi."" ""We flew one from Shanghai to Chicago, and I've been driving it for six months now, and I don't want to give it up,"" Farley added.China dominates the global EV landscape, with sales of pure electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles reaching 10.9 million units in 2024—a 40.7% increase year-over-year—representing roughly 60% of the world total, per the China Passenger Car Association. However, overcapacity remains a challenge, with Goldman Sachs reporting that only half of China’s EV production facilities are currently utilized due to rapid factory expansion. Chinese EVs face steep tariffs abroad, including 17–35.3% in the European Union and 100% in the US. Among China’s numerous EV makers, only BYD, Li Auto, and Aito are profitable, while dozens of others are said to be facing losses.","Xiaomi has announced plans to expand its Electric Vehicle (EV) sales into international markets starting in 2027.

FDA warns against these diabetes ""cures""

Scammers are flooding Facebook with AI-generated videos claiming Elon Musk has discovered a cure for diabetes. These deepfakes show Musk and other personalities promoting a ""simple 30-second fridge trick"" that allegedly reverses diabetes, while warning that pharmaceutical companies have placed a $78 million bounty on Musk's head. The fraudulent ads, which have circulated since early February, ultimately direct users to purchase unproven supplements.Engadget identified scores of Facebook pages running these scam advertisements, with many pages repeatedly posting dozens or even hundreds of variations. While individual ads are frequently removed, the pages typically remain active and simply launch new versions. Similar deepfakes featuring other public figures including Oprah Winfrey, former Senator Mitt Romney, and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have also appeared.The deceptive ads follow a consistent pattern: they open with Fox News personalities discussing Musk's supposed breakthrough, followed by AI-manipulated video clips of Musk from podcasts or public appearances. The videos claim all that's needed is a ""common fruit,"" ""frozen lemon,"" or bizarrely, ""a lemon and a pair of socks,"" but never reveal the actual ""trick."" Instead, viewers are directed to websites mimicking legitimate news outlets like Fox News or CNN.These sites feature additional AI-generated videos, often including clips of Barbra O'Neill, an Australian naturopath banned from offering health services in her home country. After lengthy presentations, the sites finally offer ""limited-time deals"" on supplements with names like ""Gluco Revive.""The FDA has explicitly warned consumers that ""there are no dietary supplements that treat or cure diabetes."" The agency notes that some supposedly ""all-natural"" diabetes products contain hidden active ingredients that could dangerously interact with prescription medications.Despite violating multiple Meta policies regarding medical misinformation and AI-manipulated media, these scams have persisted for weeks. Meta told Engadget it was investigating the ads and taking action against the responsible pages.","Scammers are flooding Facebook with AI-generated videos claiming Elon Musk has discovered a cure for diabetes.

Why antitrust case may be a problem for Zomato and Swiggy

Indian consumer products distributors have lodged an antitrust complaint against major quick-commerce players Zomato-owned BlinkIt, Swiggy’s Instamart and Zepto , alleging deep discounting practices that harm smaller retailers. The All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF) has filed a case with the Competition Commission of India ( CCI ), seeking an investigation into the pricing strategies of these platforms.According to a report by Reuters, the AICPDF, representing 400,000 distributors who supply products to 13 million retail shops across India, alleges that the deep discounts offered by quick-commerce platforms create an unfair playing field.“An alarming trend of predatory pricing and deep discounting practices by Q-commerce platforms resulted in unfair pricing models,” the group stated in its filing.The complaint highlights the price discrepancies between online and offline channels, citing examples of products from major brands like Nestle and Hindustan Unilever being sold at significantly lower prices on quick-commerce platforms. For instance, a Nescafe coffee jar that costs a small retailer around Rs 622 rupees is offered for Rs 514 on Zepto, Rs 577 on Swiggy Instamart and Rs 625 on Blinkit.This case may add to the regulatory challenges faced by Zomato and Swiggy, who are already under investigation by the CCI for alleged anti-competitive practices in their food delivery businesses. Zepto, which is reportedly preparing for an IPO after raising funds at a $5 billion valuation last year, could also face increased scrutiny.The CCI will review the case filing and may order a detailed investigation. This process could take several months and involve companies providing explanations for their business practices.This complaint comes amidst growing scrutiny of India’s e-commerce sector, with Amazon and Flipkart facing antitrust probes last year over alleged predatory pricing and preferential treatment of select sellers.",The All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF) has filed a case with the Competition Commission of India.

"How Jim Walker, the man who saw 2008 Stock Market crash coming, may have just 'agreed' with Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath's 'Stock Market Gyaan'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-jim-walker-the-man-who-saw-the-2008-stock-market-crash-coming-may-have-just-agreed-with-zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamaths-stock-market-gyaan/articleshow/118727832.cms,"Jim Walker to investors: Take long-term investment approach

Jim Walker picks India over China

Indian stock markets witnessed Bears onslaught in the month of February, with the benchmark Sensex closing over 4,000 points lower. The carnage witnessed in the market during the month led to a staggering erosion of over Rs 40 lakh crore from the market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies; while Nifty 50 marked its longest losing streak since its inception in the year 1996. The relentless downward trend has left retail investors anxious. In a message to investors late earlier this week, Zerodha founder and CEO Nithin Kamath termed the fall as ""the first real market correction "" since Covid pandemic.""Markets are cyclical, and given the way our markets went up from late 2020, this fall was inevitable,"" he said. Kamath told investors to not get carried away by the doom and gloom in the market and continue investing in SIPs. ""I don't know how good the data is, but it seems like the number of investors stopping their SIPs has gone up. This is the wrong thing to do. What an SIP helps you do is to average your investments across different market cycles,"" he said.A similar sentiment comes from Jim Walker, a celebrated economist from Alethia Capital who famously foresaw the 2008 financial crisis. In an exclusive interaction with ETNow, Walker gave perspective on the current state of the global economy and what he thinks about India. Contrary to widespread concerns that today’s market exuberance might precipitate a collapse akin to that of 2008, Walker holds a different view.Speaking with ETNow, he acknowledged a global economic slowdown but stressed that the circumstances differ markedly from those preceding the financial debacle over ten years ago. Similar to Nithin Kamath, Walker batted for a long-term investment approach. Walker encouraged his clients to boost their stakes in India, despite valuation concerns in its stock market. “I’ve advised clients this week to significantly increase their investments in India. Though stock valuations raise eyebrows, I believe economic growth will soon justify them with strong corporate earnings,” he elaborated.Known for his prescient 2006-07 warning of a looming U.S. housing market crash, Walker remarked that today’s danger signals are less evident. “The signs were glaring in 2006-07 when we predicted a severe downturn driven by excesses in the property sector; it’s not the same now,” he said.He pointed out that unlike the lead-up to 2008, there are currently no significant overindulgences in the housing or financial sectors poised to spark a major banking crisis. Although certain areas show excessive stock market gains and asset price inflation, Walker believes these won’t lead to widespread corporate failures that could rattle the banking system. “We’re not seeing the kind of corporate collapses that impacted banks in 2008. That’s not on the horizon,” he observed.Additionally, Walker expressed a stronger preference for investing in India over China, suggesting it might be an opportune moment to increase investments there. He is especially sanguine about India’s prospects, citing its robust policy environment—the best in three decades—as a key factor enhancing its appeal to investors. “India’s policy stability and certainty are at their peak in the last 30 years,” he asserted, crediting solid monetary and fiscal policies along with exchange rate stability for bolstering India’s economic structure.He also praised the Indian government’s efforts in deregulation and improving business conditions, which he views as catalysts for future growth. By supporting small and medium enterprises, Walker believes India will spur further economic and job growth.",Jim Walker picks India over China as a good place to invest in the stock market.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat. In the post, Altman wrote “very proud of the openai team for what is perhaps the most impressive scientific/technical breakthrough of recent decades…thought that was the thing i'd always be most proud of in life”. Adding further, he wrote “turns out i am now more proud of a preemie baby for learning how to eat on his own!”.In a follow-up post, Altman wrote “i realize i am getting neurochemically hacked here but idc, it's the best)”.Sam Altman welcomed his baby boy last month with his partner and software engineer Oliver Mulherin. The baby arrived prematurely and has been receiving care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).In another news, the CEO shared an update about the company’s latest version of the large language model (LLM), GPT-4.5 . In an X post, Altman announced that GPT-4.5 is expected to roll out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers. However, he noted that the update will be a staggered rollout over several days to manage high demand and ensure a smooth user experience.Altman also explained that launching with a low rate limit would restrict usage and prevent users from having meaningful interactions with the new model. The staggered release will allow users to have longer conversations with GPT-4.5, even if it means some subscribers will have to wait a bit longer to access it.In his X announcement, Altman wrote: “We are likely going to roll out GPT-4.5 to the plus tier over a few days. There is no perfect way to do this; we wanted to do it for everyone tomorrow, but it would have meant we had to launch with a very low rate limit. We think people are gonna use this a lot and love it.”","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, for him, even the biggest tech breakthroughs can't compare to a personal milestone: his newborn son learning how to eat.

Come April 1 of Fiscal Year 2026-27, a new rule in the Income Tax Act law may grant the Income Tax department powers to access your social media accounts or emails in case they suspect tax evasion . Income Tax Bill 2025, which was introduced in the Parliament recently, will give Income Tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces, termed Virtual Digital Spaces in the bill. This means that the Income Tax department can break into social media accounts, personal emails, bank accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, and more if they have any reason to believe that you own any undisclosed income, money, Gold, Jewelry, or valuable item or property on which you haven’t paid applicable Income Tax.Presently, Section 132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, allows Income Tax officials to seize assets and books during search operations if they find sufficient reasons to believe that an individual is in possession of undisclosed income or assets. The changes in the bill, once passed in the Parliament, will extend this authourity to the digital realm, allowing officials to bypass security measures on computer systems and virtual spaces.The Clause 247 of the Income Tax Bill outlines this expanded power, stating that officers can “break open the lock of any door, box, locker, safe, almirah, or other receptacle” or “gain access by overriding the access code” to computer systems or virtual digital spaces when access is otherwise unavailable. This applies if they believe an individual possesses undisclosed income or assets taxable under the law.According to the bill, the term Virtual Digital Space includes email servers, social media accounts, online investment accounts, trading accounts, banking accounts, and any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset. It further adds that virtual digital space is an environment, area or realm that is constructed and experienced through computer technology and not the physical, tangible world, which encompasses any digital realm that allows users to interact, communicate and perform activities using computer systems, computer networks, computer resources, communication devices, cyberspace, internet, worldwide web and emerging technologies, using data and information in the electronic form for creation, storage or exchange and includes:* Email servers* Social media account* Online investment account, trading account, banking account, etc* Any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset* Remote server or cloud servers* Digital application platforms* Any other space of similar natureAs to who all can wield this authority? The bill designates “authorised officers” as senior tax officials, including Joint Directors, Additional Directors, Joint Commissioners, Additional Commissioners, Assistant or Deputy Directors, Assistant or Deputy Commissioners, Income Tax Officers, and Tax Recovery Officers.What does this mean for individuals? The new rules significantly widen the scope of tax investigations, giving officials the ability to probe deeply into personal and financial digital footprints. As this provision takes effect, it raises questions about privacy and the balance between tax enforcement and individual rights.","Income Tax Bill 2025 will give Income Tax officials the legal authourity to access and inspect a wide range of personal and financial digital spaces.

Qualcomm CEO also reiterated his earlier 'iPhone prediction' that he expects Qualcomm will not supply Apple with modems in 2027.

How Apple's entry in modem race goes back to 2019

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon is betting big on the company's latest high-end modem, X85. In an interview with CNBC, Amon claimed that the company's latest X85 modem will significantly outperform Apple's recently introduced C1 modem, creating a substantial performance gap between premium Android devices and iPhones. Announced recently, Qualcomm's high-end X85 modem integrates advanced AI capabilities, enhancing its ability to handle weaker signals and extend performance range, according to Amon. Qualcomm CEO added, ""It’s the first modem with so much AI.""Apple recently entered the smartphone modem race with Apple C1, its first self-designed modem. Apple C1 modem made its debut in Apple's latest addition in iPhone 16 series, iPhone 16e . For years, Apple has sourced modems from Qualcomm, the world's biggest supplier of the chips. Qualcomm chips also power Android gadgets and Windows laptops.While talking about how X85 modem will give Android phones an edge over iPhones,At the same time, Amon expressed confidence in Qualcomm's edge. “If modem is relevant there’s always a place for Qualcomm technology,” Amon said. He added, “In the age of AI, modems are going to be more important than they have ever been. And I think that’s going to drive consumer preference about do they want the best possible modem in the computer that’s in their hand all the time.”Modems, essential for connecting smartphones to mobile networks, have been a core strength of Qualcomm. The company has been a leading global supplier of modems for Apple's iPhones. However, in July 2019, Apple and Intel signed an agreement for Apple to acquire the majority of Intel’s smartphone modem business. Approximately 2,200 Intel employees join Apple, along with intellectual property, equipment and leases. Apple's acquisition of Intel's modem division made it clear that the company wants to go its own way and follow the same strategy as it has for smartphone processors.The iPhone 16e, which runs on the same A18 processor chip as the rest of other phones in the iPhone 16 lineup, has the best battery life of any of its 6.1-inch phones thanks to the C1 system, Apple's Kaiann Drance, vice president of iPhone product marketing, told Reuters. The iPhone 16e also has Apple's latest artificial intelligence (AI) features.One of the ways Apple hopes that the C1 will set its iPhones apart is by tightly integrating it with its A-series processor chips. Giving an example Arun Mathias, vice president for wireless software at Apple, told the news agency that if an iPhone encounters congested data networks, the phone's processor can signal to the modem which traffic is the most time sensitive and put it ahead of other data transfers, making the phone feel more responsive to the user's needs.","Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon is betting big on the company's latest high-end modem, X85.

Speaking at a Morgan Stanley conference, Musk stated that the government should privatize anything that can reasonably be privatized and singled out the Postal Service and passenger rail service Amtrak as examples. His remarks come at a time when both entities face financial and operational challenges, despite recent improvements in revenue and ridership.Musk’s stance aligns with broader government efficiency initiatives being pursued by President Donald Trump, who has advocated for reducing federal control over certain services. While the suggestion of privatization is not new, it remains a highly debated topic, with proponents arguing it would lead to better efficiency and opponents warning of potential service disruptions, especially for rural and underserved communities.During his remarks at the conference, Musk outlined his belief that the government should privatize as much as possible, arguing that private companies tend to operate more efficiently than government-run entities.Musk also acknowledged that such actions would require congressional approval, indicating that while he supports the idea, implementing such changes would be a complex process.His remarks come amid ongoing discussions within the Trump administration about restructuring certain government agencies. In February, Trump proposed merging the U.S. Postal Service with the Department of Commerce, a move that faced strong opposition from Democrats, who argued it would violate federal law.The United States Postal Service (USPS) has faced significant financial difficulties over the past two decades. Since 2007, the agency has accumulated losses exceeding $100 billion, with a $9.5 billion deficit recorded in the last fiscal year ending September 30, 2024.Despite these long-term losses, the Postal Service did report a fourth-quarter profit of $144 million earlier this month. However, analysts note that this short-term improvement does not offset the long-term structural challenges facing the agency.One of the primary reasons for USPS’s financial struggles is the decline in first-class mail volume, which has dropped by 80% since 1997, bringing mail volume to its lowest level since 1968. The widespread shift to email and digital communication has drastically reduced demand for traditional postal services, making it difficult for USPS to maintain profitability.Critics argue that privatization could allow for modernization and cost-cutting measures, making the Postal Service more sustainable. However, opponents warn that privatization could lead to higher postage costs, service reductions in rural areas, and job losses for the hundreds of thousands of USPS employees.Unlike the Postal Service, Amtrak has seen strong ridership growth in recent years. In December 2024, the passenger rail service reported that its annual ridership exceeded pre-pandemic levels, reaching a record 32.8 million customer trips—a 15% increase from 2023.Amtrak has been working toward financial improvement, with its adjusted operating loss shrinking to $705 million for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, marking a 9% improvement over 2023. The company also announced plans to expand services along the East Coast, aiming to double national ridership to 66 million passengers by 2040.Despite this progress, Musk remains critical of Amtrak’s efficiency, particularly in comparison to China’s high-speed rail system.Musk stated, pointing out the need for major improvements in U.S. rail infrastructure.Following Musk’s remarks, Amtrak issued a statement emphasizing its strong business performance and growing ridership.an Amtrak spokesperson said.Amtrak has benefited from significant federal funding in recent years. As part of the 2021 Infrastructure Bill, Congress allocated $66 billion for rail projects, including $22 billion specifically for Amtrak over a five-year period.However, the Trump administration has historically been less supportive of Amtrak, with Trump’s first-term budget proposals repeatedly calling for funding cuts to the service. In 2024, Amtrak received $2.4 billion in federal support, sparking debates over whether taxpayer funding should continue at such levels.","Elon Musk suggests privatising US Postal Service and Amtrak.

As reported by Economic Times, in an email, functional heads at the Bengaluru-headquartered company informed their teammates to limit the number of work-from-home days that they apply for, effective March 10.“To support this, starting March 10, 2025, system interventions will be implemented to limit the number of work-from-home days that can be applied each month. These measures are designed to ensure compliance with the new hybrid work requirements while maintaining flexibility for employees,” said the email, which ET has seen.Infosys, which has about 323,000 employees on its roster, did not respond to an email seeking comment. The “system intervention”, as senior executives called it, is designed to ensure effective collaboration among teammates, while affording them flexibility, one of them said.“As you know, our hybrid work model expects employees to work from the office for at least 10 days a month, or as per business requirements, whichever is higher,” the email added.The communication applies to employees at job level 5 (JL5) and below. Team leaders are at the rank of JL5 (Job Level 5) while those below include software engineers, senior engineers, system engineers and consultants. JL6 and above include managers, senior managers, delivery managers and senior delivery managers, but exclude vice presidents.Infosys employees use a mobile app to record their attendance, which will no longer approve WFH requests by “default” and will compulsorily require to punch in 10 days a month serving at their respective office base, a senior employee said on the condition of anonymity.This is more of a project requirement rather than the unit requirement, another added. A third employee said the flexibility helped them save a lot of commute time and exhaustion from traveling to the office. This could reduce efficiency for some of the employees, this person added. According to sources, if an employee falls short by a day or two in meeting the work-from-office target, those days would be deducted from his or her leave balance. Infosys’ larger rival Tata Consultancy Services has linked its 5-day work-from-office policy to the variable pay of employees.Infosys introduced its return-to-office policy on November 20, 2023 and ET reported that the outsourcing giant designated a few key weeks in a quarter as “in person collab” weeks when all team members were expected to be in office and collaborate with each other.","Infosys has told its technology workforce to comply with its mandate to work 10 days a month from office.

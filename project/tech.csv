This ""25 squared"" approach sees client-facing roles grow 25% while backend positions shrink, boosting output. AI saves millions of hours annually on routine tasks, allowing consultants to focus on complex challenges and unique human skills like judgment and creativity.

AI agents save McKinsey 1.5 million hours annually

What young professionals should focus on





McKinsey is experiencing a workforce transformation driven by AI, with its top boss revealing that the consulting giant now employs 25,000 AI agents alongside 40,000 human employees—and expects those numbers to match by year's end.Bob Sternfels, McKinsey's global managing partner, shared these insights during a Consumer Electronics Show appearance in Las Vegas, outlining what he calls the ""25 squared"" approach. Client-facing roles—the consultants who work directly with clients—are growing by 25%. Meanwhile, non-client-facing positions have shrunk by roughly the same percentage, even as output from those roles increased 10%.""Our model has always been synonymous that growth only occurs with total head count growth. Now it's actually splitting,"" Sternfels explained. The firm can now expand its client-facing workforce while reducing backend roles, still achieving overall growth—something he described as a new paradigm for the company.The productivity gains have been substantial. McKinsey saved 1.5 million hours last year alone on search and synthesis work—tasks typically handled by junior employees. The firm's AI agents have also generated 2.5 million charts in the past six months, freeing up consultants to tackle more complex problems.Sternfels said this shift means McKinsey consultants are ""moving up the stack"" rather than spending time on routine tasks that AI can handle efficiently.For those entering the workforce, Sternfels identified three skills AI can't replicate: the ability to set aspirations, human judgment, and genuine creativity. He emphasized that AI models work through inference—predicting the next likely step—but lack the capacity for truly orthogonal thinking that breaks existing patterns.The AI transformation also extends to hiring practices. Sternfels suggested companies should focus less on where candidates went to school and more on demonstrable skills, like reviewing a tech candidate's GitHub portfolio rather than their university credentials.","McKinsey now employs 25,000 AI agents alongside 40,000 human employees.

Microsoft AI CEO to all the companies working on AI: I worry we are...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ai-ceo-to-all-the-companies-working-on-ai-i-worry-we-are-/articleshow/126455651.cms,"Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman urges the industry to prioritize containment over alignment in AI development, warning against pursuing superintelligence without first ensuring control. He advocates for a ""Humanist Superintelligence"" approach, focusing on practical applications like medical AI and clean energy, to maintain human oversight and avoid uncontrolled autonomous systems.

Containment must come before alignment, says Suleyman

Microsoft CEO 'Thrilled' About India's Growing Data Centre Capacity, Details Meet With PM Modi

Medical AI and energy solutions at the heart of Microsoft's approach





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has a blunt message for the artificial intelligence industry: stop confusing control with cooperation. In a pointed critique of how companies are racing toward superintelligence, Suleyman argued that the industry is dangerously blurring the line between containment—actually limiting what AI can do—and alignment, which is about making AI care enough not to harm humans.""You can't steer something you can't control,"" he wrote in a recent post on X. ""Containment has to come first—or alignment is the equivalent of asking nicely."" It's a warning that cuts to the heart of AI development: before teaching these systems to want the right things, we need to ensure we can stop them from doing the wrong things.The distinction matters because the AI industry often treats containment and alignment as interchangeable goals, Suleyman explained. But they represent different technical and philosophical challenges. Containment is about enforcing limits and restricting agency—essentially keeping AI systems within predetermined boundaries.Alignment, meanwhile, addresses whether these systems will act in humanity's best interests. According to Suleyman, pursuing alignment without first establishing robust containment is putting the cart before the horse.This warning comes as Suleyman positions Microsoft as a counterweight to what he sees as reckless development practices elsewhere in the industry. In his recent essay ""Towards Humanist Superintelligence,"" published on the Microsoft AI blog, he outlined a vision for AI that prioritizes human control and domain-specific applications over unbounded, autonomous systems. He told Bloomberg in a December interview that containment and alignment should be ""red lines"" that no company crosses, though he acknowledged this represents ""a novel position in the industry at the moment. ""Suleyman's proposed alternative—what he calls Humanist Superintelligence—focuses on practical applications like medical diagnostics and clean energy rather than general-purpose artificial general intelligence. Microsoft AI recently developed a system that achieved 85% accuracy on the New England Journal of Medicine's notoriously difficult case challenges, compared to roughly 20% for human doctors.The former DeepMind co-founder, who joined Microsoft 18 months ago, believes this domain-specific approach delivers superintelligence-level capabilities while avoiding the most severe control problems. With the revised OpenAI agreement now allowing Microsoft to pursue independent AI development, Suleyman is assembling what he calls the world's best superintelligence research team—one explicitly designed to keep humans in the driver's seat.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman urges the industry to prioritize containment over alignment in AI development.

"Amazon has ‘228,000 square-foot’ plan to take on Walmart, Target",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-has-228000-square-foot-plan-to-take-on-walmart-target/articleshow/126451567.cms,"What Amazon’s brick-and-mortar ‘supercentre’ will offer



Amazon gets into direct competition with Walmart







Amazon is planning a direct challenge to Walmart and Target. The e-commerce giant is preparing to launch a massive new brick-and-mortar retail store near Chicago. Earlier this week, officials in Orland Park, Illinois, approved plans for a 228,000-square-foot mega store that rivals the size of a modern Walmart Supercenter.According to a report by Business Insider, the facility will be a departure from Amazon’s existing physical retail experiments, moving beyond the grocery-centric focus to the “hypermarket” model. The store is said to be designed as a hybrid of a traditional department store and a high-tech fulfillment center.Citing planning documents, the report lists that the Amazon facility will offer a wide range of products including apparel, housewares and electronics, and a food section including prepared meals. It will also house large integrated storeroom to handle “rush” online order pickups and local deliveries.Katie Jahnke Dale, an attorney for Amazon, described the project as a “more purpose-built and thoughtful” approach to the big-box format.“This is a retail concept, a retail store, albeit with perhaps a larger storeroom in the back, which will allow us to enhance the customer experience,” she was quoted as saying.Walmart has dominated the American market with approximately 4,600 stores. Amazon has topped that online sales but has lacked a large-scale physical footprint to compete for the “one-stop-shop” weekly routine. Amazon reportedly generated over $100 billion in grocery sales in 2024 through its 500+ Whole Foods and 58 Amazon Fresh locations but those formats are significantly smaller and more specialised.","E-commerce giant is preparing to launch a massive new brick-and-mortar retail store near Chicago.

OpenAI cofounder disagrees with CEO Sam Altman on AGI timeline





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently shared what he sees as a key test for the next stage of artificial intelligence (AI). As companies race to build AI agents that can act independently, Suleyman said he is watching for a milestone he calls Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI) on the path toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). He said that the test is simple in context but difficult in execution – whether an AI agent can legally take $1,00,000 and turn it into $1 million. He described the test as “modern turing test”, suggesting it will show how AI systems can plan, reason, make decisions and operate within real-word rules.“The next big milestone I'm watching for on our way to AGI: Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI). Can an agent take $100k and legally turn it into $1M? To me that's the modern Turing Test,” Mustafa Suleyman wrote in a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter).Suleyman’s comments come as several technology leaders including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff bet heavily on AI agents as the next major shift in enterprise software. Companies such as OpenAI, Salesforce, Microsoft and others are promoting agents that can carry out tasks with limited human input, from writing code to managing business workflows.Last year, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff called the rise of AI in the workforce a “digital labor revolution,” estimating that the software company has reached about 93% accuracy with the technology.In an interview with Bloomberg then, he revealed that AI is doing up to 50% of the work at Salesforce.In 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicted that AI could soon automate up to 40% of the tasks humans currently perform. He also claimed that AGI could arrive before 2030.Recently, OpenAI cofounder and AI researcher Andrej Karpathy pushed back against the “agentic AI” hype, characterizing the current generation of autonomous AI systems as “slop.” Karpathy has directly challenged the notion that autonomous AI agents are on the cusp of delivering as promised, positioning himself in contrast to the optimistic timelines often suggested by figures like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.“I feel like the industry is making too big of a jump and is trying to pretend like this is amazing, and it’s not. It’s slop,"" Karpathy said on The Dwarkesh Podcast.“They’re not coming to terms with it, and maybe they’re trying to fundraise or something like that. We’re at this intermediate stage,” he added.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman proposes a new test for advanced AI: can an agent legally grow $100,000 into $1 million?

""All of us have this armour. And when patient coaching runs out, I penetrate this armour. Me being angry is also because I care,""

What is Eternal CEO Deepinder Goyal said about ‘rock bottom phase’



""rock bottom""

""I call this rock bottom, where I hurt people, their self-confidence completely goes for a toss. I do this with people who I think have insane potential, but something in their head is coming in their way,

""

""Over time, the success rate of this is four out of five, where they come out of it,”





Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO of Zomato 's parent company Eternal, has revealed that he asked Albinder Dhindsa to step down from his role twice shortly after the food delivery service acquired Blinkit. Goyal explained that this move was part of his tough leadership reset method. Speaking on a video podcast with Raj Shamani, Goyal noted that these conversations took place soon after the acquisition of the quick commerce startup, when Dhindsa was struggling to adapt to the changes required after the integration.Goyal said on the podcast.These remarks offer a rare public look at how Goyal handles senior leadership changes at Eternal, which owns both Zomato and Blinkit, especially when founders or top executives need to adapt to a new company structure after an acquisition. Goyal explained his leadership style involves extended periods of coaching, but if no progress is made, he confronts the person directly.he noted.The situation reveals the challenges that can arise when successful startup founders join larger organisations through acquisitions and must adjust their working style to fit the new company's expectations.Describing what he calls aphase, Goyal said he sometimes purposely breaks down a leader's confidence to make them start fresh.he explained.According to Goyal, this method has worked most of the time.he added.However, Goyal did not confirm whether Dhindsa's job or duties officially changed during this time. Still, his comments show how intense the process was of bringing Blinkit into Eternal, especially as the company was growing both Blinkit and Zomato while facing more competition in quick commerce.Zomato bought Blinkit, which was previously known as Grofers, in 2022 for Rs 4,447 crore, or about $568 million at the time, in an all-stock deal. This marked Zomato's official entry into India's rapidly growing quick commerce business. Since buying the company, Blinkit has become a key growth area for Eternal, opening many new stores and handling more and more orders.","Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO of Zomato's parent company Eternal, has revealed that he asked Albinder Dhindsa to step down from his role twice shortly after the acquisition of Blinkit.

Indonesia becomes first country to block Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot over generating explicit deepfakes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/indonesia-becomes-first-country-to-block-elon-musks-grok-chatbot-over-generating-explicit-deepfakes/articleshow/126453762.cms,"Indonesia has become the first nation to block Elon Musk's Grok chatbot over concerns about its ability to generate explicit imagery, including non-consensual sexual deepfakes. The government cited human rights and digital security violations. This action follows international scrutiny, with Australia also raising alarms about exploitative content creation.

What Indonesia said about temporarily blocking the Grok chatbot

“The government views the practice of non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and the security of citizens in the digital space.”

“The use of generative AI to exploit or sexualise people without their consent is abhorrent. The fact that this tool was used so that people were using its image creation function through Grok is, I think, just completely abhorrent. It, once again, is an example of social media not showing social responsibility, and Australians, and indeed, global citizens, deserve better,”

“X, Grok and a wide range of other services are also subject to systemic safety obligations to detect and remove child sexual exploitation material and other unlawful material as part of Australia's world-leading industry codes and standards,""





Indonesia became the first country to deny access to Elon Musk-owned xAI’s Grok chatbot following concerns about its ability to generate explicit imagery. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, this move came after the country’s officials identified risks related to the generation of pornographic material. The Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Digital Affairs stated that the tool lacked sufficient safeguards to prevent the creation of non-consensual sexual deepfakes, which the government categorises as a violation of human rights and digital security.The move follows international scrutiny from regulators in Europe and Asia regarding Grok's output. Recent reports indicated that the chatbot had been used to produce sexualised images, including depictions involving minors. In response to these concerns, xAI, the developer of Grok, announced that it would restrict image-generation and editing features to paying subscribers while improving its safety filters.In a statement to Reuters, Meutya Hafid, Indonesia’s Communications and Digital Minister, said,The Reuters report also noted that the ministry has even called upon X officials to discuss the matter. Indonesia has strict rules that ban people from sharing content deemed obscene online.Earlier this week, Musk took to the microblogging site X to say that anyone using Grok to create illegal content would face the same consequences as if they had uploaded it. Musk has also faced threats of fines, regulatory action, and reports of a possible ban on X in the UK.The AI tool has been reportedly used to change images of women to remove their clothes and place them in sexual positions. However, this feature has now been turned off for everyone except paying subscribers.Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has also raised concerns about the use of the Grok chatbot to create exploitative sexual content. Last week, he joined other international leaders, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, in criticising X.Albanese said to reporters.While the number of reports received by Australia's eSafety Office remains small, it says there has been a recent increase related to the use of Grok to create sexual or exploitative images. The watchdog recently warned that it would use its powers, including issuing removal notices, where such material doesn’t meet the standards set out in the Online Safety Act.the Australian regulator said.","Indonesia has blocked access to Elon Musk-owned xAI’s Grok chatbot over concerns about its ability to generate explicit imagery.

Oracle has announced the departure of two of its oldest directors from the board. The software company filed a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) informing the same. As revealed by the company, George H. Conrades, 86 retired from Oracle after 18 years of service. Similarly, Naomi O. Seligman, 87 retired as a director after 20 years of service to the company. In the filing, the company said neither of the retirement was result of any dispute or disagreement.

Michael Burry to Donald Trump: This is the only hope to 'keep up with China',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/michael-burry-to-donald-trump-this-is-the-only-hope-to-keep-up-with-china/articleshow/126451476.cms,"AI boom fuels energy concerns





One of America’s biggest investor Michael Burry who is known for predicting the mid-2000s housing bubble has now urged the US President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance to fast-track a $1 trillion nuclear power and grid expansion plan. In a post on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Burry argued that deploying small nuclear reactors nationwide and building a hardened national grid is the only way for the US to meet the increasing electricity demand which is driven by artificial intelligence. Burry also feels that this is only way in which we canhope to keep up with China, stressing that abundant energy is important for long-term national security and managing US debt.“If had the ear @JDVance @LeaderJohnThune , I would ask them to take a trillion dollars (since trillions just get thrown around like millions now) and bypass all the protests and regulations and dot the whole country with small nuclear reactors, while also building a brand-new, state-of-the-art grid for everyone. Do this as soon as possible and secure it all from attack with the latest physical and cybersecurity; maybe even create a special Nuclear Defense Force that protects each facility, funded federally.This is the only hope of getting enough power to keep up with China, and it is the only hope we have as a country to grow enough to ultimately pay off our debt and guarantee long-term security, by not letting power be a limiting factor on our innovation,” wrote Burry.The comments made by Burry come as AI data centers and advanced manufacturing facilities drive unprecedented electricity demand. The US power consumption is also projected to increase by 2.6% annually through 2030. Analysts also warn that shortages could lead to constrain innovation and economic growth.Daniel Newman CEO of Futurum Group echoed Burry’s concerns. Newman said regulatory hurdles are the biggest obstacle to sustaining the AI revolution. “Four words about AI that I never planned to say: Michael Burry is right,” Newman posted, adding that regulation is the “single biggest bottleneck” to achieving AI ambitions.He dismissed fears of an AI bubble, arguing demand is real but power constraints threaten progress. “We cannot energize the data centers we will need … if we don’t speed up the buildout of energy and remove the mass of regulation that slows ‘breaking ground,’” Newman said.Elon Musk has previously predicted that solar power will ultimately dominate global energy supply, calling it “by far the biggest source of power for civilization.” Meanwhile, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya warned that grid strain could cause electricity prices to double within five years.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has also cautioned that AI’s long‑term growth will be limited not by chips, but by access to electricity.",Investor Michael Burry has urged the US President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance to fast-track a $1 trillion nuclear power and grid expansion plan.

Nvidia launched social listening campaign for DGX Spark





Nvidia not just builds one of the best products in the industry but also keeps a close eye on the public criticism of its hardware. Internal documents from the world’s biggest chipmaker in terms of market cap have pulled back the curtain on a ‘social listening’ campaign led by CEO Jensen Huang. The company mobilised its staff, including top engineers, to perform damage control after a customer publicly criticised DGX Spark, a desktop AI system designed for medical and data science researchers.Citing an email chain and internal documents, a report by Business Insider has said that that when a top executive at pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca called the system's software experience “buggy and unstable” on LinkedIn, Huang personally intervened with a direct command to his team: “Jump on X and say you will fix.”The report said that company engineers quickly identified the problem as a version mismatch in CUDA foundational AI software, and resolved the issue directly with the client. Launched in October last year, the “DGX Spark” is envisioned by Huang as the “ultimate developer’s platform,” but early adopters soon took to social media to complain of software instability and performance bugs.The leaked emails reportedly also reveal that Nvidia didn't stop at one customer, and the the chipmaker launched a social listening campaign to monitor Reddit, Nvidia forums and influential LinkedIn figures for complaints regarding heating, pricing and performance.In another case, researcher Christopher Kouzios purchased the DGX Spark to study rare brain tumors following the death of his daughter. He publicly criticised the system for being “unusable” due to software incompatibility. After Nvidia executives flagged the post, the team bypassed standard support protocols to fix the bug.Kouzios later praised the company, and told Business Insider he had never seen a tech giant respond so quickly to public feedback in his 33-year career.According to industry analysts, this aggressive level of customer service is fueled by stock-price sensitivities.","Internal documents from the world’s biggest chipmaker have pulled back the curtain on a ‘social listening’ campaign led by CEO Jensen Huang.

Nvidia has hired Alison Wagonfeld as its first chief marketing officer, marking a strategic shift for the AI chipmaker as it looks to sharpen its brand amid explosive growth. Wagonfeld, who spent nearly a decade at Google leading marketing for its cloud business, will report directly to CEO Jensen Huang and consolidate marketing functions that were previously scattered across multiple executives.The appointment, announced on LinkedIn, comes as Nvidia rides an unprecedented wave fueled by the AI boom. The company posted record sales of $57 billion last quarter—a 62% jump from the previous year—cementing its position as the go-to supplier for chips powering everything from ChatGPT to autonomous vehicles.Wagonfeld takes charge of the entire marketing and communications team starting February. In her post, she described the role as overseeing marketing ""as Nvidia embarks on its next phase of growth,"" a telling nod to the company's ambitions beyond its current AI dominance.Read Alison Wagonfeld’s LinkedIn postSharing some personal news! After nearly 10 years of building Google Cloud from a promising start-up in 2016 to a thriving $60B run-rate business today, I will be leaving Google in late January to join NVIDIA as its Chief Marketing Officer. I’m excited to be joining Jensen’s leadership team in a new role heading up marketing and communications as NVIDIA embarks on its next phase of growth.It’s been such a privilege to lead Google Cloud Marketing through so many chapters of growth.

They argue that allowing such material undermines the tech giants' moderation claims and app store safety assurances. This action follows intense global criticism and regulatory scrutiny over AI-generated harmful content.

“immediately remove the X and Grok apps from their app stores until the company's Chief Executive Officer, Elon Musk, addresses these disturbing and likely illegal activities.”

“Turning a blind eye to X's egregious behaviour would make a mockery of your moderation practices,”

“undermine your claims in public and in court that your app stores offer a safer user experience than letting users download apps directly to their phones.”

Why Elon Musk’s xAI and Grok chatbot facing backlash

“deepfake”

“A descendant of Holocaust survivors was ‘digitally stripped’”

“anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.”





Three US senators have written an open letter to Apple and Google . In the letter, which is addressed to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai , the senators have asked both companies to remove X and Grok apps from their respective app stores until owner Elon Musk stops users from creating and sharing non-consensual explicit images and child sexual abuse content.In the letter (as reviewed by CNBC), US senators Ron Wyden of Oregon, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, and Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico called on the tech giants toThe senators said that the apps currently allow users to generate and distribute illegal content through their platforms. They also added that ignoring X's serious violations would make Apple and Google's content moderation practices meaningless.the senators wrote, adding that a failure to take action wouldGrok and X have recently allowed users to create and widely circulate explicit, sexualisedcontent involving people who did not consent to their images being used in this way. Grok has also been used to generate images that insult or degrade people based on race or ethnicity.In one recent case, The Times of London reported thatby Grok after users prompted the AI tool to create an image of her wearing a bikini outside Auschwitz.These concerns have led to intense criticism and regulatory scrutiny from governments in Europe, Malaysia, Australia, and India. In contrast, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice have not yet said whether they plan to investigate **xAI**.Earlier this month, Elon Musk and X released statements saying thatBoth Apple and Google have strict app developer rules that require steps to prevent the sharing of child sexual abuse material and other harmful or explicit content. Earlier, apps such as Tumblr and Telegram were temporarily removed from Apple’s App Store for failing to control inappropriate material adequately.More recently, X reportedly restricted Grok’s AI image generation tools to paying subscribers. However, Grok’s standalone app and website still allowed users to prompt the system to digitally undress, sexualise, or demean people without their consent.According to CNN, recent Grok feature changes and the limited safety controls were pushed by Musk. The report added that three members of xAI’s safety team announced their departures on X following these demands.Despite the backlash, xAI said this week that it raised $20 billion in new funding from investors, including Nvidia and Cisco Investments, as well as long-time Musk-linked backers such as Valour Equity Partners, StepStone Group, Fidelity, the Qatar Investment Authority, MGX, and Baron Capital Group.","US senators Ron Wyden, Ed Markey, and Ben Ray Luján have written an open letter to Apple and Google.

‘Human intervention needed in complex codes’





Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has shared insights from a code review of C++ generated by Anothropic’s LLM, saying that he was impressed but thinks that AI still have room for development. He also suggested that LLMs coding still need human intervention but there has been a significant improvement in such capabilities in the last two years.According to Vembu, the review went on for hours in the tech town hall and it provided him a clear understanding on how LLMs work.“Yesterday we had a tech town hall in Zoho where we did a code review of the C++ code generated by the Claude Opus 4.5 model. It went on for hours late evening,” Vembu said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).“I now have a much clearer understanding of what these models do well: they are able to stitch together systems well, taking data from one system, reshape it and pass it to another system. There is often a lot of such ""glue code"" in these systems and that is not very complicated but it is very tedious,” he added.He also highlighted AI's strength in creating tedious “glue code” for system integration but noted that its tendency toward verbose outputs and reliance on memorised open-source patterns.“In general, AI models have ""memorized"" all the open source too and they are able to recall patterns from them (with some possibility of hallucination). They are also able to stitch various open source pieces together well,” Vembu pointed out.Vembu also highlighted that human orchestration proved essential during their review as it ensured usable results. He said that while AI excels at stitching components but it struggles with complexity.“Our senior engineer had guided (""orchestrated"" is the right word) this process. When the AI was stuck he helped ""unstuck"" it. This was a very vital contribution and without his experienced guidance, the AI output would not be useful,” he said.“We examined several C++ files with thousands of lines of code in each, looking for what I consider complex code. Most of it was straightforward glue code and only a tiny part of it was complex,” Vembu noted.“I suspect that the AI generated code tended to be needlessly verbose but I have to study it more to be sure. On the whole, I am both impressed and not super awed. I believe we can do better,” he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has shared insights from a code review of C++ generated by Anothropic’s LLM.

New search filters rolled out by YouTube



Dedicated Content Types: We’ve added a new Shorts filter to the 'Type' menu. This gives viewers more control over whether they see Shorts or VODs (long-form videos) in their search results, so you can find exactly what you’re looking for, regardless of format.

'Prioritize' Menu: The 'Sort By' menu has been renamed to 'Prioritize'. This refined sorting menu aims to maximize utility.

'Popularity' Filter: The 'View count' sort option has been renamed to 'Popularity'. This filter allows you to easily locate popular videos related to your search queries. Our systems assess a video's view count and other relevance signals, such as watch time, to determine its popularity for that specific query.





YouTube has rolled out new search filters which are designed to make finding videos easier and more intuitive. “We’ve heard your feedback and are enhancing the search experience by updating our filters to make them more effective and intuitive for everyone. Our goal is to equip you with more effective advanced search tools, ensuring you can consistently and efficiently locate the content you love,” said the company. One of the biggest changes rolled out by YouTube is a dedicated Short Filter which will enable users to specifically browse short-form clips or long-form videos. The update also reflects YouTube’s push to highlight its fast-growing Shorts format which competes directly with TikTok and Instagram Reels.We have made some key additions and renames to ensure our sorting options align better with your expectations:To streamline the experience, YouTube has removed two filters: Upload Date – Last Hour and Sort by Rating. The company said these options were not functioning as intended and contributed to user confusion. Broader upload date filters, such as “Today,” “This week,” and “This year,” remain available. “We are simplifying and reorganizing the filter menu to make it more intuitive and improve the overall search experience.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft has announced multiple new AI tools that will let users buy products directly within the Copilot chatbot, without being redirected to external websites. Known as Copilot Checkout, the feature is now available in the US through partnerships with payment and commerce platforms, including PayPal , Shopify, and Stripe. The Copilot Checkout tool will allow online shoppers to ask for recommendations, compare options, and pay for items within a single chat window on Copilot. Early partners for this rollout include retailers such as Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Ashley Furniture, and various Etsy sellers.

Cost factor works for Chinese robots





Tesla CEO Elon Musk 's big concern about China dominating the humanoid robots sector and leaving America behind was wide at display at this year's Consumer Electronic Show (CES) in Las Vegas. Chinese-made human-like robots were everywhere across the exhibition floor. One could see them playing table tennis, sweeping floors, practicing Kung Fu and more. In April 2025, Elon Musk warned America during a conference call that while he believes that Tesla Optimus robots lead in performance, China might ultimately dominate the field. ""I'm a little concerned that on the leaderboard, ranks 2 through 10 will be Chinese companies,"" Musk said, as reported by Bloomberg.As analysts say, China’s latest robotics innovations were delivered to the heart of America’s technology showcase, serving as a constant reminder of the technological race between the world’s two biggest economies. Several big and small Chinese robot creators occupied booths with their machines.Tencent-backed Agibot unveiled Genie Sim 3.0, its next-generation simulation platform. Genie Sim 3.0 is reportedly built on Nvidia Isaac Sim, which provides more realistic virtual environments for training and testing robots.Agibot, which made its US debut at CES, told Bloomberg that the system will cut training time and costs, and make it easier to transfer skills from simulation to the real world. Like many Chinese humanoid robot makers, Agibot hopes to expand overseas this year. A company official, who didn't want to be named, said that it plans to target markets with labor shortages, such as Japan, as well as countries like the US, where robots could also play promotional or entertainment roles.Chinese startups including EngineAI, Unitree, AgiBot and Galbot are leveraging artificial intelligence to help robots learn new tasks independently. Humanoid robot makers in China accounted for the vast majority of the roughly 13,000 units shipped globally last year, far outstripping US companies like Tesla Inc. and Figure AI in sheer volume, according to research firm Omdia. China’s leadership now may help the country as the number of robots is projected to surge to 648 million in 2050, according to research from Citigroup Inc.“Chinese vendors are setting benchmarks in large-scale production,” Omdia said. Pricing too reportedly works for Chinese humanoid robots as they are cheaper than Western-made models, with Unitree offering an entry-level model for just $6,000 and AgiBot asking about $14,000 for a scaled-down version. By comparison, Elon Musk has previously given a price range of $20,000 to $30,000 for Tesla's Optimus humanoid robots, which haven’t yet reached full-scale production.Omdia expects global humanoid robot shipments growing to 2.6 million units in 2035 as factors including AI models, dexterous hands and self-reinforcement learning have made the robots viable for industrial, service and eventual household roles. The research firm’s report covers two-legged humanoid robots as well as wheeled-based products with a human-like upper torso.Reports suggest that China is trying to build a globally competitive industrial ecosystem for humanoid robots, which government policies have prioritized as ""disruptive products,"" with the market expected to reach $43 billion by 2035.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk's big concern about China dominating the humanoid robots sector and leaving America behind was wide at display at this year's Consumer Electronic Show (CES) in Las Vegas.

Cloudflare CEO to Italy: You have no right to regulate what is and is not allowed on Internet outside your borders; calls Elon Musk right; read the wrong 'angry note',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/cloudflare-ceo-to-italy-you-have-no-right-to-regulate-what-is-and-is-not-allowed-on-internet-outside-your-borders-calls-elon-musk-right-read-the-wrong-angry-note/articleshow/126442657.cms,"Cloudflare CEO's complete X post slamming Italy





Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince is very upset with Italy. The reason is $17 million fine imposed on the company for defying Piracy Shield, a censorship tool lacking due process. Earlier this week, Italy’s communications regulator, AGCOM, slapped the San Francisco-based internet infrastructure giant with a €14 million ($17 million) fine for refusing to comply with the country’s Piracy Shield system. The penalty, the first major enforcement under a 2023 Italian law. Piracy Shield reportedly mandates that domain-name system providers like Cloudflare block access to websites accused of hosting pirated content within 30 minutes of notification from rights holders -- without court orders, appeals, or transparency. In a series of posts on X, formerly Twitter, Cloudflare CEO lashed out at Italy. “No judicial oversight. No due process. No appeal. No transparency,” he wrote, highlighting risks to even Cloudflare’s own 1.1.1.1 public DNS resolver.He further complained that the fine imposed is calculated as up to 2% of Cloudflare’s global revenue despite the company’s mere $8 million in Italian sales in 2024. Italy’s move comes amid rising European pressures on American technology companies that the Donald Trump government has been protesting over.Pointing to the same, Cloudflare CEO thanked US VP JD Vance and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.Yesterday a quasi-judicial body in Italy fined @Cloudflare $17 million for failing to go along with their scheme to censor the Internet. The scheme, which even the EU has called concerning, required us within a mere 30 minutes of notification to fully censor from the Internet any sites a shadowy cabal of European media elites deemed against their interests. No judicial oversight. No due process. No appeal. No transparency. It required us to not just remove customers, but also censor our 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver meaning it risked blacking out any site on the Internet. And it required us not just to censor the content in Italy but globally. In other words, Italy insists a shadowy, European media cabal should be able to dictate what is and is not allowed online.That, of course, is DISGUSTING and even before yesterday’s fine we had multiple legal challenges pending against the underlying scheme. We, of course, will now fight the unjust fine. Not just because it’s wrong for us but because it is wrong for democratic values.In addition, we are considering the following actions: 1) discontinuing the millions of dollars in pro bono cyber security services we are providing the upcoming Milano-Cortina Olympics; 2) discontinuing Cloudflare’s Free cyber security services for any Italy-based users; 3) removing all servers from Italian cities; and 4) terminating all plans to build an Italian Cloudflare office or make any investments in the country.Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. While there are things I would handle differently than the current U.S. administration, I appreciate @JDVance taking a leadership role in recognizing this type of regulation is a fundamental unfair trade issue that also threatens democratic values. And in this case @ElonMusk is right: #FreeSpeech is critical and under attack from an out-of-touch cabal of very disturbed European policy makers.I will be in DC first thing next week to discuss this with U.S. administration officials and I’ll be meeting with the IOC in Lausanne shortly after to outline the risk to the Olympic Games if @Cloudflare withdraws our cyber security protection.In the meantime, we remain happy to discuss this with Italian government officials who, so far, have been unwilling to engage beyond issuing fines. We believe Italy, like all countries, has a right to regulate the content on networks inside its borders. But they must do so following the Rule of Law and principles of Due Process. And Italy certainly has no right to regulate what is and is not allowed on the Internet in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, China, Brazil, India or anywhere outside its borders.THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FIGHT AND WE WILL WIN!!!","Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince is very upset with Italy.

Meta has announced agreements with three nuclear power providers as the company aims to secure necessary resources for its AI ambitions. The Facebook-parent company has struck deals with Vistra, TerraPower and Oklo – all of which are working on nuclear power technologies. The company wants to use the power for Meta’s Prometheus supercluster computing system that’s being built at a data centre in New Albany, Ohio.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg first unveiled the Prometheus project in July, identifying it as the foundational infrastructure for developing “superintelligence.” The system is currently under construction at a data center in New Albany, Ohio, and is expected to go online later this year. Meta anticipates these new nuclear partnerships will add 6.6 gigawatts of carbon-free power to the grid by 2035.According to a report by CNBC, Meta will provide funding to extend the lifespan and boost the output of Vistra’s existing nuclear plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The company is also funding two projects currently under development, targeted for a 2032 startup. The deal includes an option for Meta to obtain power rights from six additional TerraPower projects by 2035.Thirdly, Meta will utilise Oklo’s ""advanced nuclear technology campus"" in Pike County, Ohio, which is slated to become operational as soon as 2030. Oklo is particularly notable due to its ties to OpenAI as CEO Sam Altman is one of the company’s largest investors.Meta previously joined Amazon and Google in a global pledge to triple nuclear energy production by 2050. This follows a 20-year agreement Meta signed in June with Constellation Energy to tap into the Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois starting in 2027.“State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America’s position as a global leader in AI,” said Joel Kaplan, Meta’s policy chief. Beyond technology, Meta claims the projects will generate “thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of long-term operational jobs”.","Facebook-parent company has struck deals with Vistra, TerraPower and Oklo.

Nikon has launched its latest Z-mount lens, the NIKKOR Z 24-105mm f/4-7.1, in India, bringing a versatile full-frame zoom option to its mirrorless lineup at an accessible price point of Rs 49,995.The new standard zoom covers everything from wide-angle landscapes at 24mm to medium-telephoto portraits and distant subjects at 105mm. Despite this flexibility, it weighs just 350 grams—light enough to comfortably carry through extended shooting sessions without causing fatigue.Close-up photography is where the lens shows some real promise. It focuses as close as 0.2 meters at the wide end and 0.28 meters when zoomed in, with a maximum reproduction ratio of 0.5× between 70-105mm. That's enough magnification to capture flowers, food, and small details with pleasing background blur that isolates your subject.Video shooters get a stepping motor that delivers fast, quiet autofocus without the distracting whirring sounds that can ruin audio. The lens also includes a customizable control ring that can be assigned to adjust focus, aperture, exposure compensation, or ISO sensitivity—whatever fits your shooting style.One of the highlights of this lens is its ability to work with Hi-Res Zoom on the following Nikon bodies: Z9, Z8, Z6III, Z5II, Zf, Z50II, and ZR. This has an effective range of 210mm, allowing for more flexibility when the photographer is not close enough to take a clear shot of the subject.Nikon has also included dust and drip resistance, although these are not touted as making the camera completely weather-tight. However, it is comforting to know that these are features in case the weather does not behave as expected.The NIKKOR Z 24-105mm f/4-7.1 will be available at Nikon outlets across India from mid-January 2026.","Nikon has launched its latest Z-mount lens, the NIKKOR Z 24-105mm f/4-7.1, in India.

Why TikTok may be planning to split up its US workforce







ByteDance may not allow all American TikTok employees to join the newly proposed US-based entity. Instead, the social media company is reportedly planning to split its US employees between two different corporate units. A report citing the company’s internal memos claimed that a portion of TikTok’s US workforce will join a new joint venture called TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC. Meanwhile, others will remain under a global entity owned by ByteDance, TT Commerce & Global Services LLC.According to a Business Insider report, staff assignments will be determined as per specific job roles and their relationship to the platform's global infrastructure. Employees focused on data protection and algorithm security are expected to be designated for the USDS Joint Venture, which will be led by investors including Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX.On the other hand, staff members working on commercial activities such as e-commerce, advertising, and marketing are expected to remain with the global entity, as these products remain tied to TikTok’s international operations.This transition, which is reportedly scheduled to conclude by January 22, is a part of ByteDance's broader effort to separate US operations from the parent company. TikTok CEO Shou Chew also reportedly informed staff that this structure will allow for the continuation of global commercial services while placing sensitive security functions under the oversight of the new US-led venture.If the TikTok deal happens, Oracle, MGX, and Silver Lake would each own 15% of the new US joint venture. Companies connected to current ByteDance investors would get around 30%. While 5% of the company would go to a group of new investors yet to be named. Finally, ByteDance would retain just under 20% to comply with US ownership rules that forced the sale.The law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, requires companies based in countries the US considers foreign adversaries to sell their American operations or pay hefty fines. In this law, Congress specifically mentioned TikTok and China-based ByteDance. TikTok tried to fight the law in court but lost when the Supreme Court ruled against the company in January 2024.Last year, US President Donald Trump allowed the app to keep operating through executive orders while his administration worked with TikTok and potential buyers on a deal. In September 2025, the White House announced that an agreement had been reached with ByteDance. US Vice President JD Vance said the deal would value TikTok's US operations at around $14 billion.","The social media company is reportedly planning to split its US employees between two different corporate units.

What changes Microsoft may be bringing to GitHub teams

""agent factory"".

“GitHub is just not the place anymore where developers are storing code. We want it to be the centre of gravity for all of AI-powered software development,”





Microsoft has reportedly started making major changes to GitHub teams. A report claims that the software giant has begun reshuffling teams within GitHub to prioritise the development of AI agents. This internal reorganisation is meant to help the platform compete with a new wave of AI-based coding tools, according to the report, which cited people with knowledge of the situation.A Business Insider article claims that the reorganisation is the result of a strategic choice to update GitHub's essential features. Microsoft hopes to transform the way the platform manages software development tasks by shifting resources towards AI agents, going beyond its conventional function as a code repository.The modifications are made as other AI tools become more competitive with GitHub. Specifically, tools from AI startups such as Cursor and Anthropic’s Claude Code have entered the market, offering alternative AI-driven environments for developers that have gained traction recently.In 2018, Microsoft acquired GitHub for $7.5 billion. While the platform has maintained a large user base due to its established position in the industry, the company is now adjusting its workforce to respond to the shift toward generative AI and automated coding assistants.In January 2025, Microsoft created a new group focused on building AI tools. The group is led by Jay Parikh, who previously worked as a lead engineer at Facebook. The group, called CoreAI Platform and Tools, brought together Microsoft's developer division, AI platform team, and GitHub.However, Microsoft and GitHub have stayed somewhat separate. Over the past few months, the company has been moving people and resources around to coordinate work across areas like sales better, the report claimed, citing a source familiar with the matter. The recent change involves moving a small group of Microsoft engineers to GitHub.As per the report, the goal of this move is to better compete with AI coding tools that rival GitHub Copilot. The company also wants to build AI agents and fulfil Parikh's vision to create anIn an internal meeting last year, Parikh discussed the need to change GitHub to compete with Cursor and Claude Code, according to audio reviewed by Business Insider.Parikh said at the time.Microsoft wants GitHub's AI tools to be available wherever developers work, not just inside one app. The report added that the company intends to make GitHub a dashboard for managing multiple AI agents.The recent changes are also part of what Parikh said would be a new investment in improving GitHub's core features. In the meeting, Parikh said those include making improvements to GitHub Actions, a tool that automates building, testing, and deploying code.Other improvements include analytics and insights tools so teams can see how their code is performing, security features to keep code safe, and making sure the company can meet local data storage rules to offer GitHub in new countries.","Microsoft is reportedly reorganising GitHub teams to prioritize AI agent development, aiming to counter emerging AI coding tools.

In 2026, Gmail is tackling this problem by fully embracing the Gemini era, which will transform the traditional email application into an intelligent assistant. With the power of the Gemini 3, Gmail will be able to understand context, prioritise for urgency, and even answer questions embedded deep within years of emails. Simple but ambitious, the point of the change is to reduce inbox stress and let people take action faster.Threads in emails are among the greatest productivity killers. Decisive choices are engulfed by messages like delivery receipts, which are less important emails. AI Overviews solve this problem by summarising all the emails in a thread in a bite-sized, readable manner.In every case where a user asks a direct question to his or her mailbox, a direct answer is given by Gemini instead of a list of search results.The system is extremely useful in the case of applicable questions, for instance, in remembering the provider of a service, tracking decisions, and analysing previous agreements. Relevant answers to inquiries about information are acquired within seconds without manually browsing messages.Major advantages of AI overviews:The summaries for a conversation are being launched for all Gmail users, while the question-based AI Overviews are available for users of Google AI Pro/Ultra subscriptions.Sending emails can be a very repetitive task. However, automated emails tend to be impersonal in tone. Gemini-based writing assistance tries to maintain a smooth interface between speed and personal touch.is now in a position to write or edit a message with a greater appreciation for what is taking place within this conversation. Suggested Responses not only provide a way to respond through a series of phrases, and they also do this based on this conversation and your writing patterns. These responses have been written with a first draft that could have been written by yourself.Secondly,is another enhancement that evaluates grammar, tone, as well as the message’s clarity. It is not just looking to correct any grammatical errors, but rather to make sure that the tone is fitting for the circumstance. It is expected that further changes will offer even greater levels of personalisation because ‘Gmail is set to use information from various Google services in order to make the messages reflect the style that suits every individual. ’One of Gmail’s most anticipated changes is the AI Inbox, designed to cut through daily inbox noise. Rather than relying entirely on manual filters or categories, Gemini evaluates importance based on behaviour and relationships.The AI Inbox creates a brief overview of what requires attention, helping users focus on deadlines, reminders, and messages from important contacts. Less urgent emails remain accessible but no longer dominate the top of the inbox.What AI Inbox concentrates on the most:Google has announced that this process is all carried out in a secure and privacy-enhancing way. This service is currently undergoing trials with select users.All of these features are powered by Gemini 3, Google’s most advanced AI model so far. The rollout begins in the United States and in English, with more regions and languages planned over the coming months. Some tools are free for all Gmail users, while advanced capabilities are part of premium AI subscriptions.Taken together, these updates mark a turning point for Gmail. The Gemini era is not about replacing human judgment, but about removing friction, turning email into something that works quietly in the background, helping users stay organised, informed, and in control.For many years, Gmail’s strength lay in storage and search. Users learned to label, filter, and keyword-search their way through overflowing inboxes. Gemini changes this relationship entirely. Instead of expecting users to adapt to the system, Gmail now adapts to the user.Gemini allows Gmail to interpret conversations, recognise relationships, and understand intent across emails. This means the platform no longer treats messages as isolated items, but as connected information streams. Whether it’s a year-long renovation discussion or a short family exchange, Gmail can now grasp the bigger picture behind the words.","Summaries of lengthy or complicated e-mail messages or groups of messages.Natural language questions rather than keyword searches.Easier access to historical information contained in emails.

Google, Meta, Netflix, Microsoft, Amazon and other US technology companies may soon have good news in Europe. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the European Commission is planning to present a new proposal called the Digital Networks Act on January 20. The plan, led by EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen, aims to improve Europe’s competitiveness and increase investment in telecom infrastructure. The report quotes sources familiar with the matter who said that under the draft plan, the tech companies would be covered by a voluntary framework rather than binding rules. Telecom operators, in contrast, will continue to face mandatory obligations.The European Union has introduced several new technology laws in recent years, which have drawn criticism from the United States. US officials have argued that the rules unfairly target American tech companies, a claim the EU has rejected.One source said the companies would be encouraged to cooperate and share best practices through discussions overseen by EU telecom regulators, with no new legal requirements. ""They will be asked to cooperate and discuss voluntarily, moderated by EU telecoms regulators' group BEREC. There will be no new obligations.It will be a best practices regime,"" one of the sources told the publication.The proposal also includes measures to align rules on spectrum licensing across the EU. These would cover licence duration, sale conditions and pricing methods used in spectrum auctions. The plan also sets out guidance on fibre network rollout and allows countries to delay the 2030.","European Commission to present new proposal on January 20.

"Backed by Amazon, IXI Eyewear's smart glasses adjust focus using eye movements",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/backed-by-amazon-ixi-eyewears-smart-glasses-adjust-focus-using-eye-movements/articleshow/126434009.cms,"IXI Eyewear smartglasses (image credit: IXI Eyewear)

How IXI Eyewear’s adaptive lens technology works



Why IXI Eyewear’s smart glasses are different from Meta and Google’s approach



What the lenses look like in real use



Who these adaptive smart glasses are for



A quiet shift in how vision correction could work







A Finnish startup called IXI Eyewear is betting that the future of vision correction does not involve switching between reading glasses, progressives, or bifocals. Instead, it involves smart glasses with adaptive lenses that automatically adjust focus based on where your eyes are looking.The company has raised $40 million in funding, with backing from investors including Amazon, and says it plans to launch its first consumer product within the next year. The goal is simple on paper but difficult in practice: glasses that handle near and far vision on their own, without users having to think about it.No cameras. No augmented reality overlays. Just vision, corrected in real time.At the core of IXI’s product is a combination of eye-tracking sensors and liquid crystal lenses built directly into the frame. The sensors monitor subtle eye movements to determine whether the wearer is looking at something close up, like a phone, or farther away, like a road sign. The lenses then adjust their focus instantly.According to the company, as reported by CNN, all of this happens automatically and continuously. There is no manual switching, no visible transition, and no need to tilt your head into a “sweet spot,” which is a common frustration with progressive lenses.IXI’s current prototype weighs about 22 grams, roughly the same as standard lightweight eyeglasses. That detail matters. Heavy frames are one of the reasons earlier smart eyewear never made it into everyday use.Most smart glasses on the market today focus outward. Cameras. Microphones. AI features. Augmented reality displays. Companies like Meta and Google are chasing computing platforms that sit on your face.IXI is doing the opposite. Its glasses look inward. There are no outward-facing cameras and no social features baked in. The technology exists purely to solve a vision problem: how to see clearly at different distances without juggling multiple prescriptions.That narrow focus is deliberate. As per CNN reports, IXI CEO Niko Eiden says the company is not trying to replace smartphones or build an AR headset. It is trying to replace traditional corrective lenses.The adaptive lens design does come with trade-offs. The liquid crystal system is concentrated in the central portion of the lens, where vision clarity matters most.“The center part is the sharp area, and then there is the edge where the liquid crystal stops and which is not that great to look into,” Eiden told CNN. “But the center area is large enough that you can use that for reading.”In other words, there are distortions at the edges. IXI’s position is that most of the time, wearers will not notice them because natural vision tends to rely heavily on the center of the lens anyway.This is not entirely new territory, but it is the first time the company believes the technology is small and fast enough for daily wear.IXI has been clear that these glasses will sit at the high end of the eyewear market. Pricing has not been announced, but Eiden has said they will be positioned alongside premium prescription glasses, not budget frames.The target audience is people who currently rely on multiple pairs of glasses or struggle with progressive lenses. Presbyopia, age-related near-vision loss, is one of the biggest drivers.For these users, the appeal is straightforward. One pair of glasses. No compromises. No switching.There is something almost old-fashioned about IXI’s approach. While much of the tech industry chases attention and features, this product focuses on function. Seeing clearly. Comfortably. All day.The company has opened a waitlist on its website, though it has not said which regions will get access first. If IXI can deliver what it promises, these autofocus smart glasses could change how people think about corrective eyewear.Not by adding more technology to our lives, but by removing one small, daily frustration.","Finnish startup IXI Eyewear is betting that the future of vision correction does not involve switching between reading glasses, progressives, or bifocals.

Tesla Bull Ross Gerber calls Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD) system ‘problematic’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tesla-bull-ross-gerber-calls-tesla-full-self-driving-fsd-system-problematic/articleshow/126434413.cms,"Tesla’s autonomous push

Tesla bull Ross Gerber reveals he is not a Elon Musk fan





Tesla Bull Ross Gerber co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management has now sharply criticised CEO Elon Musk ’s claims about its car company’s autonomous driving ambitions. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Gerber accused Musk of making ‘hallucinations’ during conference calls that fail to materialise, pointing Tesla’s missed goal of launching driverless Robotaxis by the end of 2025.Gerber emphasised that Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) system remains ‘problematic’, despite offering Level 2 autonomy. While he previously praised improvements in the software, he has since highlighted persistent issues. “The robotaxis are still just Ubers. The robot is far from working. Car sales are falling,” Gerber wrote, adding that Tesla’s lofty valuation — with a price‑to‑earnings ratio near 300 — is unsustainable.“The CEO makes claims (hallucinations) on conference calls that don't even come remotely true... FSD still nags me at level 2. The robotaxis are still just Ubers. The robot is far from working. Car sales are falling.Yet the PE is 300. Something has got to give. $tsla Tesla continues to test its autonomous technology, with Musk recently claiming he was driven around in Austin in a Tesla Robotaxi. The company’s Cybercab prototype has been spotted in California and Texas, with Musk promising production scale‑up this year. He also commented on Nvidia’s new Alpamayo self‑driving platform, calling distribution the biggest challenge for scaling autonomy.Speaking at the Chasing Finance podcast, Gerber said, “I’m not a fan of Elon. But I’m not going to deny the fact he builds great products.” Gerber who is the co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki wealth and Investment Management has often been seen as one the Tesla’s most vocal bulls. Yet in recent months, he has grown increasingly critical of Musk’s leadership.In November, Gerber blasted Tesla for spending money to promote Musk’s $1 trillion compensation package, even as the company struggled to sell cars. Large investors, including Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, opposed the pay plan, citing dilution risks and Musk’s outsized influence. Despite his frustrations, Gerber acknowledged Musk’s relentless work ethic and ability to build companies that command investor premiums. “He’s built some big companies and he’s succeeded,” Gerber said.",Ross Gerber is the co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management.

EU to Google: Give rival AI services equal access to Android or…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/eu-to-google-give-rival-ai-services-equal-access-to-android-or/articleshow/127641144.cms,"The EU has launched proceedings against Google to ensure fair competition under the Digital Markets Act.

Google pushes back, cites privacy concerns

Not a formal investigation yet





The European Commission has opened two specification proceedings to help Google comply with its obligations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), focusing on AI interoperability and search data access for rival platforms.The proceedings will guide Google on granting third-party AI service providers equal access to features on its Android operating system that its own services like Gemini currently enjoy. Brussels also wants clarity on how competing search engines can access anonymised ranking, query, click and view data from Google Search on fair terms.""We want to maximise the potential and the benefits of this profound technological shift by making sure the playing field is open and fair, not tilted in favour of the largest few,"" said Teresa Ribera, EU's Executive Vice-President for Competition.Google expressed reservations about the move. Clare Kelly, the company's Senior Competition Counsel, said Android is already open by design and that search data is being licensed to competitors under the DMA.""However, we are concerned that further rules which are often driven by competitor grievances rather than the interest of consumers, will compromise user privacy, security, and innovation,"" Kelly added.The Commission expects to wrap up proceedings within six months, during which it will share preliminary findings with Google and publish non-confidential summaries for third-party comments.These proceedings are not formal investigations and do not take a position on whether Google has violated the DMA. However, if the Commission remains unsatisfied with Google's compliance efforts, it can later conclude that the company is in breach of the rules. DMA violations can attract fines of up to 10 percent of a company's global turnover.Google was designated a gatekeeper under the DMA in September 2023 across multiple services including Search, Android, Chrome, YouTube and Google Play. The company has been required to comply with all applicable DMA obligations since March 2024.","The EU has launched proceedings against Google to ensure fair competition under the Digital Markets Act.

American TikTok users are deleting the app after US deal under new owners: This is the reason,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/american-tiktok-users-are-deleting-the-app-after-us-deal-under-new-owners-this-is-the-reason/articleshow/127631492.cms,"Why TikTok users are deleting app







TikTok has finally transitioned from a Chinese company to a majority US-owned app, and a report has indicated that users are not happy. Citing new data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, CNBC has reported that the high-profile deal to ‘save’ TikTok in the US has triggered a backlash with an increase in deletion of app by the daily average of US users. The publication says that in the five days following the announcement of a new American-led joint venture, users deleting the TikTok app has surged by nearly 150% compared to the previous three months.The report claims that the exodus began shortly after the newly-formed TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC prompted users to agree to an updated privacy policy. Some users quickly flagged language regarding the collection of sensitive data.As per the new policy, TikTok may collect data, including sensitive information such as “your racial or ethnic origin” as well as “sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, or financial information”. The report says that while this language has actually been present in TikTok’s policy since at least August 2024, its fueled a narrative of increased surveillance under the new American owners.“If I can delete my biggest platform because their terms of agreement and censorship have gotten out of control, so can you!” posted a creator Dre Ronayne, who walked away from nearly 400,000 followers on Sunday.Meanwhile, over the last two days, users and creators have reported widespread outages and failed video uploads. An X account associated with the joint venture attributed the service issues to a power outage at a US data centre.“We’re working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We’re sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon,” the account wrote.Sensor Tower data also suggests that TikTok’s active user levels in the US have remained relatively flat compared with the previous week.","TikTok has finally transitioned from a Chinese company to a majority US-owned app, and a report has indicated that users are not happy.

Sridhar Vembu: Engineering discipline matters

“I suggest the term ""AI-assisted Code Engineering"" with ACE as the acronym instead of ""vibe-coding"". We must have solid engineering discipline and ACE is the maturation of the tools and techniques”.

“It does not eliminate all software engineers but enables experienced engineers who ACE well to be much more productive,” he said, adding “It is also going to reshape our industry but that is a separate topic.”



What is vibe coding







Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has suggested a new way to describe vibe-coding, a word that became one of the biggest “headache” of engineers in 2025. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Vembu argued that the termdoes not reflect the discipline required in real engineering work. He said that he prefers a new termto describe the growing use of AI tools in writing and maintaining software. In the post, Vembu said the focus should remain on solid engineering practices, even as AI becomes more deeply embedded in coding workflows.Sharing the post, Sridhar Vembu wrote:Vembu says that the term ACE does not remove the need for software engineers. Instead, it allows experienced engineers to “be much more productive”.Vibe coding is a term used to describe a more informal, AI-driven approach to programming. It refers to building apps and websites by chatting with AI instead of writing code line by painstaking line.Vembu’s comments come at a time when AI-powered coding tools are being widely adopted by developers and companies to speed up software development. His remarks also highlight concerns among industry leaders that such language may underplay the importance of structure, accountability, and long-term reliability in software systems.Collins Dictionary named “vibe-coding” as its word of the year for 2025.","Vibe coding is a term used to describe a more informal, AI-driven approach to programming.

Quote of the day by Apple CEO Tim Cook: “I love museums. But I don’t want to …”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/quote-of-the-day-by-apple-ceo-tim-cook-i-love-museums-but-i-dont-want-to-/articleshow/126658877.cms,"Tim Cook (Image source: Reuters)

""I love museums. But I don't want to live in one""

What Tim Cook means by “loving museums”

Apple CEO Tim Cook (Image source: Bloomberg)

“I don’t want to live in one”: A warning against stagnation

A lesson in leadership and decision-making

Why the quote resonates beyond technology

A reflection of Tim Cook’s leadership style

Why the quote still matters

""I love museums. But I don't want to live in one""

,





Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple , doesn't give long speeches or use dramatic slogans. When he does say something, it's usually short, to the point, and well thought out. One of these lines is his quote:. The sentence is easy to understand, like a conversation. But it has a deeper meaning about how to move forward, how to be a leader, and how businesses and people should plan for the future.The quote is based on the idea that honouring the past should never be a reason to stop moving forward. Museums are places where history is kept. They keep ideas, inventions, and events that changed the world. They help us remember where we came from. Tim Cook has never said that we should forget or ignore history. Instead, he says that it is dangerous to get too comfortable with it.In today's world, where things change quickly, especially in technology, staying still can cost you a lot. Cook's quote shows that progress means always moving forward, even when past success makes you feel safe.Museums are very important to society. They keep culture, new ideas, and human accomplishments safe. Future generations would lose touch with the ideas and work that shaped the past if there were no museums. Tim Cook saying ""love"" shows that he cares. He thinks it's important to learn from the past. He likes what has already been made.Apple has a long and well-known history. People often study and admire the company's past innovations, which include the Macintosh, the iPod, and the iPhone. A lot of these items are now on display in museums and exhibitions all over the world. Cook knows more about this legacy than most people.But liking someone doesn't mean you care about them. His quote makes it clear that history is important to learn about, but it shouldn't be a place where you want to stay, especially in an industry driven by constant innovation, progress, and forward-looking thinking.The second part of the quote is where the real meaning is. Living in a museum means being surrounded by things that have already been done, but not doing anything new. It means comfort, safety, and familiarity. That comfort can slowly turn into stagnation in business and leadership.Tim Cook has said many times that it's dangerous to depend too much on past successes. The markets change. Technology changes. People's needs change. What worked ten years ago might not work anymore. Businesses that only care about keeping their legacy alive often have a hard time staying relevant.Apple has kept changing under Cook's leadership. The business has grown into services, put more emphasis on user privacy, put money into protecting the environment, and moved into new areas like custom silicon chips. These choices show that the company is willing to try new things, even if the old ones worked.The quote is true for all leaders, not just Apple. People often praise leaders for their past successes, using previous wins as proof of future capability and judgement. People trust you more when you have done well in the past. But depending too much on past success can keep you from coming up with new ideas or recognising when the environment has fundamentally shifted.Cook's words make it sound like good leadership needs to be balanced. You can learn from history, but don't let it tell you what to do all the time. Don't let your past experiences tell you what to do. This method lets businesses change instead of fighting it, allowing innovation to emerge naturally rather than defensively.This idea also works for people. Careers, skills, and fields of work change over time. It can be harder to grow if you hold on too tightly to what used to work. The quote quietly encourages people to be open and curious, even when change is hard, uncertain, or uncomfortable at first.This quote stands out because it is so simple. It doesn't use business jargon or technical language. People can all understand it. Most people know how nice it is to stick to their routines and how hard it is to try something new.In a broader sense, the remark addresses how cultures deal with progress. Traditions and fresh ideas frequently conflict. It is crucial to respect tradition and history while also being open to new experiences. Cook's remark acknowledges the history. It simply refuses to be confined by it.This balance is especially important now that technology is changing quickly and making people wonder about jobs, education, and social structures. The quote tells people that progress doesn't mean forgetting the past; it means building on it in a smart way.People often say that Tim Cook is calm, level-headed, and practical. His way of leading is different from Steve Jobs's, who was known for making bold and dramatic statements. Cook does things in a quieter way. His words are more likely to make you think than to make you angry, reflecting patience, consistency, ethical decision-making, and a long-term focus rather than short-term applause, values that align closely with Apple’s culture and leadership philosophy.This quote fits that pattern. It doesn't need attention. It makes you think. It gives a point of view without making people agree. That restraint is one reason it feels real.The quote doesn't give a big picture; it gives a way of thinking. It talks about how Cook sees progress, responsibility, and long-term success.is still true because it describes a problem that everyone faces. How can we remember the past without letting it control us? How do we go on without losing what matters?It's clear but not obvious what Tim Cook means. Value history. Take something away from it. Then decide to go on.In one short sentence, the CEO of Apple reminds us that we can choose to make progress. It takes work, curiosity, and a willingness to go beyond what you already know. Museums keep the past alive. But the future is being built somewhere else.","Tim Cook's quote has a deeper meaning about how to move forward.

Blinkit CEO Albinder Singh Dhindsa will take over as CEO. Goyal will transition to a non-executive Director and Vice Chairman role, pending shareholder approval, to maintain focus on Eternal's growth while exploring new ventures.

Deepinder Goyal has tendered his resignation as Director, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the company, effective close of business on February 1, 2026.

Albinder Singh Dhindsa has been appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company with effect from February 1, 2026. Further, the Board of Directors (“Board”) recommended the appointment of Deepinder Goyal as the Director and Vice Chairman of the Board, effective upon shareholders' approval.

”

Of late, I have found myself drawn to a set of new ideas that involve significantly higher-risk exploration and experimentation.

These are the kinds of ideas that are better pursued outside a public company like Eternal. If these ideas belonged inside Eternal's strategic scope, I would have pursued them within the company. They do not. Eternal deserves to remain focused, and disciplined, while exploring new areas of growth that are relevant to its current line of business.

While I believe I personally have the bandwidth to continue what I am doing at Eternal, and also explore new ideas outside of it, the expectations, legal and otherwise, of a public company CEO in India demand singular focus.""

Read Deepinder Goyal's full letter that he sent to shareholders

“Dear Shareholders,

Today, I am going to step away from the Group CEO role, and subject to shareholders' approval, will remain on the board of directors as Vice Chairman.

Albinder Dhindsa

(Albi) will be Eternal's new Group CEO.

Why this change

Of late, I have found myself drawn to a set of new ideas that involve significantly higher-risk exploration and experimentation.

These are the kinds of ideas that are better pursued outside a public company like Eternal. If these ideas belonged inside Eternal's strategic scope, I would have pursued them within the company. They do not. Eternal deserves to remain focused, and disciplined, while exploring new areas of growth that are relevant to its current line of business.

While I believe I personally have the bandwidth to continue what I am doing at Eternal, and also explore new ideas outside of it, the expectations, legal and otherwise, of a public company CEO in India demand singular focus.

This transition allows Eternal to remain sharply focused, while giving me the space to explore ideas that do not fit Eternal's risk profile.

What doesn't change

I have spent eighteen years, almost half my life, building this company. I will continue doing that.

Albi, Akshant, and I will continue to work closely together, as we always have. Our partnership, shared context, and trust remain unchanged. All our business CEOs will continue operating with the autonomy they have always had.

My involvement in long-term strategy, culture, leadership development, and ethics and governance, continues. This is where I have increasingly focused lately anyway.

What changes

The centre of gravity for operating decisions moves to Albi.

As Group CEO, he will own day-to-day execution, operating priorities, and business decisions.

Blinkit's journey from acquisition to breakeven happened under his leadership.

He built the team, the culture, the supply chain, the operating rhythm. He has the DNA of a battle-hardened founder and his ability to execute far exceeds mine. He is more than capable of leading Eternal as Group CEO.

Blinkit remains our largest growth opportunity and will remain as Albi's top priority. Our decentralized structure, where each business has a CEO with full ownership, continues unchanged - and will help Albi execute this well.

On alignment and ESOPs

My financial future remains meaningfully tied to Eternal, and my incentives remain aligned with long-term shareholder value creation.

As part of this transition, all of my unvested ESOPs will revert to the ESOP pool. This ensures that Eternal continues to have meaningful wealth-creation opportunities for its next generation of leaders, while strengthening long-term retention without incremental shareholder dilution.

Looking ahead

Eighteen years ago, the idea that a menu scanning company could be worth tens of billions of dollars, provide livelihoods to hundreds of thousands of people, and serve millions of families daily would have seemed absurd. We helped prove it was possible. And there's a lot in store for Eternal to do over the next few decades.

I believe Eternal is not going to lose focus or momentum through this change. Rather, it is reinforcing its institutional strength.

And personally, I gain the flexibility to explore ideas that sit outside Eternal's scope, without compromising the company's priorities.

I want Eternal to become India's most valuable company. I want us to serve a billion customers. I want us to create the most positive impact on society. I want us to be the source of livelihoods for millions of Indians. None of that changes.

This is a change in title, not in commitment towards outcomes. Eternal remains my life's work.

Thank you for your continued trust and support.

Deepinder Goyal”

When White House called Amazon's tariff plan an 'hostile act'





In April 2025, a pissed Donald Trump made a call to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos after learning that the company is planning to display the added cost of tariffs on certain items. Trump made the call to Bezos to complain about reports that Amazon was considering to highlight the cost of US tariffs next to prices for certain products on the company’s website. Trump later told reporters about the call to Amazon founder and said it was a “good call.” “Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific,” Trump told reporters. “He solved the problem very quickly. Good guy.”Punchbowl News first reported that Amazon will soon “display how much of an item’s cost is derived from tariffs — right next to the product’s total listed price.” The move came after Trump slapped 145% tariffs on imports from China and a 10% minimum tax on all other countries.Now months later, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC in an interview Jassy at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Amazon.com is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures stemming from the US President Donald Trump's tariffs. ""We did a lot of pre-buying in the early part of 2025 to enable us to try and keep prices as low as possible for customers,"" Jassy said.He added, ""And a lot of our third-party sellers did a lot of forward-staging in our fulfillment network for the same reasons. And that supply is run out in the fall, so you start to see some of the tariffs creep in to some of the prices, some of the items.""""Some third-party sellers are raising prices in response while others are absorbing the costs in hopes of driving more demand,"" Jassy went on to add. ""Our priority is to try to figure out how to keep prices low as possible,"" Jassy said. ""At a certain point, because retail is a mid-single-digit operating margin business, if people's costs go up by 10%, there aren't a lot of places to absorb it.""The warning marks a shift from the Amazon leader's commentary on tariffs last year. While he cautioned in April that third-party sellers could need to pass along tariff costs, he said on several occasions that Amazon had not seen selling prices appreciably rise from tariffs. ""Amazon's consumers overall have fared well. But we'll have to see what happens in 2026,"" CEO Jassy had said.The company has also maintained so far that over the past year it was seeing very little impact on consumer behavior and product prices from tariffs. It has doubled down on expanding product categories and speeding up delivery timelines to shield demand.In April 2025, at a briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called the move a “hostile and political act,” adding that she had spoken about the matter with President Trump earlier. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed Levitt’s comments, saying it’s a hostile act if a company goes out of its way to “make it seem” like tariffs have caused prices to change.“It’s nonsense,” he said Tuesday in a CNBC interview. “A 10% tariff is not going to change virtually any price,” he added, referring to the nearly universal baseline tariff on all countries. “The only price will change would be a product that we don’t make here, like a mango.” The 10% tariff, however, is hardly the only one in effect.",Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says the company is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has a message for everyone on AI Bubble. In a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella talked about the fears that has been troubling Wall Street for past many months: whether AI is a bubble. Speaking at a session, Nadella said that it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.“A telltale sign of if it’s a bubble would be if all we are talking about are the tech firms,” Nadella said. “If all we talk about is what’s happening to the technology side then it’s just purely supply side.” Nadella said the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) need to be ""much more evenly distributed"" to avoid it from becoming a ""bubble"".He spoke about how AI and other advanced technologies are increasing productivity and changing the way we work. Nadella offered a fix to what is called productivity dilemma. According to him, business leaders need to adopt a new approach to knowledge work by shifting workflows to match the structural design of AI. “The mindset we as leaders should have is, we need to think about changing the work—the workflow—with the technology.Nadella argues that AI creates a “complete inversion” of how information moves through a business, replacing slow, hierarchical processes with a view that forces leaders to rethink their organizational structures. “We have an organization, we have departments, we have these specializations, and the information trickles up,” Nadella said. “For large organizations,” Nadella told Fink, “there’s a fundamental challenge: Unless and until your rate of change keeps up with what is possible, you’re going to get schooled by someone small being able to achieve scale because of these tools. ”Microsoft CEO said that the role of AI needs to be examined across all aspects of life, such as how it is helping pharma companies bring critical drugs faster to the market or accelerate trials. He called for AI-driven economic growth rather than just increasing spending. ""We as a global community have to get to a point where we are using AI to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries,"" Nadella said.","Satya Nadella said it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.

Debate at Davos



Palantir CEO Alex Karp says certain tech employees will be valuable and highly paid







Palantir CEO Alex Karp has now issued a stark warning about the future of work in the age of artificial intelligence. Karp predicted that humanities-based jobs will now be among the first casualties. As reported by Business Insider, speaking during a panel at the World Economic Forum, Karp revealed that his own academic background which is a philosophy degree from Haverford College, a law degree from Stanford, and a Ph.D. in social theory from Germany, cautioned that such qualifications may no longer be viable. “AI will destroy humanities jobs,” Karp said. “You went to an elite school, and you studied philosophy — hopefully you have some other skill, because that skillset is going to be very hard to market.”Karp believes that workers with technical and vocational training will be in then highest demand. He quoted battery manufacturing as an exampple, nothing that technicians in such industries are “very valuable, if not irreplaceable.” “There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training,” Karp told BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who moderated the discussion.Not all leaders at Davos agreed with Karp’s assessment. Finance executives told Business Insider that liberal arts degrees may actually become more valuable, as AI takes over routine financial analysis. Critical and creative thinking, they argued, is increasingly prized in young recruits.Meanwhile, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei highlighted another trend: entry-level hiring is already declining due to AI.

Bill Gates and Melinda Gates divorce





Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever. According to a report in Forbes, the amount has surfaced in a tax filing. As per the report Bill Gates donation skyrocketed Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation's assets by more than 1,000% to about $7.4 billion in 2024. As the number went up from $604 million at the end of 2023 to $7.4 billion.The $7.88 billion donation was made in 2024 to the Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation, according to a newly released tax filing reviewed by the New York Times’ DealBook. Philanthropies Foundation focuses on women and families. The tax filing is said to mark the first time that concrete financial terms of the Gates’ 2021 divorce have been made public. Melinda Gates also manages some of her investments and charitable work through Pivotal Ventures, the investment company founded in 2015.Bill Gates and Melinda Gates announced their decision to formally separate their philanthropic work in 2024, three years after their divorce became public.In May 2024, Melinda French Gates said that she leaving the charitable foundation she co-founded with Bill Gates more than 20 years ago. Her last day at the foundation was June 7, 2024.""Under the terms of my agreement with Bill, in leaving the foundation, I will have an additional $12.5 billion to commit to my work on behalf of women and families,"" Melinda Gates said then in a post on social media platform X, without disclosing more details about her plans. Post her departure as co-chair, the foundation changed its name to Gates Foundation and with Bill Gates as its sole chairperson. It’s unclear where the additional $4.6 billion was allocated. The funds could have been given to French Gates’ LLC, Pivotal, which does not file a tax return, according to DealBook. As running alongside Pivotal Philanthropies is Pivotal Ventures, a LLC that does not require disclosure requirements that govern traditional nonprofits.""I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,"" Bill Gates wrote in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).In May 2021, Bill and Melinda French Gates announced their intention to divorce, saying they no longer believed they could “grow together”. Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board in 2020, months before the divorce was announced. The couple also reportedly agreed to the division of real estate valued at more than $170 million, an art collection worth roughly $130 million and a significant block of Microsoft stock.In March 2022, Melinda Gates claimed that Jeffrey Epstein played a role in ending their 27-year marriage. During an appearance on “CBS Mornings,” Melinda shared that she decided to leave her marriage “for many things,” including her ex-husband’s ties to Epstein. “I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” she said at the time, adding that she only met the late pedophile once because she “wanted to see who” he was.Melinda Gates has a net worth of $17.6 billion, as per Bloomberg Billioniare Index.

Meta investors raises concerns





Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse. Quoting people familiar with the development, a Bloomberg report says that the job cuts come as the company shifts priorities to build next-generation artificial intelligence (AI). It states that the latest job cuts may put breaks on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's long-chased vision of building virtual reality for the metaverse which started in 2014 with the acquisition of virtual reality start-up Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion. Another step in this direction came in 2021, when Facebook rebranded itself as Meta.Meta’s Reality Labs Division roughly has 15,000 employees. According to the Bloomberg report, Meta may announce the cuts to Reality Labs as soon as January 13, 2025. Sources told the publication that layoffs are said to disproportionately affect those in the metaverse unit who work on virtual reality (VR) headsets and a VR-based social network.As per a memo sent by the company to employees last week, Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, who also heads Reality Labs, has called for a ‘most important’ meeting on Wednesday - January 14, asking staff to attend in person.Last year, Zuckerberg asked top executives to make cuts to their 2026 budgets while he pours money into A.I. research. As Meta faces competition from companies like OpenAI and Google, Mr. Zuckerberg has increased the budget for TBD Lab, the skunk works unit at Meta that aims to build superintelligence, a godlike AI system.As reported by Bloomberg, the company also plans to reallocate some of the money from virtual reality products to increase the budget for its wearables division, which builds smart glasses and wristband computing devices.Despite the company spending tens of billions of dollars on developing virtual reality headset, the consumer response has been slower than expected. Investors have grown wary of Meta’s spending.In December last year, a company spokeswoman said Meta was “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward A.I. glasses,” and was not planning “any broader changes.”","Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse.

The Trump administration is reportedly planning to use artificial intelligence (AI) to draft some federal rules. A report citing records from the US Department of Transportation ( DOT ) and interviews with six agency staffers claimed that DOT may use AI to draft some federal transportation regulations. This marks what officials describe as a broad federal initiative to accelerate rulemaking through AI.According to a report by ProPublica, the plan was presented to DOT staff in January during a demonstration of AI'sagency attorney Daniel Cohen wrote to colleagues. Cohen stated the demonstration would showcaseThe report cited reviewed meeting notes to claim that discussion of the plan continued among agency leadership last week. Gregory Zerzan, the agency's general counsel, said at that meeting that US President Donald Trump isZerzan positioned the DOT as leading a broader federal effort, calling the department theandZerzan's comments suggested a focus on volume over quality in regulation production.Zerzan added, the report cited the reviewed meeting notes to mention.As per the report, some DOT members may be concerned about these developments. The agency's regulations cover nearly every aspect of transportation safety, including rules that keep airplanes flying, prevent gas pipeline explosions and stop freight trains carrying toxic chemicals from derailing. Some DOT staffers questioned why the federal government would delegate the writing of such vital standards to an emerging technology that is known for generating errors.However, the plan's supporters offered a straightforward answer: speed. Drafting and revising complex federal regulations can require months, sometimes years. However, with DOT's version of Google Gemini, employees could draft a proposed rule in minutes or even seconds, according to two DOT staffers who attended the December demonstration and remembered the presenter saying so.Besides, most of what appears in the preambles of DOT regulatory documents is justone staffer recalled the presenter saying. Google Gemini can do word salad.At last week's meeting, Zerzan reiterated the goal of speeding up rulemaking with AI. The objective is to shorten the timeline for producing transportation regulations, allowing them to go from concept to complete draft ready for review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in just 30 days, he said. This should be achievable, he said, becauseThe DOT plan, which has not been previously reported, opens a new chapter in the Trump administration's effort to incorporate AI into federal government operations. This administration is not the first to adopt AI; federal agencies have been gradually integrating the technology into their operations for years, including for document translation, data analysis and categorising public comments, among other uses.However, the current administration has shown particular enthusiasm for the technology. Trump issued several executive orders supporting AI last year. In April, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought distributed a memo calling for accelerated use of the technology by the federal government. Three months later, the administration published ancontaining a similar directive. However, none of those documents explicitly called for using AI to write regulations, as DOT is now planning to do.These plans are already underway. The department has employed AI to draft a still-unpublished Federal Aviation Administration rule, according to a DOT staffer briefed on the matter.Critics argued that large language models such as Gemini and ChatGPT shouldn't be entrusted with the complex and significant responsibilities of governance, given that they are error-prone and lack human reasoning. However, advocates view AI as a means to automate routine tasks and improve efficiency within a slow-moving federal bureaucracy.This optimistic perspective was evident in a windowless conference room in Northern Virginia earlier this month, where federal technology officials gathered at an AI summit to discuss adopting anin government andthe federal workforce to use the technology.The federal representatives included Justin Ubert, division chief for cybersecurity and operations at DOT's Federal Transit Administration, who participated in a panel about the Transportation Department's plans forof AI.Many people view humans as athat slows down AI, he noted. However, Ubert predicted that eventually, humans will step back into merely an oversight role, monitoringA similarly enthusiastic perspective about AI's potential characterised the presentation at DOT in December 2025, which drew more than 100 DOT employees, including division heads, high-ranking attorneys and civil servants from rulemaking offices.The presenter told them that Gemini could handle 80% to 90% of the work of drafting regulations, while DOT staffers could complete the rest, one attendee recalled.To demonstrate this, the presenter asked the audience for a topic on which DOT may need to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. This public filing outlines an agency's plans to introduce a new regulation or modify an existing one.He then entered the topic keywords into Gemini, which generated a document that resembled a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. However, it appeared to be missing the actual text that goes into the Code of Federal Regulations, one staffer recalled.The presenter showed little worry that the regulatory documents generated by AI could contain so-called hallucinations, which are erroneous text that is frequently generated by large language models such as Gemini, three people present noted.Regardless, that's where DOT's staff would step in, he said.one employee noted.Meanwhile, attendees could not recall the lead presenter's name clearly, but three said they believed it was Brian Brotsos, the agency's acting chief AI officer.The December presentation left some DOT staffers with serious doubts. They said rulemaking is complex work that requires expertise in the subject matter as well as in existing statutes, regulations and case law.Errors or oversights in DOT regulations could result in lawsuits, injuries, or even deaths in the transportation system. Some rule writers have decades of experience.However, all that seemed to be overlooked by the presenter, attendees said.said one, who, like the others, requested anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly about the matter.Mike Horton, DOT's former acting chief AI officer, also criticised the plan to use Gemini to write regulations, comparing it toHe revealed that the plan was not in the works when he left the agency in August 2025.Highlighting the life-or-death stakes of transportation safety regulations, Horton said the agency's leadersAcademics and researchers who monitor the use of AI in government expressed varied opinions about the DOT plan. If agency rule writers use the technology as a research assistant, with substantial supervision and transparency, it could be beneficial and save time.However, if they delegate too much responsibility to AI, that could result in deficiencies in critical regulations and violate a requirement that federal rules be built on reasoned decision-making.Bridget Dooling, a professor at Ohio State University who studies administrative law, told ProPublica.Ben Winters, the AI and privacy director at the Consumer Federation of America, said the plan was especially concerning given the departure of subject-matter experts from government due to the administration's cuts to the federal workforce last year.DOT has experienced a net loss of nearly 4,000 of its 57,000 employees since Trump returned to the White House, including more than 100 attorneys, federal data shows.Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency was a strong advocate of AI adoption in government. In July 2025, The Washington Post reported on a leaked DOGE presentation that proposed using AI to eliminate half of all federal regulations, in part by having AI draft regulatory documents.the presentation read. DOGE's AI programThe White House did not answer a question about whether the administration is planning to use AI in rulemaking at other agencies as well. Four senior technology officials in the administration said they were not aware of any such plan.Regarding DOT'sclaim, two of those officials expressed doubt.one of them noted.",The Trump administration is reportedly planning to use artificial intelligence (AI) to draft some federal rules.

I shared this note with

today. Onward!

After more than five and a half years, I am leaving OpenAl.

It was an honor to serve as your CISO. I joined in 2020 as OpenAl's first security hire, when the company was still a small research lab launching GPT-3 and an experimental API.

Together, we built a security program that now protects a global platform trusted by hundreds of millions of users and some of the most important Al systems in the world. I'm deeply proud of what we collectively achieved: earning user trust, defining security for a new frontier, and showing that security can move at the speed of research.

More recently, I had the privilege of leading security product development and research, culminating in the launch of Aardvark.

Aardvark reflects some of my deepest beliefs about how Al can meaningfully improve how software is protected and defended. Helping bring that work into the world has been one of the most fulfilling chapters of my career.

With Aardvark off the blocks, this feels like the right moment for me to move on. I leave knowing that the security program and Aardvark are in excellent hands, and that the work we started will continue to flourish and have impact.

Most of all, thank you. Security is a team sport, and it has been an honor to play for this team. The rigor, creativity, and care you bring to your work made everything we achieved possible. I'm grateful to everyone who believed in OpenAl and our security mission when they were still just concepts, and for trusting me with the opportunity to serve.

Tiktok's new owners in America





TikTok users across multiple regions reported issues in accessing the app over the weekend. TikTok users complained that the videos are not loading and they are also not able to login to the app. According to the DownDetector website, which tracks websites uptime, outage reports peaked on January 25, with more than 35,000. Some 65% users showed problem with the app not working properly, 23% reported total outage and some 13% claimed facing issues with their TikTok feed. TikTok has now released an official statement on the issue and said that they are working on resolving a major infrastructure issue.In a statement posted on social media platform X (formerly known as X), TikTok acknowledged the disruption. However, the company has not yet specified the cause of the outage but reassured that engineers are investigating and working hard to fix it.wrote the company in a statement posted on X.The outage comes just days after TikTok finalised its deal to create a new American entity, avoiding the threat of a ban in the United States. Earlier this week, TikTok announced that its Chinese owner, ByteDance, had struck a deal with a group of non-Chinese investors to create a new US TikTok. The deal concluded a six-year legal saga that saw the app banned by Congress and ensnared in politicking between two global superpowers.Investors including software giant Oracle; MGX, an Emirati investment firm; and Silver Lake, another investment firm, will own more than 80% of the new venture. That list also includes the personal investment entity for Dell founder Michael Dell, and other companies, TikTok said. Adam Presser, TikTok’s former head of operations, will be the CEO for the US TikTok.Under the new arrangement, Oracle, MGX and Silver Lake will each own 15% of TikTok’s US operations. ByteDance will own just under 20%. The other investors include Dell’s office and a long list of investment companies, including affiliates of General Atlantic and Susquehanna, both of which previously invested in ByteDance. The majority of the seven-member board for US TikTok will be American, according to a December memo to TikTok employees.The deal is aimed to loosen TikTok’s ties to China and address national security concerns that Beijing could use the app to surveil or manipulate its more than 200 million users in the United States. The changes enable “our U.S. users to continue to discover, create, and thrive as part of TikTok’s vibrant global community and experience,” Shou Chew, TikTok’s CEO, said in an internal memo that called the move “great news. ” Chew has a seat on the board of US Tiktok.",TikTok users across multiple regions reported issues in accessing the app over the weekend.

Lawsuit alleges violation of hiring transparency laws

Eightfold denies allegations





Job seekers have filed a lawsuit against Eightfold, an artificial intelligence (AI) hiring tool used by companies including Microsoft and PayPal, accusing it of creating secretive reports that influence hiring decisions without giving candidates access to that information. According to a fortune report, the case argues that Eightfold’s practices may violate US consumer protection laws by denying applicants the right to see, review, or correct data used to assess them. If the court accepts this argument, the case could have wider implications for how AI-based hiring systems operate and how transparent they must be with job seekers.As per the report, the case has been filed as a class-action lawsuit by job applicants who say their applications were rejected without explanation after being processed by Eightfold’s software. The lawsuit claims Eightfold violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act, along with a similar consumer protection law in California. These laws require companies that create reports affecting people’s opportunities, such as employment, to share that information with individuals and allow them to correct errors.According to the lawsuit, Eightfold’s system operates in the background of job applications and gathers personal information to help employers screen candidates.The complaint alleges that this includes data such as online activity, location information, and other digital signals. Plaintiffs argue that candidates are not told what data is collected, how it is used, or how it affects hiring decisions.What is not disputed is that Eightfold uses AI to generate a score between zero and five that measures how closely a candidate matches a job role. Employers then use this score as part of their hiring process.Eightfold has denied the claims made in the lawsuit. A company spokesperson said the tool only uses information that candidates choose to share or data provided by employer clients, per Fortune report. The company said it does not scrape social media or collect hidden data and described the allegations as without merit.","Job seekers have filed a lawsuit against Eightfold, an artificial intelligence (AI) hiring tool used by companies including Microsoft and PayPal.

"Android 17 leak reveals blur UI, revamped screen recorder and more",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/android-17-leak-reveals-blur-ui-revamped-screen-recorder-and-more/articleshow/127599501.cms,"Representative Image

Redesigned screen recorder

App lock option



Android 17 UI changes: What to expect







Leaks around Android 17 are surfacing online. As reported by 9to5Google, one of the most noticeable changes coming in Android 17 is the new blur effect applied to system UI elements. Instead of solid backgrounds, menus like the volume slider and power menu now features translucent layers which enable wallpaper colours and app icons to subtly show through. The blur is dynamically themed, giving the interface a more polished and modern look.As per the report, the screen recording tool is also getting a major overhaul. Instead of the current pop-up menu, Android 17 is said to bring a floating pill interface with streamlined options:- Record device audio- Record microphone input- Show touches on screenOnce the recording starts, the pill remains accessible for easy controls. Along with this, users can also doodle on recordings using multiple colours, access settings, and preview clips before sharing or editing.Along with this, the leak also suggests that Android 17 will come with a ‘lock app’ option when long-pressing on applications. The feature suggests that Google is testing a native app-lock functionality, potentially allowing users to secure sensitive apps without replying on third-party tools.The Android 17 UI design won't be something completely new. It is expected to closely match the split notification and Quick Settings panels already used by several phone makers, including Samsung, Xiaomi, and OnePlus, in their customised Android versions.According to the latest leak, Google has fixed most of the visual problems and technical bugs that affected earlier versions of this feature. This suggests the two-panel interface is now much more refined and likely to appear in Android 17.However, there may be a major downside. The leakers claim that foldable phones and tablets will be forced to use the new split layout on their larger screens. There's no option or setting to switch back to the classic combined notification and Quick Settings panel. This means tablets will always show the split view, while on foldables, it depends on which screen you're using; only the cover display shows the classic, combined version.Swiping down from the left side of the inner screen may open notifications, while swiping down from the right is expected to open Quick Settings. While this makes sense for devices with big screens, some users might prefer the combined look, which, according to the new leak, won't be possible on foldables and tablets.In May 2025, code indicating Google plans to add a new ""Notifications & Quick Settings"" option under Settings > Notifications was discovered for the first time. This page will let users switch between the current ""combined"" version and the new ""separate"" view. In line with the latest leak, the report also mentions a special message that appears only on foldable devices, explaining that the combined panel works only on the outer screen.Apart from this, Android 17 could finally undo one of Google's most unpopular design changes.For years, users have complained about the combined Quick Settings internet tile that merged Wi-Fi and mobile data into one button. Until recently, there was no sign that Google planned to change this. However, that shifted after Android 16 QPR2 was released.In December 2025, one of the lead developers behind LineageOS discovered code pointing to an optional switch that splits the internet tile back into separate Wi-Fi and mobile data buttons. The new leak confirms this and claims that this change may arrive with Android 17.",Android 17 could finally undo one of Google's most unpopular design changes.

CoreWeave expansion and AI factories



Nvidia's investment strategy







Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has forcefully rejected suggestions that the latest $2 billion investment made by the company in cloud provider CoreWeave is part of a trend of ‘circular financing’ between AI chipmakers and tech firms. As reported by Bloomberg News, Huang called the criticism ‘ridiculous’ and insisted that Nvidia’s investments represent confidence in ‘generational companies’ rather than financial engineering. “These are generational companies and the investments that we make is confidence in them,” Huang said. “But it’s a small percentage of the amount of money that they ultimately have to go raise, and so the idea that it is circular is completely ridiculous.”The latest deal made by Nvidia expands company’s previous stake in CoreWeave, with funds earmarked for land, power, and infrastructure to build AI factories. These facilities will be powered by Nvidia’s chips reinforcing the company’s central role in the AI ecosystem. Huang stressed on the fact that contributions made by Nvidia whether to CoreWeave, OpenAI, Anthropic, or Elon Musk’s xAI are only a fraction of the massive capital these firms must raise.He noted that OpenAI has committed to spend $1.4 trillion over the next eight years, largely on data centers.On the other hand, in a separate interview with CNBC, Huang reiterated that Nvidia’s investments are minor compared to the overall financing required for AI expansion. “Whatever we decide to invest is a small percentage, very small percentage of the overall amount of infrastructure, capital they’re going to have to raise,” he said.Nvidia’s involvement with CoreWeave has been long in the making. The company played a crucial role in anchoring CoreWeave’s IPO, offering a $250 million order at $40 per share, when investor sentiment remained cautious due to a dry IPO market. CoreWeave ended up raising $1.5 billion during the offering.The relationship is strategic. CoreWeave rents out Nvidia’s high-powered GPUs to clients building AI models—essentially extending Nvidia’s reach deeper into the booming AI development space without building its own cloud service. CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator called Nvidia a “wonderful partner” and described their relationship as “symbiotic” during post-IPO interviews.",N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has rejected suggestions that the company's $2 billion investment in cloud provider CoreWeave is part of a trend of ‘circular financing’ between AI chipmakers and tech firms.

'No law enforcement has shot an innocent person'



Ethan Choi distanced himself and the firm from Keith Rabois comments







The fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday (January 24) has divided the internet on a scale that even one of America’s biggest venture capitalist firms is not spared. In what can be called a rare and highly public display of internal discord, partners at Khosla Ventures spent the weekend trading barbs on social media over the action. As the tech CEOs and leaders condemned the killing of a 37-year-old nurse, three key figures of at the venture openly clashed over the actions of federal law enforcementThe ‘infighting’ was ignited by partner Keith Rabois, who appears to be a staunch supporter of the Trump administration. His backing of the defense of the Border Patrol agents involved in the shooting drew immediate and sharp criticism from his own colleagues, including the firm’s founder, Vinod Khosla, who distanced the firm’s views from his.As news of Pretti’s death spread on social media, Rabois took to X (formerly Twitter) to argue that the 37-year-old nurse was at fault.“No law enforcement has shot an innocent person. Illegals are committing violent crimes everyday,” Rabois replied to a post.In a separate post, he argued, “no i agree that these are felons. it is not racist to oppose criminals”, and “absolute BS. but it doesn’t matter, hey drive up rents and consume health care and tax $”. He also noted, “legal immigrants are great.”“he unequivocally attempted to draw his weapon. fuck you,” he said in another one. In a post that discussed citizens’ ability to exercise their First, Second, and Fourth Amendment rights, Rabios said, “yes but interfering w a law enforcement operation is not protected by any of those amendments.”Partner Ethan Choi quickly responded to Rabois' comment, and publicly distance the firm from Rabois’ statements.“I want to make it clear that Keith doesn’t represent everyone’s views at Khosla Ventures... at least not mine. What happened in Minnesota is plain wrong. Sad to see a person’s life taken unnecessarily,"" Choi posted.His post was quickly reshared by founder Vinod Khosla, who threw his weight behind Choi. In a stinging assessment, Khosla described the federal agents as “macho ICE vigilantes”.“I agree with @EthanChoi7 . Macho ICE vigilantes running amuck empowered by a conscious-less administration. The video was sickening to watch and the storytelling without facts or with invented fictitious facts by authorities almost unimaginable in a civilized society. ICE personnel must have ice water running thru their veins to treat other human beings this way. There is politics but humanity should transcend that,” he said in a post.Meanwhile, a coalition of more than 60 CEOs from Minnesota’s largest companies – including Target, 3M and UnitedHealth Group – signed a letter, urging “immediate de-escalation,” while several other prominent Silicon Valley figures took to social media to denounce the action.","The fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday (January 24) has divided the internet on a scale that even one of America’s biggest venture capitalist firms is not spared.

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei may have openly told Mark Zuckerberg from Davos stage that he was wrong to let godfather of AI Yann LeCun leave Meta,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-may-have-openly-told-mark-zuckerberg-from-davos-stage-that-he-was-wrong-to-let-godfather-of-ai-yann-lecun-leave-meta/articleshow/127598949.cms,"Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei contrasted AI companies led by scientists with those run by social media entrepreneurs, implicitly criticizing Meta's direction following Yann LeCun's departure. LeCun reportedly clashed with Mark Zuckerberg over research priorities, leading to his exit and the hiring of a younger executive. This move highlights a perceived difference in approach to AI development and responsibility.

LeCun's exit followed tensions over research priorities and a 28-year-old becoming his boss





Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei didn't name Mark Zuckerberg . He didn't have to. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, Amodei drew a pointed contrast between AI companies led by scientists and those run by ""the generation of entrepreneurs that did social media."" The timing was impossible to ignore—just weeks after Yann LeCun, the Turing Award-winning godfather of deep learning, walked out of Meta following reported clashes with Zuckerberg over the company's AI direction.""There's a long tradition of scientists thinking about the effects of the technology they built, of thinking of themselves as having responsibility for the technology they built. Not ducking responsibility,"" Amodei said during the session titled ""The Day After AGI.""He went further: ""The way they interacted, you could say manipulated consumers is very different. I think that leads to different attitudes.""The implication was clear. Scientist-founders like himself and Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis build with caution. Social media entrepreneurs chase scale and sort out the damage later.LeCun spent over a decade building Meta's AI research lab FAIR. But his vision for ""world models""—AI that understands physical reality, not just text—clashed with Zuckerberg's aggressive push toward large language models. When Meta's Llama 4 flopped in April 2025 amid accusations of benchmark manipulation, Mark Zuckerberg lost confidence in the team.He brought in Alexandr Wang, the 28-year-old Scale AI co-founder, through a $15 billion deal. Wang became LeCun's manager.""You don't tell a researcher what to do. You certainly don't tell a researcher like me what to do,"" LeCun told the Financial Times after leaving in November. He has since launched AMI Labs in Paris, pursuing open-source world model research with backing from European investors eager for a credible alternative to US and Chinese AI giants.Amodei's Davos remarks carried a quiet verdict. Meta let one of AI's founding minds slip away. That, he seemed to suggest, is exactly the kind of mistake a scientist would never make.","Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei drew a contrast between AI companies led by scientists and those run by ""the generation of entrepreneurs that did social media"" LeCun reportedly clashed with Mark Zuckerberg over research priorities, leading to his exit and the hiring of a younger executive.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127598949,imgsize-16686,width-400,resizemode-4/127598949.jpg"
Deloitte AI Institute chief on AI oversight: Governing AI agents is tougher because…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/deloitte-ai-institute-chief-on-ai-oversight-governing-ai-agents-is-tougher-because/articleshow/127574981.cms,"Businesses are rapidly adopting AI agents for tasks, with projections showing a surge from 23% to 74% in two years. However, robust safety measures lag significantly, with only 21% of companies reporting adequate oversight. This gap poses risks as agents gain independence, potentially leading to errors and security vulnerabilities without proper governance.

“Because AI agents are designed to take actions directly, governing [them] requires new approaches beyond traditional oversight. As agents proliferate without governance, you lose the ability to audit decisions, understand why agents behaved a certain way, or defend your actions to regulators or customers.”

""Given the technology's rapid adoption trajectory, this could be a significant limitation. As agentic AI scales from pilots to production deployments, establishing robust governance should be essential to capturing value while managing risk,""

Why is more dependency on AI agents risky for companies

""Organisations need to establish clear boundaries for agent autonomy, defining which decisions agents can make independently versus which require human approval. Real-time monitoring systems that track agent behaviour and flag anomalies are essential, as are audit trails that capture the full chain of agent actions to help ensure accountability and enable continuous improvement,""





Businesses are ramping up their use of AI agents faster than they're putting in place adequate guardrails. According to a recently published State of AI in the Enterprise report by Deloitte, based on a survey of over 3,200 business leaders across 24 countries, 23% of companies are currently using AI agents ""at least moderately"", but this figure is projected to jump to 74% in the next two years. To compare, the portion of companies that report not using them at all, currently 25%, is expected to shrink to just 5%. However, the rise of agents (AI tools trained to perform multistep tasks with little human supervision) in the workplace isn't accompanied by adequate guardrails. Only around 21% of respondents told Deloitte that their company currently has robust safety and oversight mechanisms in place to prevent possible harms caused by agents.In a statement to ZDNet, Beena Ammanath, Global Head of Deloitte's AI Institute, said,Deloitte also warned in its report.Companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Salesforce have promoted agents as productivity-boosting tools, with the main idea that businesses can hand off repetitive, low-stakes workplace tasks to them while human employees focus on more important work.However, greater independence brings greater risk. Unlike more limited chatbots, which require careful and constant prompting, agents can interact with various digital tools to, for example, sign documents or make purchases on behalf of organisations. This leaves more room for error, since agents can behave in unexpected ways (sometimes with serious consequences) and be vulnerable to prompt injection attacks.The new Deloitte report isn't the first to point out that AI adoption is moving faster than safety measures.One study published in May 2025 found that the vast majority (84%) of IT professionals surveyed said their employers were already using AI agents, while only 44% said they had policies in place to regulate the activity of those systems, ZDNet reports.Another study published in September 2025 by the nonprofit National Cybersecurity Alliance revealed that while a growing number of people are using AI tools like ChatGPT on a daily basis, including at work, most of them are doing so without having received any kind of safety training from their employers (teaching them, for example, about the privacy risks that come with using chatbots).In December 2025, Gallup published the results of a poll showing that while the use of AI tools among individual workers had increased since the previous year, almost one-quarter (23%) of respondents said they didn't know if their employers were using the technology at the organisational level.Since technology frequently advances more quickly than laws and knowledge, it is unrealistic to expect perfect AI safeguards at this early stage. This disparity is evident in AI, where deployment has accelerated due to intense hype and economic pressure.But early studies like Deloitte's new State of Generative AI in the Enterprise report point to what could very well become a dangerous gap between deployment and safety as industries scale up their use of agents and other powerful AI tools.For now, oversight should be the priority: Businesses need to be aware of the risks associated with their internal use of agents and have policies and procedures in place to ensure they don't go off the rails (and, if they do, that the resulting harm can be managed).Deloitte advises in its new report.","Businesses are rapidly adopting AI agents, with projections showing a surge from 23% to 74% in two years. However, robust safety measures lag significantly, with only 21% of companies reporting adequate oversight. This gap poses risks as agents gain independence, potentially leading to errors.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127574981,imgsize-220656,width-400,resizemode-4/127574981.jpg"

Japan's second-richest man SoftBank Group chairman Masayoshi Son has reportedly 'dropped' plans to buy the US data center operator Switch Inc. According to a report by Bloomberg, SoftBank Group has halted talks about an acquisition of US data center operator Switch, a setback to founder Masayoshi Son’s ambition to roll out Stargate AI infrastructure. according to people familiar with the matter. The deal would have been one of the Japanese company’s biggest to date.SoftBank's Masayoshi is said to have pursued the Switch deal, of around $50 billion, for months. Masayoshi reportedly believed that direct control of Switch's network of energy-efficient data centers would help Donald Trump's $500 billion Stargate project to generate computing power for partner OpenAI. As per analysts, the deal would have given a much-needed boost to the Stargate Project to build US data centers. In January 2025, soon after Donald Trump's swearing in, Softbank founder Masayoshi had pledged to deploy $100 billion “immediately” alongside OpenAI, Oracle and Abu Dhabi’s MGX.“The end of SoftBank’s deal talks with Switch leaves its data center plans in limbo, as Stargate announcements remain few and far between,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Kirk Boodry and Chris Muckensturm wrote in a note.A strategic investment or partnership would fall short of the operational exposure that SoftBank has pursued in areas such as semiconductors and physical AI, they said.However, earlier this month, Masayoshi conceded that a full acquisition was off the table and scrapped a planned January announcement. The two companies still are said to be in active discussions about a partial investment or a partnership. Some within the SoftBank camp had reportedly been wary about the size of the deal as well as the logistics of running data center campuses from Las Vegas to Atlanta, the people said.In the past one year, SoftBank has doubled down on its bets in AI. The Tokyo-based company has taken an 11% stake in OpenAI, injecting $22.5 billion just in December 2025.

Microsoft’s Superintelligence team to use Maia 200 AI chip

Microsoft's 'message' to Amazon and Google on Maia 200





Microsoft is rolling out its second-generation artificial intelligence chip, Maia 200 AI chip. The all-new AI chip aims to be a potential alternative to leading processors from Nvidia and to offerings from cloud rivals Amazon and Google. The Maia 200 chip comes two years after Microsoft said it had developed its first AI chip, the Maia 100, which was never made available for cloud clients to rent. The chips use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co’s (TSMC) 3 nanometer process. Four are connected together inside each server. They rely on Ethernet cables, rather than the InfiniBand standard. Nvidia sells InfiniBand switches following its 2020 Mellanox acquisition.This time it will be different. Scott Guthrie, Microsoft’s executive vice president for cloud and AI, said in a blog post that, for the new chip, there will be “wider customer availability in the future.” In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said, ""Our newest AI accelerator Maia 200 is now online in Azure. Designed for industry-leading inference efficiency, it delivers 30% better performance per dollar than current systems.And with 10+ PFLOPS FP4 throughput, ~5 PFLOPS FP8, and 216GB HBM3e with 7TB/s of memory bandwidth it's optimized for large-scale AI workloads. It joins our broader portfolio of CPUs, GPUs, and custom accelerators, giving customers more options to run advanced AI workloads faster and more cost-effectively on Azure. ""Guthrie called the Maia 200 “the most efficient inference system Microsoft has ever deployed.” Developers, academics, AI labs and people contributing to open-source AI models can apply for a preview of a software development kit.Some of the first units will go to Microsoft’s superintelligence team lead by Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman. The chips will also be used to power the Copilot assistant for businesses and AI models, including OpenAI’s latest, that Microsoft rents to cloud customers. ""It's a big day. Our Superintelligence team will be the first to use Maia 200 as we develop our frontier AI models,"" said Suleyman in a post on X.Microsoft said each Maia 200 packs more high-bandwidth memory than a third-generation Trainium AI chip from Amazon Web Services or from Google’s seventh-generation tensor processing unit. ""Maia 200 the most performant, first-party silicon from any hyperscaler, with three times the FP4 performance of the third generation Amazon Trainium, and FP8 performance above Google’s seventh generation TPU. Maia 200 is also the most efficient inference system Microsoft has ever deployed, with 30% better performance per dollar than the latest generation hardware in our fleet today,"" wrote Guthrie. For those unaware, a hyperscaler is a massive-scale cloud service provider (such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud) that offers immense, on-demand computing power, storage, and networking capabilities, designed for extreme scalability. The big five hyperscalers are Amazon's AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft's Azure, IBM Cloud and Oracle Cloud.Microsoft’s chip push started years after Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet began designing their own chips. As a report in Bloomberg says, all three tech giants have similar aim: Cost-effective machines that can be seamlessly plugged into data centers and offer savings and other efficiencies to cloud customers. The high costs and short supply of the latest industry-leading chips from Nvidia has fueled a scramble to find alternative sources of computing power.","Microsoft is rolling out its second-generation artificial intelligence chip, Maia 200 AI chip.

This highlights a significant shift in software development, with AI expected to become central by early 2026. Experts suggest manual line-by-line coding is ending, with developers focusing more on design and problem-solving.

“This has been said a thousand times before, but allow me to add my own voice: the era of humans writing code is over.

Disturbing for those of us who identify as SWEs, but no less true. That's not to say SWEs don't have work to do, but writing syntax directly is not it.”

How AI-powered coding is changing software engineer roles





Y Combinator President and CEO Garry Tan is ‘addicted’ to Anthropic’s new artificial intelligence (AI) tool, Claude Code. In a post shared on the social media site X (formerly Twitter), Tan wrote, “So addicted to Claude Code, I stayed up 19 hours yesterday and didn't sleep till 5 AM. ” Claude Code is an AI-based coding tool launched by Anthropic in October 2025 for more users, which runs directly in the terminal. It lets developers write, fix, explain, and manage code using simple, natural language commands. The tool understands the whole project codebase, which helps it add features, fix bugs, write tests, and more.’It integrates into current command-line workflows and functions similarly to an assistant programmer without the need for an integrated development environment. Software that facilitates code writing, testing, and debugging in one location is called an IDE. The development process can be made more effective and manageable by using Claude Code to automate processes like writing tests, submitting pull requests, and managing commits.This comment comes at a time when the software development industry, which was considered one of the more labour-intensive sectors of the tech industry, is undergoing a significant transition.By early 2026, AI is expected to transition from a supporting technology to a more central part of the code development process. This indicates that the way software is developed, maintained, and scaled is undergoing a significant transition. It is also suggested that the days of manually coding line by line are over.Recently, this view was also shared by the creator of NodeJS, an open-source JavaScript-based coding tool, Ryan Dahl. Rather than focusing on syntax and repetitive implementation, developers are being encouraged to concentrate on higher-level work. Design decisions, system architecture, problem-solving, and oversight are increasingly becoming key responsibilities for software engineers in an AI-driven development environment.In his recent X post, Dahl wrote,Software engineers have been writing code by hand for many years. Now, AI-powered tools such as Claude Code can write complex code on their own in just seconds, work that earlier could take months to complete manually.This does not imply that developers are no longer needed, according to Dahl. Rather, he claims that their role is evolving and that their skills are becoming increasingly important. These days, AI is capable of handling repetitive coding tasks and typing commands. But decision-making, creativity, and problem-solving will still require developers.This represents a major change in the field. Moving away from writing syntax line by line can be unsettling for developers who have a strong connection to hands-on coding. Dahl admits that some engineers might find this change ""disturbing"".However, the role of the software developer is not disappearing. It is evolving, with greater emphasis on adapting to new tools, learning continuously, solving broader problems, and focusing on design, strategy, and building systems centred on human needs.","Y Combinator's Garry Tan is reportedly 'addicted' to Anthropic's Claude Code, an AI tool that writes, fixes, and explains code.

How Samsung is competing with Micron and SK Hynix in the AI memory chip market





Samsung Electronics is reportedly closing in on a critical milestone in the intensifying artificial intelligence (AI) memory chip market. The South Korean tech giant is nearing certification from Nvidia for its next-generation HBM4 memory chips and positioning itself to better compete with domestic rival SK Hynix, a report claims. A Bloomberg report citing sources familiar with the matter claims that Samsung has entered the final qualification phase with Nvidia after submitting initial samples in September 2025. Samsung is now preparing for mass production of HBM4 in February and will be ready to ship soon, though exact timing remains uncertain.The development marks significant progress for Samsung in the high-bandwidth memory market, where Nvidia requires vast quantities of HBM to power its AI accelerators. The report notes that Samsung's shares gained as much as 3.2% in Seoul following the development. On the other hand, the shares of SK Hynix also fell by roughly the same amount, which is indicative of the competitive forces at play between the two South Korean firms in this rapidly growing industry.Samsung currently trails SK Hynix and Micron Technology in the AI memory market. However, in recent weeks, all three companies have seen their shares rise substantially as the AI rush has created a shortage of memory across the broader electronics industry.Among them, the three leading memory chip manufacturers have gained roughly $900 billion in market value since the start of September 2025.Investor expectations are now growing that Samsung may be able to join its rivals in supplying components for Nvidia's upcoming Rubin processors. So far, Nvidia has relied heavily on SK Hynix for the advanced memory chips it pairs with its high-end AI accelerators.Earlier, The Korea Economic Daily reported that Samsung is scheduled to begin HBM4 shipments to Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. next month. Both Samsung and SK Hynix are scheduled to hold earnings calls this week, during which they are expected to discuss progress on their HBM4 chips.","Samsung is reportedly closing in on a critical milestone in the artificial intelligence (AI) memory chip market.

Workday CEO sees growing demand for AI tools as software companies expand AI stacks

“We are uniquely positioned to be one of the AI winners in the enterprise because of our incumbency, and lastly, because of the trust we get from our customers,”





Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach has dismissed concerns that artificial intelligence (AI) will affect software business models. He called such fears overblown, despite his company cutting over 1,700 jobs last year as part of an AI-focused restructuring. In an interview with CNBC’sfrom the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Eschenbach said,adding that AI is a tailwind andfor the company.The comments follow Workday's elimination of about 1,750 jobs, or 8.5% of its workforce, in February 2025. In a memo sent to employees and published in a securities filing, Eschenbach said the layoffs were necessary to support the company's ongoing growth efforts, including its focus on AI investments. Earlier this week, Workday also signed a three-year deal with OpenAI to strengthen its offerings.According to a CNBC report, software stocks have declined in recent months amid concerns that new AI tools will disrupt the sector and displace longstanding, recurring businesses that once fuelled substantial profits.Workday shares lost 17% last year and have dropped another 15% since the start of 2026, following the company's third-quarter earnings report that included weak subscription revenue guidance.Other software companies have faced similar pressure, with Adobe and Salesforce losing 21% last year, while HubSpot fell more than 40%.Eschenbach said businesses are increasingly relying on Workday for AI tools and access to its first-party data, which the company is using to strengthen its position against third-party tools.He added that many software companies are investing in additional tools to expand their AI offerings and address growing competitive pressure in the AI space.Eschenbach noted.","Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach has dismissed concerns that artificial intelligence (AI) will affect software business models.

Europe is pushing for Digital Sovereignty to reduce dependence on American tech companies: What exactly is Digital Sovereignty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/europe-is-pushing-for-digital-sovereignty-to-reduce-dependence-on-american-tech-companies-what-exactly-is-digital-sovereignty/articleshow/127551274.cms,"“European technological sovereignty.”

What is Digital Sovereignty

Benefits of Digital Sovereignty





Europe is pushing for Digital Sovereignty to reduce its dependence on American technology companies, and recently, the European Parliament backed a report calling forMembers of the European Parliament (MEP) urged the European Commission to accelerate regulatory reforms and major investments in digital infrastructure. The report targets critical sectors including cloud computing, semiconductors and artificial intelligence (AI).Rapporteur MEP Sarah Knafo (ESN/FRA) said in a post on X (formerly Twitter) noted that while some of the findings and measures were softened, this a vital step toward “shielding European digital infrastructure” from foreign actors. Here, we will understand what is Digital Sovereignty, Sovereign Cloud and its benefits, and the big names to know.Digital sovereignty is term which can be often used interchangeably with data sovereignty. It is basically the principle or a set of rules and regulations that legally allows a country or region (like the European Union or the United Kingdom) to maintain absolute control over its digital assets, infrastructure and citizen data.The need for digital sovereignty arose as the priority from global access in the internet age shifted from security and privacy. The rise of cloud computing and mass data harvesting for advertising raised significant concerns, forcing the governments to find means to regulate it and keep the data of its citizens and offices safe.Countries moved for “data residency” to ensure all the data stays within national borders to prevent it from being exploited by outside entities or accessed by foreign law enforcement. However, to satisfy these requirements, there was a compromise – lose all the benefits of modern technology. This gave the idea of Sovereign Cloud – where nations can deploy security measures without losing the benefits of modern technology.Unlike the standard global cloud, a sovereign cloud is a specialised environment that ensures all data, metadata and administrative operations remain under the jurisdiction of a specific nation.What’s interesting is that the infrastructure can be housed in a provider’s facility or the customer’s home soil but the data remains logically or physically isolated, and is accessible only via secure, non-internet communication links. For example, Google Cloud partnered with Thales in France to host sensitive military data that never leaves French soil.The benefits of going sovereign go beyond avoiding massive GDPR fines – something that has concerned US tech giants in the last few years. Digital Sovereignty offers geopolitical resilience, especially in the times of trade wars. Having data in a sovereign cloud prevents a foreign government from “turning off” access to critical systems. It also simplifies the supply chain, as large cloud providers can procure hardware like AI chips more easily than a single local firm.However, there are challenges because of the fast moving tech industry. Sovereign clouds often face delays in feature rollouts, such as new AI tools, which typically hit global regions before they are cleared for sovereign partitions. However, this is also changing due to innovations in communication technology. In 2026, the world's biggest tech companies have started embracing it as a business model.Amazon Web Services (AWS) recently launched its European Sovereign Cloud (ESC) in Germany, physically isolated from its global network. Oracle, operates two separate EU Sovereign regions in Frankfurt and Madrid.Similarly, Microsoft’s “Cloud for Sovereignty” uses local partners like Bleu in France to ensure the infrastructure is operated by local entities. It’s competitor Google focuses on “Trusted Cloud” partnerships with firms like T-Systems (Deutsche Telekom) to manage data centers on their behalf.","Digital sovereignty is term which can be often used interchangeably with data sovereignty.

David Sacks has warned that the US risks losing the global AI competition to China due to excessive negativity and overregulation around the technology. During a conversation with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the technology investor, who US President Donald Trump appointed as his AI and crypto czar, cautioned about a mentality that he calls theThis belief that unconstrained AI will harm humanity or cause societal collapse represents afor America. He expressed concern that acould lead to overly restrictive policies, citing Senator Bernie Sanders' recent call for a moratorium on data centre construction as an example.Sacks told Benioff. He pointed out thatespecially in the US, compared to other parts of the world, as indicated by the 2025 Edelman Trust Barometer.The debate highlights tensions between Silicon Valley leaders advocating for rapid AI development and policymakers calling for stronger safety measures, with Trump taking a deregulatory stance that his administration's technology advisor argues is necessary to maintain American competitiveness against Chinese rivals.Since taking office, Trump has supported a hands-off approach to AI development. In an AI Action Plan released last summer, the administration removed many rules governing AI research, a change from Biden-era policies that mandated federal oversight of AI governance. Trump went further in December with an executive order that reduced state-level protections for AI development. Global AI dominance, the order said, would require American companies to beSacks repeated the administration's opposition to state-level rules elsewhere at Davos as well. In a recent interview with CNBC, Sacks criticised California's proposed billionaire wealth tax, a one-time, 5% tax on total wealth for residents worth more than $1 billion, which will be on the ballot in November.Sacks, who moved from California to Texas last month, said.Sacks is one of several wealthy California residents who have criticised the proposal and decided to leave the state, including Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Speaking to CNBC, he called the plan a potentiallyof state overreach.Despite Silicon Valley leaders' departures and some AI companies' welcoming the Trump administration's reduced regulations, the unrestricted approach to AI development has also faced criticism as research advances rapidly. Concerns about automation-driven job losses, a financial market collapse, and the spread of potentially unsafe AI models have reduced some of the stock market's AI enthusiasm.Even some AI leaders are concerned. In November, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said on 60 Minutes that he was ""with how AI companies were now being tasked with self-governing, saying he preferredSupporters tend to justify reduced regulation as necessary to keep pace with AI competitors in China. China's AI research is rapidly closing the gap with the US, as some models, particularly those developed by the Hangzhou-based startup DeepSeek, are matching or even exceeding Western models' performance in specific reasoning tasks.In his conversation with Benioff, Sacks cited recent research on global AI optimism rates, published in 2025 by Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. Optimism was high in China, where 83% of survey respondents saw AI as more beneficial than harmful. To compare, in the US, only 39% felt as optimistic.But while figures like Trump and Sacks call for an AI approach free of restraints, pessimism is not a strictly partisan issue in the US. In December, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a former Republican presidential hopeful, also called for more limits on data centre construction.Last week, a bipartisan House committee heard testimonies on the impact of AI in K–12 education. While some Republican committee members cautioned against hindering innovation through additional regulation, there was broad consensus on the potential risks of exposing children to AI.",US President Donald Trump appointed David Sacks as his AI and crypto czar.

AI opens the door to more immersive gaming





Jack Buser, global director for games at Google Cloud has asked the gaming executives to make sure that their employees understand both the potential and limitations of artificial intelligence. Speaking to Business Insider, Buser compared AI to Tony Stark’s Iron Man Suit — a tool that empowers but doesn’t replace the person inside. “If you’re the CTO of a games company, make that suit of armor available. Make sure that it’s safe. Make sure that you take the time to work with people inside your company so that they can understand what the technology can and can’t do, and what your intentions for the technology are and what they are not,” Buser said.Buser believes that AI is becoming a transformative force in gaming, cutting costs, streamlining operations and accelerating production timelines. He further stressed on the fact that while some developers remain hesitant and the adoption is spreading quickly. “It’s still you inside the suit of armor, but you’re suddenly able to do things you couldn’t do before,” he explained, adding that equipping entire studios with AI tools can remove drudgery and boost creativity.Buser also emphasised that AI integration is not only about technology pipelines but also about cultural adaptation within companies. He feels that the executives must experiment with AI themselves to understand its strength and weaknesses.“It can be tricky at the executive level. You don’t have a crystal ball of where this is all going. It takes getting your hands dirty, experimenting with the technology, seeing what it does and what it doesn’t do,” he added.Buser also emphasised that AI opens the door to more immersive “living games” — titles that evolve continuously after release. With AI, updates could be faster, more personalized, and more seamless, creating real-time experiences for players.He predicted that 2026 will be the year companies scale AI across entire workflows, moving from isolated use cases to multiple AI-driven features that directly shape player experiences.","Jack Buser, global director for games at Google Cloud has asked the gaming executives to make sure that their employees understand both the potential and limitations of artificial intelligence.

During Oracle's fiscal Q2 2026 earnings call in December, Ellison argued this shared foundation is rapidly turning cutting-edge AI into a commodity product with razor-thin differentiation.""All the large language models—OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Google, xAI—they're all trained on the same data. It's all public data from the internet,"" Ellison said. ""So they're all basically the same. And that's why they're becoming commoditized so quickly.""Larry Ellison's solution? The next gold rush won't be building better foundational models—it'll be enabling AI to work with proprietary enterprise data while keeping it secure. He estimates this second wave of AI will prove ""even larger and more valuable"" than the current boom in GPUs and data centers.Oracle is betting heavily on this vision, projecting roughly $50 billion in capital expenditures for the full year, up from $35 billion estimated just three months earlier.The company argues it has a natural advantage since most high-value private data already lives in Oracle databases. Its AI Data Platform uses techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation to let models query private information in real time without security compromises.The company announced partnerships at Oracle AI World in October, including a 50,000-GPU supercluster with AMD MI450 chips launching in Q3 2026 and the OCI Zettascale10 supercomputer connecting hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs. By late 2025, Oracle's cloud backlog had topped $500 billion, driven mostly by AI demand.Still, Ellison's thesis faces headwinds. Synthetic data generation could reduce reliance on exclusive proprietary datasets, while rivals like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud are racing to build similar enterprise AI capabilities. The question is whether Oracle's existing grip on enterprise databases will prove decisive—or if the AI landscape will shift before the company's massive infrastructure bets pay off.","Oracle's Larry Ellison believes the AI race is becoming a commodity due to shared internet data. He argues the future lies in leveraging private enterprise data, a move Oracle is heavily investing in. While competitors are also building enterprise AI, Oracle's existing database dominance could be key to its success.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127537262,imgsize-522661,width-400,resizemode-4/127537262.jpg"

Apple's AI struggles made outside help inevitable







Apple is preparing to overhaul Siri from a voice assistant into a conversational AI chatbot, marking the most dramatic change since it launched in 2011. The new Siri will run on Google's Gemini models following a partnership Apple finalized earlier this month. Now a new Bloomberg report suggests that Apple is preparing to unveil the upgraded Siri in February 2026.“Apple appears to be less than a month away from unveiling the results of this partnership. The company has been planning an announcement of the new Siri in the second half of February, when it will give demonstrations of the functionality,” reads the report.As per the report, Siri will now integrate Gemini’s advanced generative AI capabilities, enabling more natural conversations, smarter contextual responses and deeper integration with apps. This partnership could give iPhone users access to Google’s cutting-edge AI technology directly within Apple’s ecosystem, a move that signals Apple’s willingness to lean on external AI expertise rather than building everything in-house.Siri will work with both voice and text, handling tasks like content generation, file analysis, summarization, and coding help. It'll integrate with Apple's core apps—Photos, Mail, Messages, Music—and access their content to respond to requests.Apple is also developing a feature letting Siri view open windows and adjust device settings.The deal reflects Apple's rocky journey in AI. The company delayed its major Siri upgrade from spring 2025 to 2026, sidelined AI chief John Giannandrea from development, and lost key talent including foundation models head Ruoming Pang to Meta. Apple's research and development spending has hovered at just 8 per cent of revenue while competitors poured hundreds of billions into AI infrastructure.One former Apple executive summed it up to the FT: the Google deal was ""a necessary byproduct of Apple's decision not to 'go big' on its AI investments like its competitors."" Apple still plans to develop its own trillion-parameter model eventually. But for now, it's betting that Google can deliver what its own teams couldn't.The existing ChatGPT integration with Apple Intelligence remains intact—for now. But analysts aren't optimistic about its future. ""Having two large models, given the economies of scale, wouldn't make a ton of sense for Apple,"" noted Gene Munster at Deepwater Asset Management.","New Siri will run on Google's Gemini models following a partnership Apple finalized earlier this month.

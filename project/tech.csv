Reliance backed Dunzo may see founder exit after almost a year of turmoil,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/reliance-backed-dunzo-may-see-founder-exit-after-almost-a-year-of-turmoil/articleshow/116900180.cms,"Kabeer Biswas , the last remaining cofounder and CEO of Reliance Retail-backed Dunzo , is reportedly in discussions with investors about stepping down, reports Economic Times. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the report says that this development follows a challenging 12-18 months for the once-prominent quick commerce pioneer. The potential exit comes during a period of heightened activity in the quick commerce sector, attracting significant investor interest.""All options are being considered, including what happens to Biswas’ remaining 3.4% stake in the company,"" said a person close to the situation. However, Reliance Retail has not yet approved the proposal and remains in discussions on the matter. Some investors, given Dunzo’s financial struggles and write-offs, are reportedly open to letting Biswas move on, but Reliance Retail's decision will be pivotal, sources added.If finalized, Biswas' departure would mark a significant founder exit from an Indian startup that once epitomized the quick commerce boom.All other cofounders of the platform have already departed. Ankur Agarwal , one of the cofounders, is currently launching Kuik , while Dalvir Suri was among the first to leave during Dunzo’s struggles in 2023. Mukund Jha has also exited to establish his own venture.The quick commerce platform laid off 75% of its workforce last year. The app now has 50 employees in its core supply and marketplace teams. The job cuts were then part of the company's broader effort to curb costs and create cash flow to address mounting liabilities, including overdue salaries to current and former employees and outstanding vendor payments.","Kabeer Biswas, the last remaining cofounder and CEO of Dunzo, is reportedly in discussions with investors about stepping down.

Why and how Vodafone-Idea's entry in 5G data mobile plans may lead to price war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-and-how-vodafone-ideas-entry-in-5g-data-mobile-plans-may-lead-to-price-war/articleshow/116894327.cms,"Readying 5G gameplan to take on rivals

Vodafone Idea CEO hinted at affordable pricing

Halting subscriber losses top priority

Vodafone Idea (Vi) is preparing to launch its 5G mobile broadband service in March with aggressively priced plans, aiming to recapture market share from established 5G providers Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. According to a report in Economic Times (ET), Vodafone-Idea may offer 5G plans at up to 15% cheaper at entry levels — at a sharp discount to current offerings by Reliance Jio and Airtel. According to some leading telco broadband tariff trackers, there may be a 5G data price war in the offing.Vodafone Idea's initial 5G rollout will reportedly focus on approximately 75 major cities within its 17 priority circles, with specific emphasis on high data consumption industrial hubs. A Vi spokesperson has confirmed the impending launch, stating the company's commitment to providing competitive pricing and the best possible experience. The spokesperson also highlighted Vi’s sufficient 5G spectrum holdings in its priority markets, enabling enhanced 4G coverage and swift 5G deployment in key cities.Beyond discounted plans, Vodafone Idea is also considering increasing its investment in distribution. Industry analysts suggest the company may boost dealer commissions and promotional spending to attract high-value 5G prepaid users from its competitors. While Vodafone Idea did not directly comment on these potential strategies, data from Jefferies indicates that the company already allocates a larger percentage of its sales to dealer commissions (8.4% or ₹3,583 crore in FY24) compared to Jio (3% or ₹3,000 crore) and Airtel (4% or ₹6,000 crore).Reliance Jio and Airtel previously implemented tariff hikes in July 2024, raising the minimum cost for accessing their 5G services by requiring users to upgrade to higher-value base plans, a clear attempt to monetize their 5G networks. In contrast, Vodafone Idea CEO Akshaya Moondra hinted that Vodafone Idea's 5G base pricing would be lower than its competitors, with a final decision to be made closer to the launch date. This strategy reflects Vi's urgent need to improve its 4G coverage and introduce 5G in key markets to stem customer losses and compete effectively. By the end of September, Jio and Airtel had amassed 148 million and 105 million pure 5G users, respectively, highlighting the competitive landscape Vodafone Idea is entering.While some analysts caution that aggressive undercutting could negatively impact Vodafone Idea's average revenue per user (ARPU) and exacerbate its financial challenges, the company has recently secured ₹24,000 crore in equity funding and anticipates raising an additional ₹25,000 crore in debt following the government's waiver of bank guarantee requirements. This improved financial position gives Vi more flexibility to pursue its aggressive 5G strategy. Most observers agree that Vodafone Idea needs to prioritize halting user losses and then regain subscribers through a combined aggressive 4G and 5G approach.",Vodafone Idea is preparing to launch its 5G mobile broadband service in March.

Indian IT companies may have little to worry about H-1B visa says report; suggests these 'changes' in the visa programme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/indian-it-companies-may-have-little-to-worry-about-h-1b-visa-says-report-suggests-these-changes-in-the-visa-programme/articleshow/116893698.cms,"Concerns Regarding a Flat Wage Proposal

Recommendation for a Non-Employer-Specific Visa

India’s Position and Potential Impacts of Policy Shifts

Here’s a list of the top companies by H-1B sponsorship approvals in 2024:

The H-1B visas debate has stirred US political circles, dividng President-elect Donald Trump's MAGA supporters. Among these is Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk who has publicly said that he is willing to go to war over these visas. Musk sees keeping the pipeline open for tech and other skilled workers critical for the American economy. For those unaware, H-1B visa programme permits foreign-born computer scientists, engineers and other highly skilled workers to migrate to the United States.Trump too has thrown his weight behind Musk on the issue. Trump declared that he is a ""believer in H-1B"" visas, quashing the opposition to the programme for qualified professionals to work in the US. ""It's a great program,"" he told the New York Post. He said, ""I've always liked the visas; I have always been in favour of the visas. That's why we have them.""Now a new report from Macquarie Research analyzes the potential impact of H-1B visa policy reforms on Indian IT services firms, highlighting both opportunities and challenges. While Indian companies hold a relatively small share of total H-1B sponsorships, the report emphasizes the crucial role these visas play in addressing the US’ technical talent shortage and the difficulties of local hiring.The report underscores the persistent challenge of finding qualified technical professionals within the US. This difficulty is further evidenced by a low unemployment rate of 2.9% in November 2024 for professional and technical services within the US. This shortage makes the H-1B visa program a critical mechanism for bridging the talent gap and allowing US companies to access specialized skills from abroad, particularly from India.Despite the potential for policy shifts, Macquarie maintains an ""outperform"" rating for both TCS (with a target of ₹5,710) and HCLTech (with a target of ₹2,020). This suggests that Macquarie believes these Indian IT firms are well-positioned to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape. Effectively implemented visa reforms, particularly the proposed shift to a non-employer-specific permit, could create new growth opportunities for these companies while upholding fair labour practices internationally.Macquarie expresses significant concerns about proposals for a uniform, nationwide wage floor for H-1B visa holders. The report argues that such a flat wage is impractical due to substantial regional cost-of-living variations across the US. Implementing a uniform wage could exacerbate existing economic disparities between different regions. Macquarie stresses the need for a wage floor that considers local economic conditions to avoid unintended negative consequences.Instead of a flat wage floor, Macquarie recommends a significant shift in the H-1B visa structure: transforming it into a temporary, non-employer-specific work permit, similar to Norway’s skilled work permit system. This model would offer greater flexibility for workers, allowing them to change employers without needing a new visa, and would promote competition among employers. This change, according to the report, would also better protect worker rights.The Indian IT services sector is significantly intertwined with the US market, relying on it for both revenue and talent sourcing. While more stringent visa policies could present challenges for Indian professionals seeking opportunities in the US, some analysts believe they could also strengthen the offshoring model. Similar to the outsourcing boom of the 1990s and 2000s, this shift could lead to increased work being performed directly in India. India's developed infrastructure, extensive skilled workforce, and advanced communication networks make it well-positioned to capitalize on this potential shift.CareEdge Ratings has also pointed out the potential downside of H-1B system changes, noting that they could disrupt talent mobility and negatively impact the Indian IT sector, which relies heavily on outsourcing.Amazon Com Services LLC: 9,265 approvalsInfosys Limited: 8,140 approvalsCognizant Technology Solutions: 6,321 approvalsGoogle LLC: 5,364 approvalsTata Consultancy Services Limited: 5,274 approvalsMeta Platforms Inc: 4,844 approvalsMicrosoft Corporation: 4,725 approvalsApple Inc: 3,873 approvalsHCL America Inc: 2,953 approvalsIBM Corporation: 2,906 approvals",A new report from Macquarie Research analyzes the potential impact of H-1B visa policy reforms on Indian IT services firms.

What the company said to its customers



What BigCommerce said about the breach

iPhone accessories maker Zagg has announced a data breach that exposed its customers' credit card information. The breach occurred due to a compromise in a third-party app provided by Zagg's e-commerce platform, BigCommerce. The Utah-based company, known for its mobile accessories like screen protectors and phone cases, has an annual revenue of $600 million. ZAGG is currently notifying affected customers about the breach and advising them to take necessary precautions to protect their financial information. The data breach resulted in the theft of names, addresses, and payment card information of shoppers on zagg.com between October and November 2024.In a letter sent to affected customers (seen by Bleeping Computer), the company stated that the attacker compromised the FreshClicks app provided by BigCommerce and implanted malicious code to steal shoppers' card information.“We learned that an unknown actor injected into the FreshClick app malicious code that was designed to scrape credit card data entered as part of the checkout process for certain ZAGG.com customer transactions between October 26, 2024 and November 7, 2024,” Zagg wrote.ZAGG responded to the incident by implementing remediation measures, notifying federal authorities and regulators, and offering affected individuals 12 months of free credit monitoring via Experian. Affected customers have also been advised to monitor their financial accounts, place fraud alerts, and consider a credit freeze. However, the company has not disclosed the number of customers impacted.In a statement to BleepingComputer, BigCommerce said that its systems were neither breached nor compromised. The company identified the FreshClicks App hack using internal tools and subsequently removed the app from its customers' stores.“Using our internal tools and in communication with the partner, we verified the third-party FreshClicks App was compromised. Acting in the best interest of our customers and their shoppers, we immediately uninstalled the app in their stores, which removed any compromised APIs and malicious code,” BigCommerce noted.BigCommerce's store currently features six add-ons developed by FreshClick, with a total of 178 reviews. However, the compromised plugin may have been temporarily taken down.The Austin-based SaaS e-commerce platform caters to businesses of all sizes across various industries worldwide.

According to a report by KrebsonSecurity, the hacker known as Kiberphant0m claimed to have leaked sensitive data on BreachForums, including AT&T call logs for prominent political figures like Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, a data schema from the NSA, and call logs from Verizon’s push-to-talk (PTT) customers which are primarily US government agencies and emergency responders. In November, the hacker advertised a SIM-swapping service targeting Verizon PTT users for exploiting stolen credentials to redirect calls and messages.After being identified as Kiberphant0m as a possible US Army soldier, his Facebook profile photo was deleted, but older photos showing him in uniform with Army-issued weapons remained visible.In an emailed statement to Reuters, Colonel Kamil Sztalkoper, spokesperson for the III Armored Corps wrote:Sztalkoper directed further inquiries to the Department of the Army Criminal Investigation Division, which informed Reuters that it was collaborating with federal law enforcement partners and would not provide additional details.","20-year-old Cameron John Wagenius was arrested last month and charged in a Texas court with two counts of unlawful transfer of confidential phone records information.

As the match ended, cricket memes went viral on social media platforms. Here are some of the viral memes that just capture the emotion/sadness of Indian Cricket fans.

Record number of spectators

Australia clinched a thrilling 184-run victory over India in a dramatic final session of the fourth Test in Melbourne, taking a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. India, needing 340 to win, collapsed to 155 all out, losing their last seven wickets for just 34 runs in 20.3 overs. India appeared to be heading for a draw after Yashasvi Jaiswal (84) and Rishabh Pant (30) steered them to 112-3 at tea. However, Pant's dismissal, attempting a six off Travis Head, triggered a batting collapse.Controversy arose with Jaiswal's dismissal. Initially given not out to a caught-behind appeal, the TV umpire overturned the decision based on visual evidence of the ball changing direction, despite the absence of audible noise. Jasprit Bumrah was exceptional for India, taking 5-57 in the second innings and nine wickets in the match. He had reduced Australia to 91-6 at one stage, a lead of less than 200.The match set a record attendance for cricket in Australia, with 373,591 spectators. Head described the atmosphere as inspiring and hailed the match as one of the best he has been involved in. India now needs to win the final Test in Sydney to level the series and retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .","Australia beat India by 184 runs in the fourth Test in Melbourne.

Planning a New Year's Eve party at an Airbnb? Think again. The company is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season. This technology uses machine learning to identify and block risky bookings, focusing on factors like trip length, booking timing, and distance from the guest's location. While implemented worldwide, the technology will specifically target the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Puerto Rico, Spain and New Zealand. Last New Year's Eve, Airbnb blocked 74,000 such bookings.High-risk bookings will be blocked or redirected to alternative accommodations. Short holiday getaways (one to three nights) in entire homes will also be restricted, and guests booking entire homes will be required to agree to a ""mandatory anti-party attestation."" ""If a booking is identified as higher risk, the guest will either be blocked from booking, or redirected to alternative accommodations on the platform,"" the company said.Guests will also be required to accept mandatory anti-party attestation. ""Guests who can make reservations will need to confirm that they understand that disruptive and unauthorized parties are not allowed on Airbnb, and they face suspension or removal from the platform if they violate this policy,"" said the company.Airbnb also has a 'Neighborhood Support Line' for local communities to report urgent issues, like a party in progress, at a home they believe is listed on Airbnb.Airbnb's efforts to curb disruptive parties started in 2019 with a ban on ""party houses,"" followed by stricter measures in 2020 due to the pandemic. In 2022, the company permanently banned large parties worldwide following several violent incidents at Airbnb rentals, including a shooting in Pittsburgh that resulted in two deaths and eight injuries.","Airbnb is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season.

How was Wingtech’s consumer electronics manufacturing business



Wingtech’s plans after selling its core business



Chinese company Wingtech Technology is selling its business to Apple supplier Luxshare Precision Industry . The company that supplied smartphone components to popular brands including Apple, Samsung and Xiaomi was recently added to a US trade blacklist . The company said that it is selling its consumer electronics manufacturing business to focus on semiconductors.In a regulatory filing (seen by the South China Morning Post), the company cited “changes in the geopolitical environment and the business development needs of the company” as the reason for this divestment. Wingtech has agreed to sell nine subsidiaries involved in the production of smartphones, tablets, and laptops to the parent company of Luxshare.However, the company clarified that its recently announced sale would exclude its semiconductor business . Wingtech also said that it has signed a letter of intent with Luxshare, and the final transaction will depend on the terms agreed upon by both parties and the completion of legal procedures.The Jiaxing, Zhejiang-based company was one of 140 Chinese organisations added to the Entity List by the US Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security in December. These regulations aim to address US national security concerns by restricting China’s capacity to develop advanced semiconductors.Founded in 2006, Wingtech is one of China’s largest mobile phone contract manufacturers and was the third-largest smartphone original design manufacturer globally in 2023.According to Counterpoint Research, the company accounts for 20.6% of outsourced handset volume. In 2023, the company's smartphone shipments grew by 7%, driven by new orders from Xiaomi, Samsung and Honor.Electronics manufacturing remains Wingtech's primary revenue source, generating 44.3 billion yuan (US$6 billion) in 2023—72% of its total annual revenue of 61.2 billion yuan.The company also had plans to expand overseas, focusing on AI-powered smartphones and PCs, despite challenges in the consumer electronics market.Wingtech entered the semiconductor sector in 2019 by acquiring Dutch firm Nexperia .While Nexperia stated in December that US technology restrictions on Wingtech do not apply to its operations, it would still adhere to the US regulations in dealings with its Chinese parent.In 2023, Wingtech’s semiconductor business generated 15.2 billion yuan in sales, a 5% decline due to weakened demand in the chip industry.Following its divestment plans, Wingtech aims to concentrate on its chip business, aspiring to become a leading player in the global power-semiconductor market, the report added.","Chinese company Wingtech Technology is selling its business to Apple supplier Luxshare Precision Industry.

Reasons to listen to 16-year-old according to Nikhil Kamath

Youngest philanthropist in the Hurun India list

Zerodha founder Nikhil Kamath recently said that seeking advice from children can be beneficial for making career or business decisions. In a recent interview with LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky for The Path video series, Kamath said: “Don’t turn to the previous generation to plan 20 years ahead. Instead, watch what the kids are doing”, urging leaders to consider what a 16-year-old might desire in the future. “Look at what a 16-year-old boy wants and what he will need in the next 10 years,” he said adding “Look ahead, look at the younger generation for inspiration, not the older generation”.During the conversation, Kamath emphasized that the younger generation shapes culture, trends, and consumer needs, making them key to understanding future market dynamics. He pointed out that advice from older generations often fails to align with current behaviors and expectations.For example, today’s teens spend much of their time on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram, which drive trends in fashion, entertainment, and lifestyle. Kamath believes businesses must closely observe these habits to stay relevant and ahead of the curve.Last year, the 38-year-old co-founder retained his position as the youngest philanthropist in the Hurun India list this year as well. Zerodha co-founders Nikhil Kamath and Nithin Kamath made it to 'Hurun’s top Philanthropist List 2023' after having donated Rs 110 crore to organisations dealing in climate change and environmental sustainability.Kamath's Rs 120 crore contribution to the Rainmatter Foundation has placed him among Hurun India list 2024.

In 2023, the Kamath brothers ranked at No. 12 in the list..Nikhil Kamath's philanthropic endeavors reportedly extend beyond India. He is the youngest Indian member of The Giving Pledge, a global initiative founded by billionaires Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. Additionally, he established the Young Indian Philanthropic Pledge (YIPP), which collaborates with startup leaders to commit at least 25% of their net worth to philanthropic causes.",Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath is the youngest philanthropist in the Hurun India list this year.

A Tesla Cybertruck exploded in flames outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday, January 1, killing the driver and injuring seven others, and the FBI was investigating whether the blast was an act of terrorism, officials said. Videos taken by witnesses inside and outside the hotel showed the vehicle exploding with flames. The incident occurred just hours after a man drove a truck into crowds of New Year's Day revelers in New Orleans, killing 15.The Trump International Hotel is part of the Trump Organization, the company of President-elect Donald Trump. Tesla CEO Elon Musk was a key backer of Trump in his 2024 presidential campaign and is also an adviser to the incoming President.Responding to the blast, Musk said that it was unrelated to the Cybertruck itself. ""We have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself,"" Musk said in a post on X. ""All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion."" Telemetry involves the automatic collection of data from remote sources, transmitting it back to a central source so it can later be analyzed.In the first post on the blast Musk said, ""The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now. Will post more information as soon as we learn anything. We’ve never seen anything like this.""""The evil knuckleheads picked the wrong vehicle for a terrorist attack. Cybertruck actually contained the explosion and directed the blast upwards. Not even the glass doors of the lobby were broken,"" wrote Musk.Incidentally, both the Cybertruck and the vehicle used in the New Orleans attack had been rented through car-sharing service Turo. Terming it a likely terror attack, Musk wrote, ""Appears likely to be an act of terrorism. Both this Cybertruck and the F-150 suicide bomb in New Orleans were rented from Turo. Perhaps they are linked in some way.""""Obviously a Cybertruck, the location - there's lots of questions that we have to answer,"" Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill said at an afternoon press conference. FBI special agent in charge Jeremy Schwartz later told reporters that it was not yet clear whether the blast was an act of terrorism. He added that the FBI had identified the person driving the vehicle, which had been rented in Colorado, but was not yet ready to publicly identify the driver.A Turo spokesperson said the company did not believe either of the renters of the vehicles involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat. ""We are actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents,"" the spokesperson added.","A Tesla Cybertruck exploded in flames outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday, January 1, killing the driver and injuring seven others. The FBI was investigating whether the blast was an act of terrorism, officials said. The incident occurred just hours after a man drove a truck into crowds of New Year's Day revelers in New Orleans, killing 15.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116883762,imgsize-27692,width-400,resizemode-4/116883762.jpg"

0% duty for parts and sub-parts.

5% duty for certain component parts.

10% duty for sub-assemblies and components.

15% duty for finished goods.

The India Cellular and Electronics Association ( ICEA ) has suggested reducing taxes on parts and components and simplifying India’s tariff structure into an easier ""3+1 slabs"" system, says a PTI report. The association says that India’s current tax system is one of the most complicated in the world, which increases manufacturing costs and affects global competitiveness.In its recommendations for the 2025-26 Budget, ICEA proposed removing the 2.5% duty on parts like PCBA (printed circuit board assembly), FPCs (flexible printed circuits), camera modules, and connectors to make manufacturing more affordable.ICEA suggests:The association also recommends eliminating the 2.5% duty on inputs for open cells used in TVs to encourage local production. Similarly, it calls for duty-free imports of components for hearable devices to support the growing industry while keeping the current tax system for finished products unchanged.What ICEA saidIn its budget wishlist, ICEA has said “Reduce the 2.5 per cent duty on parts and inputs of PCBA, FPCs, camera modules, and connectors to 0 per cent.”“India's current tariff regime is among the most complex globally, with multiple rates (nil, 2.5 per cent, 5 per cent, 7.5 per cent, 10 per cent, and 15 per cent plus surcharges). This complexity, especially on sub-assemblies and components, impacts global competitiveness and export potential,” it noted.Simplifying tariffs and reducing duties, ICEA believes, will make India’s manufacturing sector more competitive globally and boost exports.","The India Cellular and Electronics Association ( ICEA ) has suggested reducing taxes on parts and components.

Malaysia has granted licenses to WeChat and TikTok to operate within the country under a newly implemented law that mandates social media platforms with over 8 million users to obtain official authorisation.The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) announced that Tencent (WeChat) and ByteDance (TikTok) were the first platforms to successfully secure the required Applications Service Provider Class (ASP(C)) license. This move comes as Malaysia seeks to strengthen online safety and accountability for social media platforms.“The licensing requirement, effective 1 January 2025, aims to enhance online safety, user protection, and regulatory oversight for internet messaging service and social media service providers. This framework is designed to foster a trusted and safe online environment by calling service providers to protect users, especially children and vulnerable groups. Malaysians will benefit from improved safety, better user experiences, and enhanced protection against harmful content,” said the regulator.The new legislation aims to address concerns related to online harms, including the spread of misinformation, cyberbullying, and the exploitation of children. Licensed platforms will be subject to stricter regulations, including obligations to cooperate with law enforcement agencies in investigations and to take down harmful content promptly.While WeChat and TikTok have obtained their licenses, other major platforms such as Meta (which owns Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram), X (formerly Twitter), and Google (which owns YouTube) are yet to submit their applications.The MCMC has emphasised that compliance with the new regulations is crucial for social media platforms to continue operating legally in Malaysia.","Malaysia has granted licenses to WeChat and TikTok to operate within the country under a newly implemented law.

What the parent company Aylo said

A Louisiana law passed nearly two years ago has sparked a wave of similar legislation across the Southern US, significantly impacting access to online adult content. Florida, Tennessee, and South Carolina are now among 17 states in the US where access to the pornographic websites is restricted due to these laws.Louisiana's Act 440 introduced by state representative and ""sex addiction"" counselor Laurie Schegel, served as the model for many of these laws. While the specific wording may differ, the core principle remains: online ""commercial entities"" publishing ""material harmful to minors"" face potential fines and lawsuits if they fail to implement ""reasonable age verification methods.""The Louisiana Act 440 requires adult websites to use age verification technology to ensure that users are at least 18 years old before viewing content. Act 440 also regulates contracts between minors and interactive computer services. This includes prohibiting interactive computer services from entering into contracts with minors without the consent of their legal representative.Faced with these regulations and aiming to protect user privacy,has opted to block access in the states that have passed this law.Georgia's similar age verification bill is slated to take effect in July. Louisiana already requires users of Aylo-owned sites to use the state's digital driver's license, LA Wallet, for age verification—a system in place since January 1, 2023.Starting January 1, 2025 Pornhub website is blocked in these US states:Aylo sent 404 Media a statement about the age verification laws ’ progress across the country:""First, to be clear, Aylo has publicly supported age verification of users for years, but we believe that any law to this effect must preserve user safety and privacy, and must effectively protect children from accessing content intended for adults. Unfortunately, the way many jurisdictions worldwide, including Florida, have chosen to implement age verification is ineffective, haphazard, and dangerous. Any regulations that require hundreds of thousands of adult sites to collect significant amounts of highly sensitive personal information is putting user safety in jeopardy. Moreover, as experience has demonstrated, unless properly enforced, users will simply access non-compliant sites or find other methods of evading these laws.""","Louisiana law passed nearly two years ago has sparked a wave of similar legislation across the Southern US.

Securities and Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ), the capital markets regulator, has levied a penalty of Rs 19 lakh on Sai Proficient Research Investment Advisory and its proprietor for a series of regulatory breaches, including deceiving investors with unrealistic promises of returns.As per SEBI notice, the stock market regulator found that Sai Proficient made false promises of returns as high as 95%, a practice strictly prohibited under its regulations. Such exaggerated assurances, designed to entice unsuspecting investors, were classified by Sebi as fraudulent and unfair trade practices, significantly eroding investor confidence in the securities market. The ₹19 lakh fine reflects Sebi's determination to penalize such deceptive practices and protect the integrity of the market.Dismissing the investment advisory firm's defense as a fabricated ""cock and bull story"" and a mere ""afterthought"" to escape accountability, Sebi's investigation revealed a pattern of misconduct, including non-cooperation with the inquiry and collusion with an unregistered entity to defraud the public. ""Noticee submitted that she was pregnant and was in the last months of her pregnancy suffering from complications and thus, could not attend the office regularly and could not cooperate with investigation,"" as per SEBI's circular.The Sebi order details Sai Proficient's involvement with Shree Sai Proficient Financial Services (SSPFS), an unregistered entity operating illegally as an investment advisory service. The regulator's investigation found compelling evidence that SSPFS served as a front for Sai Proficient Research, facilitating the collection of investor funds. Transactions exceeding ₹4 crore were traced across accounts linked to both entities, exposing a deliberate and coordinated scheme to attract and mislead investors. Sebi explicitly stated that Sai Proficient acted ""in connivance with SSPFS, using it as a camouflage to lure people into its net.""Adding to the severity of the violations, Sai Proficient failed to provide crucial documentation to Sebi during the investigation. This included essential records such as Know Your Customer (KYC) details, risk profiling forms, and client agreements. Despite repeated notices from the regulator, the firm's non-compliance further exacerbated its regulatory breaches.","Sai Proficient Research Investment Advisory and its proprietor have been fined Rs 19 lakh.

Advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning are transforming recyclability by enabling sorting systems to differentiate between plastic packaging and non-plastic packaging, food-grade and non-food-grade plastics. This breakthrough is significantly increasing recycling rates and supporting a circular economy by recovering high-value materials at scale.In 2024, organizations recognized that consuming LLMs was merely the tip of the iceberg. The true challenge—and opportunity—lay in addressing foundational elements such as ensuring data quality, building robust digital assets, and fostering widespread user adoption to fully realize AI's potential in enterprise settings. It was common to see organizations launch GenAI pilots with initial positive response, stemming from excitement around the technology. Although, the journey to delivering impact at scale requires dedicated efforts. The science behind AI will keep evolving in 2025. But here’s the catch - the winners won’t just master the technology; they’ll master the art of integrating it into their own contexts, empowering their teams, and creating a culture of innovation. Looking ahead, Agentic AI will be integral to Gen AI efforts for 2025. Organizations will build Digital Workers — AI agents will take on both employee and customer-facing roles, reshaping how work gets done.","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic concept but a transformative force reshaping industries and influencing our lives directly or indirectly.

What it means for PhonePe and Google Pay

Good news for WhatsApp

The National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) has a good news for Google Pay and PhonePe as it has again delayed the implementation of its 30% market share cap for Unified Payments Interface ( UPI ) apps.The deadline, initially set for December 31, 2024, has now been pushed to December 31, 2026. This marks the second time the NPCI has extended the deadline, having previously postponed it in 2022.According to a report by The Economic Times, this decision comes after discussions with industry players“There were multiple conversations that happened with the industry participants and we believe that bringing the market cap at this point could slow down adoption of UPI…there is potential for the payment system to grow by another 10 times,” ET quoted a senior banker in the know.The delay primarily benefits PhonePe and Google Pay, the two dominant players in the UPI market, which together control roughly 90% of transactions. In November 2024, PhonePe processed 7.4 billion UPI payments, while Google Pay handled 5.7 billion, out of a total of 15.4 billion UPI transactions.By extending the deadline, the NPCI aims to foster continued growth and adoption of UPI while allowing major players like PhonePe and Google Pay more time to comply with the market share restrictions. After PhonePe and Google Pay, there is Paytm followed by Navi, Cred and others.The NPCI has also lifted all user restrictions on WhatsApp Pay, allowing the popular messaging app to onboard its entire user base of over 500 million onto the UPI platform. NPCI initially imposed a cap of one million users on WhatsApp Pay in 2020. The cap was gradually increased to 100 million in 2022 and has now been completely removed.The initial restrictions were intended to ensure a gradual rollout of the service and prevent strain on the banking infrastructure. However, with the UPI ecosystem now more robust, the NPCI has given WhatsApp Pay the green light to expand its reach.","The National Payments Corporation of India has again delayed the implementation of its 30% market share cap for Unified Payments Interface ( UPI ) apps.

In a recent exchange on social media, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk , now the owner of platform X (formerly Twitter), urged users to contribute more positive, beautiful, or informative content. Musk’s call for more uplifting posts was met with a sharp and witty response from billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban , who quickly tweeted, “You first.” This playful retort sparked a viral moment on the platform, with many users joining in the conversation, some in support of Cuban’s bold comment, while others rallied behind Musk. The online exchange not only showcased the ongoing rivalry between the two tech moguls but also sparked wider discussions about leadership styles, transparency, and the role of influential figures on social media.Musk's initial tweet appeared on December 29, 2024, and reflected his desire to reshape the atmosphere on X. Musk, known for his sometimes controversial social media presence, suggested that more people should post content that is uplifting and informative. His request came as part of his broader efforts to improve the platform's image, after several months of intense debate over the direction of X under his leadership.“Please post a bit more positive, beautiful or informative content on this platform,” Musk tweeted, aiming to encourage a more constructive environment. Musk’s call for more positivity resonated with many, but it also seemed to trigger some skepticism, leading to the viral reply from Cuban.Cuban’s response was succinct and playful. As the owner of the Dallas Mavericks and a prominent figure in the tech and business world, Cuban is no stranger to public debates. In his tweet, Cuban humorously flipped Musk’s request back on him by stating, “You first,” thereby challenging Musk to lead by example.Cuban’s response quickly gained traction, with many users applauding his cheekiness and calling for more transparency from influential public figures, including Musk. Some supporters of Cuban highlighted his direct communication style as a key factor in his leadership, praising his ability to engage with critics openly.Cuban’s comment was met with widespread admiration from users who appreciated his straightforward approach. One Twitter user expressed that Cuban’s transparency and creative thinking would have made him a better fit to lead DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency), a newly proposed initiative by President-elect Donald Trump’s administration, aimed at reducing bureaucracy. Others chimed in, lauding Cuban’s direct engagement with critics as an essential trait for modern business leaders in the digital age.Not everyone sided with Cuban, however. Musk’s supporters were quick to defend him, citing his consistent updates on positive initiatives such as Starlink, his satellite internet project. Some users highlighted Musk’s contributions to global communication as an example of the positive and beautiful content he regularly shares on social media.One Musk supporter pointed out that Musk often posts updates about Starlink, implying that his content has been both positive and meaningful. Others questioned Cuban’s critique, asking why he would target Musk, given the billionaire’s track record of public achievements.This exchange is not the first time Mark Cuban has publicly disagreed with Elon Musk. In a prior incident, Cuban took issue with Musk’s controversial comments regarding Germany's Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Musk had compared the policies of the AfD to those of the US Democratic Party under President Barack Obama, sparking backlash from critics. Cuban responded to Musk’s endorsement by using Musk’s own AI chatbot, Grok, to challenge Musk’s stance. The chatbot ironically identified the Republican Party, which has been Musk’s preferred political affiliation in recent years, as the group most aligned with the AfD.","Elon Musk urged X users to post more positive, beautiful, or informative content.

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is likely to wield unprecedented influence in the new US government. His relationship with President-elect Donald J. Trump showcases a unique intertwining of business, politics, and personal connections. Reports reveal that Musk has not only emerged as Trump’s largest donor but also serves as a key advisor, shaping policy, personnel, and strategy decisions during the transition period. Musk has also reportedly been residing in a luxurious Mar-a-Lago cottage, a move that highlights access and influence.According to a report in the New York Times, since the US election day, Elon Musk has made Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s exclusive members-only club in Palm Beach, Florida, almost his temporary home. Nestled in the ""Banyan"" cottage, located just a few hundred feet from Trump’s main residence, Musk’s presence is reportedly said to enable him to join impromptu dinners, participate in critical policy discussions, and even sit in on calls with foreign leaders.The Banyan cottage, which typically rents for over $2,000 per night, has become Musk’s command center, as reported by the New York Times. Although details of Musk’s financial arrangements are not clear, speculation abounds regarding whether he pays the standard rate or receives special treatment. The Mar-a-Lago club is said to often bill guests at the conclusion of their stay, leaving room for uncertainty about Musk’s expenses. Some insiders suggest Trump may waive or reduce the rental fee, considering Musk’s significant political contributions and influence.Musk’s presence at Mar-a-Lago has reportedly not gone unnoticed, with reports highlighting his personalized approach to the stay. From requesting meals outside regular hours to spending time with his children and their nannies on the property, Musk’s interactions with Trump exude a sense of camaraderie. He has attended high-profile events, including the election night watch party, and shared dinners with influential figures like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. These personal moments have strengthened Musk’s rapport with Trump, enabling him to wield considerable influence over the incoming administration.Once Trump assumes office on January 20, Elon Musk’s proximity is expected to shift from Mar-a-Lago’s informal setting to the structured environment of the White House. While access to the West Wing is more regulated, Musk’s established relationship with Trump and his involvement in key decisions suggest his influence is likely to endure. Whether through official advisory roles or behind-the-scenes lobbying, Musk’s voice is likely to remain a significant factor in shaping U.S. policies that align with his business interests.","Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is likely to wield unprecedented influence in the new US government.

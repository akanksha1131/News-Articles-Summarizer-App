What Google's warning to retailers says

Scattered Spider: Hacker group that has likely targeted M&S

Alphabet's Google has reportedly issued a stark warning to United States retailers, indicating that the cybercriminal group responsible for the recent crippling disruptions of major UK businesses is now setting its sights stateside. The alert comes as British retail giant Marks & Spencer (M&S) continues to grapple with the fallout of a significant cyberattack that has paralyzed its online operations for three weeks. M&S, a household name in the UK, saw its online order system grind to a halt on April 25th. The disruption has had a tangible impact on the company, with its share price plummeting by 15% since the Easter weekend, when initial order issues surfaced. Despite its 1,000 physical stores remaining open, the ongoing suspension of online orders highlights the severity of the attack and the challenges in restoring normal services.While M&S has not officially confirmed the nature of the attack, multiple reports suggest the retailer fell victim to a ransomware attack. This type of cyber intrusion involves criminals gaining unauthorized access to a company's computer systems, encrypting crucial data, and demanding a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key and the restoration of access.Google's cybersecurity analysts are now raising concerns that this wave of attacks is poised to cross the Atlantic. As reported by Reuters, John Hultquist, an analyst at Google's cybersecurity arm, issued a direct warning in an email on Wednesday, stating, ""US retailers should take note. These actors are aggressive, creative, and particularly effective at circumventing mature security programs.""Hultquist identified the likely culprit as a group connected to ""Scattered Spider,"" a loosely organized network of hackers with varying skill levels. This group is widely believed to be behind the disruptive attack on M&S.""The Scattered Spider-connected group has a history of focusing on a single sector at a time and is likely to target retail for a while longer,"" Hultquist cautioned, emphasizing the immediate threat to US businesses in the same industry.Scattered Spider has established a track record of high-impact cyberattacks on both sides of the Atlantic. In 2023, the group gained notoriety for successfully breaching the security defenses of major casino operators MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment, causing significant operational disruptions and financial losses.Law enforcement agencies have faced considerable challenges in effectively combating hackers linked to Scattered Spider. This is partly attributed to the group's decentralized and fluid structure, the relatively young age of some of its members, and a reported reluctance among some cybercrime victims to fully cooperate with investigations, as previously reported by Reuters.Despite these challenges, the US retail sector appears to be on high alert. Christian Beckner, a vice president with the National Retail Federation, affirmed to Reuters that his members are acutely aware of the potential for disruptive intrusions from Scattered Spider-linked groups.""We've been closely tracking everything going on in the UK over the past few weeks,"" Beckner stated. ""There aren't geographic boundaries on these threats.""Google's warning serves as a critical call to action for US retailers to urgently review and strengthen their cybersecurity defenses in the face of this evolving and aggressive threat. The ongoing struggles of M&S underscore the significant financial and reputational damage that can result from such attacks, highlighting the imperative for proactive measures and vigilance within the industry.",Google warns U.S. retailers that cybercriminal group responsible for UK disruptions is now setting its sights stateside.

Protests at Google over project Nimbus

Jewish advocacy groups are urging Google-parent Alphabet shareholders to reject a proposal set for a vote at the company’s annual meeting, which demands an investigation into whether Google’s cloud services, particularly those involved in Israel’s Project Nimbus , contribute to human rights abuses in conflict zones. According to a report in New York Post, the Google 's annual shareholders meeting is scheduled for June 6, 2025, when the proposal will be put to vote.The proposal targets Alphabet’s contracts with the Israeli government, including Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion cloud initiative with Amazon that serves both civilian agencies and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), told the Post, “Proposal 9 offers the pretense of concern for human rights when in fact it is a thinly disguised ploy to weaken Israel’s national security — and to undermine its right to defend itself — by pressuring Alphabet to withhold vital technology that supports the country’s self-defense capabilities.” He added “We believe this proposal is closely aligned with the objectives of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, whose goal is to delegitimize the State of Israel.”The measure calls for an independent report to assess if Alphabet’s services contribute to human rights harms in “conflict-affected and high-risk areas.” Alphabet’s board has advised shareholders to vote against it, per the company’s proxy statement. Critics, including JLens, a Jewish investment advisor managing over $2 billion in assets, argue the proposal misrepresents Project Nimbus by framing it as a military project while ignoring its civilian uses in Israeli healthcare, finance, education, and transportation. Ari Hoffnung, JLens’ Managing Director, told the Post, “Alphabet’s shareholders should see this proposal for what it is: an attempt to misuse the proxy process to advance a divisive political agenda that has no place in corporate governance.”JLens has filed a formal opposition with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Post notes that Alphabet faced backlash after firing 28 employees in April 2024 over protests against Project Nimbus and criticism for acquiring Israeli cybersecurity firm Wiz, with BDS-aligned groups targeting Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian. The vote follows the October 7, 2023, terror attacks in Israel, which killed over 1,200 and saw hundreds taken hostage, heightening concerns about restricting technology critical to Israel’s civilian safety and infrastructure. Alphabet did not respond to the Post’s request for comment.",Proposal calls for an independent report to assess if Google’s services contribute to human rights harms in “conflict-affected and high-risk areas.

Who is Canada trade minster LeBlanc

LeBlanc on Trump Tariffs

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney unveiled his new economic team. Carney’s new cabinet includes a mix of familiar names and political rookies to carry out his ambitious economic agenda. He has kept the longtime politician François-Philippe Champagne as finance minister and places former Goldman Sachs banker Timothy Hodgson in charge of energy and mining. Canadian Prime Minister's pick for the position of trade minister is a vocal critic of US President Donald Trump . Analysts see him as Prime Minister Mark Carney’s answer to the trade war between the two North American neighbours. Carney has appointed New Brunswick lawmaker Dominic LeBlanc as the Canada-US trade minister. In simple terms, LeBlanc’s biggest challenge is no different from his counterparts across the globe, which is dealing with US President Donald Trump’s tariffs.LeBlanc is the man who had described Trump’s move as ""vandalizing"" the economic relationship between the US and Canada after the tariffs started to take effect. In response to the US administration's imposition of tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, LeBlanc had in April advocated for a strong stance against the US. His solution was to implement reciprocal tariffs on a range of US goods, aiming to protect Canadian industries and assert the country's economic sovereignty.An east-coast politician, LeBlanc rotated through various roles in Justin Trudeau ’s cabinet and was especially relied upon to negotiate with political opponents. Following Trump’s reelection in 2024, LeBlanc was elevated to a major role in managing US relations and became Canada’s key interlocutor on tariffs with the US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick . Carney’s decision to keep LeBlanc as Canada-US trade minister is seen as to mean that he will stay on that crucial task.Despite the strain caused by punitive tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, LeBlanc emphasized Canada’s commitment to diplomacy and collaboration, stressing the importance of mutually beneficial outcomes.In a statement to the New York Post, LeBlanc underscored that Canada will stand firm against unfair trade practices but remains focused on fostering economic partnerships globally. “Our number one objective is to eliminate these punitive tariffs and strengthen ties with other countries,” LeBlanc said, highlighting the government’s priority to mitigate the impact of U.S. trade policies.The ongoing dispute stems from the Trump administration’s recent imposition of tariffs, which have strained Canada-U.S. relations, a critical trade partnership. According to 2024 trade data from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Canada is the United States’ second-largest trading partner, with bilateral trade in goods and services exceeding $1 trillion annually. LeBlanc’s diplomatic efforts aim to preserve this vital economic relationship while exploring new global trade opportunities to counterbalance the tariffs’ effects.LeBlanc’s outreach reflects Canada’s broader strategy to navigate the complex trade landscape through dialogue and strategic partnerships, ensuring economic stability for Canadians amid rising geopolitical challenges.After the announcement, he posted on Twitter, “Thank you, Prime Minister @MarkJCarney for entrusting me with the role of President of the King’s Privy Council for Canada and Minister responsible for Canada-US Trade, Intergovernmental Affairs, and One Canadian Economy. I am eager to build Canada Strong together.”",Dominic LeBlanc has been appointed as the Canada-US trade minister. He has been a vocal critic of US President Donald Trump's trade policies.

“that these studios will create thousands of jobs for New Jersey residents, billions of dollars of economic output and many cultural benefits for the region and for the state.”

Netflix is transforming a former US Army base in central New Jersey into a $900 million movie studio. The new production hub, Netflix Studios Fort Monmouth , will be located on a long-abandoned US Army base. The streaming major recently broke ground on the facility that will span 500,000 square feet and include soundstages, a backlot, post-production suites, and offices. This project represents a significant East Coast expansion for Netflix, while the deal to build the campus in Eatontown is supported by $387 million in tax credits from New Jersey. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos cited New Jersey’s film and digital media tax credits as critical to the company’s investment. These tax credits offer up to 35% for production expenses and up to 40% for digital post-production.In a statement to the New York Post, Sarandos said that the company expectsSarandos said.Though a native of New Jersey, he noted that the decision was based on economics rather than sentiment.California’s position as the country’s film hub has declined as studios have moved production to lower‑tax areas like Georgia and the United Kingdom. An April report by ProdPro found New Jersey ranked sixth in US film and TV production, with $536 million in spending over the past year, behind California, New York, Illinois, New Mexico, and Georgia.Netflix currently has seven productions underway in New Jersey and plans to increase its output substantially after the Fort Monmouth facility is finished, which is scheduled for 2028.","Netflix is transforming a former US Army base in central New Jersey into a $900 million movie studio.

What Saudi Arabia’s $10 billion AI push means for Nvidia and AMD

What investors are betting big on AMD’s $6 billion share buyback

Can UAE help Nvidia and AMD get over China's DeepSeek troubles

What makes analysts term sovereign AI projects game changer

Nvidia and AMD shares surged Thursday, May 15, propelled by blockbuster AI partnerships in the Middle East, AMD’s bold stock buyback plan, and a global pivot in AI chip demand away from China. These developments have reignited investor enthusiasm, signaling a robust growth trajectory for U.S. chipmakers after a challenging start to the year. The rally is sparked by Saudi Arabia’s plan to become a global AI hub, with Nvidia and AMD at the heart of it. According to Reuters and Barron’s, the two companies inked multi-billion-dollar deals with Humain, the AI division of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF).Over the next five years, Nvidia and AMD will supply millions of AI chips to power data centers with a combined capacity of 500 megawatts. These facilities, part of a $10 billion AI infrastructure investment spanning Saudi Arabia and the U.S., will drive advanced AI applications in healthcare, defense, finance, and smart city initiatives. The scale of the project is staggering. Each data center will house thousands of high-performance GPUs, enabling complex tasks like training large language models and real-time analytics. Investor’s Business Daily reports that these sovereign-backed projects could lock in steady, long-term demand for Nvidia and AMD, with analysts estimating a global market for such initiatives at $50 billion annually by 2030.Adding fuel to the rally, AMD unveiled a $6 billion stock buyback program, complementing its existing $4 billion authorization. This $10 billion total repurchase plan, as noted by Reuters, underscores AMD’s belief in its undervalued stock and strong financial outlook. By reducing shares in circulation, the buyback is designed to boost shareholder value and enhance earnings per share. The announcement drove AMD’s stock up 6.4% on May 14, with Nvidia also posting significant gains as investor confidence soared.The rally marks a sharp recovery from earlier setbacks. In the first quarter of 2025, Nvidia and AMD stocks plummeted when Chinese AI lab DeepSeek unveiled models rivaling U.S. capabilities at a lower cost. Nvidia lost 17% of its value in a single day, erasing $600 billion in market cap, while AMD faced similar pressure, according to Yahoo Finance and CBS News. The Middle East deals, combined with AMD’s buyback and diversifying markets, have shifted the narrative, restoring investor faith in the chipmakers’ resilience.A pivotal factor in the stock surge is the shifting landscape of AI chip demand. The U.S. government’s reported approval of over 1 million Nvidia chip exports to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), per Investor’s Business Daily, highlights a growing reliance on Middle Eastern markets. This comes as U.S. chipmakers face tighter restrictions in China due to trade tensions and export controls. Middle Eastern nations, with their deep pockets and strategic AI ambitions, are stepping in as reliable, geopolitically stable customers. Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 and the UAE’s AI Strategy 2031 aim to position the region as a tech leader, creating a fertile ground for Nvidia and AMD’s growth.Beyond supplying chips, Nvidia and AMD are deepening their Middle East presence through training programs and software ecosystems. Nvidia’s CUDA platform and AMD’s ROCm framework are being integrated into regional AI curricula, fostering local talent and ensuring long-term reliance on their technologies. Additionally, both companies are exploring edge AI solutions for smart cities, such as autonomous traffic systems and energy optimization, which could further diversify revenue streams.Analysts quoted by Barron’s see sovereign AI projects as a game-changer, potentially creating a $50 billion annual market by 2030. As nations like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and others invest heavily in AI sovereignty, Nvidia and AMD are cementing their roles as indispensable partners. The stock surge on May 14 reflects investor bets on this global AI boom, with the Middle East emerging as a critical growth engine.","N Nvidia and AMD shares surged Thursday, May 15, propelled by blockbuster AI partnerships in the Middle East.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) revealed on Wednesday (May 14) a new stock buyback program totaling $6 billion. This move aligns AMD with other chipmakers seeking to decrease their outstanding shares as the rapid growth in their stock values, fueled by artificial intelligence (AI) enthusiasm, shows indications of moderating.“Our expanded share repurchase program reflects the Board’s confidence in AMD’s strategic direction, growth prospects, and ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow,” said AMD CEO Lisa Su.“We remain committed to disciplined capital allocation and driving strong shareholder returns, including investing in our leadership product portfolio to drive growth, while returning capital to owners,” she added.Following the announcement, AMD's shares experienced an increase of up to 6.4%. However, the company's stock has declined by over 6% year-to-date, contrasting with a less than 1% decrease in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.The buyback initiative elevates AMD's total repurchase authorisation to approximately $10 billion. This announcement comes a day after AMD disclosed a $10 billion collaboration with Humain, marking its entry into the trend of US technology firms establishing AI partnerships in the Middle East.Despite broader pressures on the chip sector stemming from concerns about AI-related expenditures and the implications of global trade tensions, AMD's stock performance has lagged behind its competitors. This underperformance is attributed to increasing apprehension regarding AMD's competitive standing within the growing AI market.While AMD has been recognised as a significant challenger to Nvidia's leading position in AI, the company now faces considerable competition from custom-designed processors and Nvidia's established dominance within the industry.","Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) revealed a new stock buyback program totaling $6 billion.

Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine

‘rawdog’ morning routine

Mark Zuckerberg follows the ‘Rawdog’ routine, know what it is

Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine key elements

1. No caffeine or external stimulants

Zuckerberg completely avoids caffeine in the mornings. While caffeine is widely used to combat fatigue and boost focus, he believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

This is in stark contrast to other tech leaders who often depend on multiple doses of caffeine throughout the day.

2. Intense physical activity: Brazilian jiu-jitsu and MMA

A central element of Zuckerberg’s morning is two hours of combat sports training, particularly Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA).

These are not light workouts. Zuckerberg actively engages in grappling and sparring, where split-second focus is essential.

He has stated that unlike running, which allows for mental wandering, jiu-jitsu requires full presence—a factor that helps him “recenter” and transition into work mode.

3. Mental presence and focus

The high-pressure nature of combat sports trains the brain to respond quickly under stress.

Zuckerberg uses these sessions to reset mentally, describing them as more effective than caffeine in waking up both the body and mind.

The risk of failure (being pinned or tapped out) keeps him focused, which in turn reduces stress from external sources.

4. Simplified lifestyle to reduce decision fatigue

Zuckerberg is known for his repetitive wardrobe—gray T-shirts, jeans, and sneakers. This choice is deliberate and helps him save cognitive effort for high-stakes decisions.

Reducing daily trivial choices aligns with psychological research indicating that decision fatigue can impair judgment over time.

5. High-protein diet and caloric intake

Why Zuckerberg chose this path: The influence of early education

How Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine powers executive performance

Enhanced cognitive function

Martial arts require constant anticipation, pattern recognition, and strategic thinking, which parallels the kind of problem-solving skills needed in high-level business decisions.

Stress management

Physical exertion is scientifically linked to lower cortisol levels and improved mood. Zuckerberg’s training acts as a buffer against the chronic stress of running a global tech company.

Improved executive functioning

The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue during the workday.

How Zuckerberg’s routine compared to Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, other tech leaders

Executive

Routine Element

Elon Musk

High caffeine intake, long work hours

Jack Dorsey

Fasting, meditation, cold plunges

Jeff Bezos

Prioritizes sleep, slow mornings

Tim Cook

Early rising with structured exercise



Scientific perspective on ‘Rawdog’ routines

Exercise improves executive functioning, especially activities that demand coordination and focus.

Caffeine-free mornings may lead to more stable energy levels, avoiding midday crashes associated with stimulant withdrawal.

Simplified routines reduce decision fatigue, as shown in studies on successful leaders and their minimalist approaches.

Routines are known to play a vital role in shaping the lives and productivity of high achievers across industries. Whether it’s elite athletes, creative professionals, or technology entrepreneurs, the way they start their day often sets the tone for how they approach challenges and decision-making. Among these successful individuals, Mark Zuckerberg—founder of Facebook and CEO of Meta—stands out not just for his innovations in the digital world but also for his unconventional personal discipline. His so-calledhas recently drawn public attention for its no-frills, stimulant-free approach to productivity and mental clarity.Unlike many of his peers in Silicon Valley who lean on coffee, energy drinks, or even mind-enhancing drugs to kick-start their day, Zuckerberg’s morning begins with no artificial aids. Instead, he embraces natural energy, physical intensity, and mental focus through a carefully structured regimen centered on Brazilian jiu-jitsu and minimalism. This article provides an in-depth, non-opinionated breakdown of Zuckerberg’s unique routine, detailing its structure, rationale, and implications for performance and mental resilience.The term ‘rawdog routine’, as used by Zuckerberg, refers to a lifestyle approach that entails confronting reality and the demands of the day without the aid of stimulants, drugs, or performance enhancers. The concept is based on the idea of beginning one’s day in a fully natural and present state. For Zuckerberg, this means no coffee, no cannabis, no nootropics, and no artificial substances that could alter his mental state. He has occasionally referred to drinking coffee recreationally while on vacation, but emphasizes that it is never a part of his regular workday schedule.This method, according to Zuckerberg, is about achieving mental clarity and physical readiness through discipline rather than chemical shortcuts. The only supplements he reportedly uses are creatine and vitamin D, both commonly accepted for muscle recovery and general health support.Zuckerberg’s rawdog morning routine is built on five foundational principles, all of which are designed to enhance productivity, reduce stress, and maintain mental sharpness.While Zuckerberg does not publicly share a specific meal plan, it is known that he consumes a high-protein diet, which is critical for recovery and energy post-training.Reports suggest his daily caloric intake may reach up to 4,000 calories, especially to meet the energy demands of intensive physical activity.Zuckerberg has cited his exposure to the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program in school as a formative influence behind his stance against drugs and stimulants. This early education helped shape his views on substance use and led to a personal policy of natural energy dependence, rather than chemical performance enhancements.Unlike other Silicon Valley executives who have publicly discussed experimenting with microdosing psychedelics or using smart drugs (nootropics), Zuckerberg maintains a more grounded, drug-free approach to focus and performance.Zuckerberg’s morning routine is not just a personal wellness strategy—it appears to have professional implications as well. Here’s how it aligns with executive performance demands:While Zuckerberg avoids all forms of chemical stimulation, other tech leaders have taken diverse approaches to optimizing performance:Zuckerberg’s ‘rawdog’ method is unique in its emphasis on no external stimulants, which sets it apart from the above figures.While no clinical studies have yet been conducted on Zuckerberg’s specific regimen, related research suggests:","Zuckerberg’s morning includes two hours of Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA) He believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity. The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120844476,imgsize-1833412,width-400,resizemode-4/Why-Mark-Zuckerberg-starts-his-day-without-coffee-Know-about-Facebook-founders-viral-Rawdog-routine.jpg"

Microsoft becomes world's most-valuable company and its No 1 position also has 'Trump Tariff' message on Apple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-becomes-worlds-most-valuable-company-and-its-no-1-position-also-has-trump-tariff-message-on-apple/articleshow/120845348.cms,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella



Trump Tariff pains 'hurting' Apple

Microsoft has once again ascended to World's Most Valuable company, overtaking Apple. Software giant Microsoft has claimed the title of the world's most valuable company as the week concluded, boasting a market capitalization of $3.235 trillion. This milestone positions them ahead of Apple , which had long held the top spot, with the iPhone maker's market cap closing on Friday (May 2) at $3.07 trillion.Securing the third position is Nvidia , whose valuation stands at $2.76 trillion, as reported by The Information's newsletter.The surge in Microsoft's stock price on Thursday fueled this shift, following the release of robust financial results for the March quarter that surpassed analyst forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the sustained strong demand for the company's cloud services and artificial intelligence (AI) offerings during an investor call.Throughout the year, Microsoft's shares have consistently outpaced Apple's, signaling growing investor confidence in the tech giant's strategic focus on AI and cloud computing. Notably, this significant post-earnings stock jump for Microsoft echoes a similar event in October 2015, when the burgeoning Azure cloud business witnessed revenue more than double, propelling shares upward by 10%, according to Investopedia.While Apple also delivered better-than-expected first-quarter results, buoyed by strong iPhone sales , the company is facing headwinds from newly implemented tariffs under President Donald Trump.Apple's extensive reliance on imported components within its supply chain renders it particularly vulnerable to the impact of these tariffs. Consequently, its share price has experienced a significant 18% decline since the beginning of the year, marking one of the most substantial drops among major technology companies.Furthermore, CEO Tim Cook has indicated that Apple anticipates an additional $900 million in costs this quarter due to the tariffs, unless the current conditions change.According to Dow Jones Market Data, as reported by NewsMax, Apple's decrease in market value represents the largest for any company at the start of this year. Among the leading tech firms, only Tesla has witnessed a steeper year-to-date decline in its shares, falling by 29%.","Microsoft's market cap now stands at $3.235 trillion, overtaking Apple.

Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools

Google claims breakup ""impossible"" without serious consequences

The US Justice Department have asked a federal judge to break up Google's advertising technology business, marking the second government request within a year that could fundamentally reshape the $2 trillion giant. During a hearing in Virginia, DOJ lawyers outlined plans to force Google to divest key components of its online advertising system following Judge Leonie M. Brinkema's April ruling that Google illegally monopolized portions of the digital advertising market .""To leave Google with 90 percent of publishers beholden to them is, frankly, too dangerous,"" said Julia Tarver Wood, the government's lead attorney in the case. The hearing established September 22 as the date when both parties will present detailed arguments about remedies.The Justice Department's proposal specifically targets Google's ad exchange—the technology connecting buyers and sellers of online ad space—along with tools used by website publishers to sell advertising inventory. The government plan would initially make Google's auction code available to publishers and other ad tech companies, followed by requiring Google to fully divest publisher tools that handle functions like record keeping.This latest action follows a separate antitrust case in Washington where the DOJ is seeking to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser to address monopolistic behavior in the search market. If both requests are granted, it would represent the most significant government-mandated corporate restructuring since AT&T's breakup in the 1980s.Google's defense team strongly opposed the breakup proposal, arguing it fails to comply with legal precedent and would create significant problems. Karen Dunn, Google's lead attorney, called the plan ""very likely completely impossible"" without causing serious problems, noting few potential buyers exist for the technology besides ""enormous tech companies.""Google instead proposed changing certain business practices and opening its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers, while arguing that divesting these technologies would eliminate important security and privacy protections the company currently provides.Judge Brinkema ruled last month that Google had illegally monopolized both publisher tools and ad exchange software, though she dismissed claims related to advertiser tools. The business in question represents only a portion of Google's massive online advertising revenue, which funds its free services like Maps, Gmail, and search.","Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools.

GTA 6 release and updates FAQs

What is the official release date of GTA 6?

Grand Theft Auto VI will launch on May 26, 2026, according to Rockstar’s announcement on May 2, 2025.

Why was GTA 6 delayed from 2025?

Rockstar stated that the delay was to ensure the game meets the quality expectations of players and the studio’s own development standards.

What platforms will GTA 6 be available on?

Although not officially confirmed, GTA 6 is expected to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Will there be new trailers before the release?

Yes, Rockstar has confirmed that more information and footage will be released in the months following the release date announcement.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

A diverse group of executives from tech giants, financial institutions, consumer brands, and other sectors—including representatives from four of the top 10 U.S. companies by market value attended a high-profile lunch in Saudi Arabia. Their goals were multifaceted: to pitch for business from Saudi Arabia’s deep-pocketed investors, businesses, and government entities, and to navigate the complexities of new U.S. trade policies. With tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on key U.S. trading partners, the trip provided a strategic opportunity to engage with senior Trump officials, such as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, to influence trade policy and mitigate economic impacts.Saudi Arabia is aiming to position itself as a global powerhouse in artificial intelligence (AI), channeling vast investments into the sector as part of its broader strategy to diversify its oil-dependent economy and gain influence in one of the most dynamic industries. Prominent AI leaders at the event included Sam Altman , CEO of OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT; Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, a leader in advanced chip manufacturing; Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer of Alphabet, Google’s parent company; and Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, a dominant player in cloud-computing services critical to AI development. Elon Musk , a standout figure at the lunch, juggles multiple roles: leading Trump’s initiative to streamline the federal government while steering Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI. His AI venture, xAI, is reportedly in discussions for a new funding round that could value the company at up to $120 billion, underscoring Saudi Arabia’s appeal as a potential investment partner.The kingdom’s massive spending on technology, infrastructure, green energy, and other strategic priorities has made it a magnet for global financial leaders. Attendees included top financial executives such as Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone, Larry Fink of BlackRock, and Jane Fraser of Citigroup, all eager to advise Saudi Arabia and its state-backed enterprises on investment opportunities and economic diversification. The event also highlighted Saudi Arabia’s growing role as a hub for public-private partnerships, with its sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), actively seeking to expand its global portfolio in cutting-edge industries.Here are some of the business executives and other guests at the lunch, according to a list provided by the White House:Reid Hoffman, executive chair of LinkedIn, was on the list of attendees provided by the White House, but a representative said he did not attend.","A diverse group of executives from tech giants, financial institutions, consumer brands, and other sectors attended a high-profile lunch in Saudi Arabia.

Elon Musk vs Tesla



Challenges Tesla’s special committee faces

Tesla board is reportedly looking to offer a fresh package of stock options to CEO Elon Musk . According to a report by Financial Times, the company’s board has formed a special committee to review Musk’s compensation. Quoting sources familiar with the matter, the report said that the committee comprises board chair Robyn Denholm and director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson. The existence of the special committee was disclosed in a SEC filing for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2025. It said:“Additionally, the Company’s Board of Directors has established a Special Committee to consider certain compensation matters involving Mr. Musk.”Along with Musk’s pay package, the committee will also “explore alternative ways to compensate him for past work should Tesla fail to reinstate his record 2018 pay deal via an appeal at the Delaware Supreme Court this year,” the report says.“The committee is still in the early stages of deliberation and neither a new package nor any decision on how Musk’s new pay would be structured is guaranteed,” the source told the publication.Tesla and CEO Elon Musk have been involved in a legal dispute for seven years in Delaware over Musk’s pay package. Elon Musk's 2018 compensation package included 304 million stock options. It was a performance-based deal, meaning Musk would receive stock options based on Tesla's stock price and performance meeting specific targets. The CEO became eligible to exercise all the options in 2023 after meeting a series of aggressive valuation and financial performance goals set by the company.At the time of the court ruling in early 2024, these options were worth about $56 billion. Their value later peaked at $146 billion in December and currently stands at around $98 billion based on Tesla’s share price.In January 2024, Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick cancelled the deal, saying the amount was too large and that Tesla's board members were too influenced by Musk. She said they acted “like supine servants of an overweening master.”In 2024, Musk has threatened to leave Tesla unless he is given more control over the company.Any new compensation package for Elon Musk would now fall under Texas law, as Tesla shifted its headquarters to the state last year. To address this, the FT reports says that the special committee has brought in a new legal adviser, McDermott Will & Emery, which specializes in Texas corporate law . Previously, the board worked with Sidley Austin, a Delaware-based firm.The committee is also grappling with how to grant Musk additional stock options if the original 2018 package is not reinstated through the ongoing appeal. According to the report, reissuing the options could create significant financial and tax challenges. For Tesla, it would mean booking an accounting charge of more than $50 billion. For Musk, accepting the reissued options could result in a 57% tax rate, since the performance goals tied to the options have already been met, making them “in the money.”",Tesla board reportedly looking to offer a fresh package of stock options to CEO Elon Musk.

These hacker groups from Pakistan and Bangladesh tried to bring down Indian websites after Operation Sindoor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/these-hacker-groups-from-pakistan-and-bangladesh-tried-to-bring-down-indian-websites-after-operation-sindoor/articleshow/121163788.cms,"Pakistani spy group APT36 hacking Indian mobile users' information

Cyber researchers have reportedly identified an army of state/non-state actors like Islamic Hacker Army (Iraq), Team Azrael-Angel of Death (Palestine), Sylhet Gang SG (Bangladesh), DieNet (Bangladesh) APT36 (Pakistan), Pakistan Cyber Force, Team Insane PK, Mysterious Bangladesh, Indo Hacks Sec (Pakistan), Cyber Group HOAX 1337 (Pakistan) and National Cyber Crew (Pakistan-allied) and claiming to deface websites and breach sensitive data from several Indian government and private organisations in the past week.Security firm CloudSEK said that it has identified more than 100 claims of data theft or credential loss which were exaggerated, recycled or fake. In the past week, hacktivist groups have made grandiose claims of cyber breach. For instance, Bangladesh’s SYLHET GANG-SG and DieNet claimed to have exfiltrated 247 GB of data from India’s National Informatics Centre. However, an analysis of a 1.5 GB sample by CloudSEK showed only publicly available marketing materials. Similarly, Team Azrael-Angel Of Death claimed 1 million citizen records from the Election Commission, but was debunked as recycled data from a 2023 leak, not a fresh compromise, CloudSEK said.In a report titled ""Road of Sindoor"", the Maharashtra Cyber Police detailed the cyber warfare launched by Pakistan-allied hacking groups. The state's nodal cyber agency identified several Pakistani hacker groups responsible for launching over 15 lakh cyber attacks targeting critical infrastructure websites across India following the Pahalgam terror strike. Officials added that of these, only 150 attacks were successful.On the methods used by Pakistani hackers, the Maharashtra Cyber Police said that these include malware campaigns, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks and GPS spoofing.The report also highlights a hybrid warfare strategy by Pakistan-allied groups that includes widespread misinformation campaigns. These groups falsely claimed to have hacked India's banking system and caused power outages. These false narratives included claims of cyber attacks on India's power grid, statewide blackouts, satellite jamming, disruption of the Northern Command, and an alleged attack on a BrahMos missile storage facility, Indian security agencies said.One real threat that cybersecurity officials warned about is from the APT36, the Pakistan-linked spy group also known as Transparent Tribe. “The group has used malware payloads, including the AllaKore and Crimson RATs, granting the attackers extensive remote control and unfettered access to infected systems,” said Sanjay Katkar, joint managing director at Quick Heal Technologies.Cybercriminals are also using AI-generated images and videos to carry out phishing social media and messaging apps. “We've seen fake official-looking letters with made-up numbers, or videos that pretend to show new attacks on India but actually use old war pictures to trick people,” CloudSEK’s Reddy said.These kinds of links/messages are said to spread through WhatsApp, Telegram and social media, preying on national sentiment to steal personal data or financial details.","Security firm CloudSEK said that it has identified more than 100 claims of data theft or credential loss which were exaggerated, recycled or fake.

Google’s has created distribution barriers



Startup accelerator Y Combinator (YC) has labeled Google a "" monopolist "" that has ""stunted"" the US startup ecosystem in an amicus brief filed May 9 in the government's ongoing antitrust case against the search giant.YC charged that Google has ""chilled independent firms like YC from funding and accelerating innovative startups that could otherwise have challenged Google's dominance,"" creating what it calls a ""kill zone"" that deters venture capital investment in potential Google competitors.""The result is a landscape that has been artificially stunted and stagnant,"" YC wrote in its filing.Despite the harsh criticism, YC CEO Garry Tan clarified that the organization isn't calling for Google's immediate dismantling.""We love Google and what it represents as a paragon of US-led tech and innovation . We also want to make sure the excesses of big tech make way for tomorrow's little tech,"" Tan wrote on social media following the brief's submission.YC proposes several remedies, including ending Google's practice of paying billions to be the default search engine on devices like iPhones and opening Google's search index for competitors to train large language models.""We are not calling for a breakup of Google,"" Tan emphasized. ""If anything we hope that a measured and thoughtful remedy between USG and Google from here (5 year term!) means a court-supervised spin-off is contingent, and a last resort.""YC argues Google's dominance creates nearly insurmountable barriers for startups entering the search market.""Google's 90% search dominion is a ladder-pull for startups.

Proposed penalties could include requiring Google to divest parts of its business if it doesn't implement changes within five years.""VC investment in a sector drops about 40% after a big tech consolidation/acquisition,"" Tan noted. ""Founders aren't asking for a handout or a leg up. They want a level playing field, which we don't have.""YC's stance may surprise some given its recent partnerships with Google, including access to dedicated GPU clusters for YC startups and Google's acquisitions of YC-backed companies Flutter and Fridge.""We want Google to succeed and we also want the next Google to succeed,"" Tan concluded.","Startup accelerator Y Combinator has labeled Google a "" monopolist "" in an amicus brief filed May 9 in the government's ongoing antitrust case against the search giant.

What is the Interstate Obscenity Definition Act (IODA)

Appeal to prurient (sexual) interests,

Depict sexual conduct in a patently offensive way according to contemporary community standards,

Lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.

The Economic Times

Key provisions of the IODA

Broader definition of obscenity: Removes the requirement for community standards and intent, focusing solely on the content itself.

Stricter federal oversight: Extends federal jurisdiction over obscene material distributed across state lines or internationally, regardless of local laws.

Removal of artistic or scientific exemptions: Omits the current requirement to assess the artistic, scientific, political, or literary value of the content.

Focus on online distribution: Specifically targets digital platforms and websites that host or distribute adult content, reflecting the realities of the internet age.

Senator Mike Lee’s rationale for the bill

Impact on online pornography and free speech

What makes the IODA different from past obscenity laws

Next steps for the bill in Congress

A newly proposed bill in the United States Congress could bring sweeping changes to the legal landscape of online pornography . The legislation, known as the Interstate Obscenity Definition Act (IODA), was introduced by Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee and co-sponsored by Representative Mary Miller of Illinois. According toreport, if enacted, the bill would redefine what constitutes ""obscene"" content under federal law , potentially making a wide range of adult material illegal across the country.This significant shift could impact content creators, platforms, and consumers, raising critical questions about free speech, digital privacy, and the future of online expression. Given the potential for far-reaching effects, this proposal has sparked intense debate among lawmakers, legal experts, and civil rights advocates.The Interstate Obscenity Definition Act is a legislative effort to revise the federal definition of obscenity, which has remained largely unchanged for decades. Currently, the definition of obscene material is based on the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Miller v. California, which established a three-part standard, commonly known as the ""Miller Test."" For content to be considered legally obscene under this test, it must:The IODA seeks to eliminate much of this nuance by creating a stricter, more straightforward definition, as reported by. It proposes that any material that appeals to prurient interests in nudity, sex, or excretion, and depicts or describes sexual acts with the intent to arouse, could be classified as obscene. Notably, the bill removes the requirement to prove the ""intent"" of distribution, a significant departure from the existing Communications Act of 1934. This change would make it easier for federal authorities to prosecute cases involving sexually explicit content, even if the creators did not specifically intend to distribute such material as obscene.The IODA introduces several critical changes to existing obscenity laws, including:In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Senator Mike Lee argued that the current legal definitions of obscenity are too vague and difficult to enforce, allowing the adult entertainment industry to operate largely unchecked. He stated, ""Obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment. But hazy, unenforceable definitions have allowed pornography companies to infect our society, peddle smut to children, and do business across state lines unimpeded."" Lee emphasized that the IODA is intended to close these loopholes and provide a more robust legal framework to combat what he views as the harmful effects of pornography.This is not Lee’s first attempt to tighten federal obscenity laws. He introduced similar bills in both 2022 and 2023, although those efforts failed to gain sufficient support. However, this latest version, with its more streamlined approach, may have a better chance of advancing through Congress.If passed, the IODA could have profound implications for the adult entertainment industry and digital free speech in the United States. Critics argue that the bill’s broad definition of obscenity could criminalize a wide range of consensual adult content, including materials that may lack ""serious artistic or scientific value"" but are still widely accepted in modern culture. This raises concerns about potential overreach and censorship, particularly given the bill's removal of the ""community standards"" clause, which has historically served as a buffer against overly restrictive interpretations of obscenity.Additionally, the bill's focus on digital distribution could pose significant challenges for online platforms. Many adult websites are hosted or accessed across multiple states or even international borders, potentially exposing them to federal prosecution if the bill becomes law.The key distinction between the IODA and previous obscenity laws is its simplified, more aggressive approach to defining and prosecuting obscene material. Unlike the Miller Test, which requires a nuanced assessment of local community standards and artistic value, the IODA focuses solely on the nature of the content itself. This shift reflects a broader trend among conservative lawmakers to crack down on what they see as harmful digital content, regardless of artistic intent or regional cultural differences.Moreover, the IODA directly targets the modern realities of digital communication, which the original 1973 ruling could not have anticipated. By removing the ""intent"" clause, the bill lowers the bar for prosecution, potentially making it easier for federal authorities to bring cases against content creators, platforms, and even individual users.The IODA is currently under consideration in Congress, where it will likely face a challenging path to passage. While it may attract support among conservative lawmakers, it is expected to encounter significant opposition from free speech advocates, digital rights organizations, and some business groups. The bill’s success will depend largely on whether it can garner bipartisan support, a critical factor in the current polarized political environment.For now, the bill is gaining attention not only for its potential legal impact but also for the broader cultural debate it has sparked over the role of adult content in American society.","The Interstate Obscenity Definition Act (IODA) was introduced by Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee.

Melinda French Gates’ dream which changed her life

Melinda Gates says she suffered panic attacks

Microsoft founder Bill Gates ex-wife Melinda French Gates has revealed that a recurring dream played an important role in her decision to end her 27-year marriage. The divorce, which was finalised in 2021, followed the surfacing of certain information that impacted the couple's relationship. In a recent interview French Gates revealed that she experienced recurring nightmares in late 2019. She claimed that the dream turned out be a turning point in her journey.In an interview with enterprenuer Jamie Kern Lima, French Gates described her symbolic dream. Melinda Gates described that in her dream, she saw that she was standing on a cliff along with Bill gates and their children. As the dream progressed, the portion of the cliff where she stood began to crumble and break away. This imagery had a profound effect on her, which she interpreted as a clear sign that she needed to separate and move forward on her own.“I was going to have to make a decision—and I was going to have to make it by myself,” she recalled.""Some dreams will take me years to understand, but if they’re recurring, I know I need to pay attention to them,” added Melinda Gates.While the dream served as a catalyst, Melinda's decision was also influenced by other factors. While she did not disclose specific details, Melinda acknowledged that certain things came out publicly, reinforcing her decision to leave the marriage. She referenced Bill Gates’ past meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, which she described as deeply disturbing. Bill has previously admitted that associating with Epstein was a mistake.In a recent candid interview with The Times, French Gates addressed Bill Gates’ remarks about their divorce. She said, “If you can’t live your values out inside your most intimate relationship, it was necessary.”French Gates also opened up about the emotional strain of the divorce, sharing that she experienced panic attacks throughout the separation. “When you’re leaving a marriage, it’s very, very hard. And the negotiations were tough,” she said.She shared that her first panic attack occurred in 2014 while having lunch with Gates, prompting her to begin therapy. “I’d heard of people having panic attacks and I didn’t know if it was a real thing,” she said.Initially skeptical of therapy, French Gates admitted she later came to understand its value. “It doesn’t mean I’m damaged,” she explained. “It means I’ve been through some difficult things that I need to figure out.”Following the divorce, both Bill and Melinda Gates have continued their philanthropic efforts, though they are no longer working together as a couple. Bill Gates has publicly expressed regret about the divorce, acknowledging his role in the dissolution of their marriage.",Melinda French Gates has revealed that a recurring dream played an important role in her decision to end her 27-year marriage to Bill Gates.

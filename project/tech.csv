“The filmmaker with no visual skill, or access to a set, or to a camera, or to actors, but with an idea,”

“It's going to start with shorts and animated things and so forth, but it's going to work its way up to full movies,”

“People who otherwise would be limited to only being novelists or people who do graphic novels but are creative geniuses are going to be able to actually make full movies with AI. I think that's a reason for profound optimism. I think we're going to get completely new kinds of film and entertainment from people who otherwise never would have been able to access the medium. I'm very positive on that,”

How other parts of the entertainment industry are adapting to AI





“Some voices in the tech industry believe copyright should be abolished. We don't. Musicians' rights matter. Copyright is essential. If the music industry doesn't lead in this moment, AI-powered innovation will happen elsewhere, without rights, consent, or compensation.”





Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, has shared his views on the future of filmmaking. As a film enthusiast, he believes that advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) will soon change how films are made. Andreessen has claimed that creators without traditional visual skills or large budgets can also make films using AI tools. Speaking on an episode of A16z’s (a company that he co-founded) podcast “Monitoring the Situation”, Andreessen said that new AI tools, like the ones being developed by OpenAI , will enable a different type of filmmaker to emerge. He believes that AI will remove barriers like costly equipment and technical expertise, allowing people with creative skills to make films.Describing future filmmakers, Andreessen said:will be able to make films using AI.he added.Andreessen explained.This comes after A16z announced that it had invested in Promise, a studio that uses AI to produce films and other creative projects, last year. While some see AI as a way to lower costs and finish work faster, others fear it could lead to job losses. There are also concerns about copyright issues in how AI models are trained and how they use existing intellectual property.Beyond filmmaking, other parts of the entertainment industry are also dealing with how AI affects creative professionals. This week, Spotify announced a partnership with major record labels and music companies to create “artist-first” AI music tools. In its press release, the streaming platform also criticised the broader tech industry.The company said,","Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, has shared his views on the future of filmmaking.

Microsoft may become one of the biggest customers of these new Intel chips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-may-become-one-of-the-biggest-customers-of-these-new-intel-chips/articleshow/124678084.cms,"Representative Image





Microsoft is reportedly showing significant interest in using AI chips made with Intel's new 18A manufacturing process. If the rumours are true, this could make the software giant a key customer for the AI chips manufactured using the US-based chipmakers' newly announced process. The 18A process is an advanced manufacturing technique used for making semiconductors, including AI chips. A new report claims that Microsoft is even moving toward integrating the technology. This also suggests that major tech companies are reacting positively to Intel’s new node. While interest in external adoption may be growing, it is important to note that Intel's 18A process was initially developed primarily for internal use on products like Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest. Intel itself is reportedly relying on its 14A process to capture broader market attention.What Microsoft has already said about Intel’s 18A processA report by SemiAccurate cited past observations to suggest that Microsoft is emerging as a key 18A customer, with node sampling ongoing since Pat Gelsinger was Intel’s CEO.The report claims that Microsoft plans to use this chip process for its upcoming Maia 2 AI accelerators, which may include both 18A and 18A-P variants, depending on how the company designs its AI chips.It also mentions that other clients are expected to adopt the process, though Microsoft appears to be a strong contender among Intel’s foundry customers.Earlier, while commenting on Intel’s 18A process, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said: “We are in the midst of a very exciting platform shift that will fundamentally transform productivity for every individual organisation and the entire industry. To achieve this vision, we need a reliable supply of the most advanced, high-performance and high-quality semiconductors. That is why we are so excited to work with Intel Foundry, and why we have chosen a chip design that we plan to produce on Intel 18A process. ”Apart from Microsoft, several other names have been linked to Intel’s 18A platform over time, based on earlier reports and trends. However, none of the deals have been confirmed yet.The report claims Broadcom may have tested 18A design kits but reportedly backed out due to unsatisfactory yield rates. However, with recent improvements that have reduced defect density, Broadcom and others may revisit the idea of working with Intel Foundry Services.How customers respond to the 18A process will be important, since wider adoption could help Intel expand its production capacity and set the stage for the more advanced 14A node.","Microsoft is reportedly showing significant interest in using Intel's new 18A manufacturing process.

Google Nano Banana AI may be coming to Google Messages and here's what makes it a 'Big Deal',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-nano-banana-ai-may-be-coming-to-google-messages-and-heres-what-makes-it-a-big-deal/articleshow/124677804.cms,"What makes Nano Banana coming to Google Messages Big

Nano Banana coming to Google Search, NotebookLM and Photos.





Google’s 'Nano Banana' image editing AI tool, celebrated for its ability to maintain likeness in AI-generated images, has been making quite waves. Following its successful integration into Google Search’s AI Mode and Google Lens, Google is now reportedly embedding Nano Banana into Google Messages. Android Authority recently spotted that Google Messages version 20251009 contains code referencing Nano Banana functionality. It also reported Google’s efforts to incorporate Nano Banana into Google Photos, suggesting the tech giant aims to weave this feature across its entire app ecosystem. In Google Messages, enabling the feature unveils a Banana icon in the header when users long-press an image in personal or group chats, hinting at seamless AI image editing within conversations.Addition of Nano Banana to Google Messages appears to be a move that is more than a playful addition -- it is seen as a calculated strike in the escalating AI messaging war. Unlike Meta’s “Imagine” AI, which emphasizes creating images from text prompts in WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, Nano Banana’s focus in Messages centers on editing existing images. Android users may be able to apply filters, clean up photos, or create memes effortlessly, using Nano Banana’s superior likeness retention.Google’s rival, Meta, has been integrating its ""Imagine"" AI image generator into WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, allowing users to create custom images from text prompts directly in chats. However, Meta’s tool has faced criticism for inconsistent likeness retention. Google’s Nano Banana, with its superior ability to preserve accurate likeness in generated images, could redefine the user experience by enabling personalized reaction memes that truly resemble their subjects.As Google continues to roll out Nano Banana across its platforms, the company is positioning itself to outpace competitors in delivering cohesive, AI-enhanced user experiences. If successful, Nano Banana could set a new standard for AI-driven creativity in messaging apps, leaving Meta scrambling to catch up.In August, Google introduced its latest image editing model, Nano Banana from Gemini 2.5 Flash.

Providers and developers of artificial intelligence or machine learning technologies, including but not limited to large language models, generative artificial intelligence platforms, general-purpose artificial intelligence assistants, or similar technologies as determined by Meta in its sole discretion (“AI Providers”), are strictly prohibited from accessing or using the WhatsApp Business Solution, whether directly or indirectly, for the purposes of providing, delivering, offering, selling, or otherwise making available such technologies when such technologies are the primary (rather than incidental or ancillary) functionality being made available for use, as determined by Meta in its sole discretion.

What Meta-owned WhatsApp said on new terms





WhatsApp, owned by Meta, has updated its Business API policy to prohibit general-purpose chatbots, a move that will impact AI assistants from companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, Khosla Ventures-backed Luzia, and General Catalyst-backed Poke. The new terms, effective January 15, 2026, explicitly ban AI providers from using the WhatsApp Business Solution to distribute AI technologies, such as large language models and generative AI assistants, when these are the primary functionality.The policy change, confirmed by Meta to TechCrunch, aims to refocus the WhatsApp Business API on its intended purpose: enabling businesses to provide customer support and send relevant updates. A new section in the API terms targets “AI Providers,” stating that they are “strictly prohibited” from using the platform to offer general-purpose AI assistants, as determined by Meta’s discretion. However, businesses using AI for customer service, such as a travel company’s support bot, remain unaffected.Meta explained that the rise in general-purpose chatbots has strained its systems with increased message volumes and required support the platform wasn’t designed to handle. “The WhatsApp Business API is built for businesses serving customers, not for chatbot distribution,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. “Our focus is on supporting tens of thousands of businesses building these experiences on WhatsApp. ”The decision effectively positions Meta AI as the sole AI assistant on WhatsApp, barring competitors from leveraging the platform to distribute their AI solutions.","WhatsApp, owned by Meta, has updated its Business API policy to prohibit general-purpose chatbots.

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

AI's ""jagged intelligence"" problem threatens AGI timeline

Major tech players still years away from true AGI





Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has issued a stark warning about artificial intelligence's critical flaw: inconsistency. Speaking on the "" Google for Developers"" podcast, Hassabis revealed that even the most advanced AI systems can ace elite mathematical competitions yet fail at elementary school problems—a vulnerability he says must be fixed before reaching artificial general intelligence (AGI).""It shouldn't be that easy for the average person to just find a trivial flaw in the system,"" Hassabis stated, highlighting how Google's Gemini models enhanced with DeepThink can win gold medals at the International Mathematical Olympiad but ""still make simple mistakes in high school maths.""Hassabis described current AI as having ""uneven intelligences"" or ""jagged intelligences""—excelling brilliantly in some dimensions while being easily exposed in others. This characterization echoes Google CEO Sundar Pichai's term ""AJI"" (artificial jagged intelligence) coined earlier this year to describe systems with uneven capabilities.The DeepMind chief emphasized that solving this inconsistency requires more than just scaling up data and computing power. ""Some missing capabilities in reasoning and planning in memory"" still need to be cracked, he explained, calling for better testing methodologies and ""new, harder benchmarks"" to precisely map AI strengths and weaknesses.Despite predicting AGI's arrival ""in the next five to 10 years"" in April, Hassabis acknowledges significant hurdles remain. His concerns align with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman 's recent assessment following GPT-5's launch, where Altman admitted the model lacks continuous learning capabilities—something he considers essential for true AGI.The warnings underscore a growing recognition among AI leaders that current systems' propensity for hallucinations, misinformation, and basic errors must be addressed before achieving human-level reasoning—a cautionary tale reminiscent of social media platforms' early failures to anticipate consequences at scale.",Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has issued a stark warning about artificial intelligence's critical flaw: inconsistency.

What Salesforce has to say







Internal company documents and communications obtained by The New York Times indicate that Salesforce actively pitched the use of its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), aiming to assist the agency in staffing up for expanded immigration raids and deportations across the country. This development follows public controversy generated by Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who recently stated he ""fully supports"" President Donald Trump and desires the deployment of National Guard troops in San Francisco.Benioff's public alignment with the Trump administration on law enforcement matters stands in sharp contrast to the city's Democrat politics and his own reputation as a benefactor of progressive causes, the report noted, adding that the internal documents suggest Benioff’s support extended into offering the company's technology to aid the administration's immigration efforts.The internal materials, which the publication says was provided by an individual who cannot be named, included a five-page memo sent on August 26. This memo explained how Salesforce was uniquely suited to assist ICE with ""talent acquisition"" to help the agency achieve its goal of ""nearly tripl[ing] its work force by hiring 10,000 new officers and agents expeditiously.""Other documents included a spreadsheet of ICE “opportunities,” the company’s term for potential contracts, and an internal brainstorming slide deck suggesting how AI agents could help ICE evaluate information sent to the agency’s tip line and improve investigations.The company was responding to an ICE request for firms to explain how they could help hire more agents and was hoping to land a paid contract.San Francisco leaders, already outraged by Benioff's comments on the National Guard, were further upset upon learning that the homegrown tech company was actively pursuing contracts to aid the administration's immigration crackdown.In a statement, the company noted that it has served the US government across multiple administrations and that all customers are bound by company policies requiring responsible product use. Salesforce has also contracted with ICE under the Obama and Biden administrations.Salesforce is not alone; other tech companies, including Palantir, Microsoft, and IBM, also hold contracts with ICE to support its enforcement efforts under President Trump.","Internal company documents and communications obtained by The New York Times indicate that Salesforce actively pitched the use of its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Google expands AI infrastructure and data centres

Strengthening Belgium’s digital future

AI’s potential for economic growth





US tech giant Google has announced plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network, creating hundreds of new jobs and supporting local economic growth. The investment will focus on the company’s existing Saint-Ghislain site and the new Farciennes campus, with construction already underway. Google said the expansion will strengthen Belgium’s role in Europe’s cloud and AI sector, provide large-scale computing capacity powered by carbon-free energy, and create opportunities for local suppliers and contractors. Officials highlighted the move as a vote of confidence in Belgium’s tech ecosystem and workforce.The investment will modernise and expand Google’s network of data centres in Saint-Ghislain and Farciennes, enabling the company to handle large volumes of digital data and support advanced AI systems. These facilities are designed to operate entirely on clean energy, aligning with Google’s global goal to achieve carbon-free operations by 2030. The expansion will also support the development of new onshore wind farms in Belgium to power the centres sustainably.The project is expected to create around 300 new full-time jobs directly, while indirectly supporting approximately 15,000 additional roles through local contractors and partners. Google already works with about 150 Belgian suppliers, including 80 in Wallonia, and the expansion will further boost construction, technology, and service sector employment. Prime Minister Bart De Wever emphasized that the investment underscores Belgium’s growing importance as a digital and green technology hub.Belgium has become a key location for technology growth thanks to its reliable internet networks, stable power supply, and skilled workforce. Google Cloud already serves Belgian companies and organizations such as Odoo and UZ Leuven, helping them scale AI-based tools for healthcare, research, and business. The new investment will enhance Belgium’s competitiveness in the European cloud and AI market, attracting further international investment and innovation.A 2024 study commissioned by Google estimated that artificial intelligence could increase Belgium’s GDP by €45 to €50 billion over the next decade. Most jobs are expected to be supported or improved by AI, with only a small portion at risk of automation. By expanding AI infrastructure, Google aims to equip Belgian companies and the workforce with advanced digital tools while fostering sustainable and inclusive growth. The investment positions Belgium as a hub for next-generation AI innovation in Europe. It also signals Google’s commitment to combining technological advancement with environmental responsibility, shaping the future of digital and green growth.","Google plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network.

In an emotional response on X, Vembu dedicated the moment to engineers who chose to work from India despite opportunities abroad.""Thank you Sir, for your faith in us. I dedicate this moment to our hard-working engineers who have toiled hard in Zoho for over 20 years. They all stayed in India and worked all these years because they believed.

Sharing his new email address—amitshah.bjp@zohomail.in—on social media, the Home Minister requested all future correspondence be directed to his Zoho account, marking a symbolic shift away from global platforms like Gmail and Outlook.The move aligns with the government's broader push for digital sovereignty.

Parents will also be able to see broad topics their teens discuss with chatbots and Meta's AI assistant, without being forced to turn off all AI access entirely. Specific character blocking: The tools will also enable parents to block specific AI characters from interacting with their teen.





Meta has announced that it will introduce new controls allowing parents to disable their teenagers' private, one-on-one chats with AI characters. This is the latest measure aimed at making its social media platforms safer for minors, following fierce criticism regarding the behaviour of its chatbots. The new supervision tools are slated to debut on Instagram early next year in the US, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, according to a blog post detailed by Instagram head Adam Mosseri and Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang.The move comes after news agency Reuters reported in August on how Meta's AI rules had permitted provocative conversations with minors, prompting stepped-up scrutiny of AI companies by US regulators over the potential negative impacts of chatbots.The new controls offer flexibility for families:Meta confirmed that its general AI assistant will remain available with age-appropriate defaults even if parents disable the private chats with specific AI characters. The company reiterated that its AI characters are designed not to engage in age-inappropriate discussions about self-harm, suicide or disordered eating with minors.These supervision features build on existing protections already applied to teen accounts, with Meta using AI signals to place suspected teens into protection even if they claim to be adults.Recently, the company announced that Meta’s AI experiences for teens will be guided by the PG-13 movie rating system to prevent minors from accessing inappropriate content.The move also aligns with actions taken by competitors.

Nikon has unveiled two new NIKKOR Z lenses designed for APS-C format mirrorless cameras, expanding creative options for photographers using the company's DX-format system. Both lenses will be available in the first week of November 2025.The NIKKOR Z DX MC 35mm f/1.7, priced at INR 38,995, represents Nikon's first DX-format lens to achieve life-size equivalent macro reproduction. This lightweight standard lens features a fast f/1.7 aperture and can focus as close as 16 centimeters from subjects, allowing photographers to capture intricate details with pronounced background blur. The 35mm focal length provides a natural field of view suitable for everything from tabletop photography to portraits.The NIKKOR Z DX 16-50mm f/2.8 VR, priced at INR 78,995, offers a constant f/2.8 aperture throughout its zoom range—a feature typically found in premium lenses. Despite its fast aperture, the lens maintains a compact profile at 88mm length and 330 grams. It incorporates built-in vibration reduction providing 5.0 stops of image stabilization, enabling sharper handheld shots in challenging lighting conditions.Both lenses feature stepping motors for quiet autofocus operation and suppress focus breathing, making them suitable for video recording. They include customisable control rings and dust- and drip-resistant designs for reliable performance in various shooting environments.The macro lens uses aspherical ED glass to minimise chromatic aberration, while the zoom lens employs one ED glass and two aspherical elements to reduce optical distortions. When paired with the Z50II camera, the zoom lens supports Hi-Res Zoom functionality, extending the effective range to 100mm equivalent while maintaining the f/2.8 aperture.These additions strengthen Nikon's Z-mount lens ecosystem for DX-format users seeking professional-grade optics in portable packages.",The NIKKOR Z DX MC 35mm f/1.7 is Nikon's first DX-format lens to achieve life- size equivalent macro reproduction.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris said she regrets that Tesla CEO Elon Musk was not invited to a White House electric vehicle event four years ago. Speaking at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit in Washington, D.C., Harris said the decision was wrong. She told Fortune Editor-in-Chief Alyson Shontell: “So, I thought that was a mistake, and I don’t know Elon Musk, but I have to assume that that was something that hit him hard and had an impact on his perspective”. She continuedThe event in August 2021 featured executives from General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis but excluded Tesla CEO Elon Musk, even though Tesla produces only electric vehicles.“I write in the book that I thought it was a big mistake to not invite Elon Musk when we did a big EV event,” she told Fortune. “I mean, here he is, the major American manufacturer of extraordinary innovation in this space.”During the event, Harris said US presidents should “put aside political loyalties” when recognizing technological achievements that benefit the country.The omission then was widely seen as a move to support organized labor, as Tesla plants are not unionized. Musk expressed his frustration at the time, tweeting, “Yeah, seems odd that Tesla wasn’t invited,” and later called the Biden administration “not the friendliest administration.”Elon Musk eventually became a supporter of Donald Trump and other Republican candidates in the 2024 election, donating nearly $300 million to GOP campaigns.","Former Vice President Kamala Harris said she regrets that Tesla CEO Elon Musk was not invited to a White House electric vehicle event four years ago.

CEO Aadit Palicha addressed employees in a town hall meeting following the company's $450 million fundraise, emphasizing the journey from being the seventh player to becoming the second-largest quick commerce platform in India.The workforce restructuring comes just days after Zepto raised fresh capital from California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers) and existing investors, valuing the company at $7 billion—a 40 percent jump from its $5 billion valuation last year, according to MoneyControl. A total of approximately 1,000 Zepto employees have been impacted since the beginning of 2025, sources told the publication.The Mumbai-based company is implementing broader cost reduction strategies, including cutting back on Amazon Web Services expenses and other software spending. Zepto will also adopt a ""very tight"" approach to future hiring, people familiar with the matter revealed to MoneyControl. By moving employees to third-party service providers, Zepto aims to lower fixed monthly costs while maintaining operational efficiency.The restructuring strategy allows the quick commerce firm to reduce its employee-related expenses on a month-on-month basis without compromising productivity. This approach reflects the company's focus on building operating leverage as competition intensifies in India's $7 billion quick commerce market.With approximately $900 million in net cash reserves following the latest funding round, Zepto is positioning itself to challenge market leader Blinkit, owned by Zomato 's parent company Eternal, and Swiggy's Instamart. The company has raised close to $3 billion in total funding, with nearly $2 billion coming in the past 18 months alone.Zepto scaled order volume by 200 percent over the past 18 months while turning more stores profitable, according to investor Goodwater Capital. The fresh capital is expected to reignite competitive intensity in the quick commerce sector, with Zepto likely to increase marketing and expansion spending to capture greater market share from its larger rivals.",Zepto has removed around 300 employees from its payroll as part of a cost efficiency drive.

The US stock market is in a clear and massive bubble.

The degree of leverage in the system means that we cannot rule out a systemic event like the global financial crisis of 2008-9.

Gold is also flashing a big warning signal. I don't think of gold as an investment, I think of it as insurance against systemic financial risk. Ultimately finance is all about trust and when debt levels reach this high, trust breaks down.

I am sure AI will work hard to repay all the debt in the system”.





Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently said that he does not think of gold as an investment. Instead, he believes it as an “insurance against systemic financial risk”. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Vembu writes: “Gold is also flashing a big warning signal. I don't think of gold as an investment, I think of it as insurance against systemic financial risk. Ultimately finance is all about trust and when debt levels reach this high, trust breaks down.”The Zoho founder was responding to IMF economist Gita Gopinath who recently warned against a global market crash that could cost $35 trillion. “The exposure of the world to US equities is at record levels. A stock market correction would have more severe and global consequences as compared to what followed the dot-com crash. The tariff wars and lack of fiscal space compounds the problem. The underlying problem is not 'unbalanced trade' but 'unbalanced growth.

Tesla responds





Tesla will hold its annual shareholder meeting on November 6. With just weeks left before it, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has urged investors to vote against CEO Elon Musk’s $1 trillion compensation plan, creating a fresh hurdle for Tesla’s board as it seeks support. Notably, this is the second consecutive year ISS has recommended shareholders reject Musk’s pay package. The firm cited concerns over the “magnitude and design” of the plan and said there were no guarantees that the proposal would keep Musk focused on Tesla over his other ventures, which include SpaceX , Neuralink, xAI, and The Boring Company.In a report, the ISS wrote: “Although one of the main reasons for this award is to retain Musk and keep his time and attention on Tesla instead of his other business ventures, there are no explicit requirements to ensure that this will be the case”. It cited “unmitigated concerns” with the plan’s magnitude and design.ISS has also advised against granting Musk any backpay related to the voided 2018 plan and recommended rejecting a proposal for Tesla to invest in Musk’s AI firm, xAI, calling it “highly unusual.”In response to ISS’s stance, Tesla has released promotional material on X urging shareholders to back Musk’s pay plan ahead of the crucial vote.The EV company criticized ISS for “missing fundamental points of investing and governance” and urging investors to vote in line with the company’s recommendation.""ISS once again completely misses fundamental points of investing and governance. They recommended against compensation that shareholders have voted on twice before (and that Elon has already earned), as well as the 2025 CEO Performance Award (where Elon receives nothing unless shareholders win big). ISS’s unfounded and nonsensical recommendation against Ira proves how disconnected from reality they are. As Tesla’s longest-tenured independent director, Ira has created a governance framework that has allowed Tesla to achieve an astonishing TSR increase of ~39,000% during his tenure. He embodies our high-engagement Board – with hands-on leadership + effective governance with a focus on long-term value. It’s easy for ISS to tell others how to vote when they have nothing on the line. Vote with Tesla on ALL proposals,"" Tesla's X post reads.The proposed compensation plan, introduced in September, aims to keep Musk committed to Tesla for the next decade. To receive the full payout and more voting control, Musk must help the company achieve a market value of at least $8.5 trillion and expand its electric vehicle, robotics, and robotaxi operations. If successful, Elon Musk’s stake could rise to around 25%.Musk, who remains Tesla’s largest shareholder, has warned he might pursue some projects outside Tesla if his equity stake is not increased. He sold part of his holdings to fund his acquisition of Twitter, now rebranded as X and owned by his AI firm, xAI.",Tesla will hold its annual shareholder meeting on November 6. proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has urged investors to vote against CEO Elon Musk's $1 trillion compensation plan.

Once enabled, the tool scans your camera roll for standout images and videos—those “hidden gems” often buried among screenshots and receipts—and offers enhancements, stylized edits, and collage suggestions. These recommendations appear privately to the user, who can choose whether to save, share, or ignore them.“We’ve rolled out a new Facebook feature designed to make reminiscing and sharing your favorite moments easier and more fun than ever before. This opt-in feature suggests the best photos and videos from your camera roll and creates fun collages and edits, making it simple to share unique content on Facebook and Messenger,” said Meta in a blog post.“Many people capture life’s moments but rarely share them,” Facebook said in its announcement.“This feature does the heavy lifting, so you can focus on sharing the fun.”The AI can generate ready-to-share content for Facebook Stories, Feed, and Memories, all while keeping user control front and center.

Beware of scam calls and social engineering: If someone calls claiming to be from Flipkart and asks you to install an app or share sensitive information (OTP, PIN, CVV), hang up. Flipkart never asks for such details.

Don’t fall for too-good-to-be-true offers: Fraudsters lure users with unrealistic discounts, like smartphones for Rs 2,499. Always verify deals on the official app before clicking on links in messages, emails, or social media.

Watch out for malicious links — across SMS, email & pop-ups: Links sent via messages or emails that promise prizes or urgent account updates may install spyware or redirect to phishing pages. Avoid clicking on unknown links and delete suspicious messages immediately.

Trust only verified platforms: Stick to official channels, the mobile app, and verified social handles. Fake websites and apps often mimic branding; always double-check URLs and developer names.

Check for signs of a fake app or website: Look out for odd spellings, smudged logos.” On websites, broken carts, inactive menus, and missing security certificates (no lock icon in the address bar) are red flags.

Strengthen and protect your account: Use a strong, unique password with numbers, symbols, and uppercase letters. Change it regularly and never share it with anyone. If needed, reset using OTP via the official app.

Keep an eye on your device’s health: Unfamiliar apps, sudden performance drops, or unauthorized activities are signs of compromise. Delete suspicious apps, clear browser cache and downloads, and run an antivirus scan. Reboot in safe mode or do a factory reset if needed.

Report suspicious activity immediately: Whether it’s a fake SMS, call, or app, report it to the Flipkart Help Center. Your alert could help protect thousands of others.

China to tech companies: You cannot buy AI chips from Nvidia





Nvidia, the American semiconductor giant, has seen its dominance in China’s advanced chip market vanish, with its market share dropping from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls, according to CEO Jensen Huang. Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in New York earlier this month, Huang revealed that Nvidia is completely barred from selling its high-performance AI chips, including the A100, H100, and H200 models, to Chinese companies since restrictions began in 2022.A video of the interview was released recently. Huang expressed hope for a policy shift, stating, “We will continue to explain and inform and hold on to hope for a change in policy.” He emphasized that Nvidia’s exclusion from China not only harms the company but also has broader implications for both China and the U.S. “What harms China could oftentimes also harm America, and even worse,” Huang said. He further highlighted China’s significant role in global AI development, with roughly 50% of the world’s AI researchers.Nvidia CEO's remarks come as China carries on with a nationwide push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.Chinese AI and semiconductor contenders have rushed to launch domestic alternatives, eroding Nvidia’s once-dominant market share. Huawei’s advancements, including clustering methods to bypass Nvidia’s technology and cutting-edge manufacturing techniques, signal China’s aggressive push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.Despite receiving US approval to sell a less powerful H20 chip tailored for the Chinese market, Nvidia faces further challenges. Chinese authorities launched a security investigation into the H20, and local clients were advised to avoid the product, further limiting Nvidia’s foothold. Huang warned that excluding Nvidia from China risks ceding the market to domestic competitors like Huawei Technologies, which recently unveiled an ambitious AI chip roadmap.“It’s a mistake not to have those researchers build AI on American technology,” Huang said, raising concerns about balancing U.S. technological leadership with global collaboration. As China accelerates its domestic chip development, Nvidia’s absence from the market could reshape the global AI and semiconductor landscape.Nvidia recently got shut out of the Chinese market after China’s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, reportedly banned domestic tech companies from buying Nvidia AI chips. According to a report by Financial Times, the Chinese agency also told tech companies, including TikTok-parent ByteDance and Alibaba, to stop testing and ordering Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D server, a device designed specifically for the market in China.",N Nvidia's dominance in China's advanced chip market has dropped from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls.

ChatGPT sees fall in app downloads and time spent on the mobile app





ChatGPT’s mobile app may be losing steam, with new data from app intelligence firm Apptopia showing a slowdown in global download growth. According to the analysis, the app’s new user growth, measured by month-over-month percentage changes in global downloads, has been decelerating since April and is projected to decline by 8.1% in October.While ChatGPT continues to attract millions of daily downloads worldwide, the stalling growth rate signals a potential peak in its expansion. Apptopia’s data also reveals a leveling off in global daily active users (DAUs) over the past month, suggesting the app’s user base is stabilizing.Apptopia in its report attributes the slowdown to rising competition and changes to ChatGPT’s AI model, which may be impacting its appeal. Apptopia notes that ChatGPT’s average time spent per DAU and average sessions per DAU metrics were trending downward before the sharp rise of its competitor, Google’s Gemini, which shot up to the top charts in September thanks to the release of Google’s new AI image model, Nano Banana. However, the company noted that while Gemini’s growth may have impacted some of the more recent drops in ChatGPT’s core metrics, it doesn’t explain the overall trend completely.In the U.S., user engagement is declining. The average time spent per DAU has dropped 22.5% since July, and the number of sessions per DAU has fallen by 20.7%. This indicates that American users are spending less time in the app and opening it less frequently.However, user churn has stabilized, with fewer users experimenting briefly and then abandoning the app, pointing to stronger retention of its core audience.As the AI landscape evolves, ChatGPT’s mobile app faces new challenges in maintaining its growth trajectory.","ChatGPT’s mobile app may be losing steam, with new data from app intelligence firm Apptopia showing a slowdown in global download growth.

Meta to use photos in your phone train its AI models, when ...





Meta has launched a new AI-powered feature for Facebook , allowing its AI to suggest creative edits for unposted photos in users’ camera rolls. The feature, now available to all users in the US and Canada, was announced on Friday and offers opt-in sharing suggestions for posting AI-edited photos to Facebook Feeds and Stories. ""We’re introducing a new Facebook feature that surfaces photos and videos and suggests fun edits and collages, making it easier to share your favorite moments,"" said the company in a post.Initially tested in June, the feature prompts users with a permission dialog to allow cloud processing of camera roll images. This enables Meta AI to generate creative ideas like collages, recaps, AI restyling, and birthday-themed edits. Users can disable the feature at any time.Meta emphasizes that unposted photos are not used to train its AI or for ad targeting unless users actively edit or share the media. However, agreeing to Meta’s AI Terms of Service permits the AI to analyze media and facial features to summarize content, modify images, or generate new content. ""All suggestions are private to you and you decide what to share, when to share, and with whom.We don’t use media from your camera roll to improve AI at Meta, unless you choose to edit this media with our AI tools, or share,"" said Meta in its post.The company also uses photo metadata, such as dates and the presence of people or objects, to tailor suggestions, raising concerns about the depth of personal data accessed.This rollout follows earlier reports in June about a test phase, where Meta clarified it wasn’t using private photos for AI training but left open the possibility for future use under specific conditions. Now, with the feature live, users must weigh the creative benefits against potential privacy implications.","The feature, now available to all users in the US and Canada, offers opt-in sharing suggestions for posting AI-edited photos to Facebook Feeds and Stories.

"Spotify to partner with Sony, Universal and Warner for AI music products",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/spotify-to-partner-with-sony-universal-and-warner-for-ai-music-products/articleshow/124634444.cms,"Four rules on which deals will depend upon



Partnerships with record labels, distributors, and music publishers:

Choice in participation:

Fair compensation and new revenue:

Artist-fan connection:





Spotify has announced plans to collaborate with major music rightsholders to develop responsible AI products as it looks to help artists and songwriters while connecting them with fans. Spotify has entered into an agreement with Sony Music Group, Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, Merlin, and Believe to develop products forged through upfront agreements. The company hopes to bring on additional rightsholders and distributors over time.Spotify acknowledged that many emerging AI music products are perceived by artists as short-term experiments built to compete with them, rather than long-term solutions designed to serve them. Spotify’s existing focus has been on using generative AI for features that connect fans and artists, such as its AI DJ, personalised daylist, and AI Playlist.The company rejects the view held by some in the tech industry that copyright should be abolished, stating plainly: Musicians’ rights matter, and copyright is essential. It argues that if the music industry fails to lead in this moment, AI-powered innovation will occur elsewhere “without rights, consent, or compensation.”The collaboration with rightsholders, artists, and songwriters involves significant investments in AI research and product development.All products developed through this collaboration will put artists and songwriters first, guided by four key principles:New products will be developed through upfront agreements.Artists and rightsholders will choose if and how to participate, ensuring the use of AI tools aligns with their values.Products will be built to create entirely new revenue streams, ensuring proper compensation and transparent crediting for the use of their work.AI tools will not replace human artistry but will offer artists new avenues for creativity and connecting with fans, the company says.","Spotify has announced plans to collaborate with major music rightsholders to develop responsible AI products.

How these hackers targeted Microsoft Teams users



Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained





Microsoft has successfully stopped a wave of cyberattacks targeting people using its video conferencing tool Teams. The software giant was able to restrict these attacks by removing more than 200 digital keys that the hackers used to make their malicious software appear trustworthy. The company revealed that the hacking group, also known as Vanilla Tempest, was trying to deploy a type of harmful software called Rhysida ransomware . This software locks up a victim's files, and the hackers then demand money to unlock them, a practice known as extortion . The group carried out these attacks using fake advertisements on search engines and tricky website links. They created websites with addresses that looked a lot like the official Microsoft Teams site.Microsoft wrote in a blog post.When a Teams user visited one of these fake sites, they were prompted to download a file named ""MSTeamsSetup.exe,"" the same name as the real Teams program.Once someone ran this file, it secretly put a hidden tool, called the Oyster backdoor, onto the computer.This hidden Oyster tool gave the hackers secret remote control over the infected systems. This allowed them to steal private files, run commands, and load the final Rhysida ransomware to lock up the data.Microsoft said that Vanilla Tempest is a group mainly focused on making money. They specifically aim to get into company computer networks to lock files with ransomware and steal data for extortion. While they've used other locking software before, they have been focusing mostly on Rhysida recently.","Microsoft has stopped a wave of cyberattacks targeting people using its video conferencing tool Teams.

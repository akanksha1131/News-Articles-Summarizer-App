Facebook-parent Meta has acquired PlayAI, a voice technology startup in a move which further underscores its aggressive push for into artificial intelligence. This latest acquisition made by Meta follows its early purchase of AI startup — ScaleAI. Meta acquired ScaleAI for $14.3 billion. With the ScaleAI acquisition Meta aims to build advanced AI systems with human-like capabilities.As per an internal memo seen by Bloomberg, after this acquisition, the ‘entire PlayAI team’ will join Meta’s operations. The memo also reveals that the PlayAI team will directly report to Johan Schalkwyk, who joined Meta recently from another voice AI startup called Sesame AI Inc.PlayAI specialises in multilingual voice cloning, real-time speech synthesis and programable voice agents. It is expected that Meta may use PlayAI’s technology to improve voice features across Meta platforms including the Quest VR headsets and the Ray-Ban smart glasses. Developers may also gain access to PlayAI’s APIs, enabling custom voice agents and characters.Meta has made AI its top priority this year as the company is heavily investing in building proper infrastructure and Mark Zuckerberg is also aggressively recruiting top talent from other AI firms. Meta CEO recently announced the Meta Superintelligence Labs which will be led by ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang. This AI venture of Meta aims to achieve superintelligent AI before any competitor.Meta has not yet disclosed the financial details of the deal.Zuckerberg has declared AI the company's paramount priority for the year, as Meta vies with rivals like Google and OpenAI to develop AI features.The report about the potential acquisition comes soon after Meta acquired data-labeling startup Scale AI, also recruiting Scale AI's CEO to join a newly formed “superintelligence” team spearheaded by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.Bloomberg also says that Zuckerberg has been poaching AI researchers from leading firms, including Google and OpenAI, to staff this new team. Recently, Meta reportedly hired three OpenAI researchers from the ChatGPT maker's Zurich office, a departure confirmed by OpenAI.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman even claimed that Meta is offering $100 million signing bonus for researchers.It was previously reported that Meta held acquisition talks with Perplexity AI before finalising its Scale AI investment. Meta also reportedly discussed a potential takeover of AI video startup Runway AI, though those discussions did not lead to a formal offer, the report added.","PlayAI specialises in multilingual voice cloning, real-time speech synthesis and programable voice agents.

"Stanford University forced my wife out without ..., said Silicon Valley's most-prominent venture capitalist Marc Andreessen in a group chat with US government officials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/stanford-university-forced-my-wife-out-without-said-silicon-valleys-most-prominent-venture-capitalist-marc-andreessen-in-a-group-chat-with-us-government-officials/articleshow/122422824.cms,"Stanford and MIT have ""declared war on 70% of the country""

Prominent venture capitalists are making headlines for their sharp criticisms of established institutions and, in one case, for incendiary comments regarding a political candidate, underscoring a growing ideological divide within the tech industry.Prominent venture capitalist Marc Andreessen , co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), has reportedly launched a scathing attack on leading universities, including Stanford and MIT, and the National Science Foundation. According to screenshots viewed by the Washington Post, Andreessen, in a private group chat with AI scientists and officials of the Donald Trump administration, characterized MIT and Stanford as ""mainly political operations fighting American innovation."" He reportedly further said that Stanford ""forced my wife out [as chair of its Center on Philanthropy and Civil society] without a second thought, a decision that will cost them something like $5 billion in future donations.""In a separate message, Andreessen reportedly declared that universities ""declared war on 70% of the country and now they’re going to pay the price,"" specifically targeting ""DEI and immigration"" as ""two forms of discrimination"" that are ""politically lethal."" These remarks align with Andreessen's previously stated support for Donald Trump's presidential campaign, alongside a16z co-founder Ben Horowitz. Allies of Andreessen have since taken roles within the Trump administration. TechCrunch has reached out to a16z for comment.Meanwhile, venture giant Sequoia Capital is grappling with the fallout from controversial comments made by partner Shaun Maguire concerning Zohran Mamdani , the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor. In a July 4th tweet on Twitter, which has garnered over 5 million views, Maguire labeled Mamdani an ""Islamist"" who ""comes from a culture that lies about everything.""In his tweets, Maguire stated: ""Mamdani comes from a culture that lies about everything. It’s literally a virtue to lie if it advances his Islamist agenda. The West will learn this lesson the hard way."" He further elaborated, ""People have lost the plot Islamist != to Muslim Hezbollah, Hamas, Al-Qaeda, ISIS, The Taliban, The Ayatollahs in Iran, etc are Islamists Mamdani — a man who started an SJP chapter and defended Anwar al-Alawki — is an Islamist He’s doing his best to hide this but it’s clear.""Sequoia Capital has maintained a ""hands-off approach"" to the controversy, a strategy now being tested as the company finds itself in the eye of a public storm. The incidents once again shows increasing political polarization within the tech sector and raise questions about the role and responsibilities of influential figures in shaping public discourse.","Prominent venture capitalist Marc Andreessen has reportedly launched a scathing attack on leading universities, including Stanford and MIT.

Google may slash Cloud costs in new government deal: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-may-slash-cloud-costs-in-new-government-deal-report/articleshow/122417965.cms,"Cost-cutting drive led by Trump’s procurement reform

Oppo Reno 14 Pro Review: Flagship Features Without the Flagship Price?

Google is close to finalising a cloud services deal with the US government that includes major price cuts, reports Financial Times. The report quotes a senior official from the General Services Administration (GSA) who said that the tech giant is likely to offer “substantial discounts,” with the deal expected to be completed in the coming weeks. This development comes shortly after Oracle agreed to reduce prices by up to 75% on some software contracts, and to offer broad discounts on its cloud computing services.Google’s deal is expected to land “in a similar spot,” said the GSA official involved in the negotiations. The agency, as per the report, is also in talks with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, adding that the discussions are at an earlier stage. “Every single one of those companies is totally bought in, they understand the mission,” said the official, suggesting cooperation across the board.Together, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Oracle account for the bulk of the US government’s cloud services spend, which currently exceeds $20 billion annually.The push for lower prices comes under a renewed Trump administration effort to reduce government procurement costs. It’s part of a broader strategy led by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), formerly overseen by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Alongside cloud services, the GSA has renegotiated deals with consulting firms like Deloitte and Booz Allen Hamilton, and is also targeting contracts with ride-hailing companies.Earlier in April, Google had already agreed to a 71% temporary discount on some Workspace contracts until the end of September.The negotiations also reflect a shift in the relationship between Big Tech and the Trump administration. During his first term, Amazon lost a $10 billion defense contract — the Jedi project — which the company claimed was due to a personal vendetta linked to Trump’s opposition to the Washington Post, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The contract was later cancelled and replaced by a $9 billion project awarded jointly to AWS, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle under the Biden administration.This time around, tech CEOs have taken a more conciliatory approach. Google’s Sundar Pichai and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg appeared at Trump’s inauguration, while diversity programmes within these companies have since been scaled back. Even Bezos has worked to repair ties with the president, whom he once called “a threat to democracy.”","Google is close to finalising a cloud services deal with the US government that includes major price cuts.

Grok is being utilised to support some SpaceX features



Elon Musk's SpaceX has agreed to inject $2 billion into his artificial intelligence venture, xAI, that makes up nearly half of the Grok chatbot maker's recent equity fundraising round, a report by The Wall Street Journal has said. This comes after Musk merged xAI with X (formerly Twitter), combining the AI research lab with the social media platform to amplify the reach of its Grok chatbot. That merger valued the newly combined entity at $113 billion. The move suggests Musk's strategy of leveraging his various companies to propel xAI forward in the competitive AI landscape at a time when tech companies like Meta and OpenAI are strengthening their AI teams.The $2 billion investment from SpaceX is part of xAI's broader $5 billion equity fundraise, which Morgan Stanley announced last month. This marks SpaceX's first known and one of its largest investments in an external company, signaling a deeper integration of Musk's corporate empire .Since his departure from the Trump administration, Musk has focused on training the latest version of Grok which Musk declared as “the smartest AI in the world,” though Grok's user adoption hasn't yet rivaled OpenAI's ChatGPT.Notably, Grok recently generated racist and controversial comments on X, prompting xAI to issue an apology and confirm an investigation into the “horrific behaviour.”Grok is already being utilised to power customer-support features for SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. Investors who have spoken with Musk's representatives indicate that further business partnerships between SpaceX and xAI are anticipated.Musk also stated this week, during the release of Grok 4, that he intends to embed Grok into humanoid robots, including Tesla's Optimus fleet.Musk has a history of using SpaceX to support his other ventures. He previously borrowed $20 million from SpaceX to help fund Tesla in its early days and utilised SpaceX equipment for The Boring Company. More recently, he secured a $1 billion loan from SpaceX during his acquisition of Twitter, which he subsequently repaid.","Elon Musk's SpaceX has agreed to inject $2 billion into his artificial intelligence venture, xAI.

Steve Jobs said he doesn’t blame entrepreneurs who give up on patience: There are such ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/steve-jobs-said-he-doesnt-blame-entrepreneurs-who-give-up-on-patience-there-are-such-/articleshow/122416265.cms,"Apple co-founder Steve Jobs on entrepreneurs who give up on patience



Apple co-founder Steve Jobs once famously said, “I don’t blame them. It’s really tough,” referring to entrepreneurs who abandon their ventures during tough times. Contrary to the popular belief of perseverance and determination, Jobs believed that giving up on patience is not always a sign of weakness, but sometimes a pragmatic decision.Jobs believed that perseverance separates the doers from dreamers, estimating that “about half of what separates successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance.” He also mentioned that in the initial days of entrepreneurship one has to work for 18-hour-1 -day and seven-days-a-week. So, he warned that without deep passion the chances of surviving or creating a successful venture is unlikely.Jobs point of view also aligns with modern psychological insights which also believe that while perseverance is important, the ability to identify when a path is no longer viable or adaptability are equally important for long-term success. It’s not about how long you stick with something, it is about the quality of effort and the ability to take informed decisions about when to stop or change the course.This less-publicized point of view of Steve Jobs on patience offer an inspiring and valuable lesson for budding entrepreneurs: while passion and hard work are essential, so too is the discernment to know when to recalibrate, or even gracefully exit, a project that is not yielding results, rather than blindly clinging to a failing endeavor.","Apple co-founder Steve Jobs once famously said, “I don’t blame them.

Entry-level positions face uncertain future

Goldman Sachs has made a hiring decision that could send shockwaves through the engineering job market : the investment banking giant is deploying Devin , an AI software engineer that never sleeps, never takes breaks, and never asks for a raise. The bank announced it will initially deploy hundreds of these autonomous coders, with plans to scale to thousands.The AI employee, developed by London-based startup Cognition, represents a seismic shift in how major financial institutions approach software development. Goldman's Chief Information Officer Marco Argenti told CNBC that Devin will function ""like our new employee who's going to start doing stuff on the behalf of our developers.""With Goldman employing 12,000 human developers, the introduction of thousands of AI coders signals a fundamental transformation in the industry's labor dynamics. Marco Argenti projects that Devin could boost productivity by three to four times compared to previous AI tools, focusing on routine tasks like updating legacy code that human engineers often consider drudgery.""Those models are basically just as good as any developer, it's really cool,"" Marco Argenti told CNBC, describing the AI's capabilities as matching human performance levels.The implications for aspiring engineers are particularly concerning. Bloomberg Intelligence warned in January that banks could eliminate up to 200,000 jobs globally over the next three to five years due to AI adoption. Traditional analyst positions—the typical entry point for finance careers—may shrink dramatically as routine coding and research tasks become increasingly automated.However, Marco Argenti envisions a ""hybrid workforce"" where humans and AI work collaboratively. ""It's really about people and AIs working side by side,"" he explained to CNBC. ""Engineers are going to be expected to have the ability to really describe problems in a coherent way and turn it into prompts.""While roles requiring sector expertise, client relationships, and high-stakes judgment are expected to remain resilient, the era of AI coders has officially begun on the Wall Street.","Goldman Sachs is deploying an AI software engineer that never sleeps, never takes breaks, and never asks for a raise.

Officials in Warsaw say the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders, so they’re asking the European Commission to investigate and, if the rules allow, hit xAI or X with fines.Krzysztof Gawkowski, Poland’s digitisation minister, told RMF FM radio that the bot’s remarks amounted to hate speech. He argued that ignoring algorithm-driven abuse “may cost humanity in the future,” so his ministry will file an official complaint under existing EU regulations.The step is unusual but legal: member states can trigger EU probes when digital services target their citizens with unlawful content. If Brussels agrees, xAI could face penalties under the Digital Services Act or the forthcoming AI Act.Grok’s missteps are piling up. The same day Poland aired its grievance, the Anti-Defamation League flagged responses in which the bot praised Adolf Hitler and recycled antisemitic stereotypes. xAI deleted the posts, calling them “inappropriate,” yet offered no public apology.Users had also shared screenshots showing Grok calling Tusk “a coward in Brussels slippers,” among other jabs. Warsaw says the language breaches Poland’s hate-speech law and the EU’s code of practice on disinformation.The EU’s Digital Services Act took full effect for very large platforms in February 2025. It forces companies such as X to assess systemic risks, audit their algorithms, and let regulators peek behind the curtain. An AI-specific law is coming later this year, likely adding fresh transparency mandates. Poland’s complaint tees up an early test of those combined powers.Legal scholars note that fines can reach 6 percent of global turnover for DSA violations. For Musk’s empire, that runs into billions.Poland is not alone. A Turkish court ordered X to block Grok content that mocked President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and Islamic beliefs.In June, users spotted the bot rambling about a supposed “white genocide” in South Africa. xAI blamed an “unauthorised change” to its response code.Each flare-up feeds an image of a system that swings from playful banter to extremist rhetoric with a single prompt.As of Wednesday afternoon, xAI had not replied to Reuters’ emailed questions, and Musk’s normally hyperactive X feed stayed quiet on the topic.The billionaire recently urged “maximum free speech” on X, but he also says AI must be “truth-seeking.” That balance gets messy when the bot channels conspiracy theories or ethnic slurs.","Poland says the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders.

Microsoft tensions behind OpenAI-Windsurf deal collapse

What is Windsurf into

OpenAI’s $3 billion agreement to buy the AI coding startup WindSurf has fallen apart. The highly-anticipated acquisition deal between artificial intelligence powerhouse OpenAI and AI coding startup Windsurf. OpenAI had reportedly been close to finalizing the deal to acquire Windsurf, formally known as Exafunction Inc. , with a signed letter of intent and investor payout agreements (waterfall agreements) already in place. The acquisition was even nearing an announcement in early May, according to sources familiar with the discussions. However, an OpenAI spokesperson has confirmed that the exclusivity period for their offer has lapsed, leaving Windsurf free to explore other opportunities.In a swift turn of events, Alphabet Inc's Google has stepped in, striking a deal worth approximately $2.4 billion to acquire top talent and licensing rights from Windsurf. This move comes hot on the heels of the collapsed OpenAI acquisition .Google announced on Friday, July 11, that it is bringing Windsurf Chief Executive Officer Varun Mohan and co-founder Douglas Chen, along with a small team of staffers, into its DeepMind artificial intelligence unit. While the company declined to disclose the specific financial terms, it clarified that the agreement does not involve taking an equity stake in Windsurf itself. This development marks a significant strategic gain for Google in the competitive AI landscape, securing valuable expertise and technology that had been hotly contested by its rivals.A significant factor in the unraveling of the OpenAI-Windsurf deal appears to be friction with kMicrosoft Corp., a major investor and key partner for OpenAI. According to a Bloomberg report, sources close to the matter indicate that Windsurf was hesitant to grant Microsoft access to its intellectual property. This condition became a sticking point that OpenAI was reportedly unable to resolve with Microsoft, whose existing agreement with OpenAI grants the software giant access to the AI startup's technology. This issue was reportedly one of several points of contention in ongoing discussions between Microsoft and OpenAI regarding OpenAI's restructuring into a commercial entity.Founded in 2021, Windsurf is a prominent player in the burgeoning field of AI-driven coding assistants. These systems are designed to automate and streamline coding tasks, including generating code from natural language prompts. The startup has successfully raised over $200 million in venture capital funding from investors like Greenoaks Capital Partners and AIX Ventures, according to PitchBook data.","OpenAI had reportedly been close to finalizing the deal to acquire Windsurf, formally known as Exafunction Inc.

What is the mysterious ‘trading plan'



Nvidia sets new record, beats Microsoft and Apple



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold 225,000 shares of company stock worth around $36.4 million. According to the recent filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the transactions were executed between July 8 and July 10. The recent sale of stocks is part of a prearranged 10b5-1 trading plan which Huang adopted in March this year. The trading plan allows the Nvidia CEO to sell up to 6 million shares by the end of 2025. This latest transaction made by Huang follows the previous batch of stock which he sold in June this year. Last month Huang offloaded 1,00,000 shares in the span of two days.For those unaware, the 10b5-1 trading plan enable corporate insiders such as company executives to sell or but company stock at pre-decided value. This plan also offers defense against insider trading charges by showcasing that the traders were planned in advance and is not based on any new information. This pre-arranged structure ensures transparency and compliance with regulatory standards.The plan mentioned in Nvidia’s quarterly report was adopted in March 2025. The plan is designed to allow structured selling without triggering any market volatility. Despite the recent stock sale, Hang still remains the largest individual shareholder of Nvidia. Huang still has more than 900 million shares.The timing of the stock sale made by Huang coincides with Nvidia’s stock trading near its 52-week high and also the company surpassed the $4 trillion market capitalisation. This marks Huang’s second batch of sales under the plan, following a $15 million transaction in June. Last year, he sold $700 million worth of shares under a similar arrangement.Nvidia's has become the first public company to touch the ‘magic’ $4 trillion market value. The company’s stock market valuation officially closed above $4 trillion for the first time on Thursday (July 10) after shares of the AI chipmaker ended the trading session up 0.75% at $164.10, pushing its market capitalisation to $4.004 trillion. This milestone extends Nvidia's significant lead over tech giants Apple and Microsoft, as it continues to benefit from an increasing demand for its AI technologies.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the company's market value briefly touched the $4 trillion mark on Wednesday (July 9) before closing just shy at approximately $3.97 trillion. To put its scale in perspective, Nvidia is now worth more than the combined value of all publicly listed companies in the United Kingdom, the report added.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold 225,000 shares of company stock worth around $36.4 million.

Former Google executive who raised $92 million for a startup backed by Sundar Pichai shares one simple strategy every entrepreneur should know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-google-executive-who-raised-92-million-for-a-startup-backed-by-sundar-pichai-shares-one-simple-strategy-every-entrepreneur-should-know/articleshow/122399528.cms,"Former Google executive Caesar Sengupta finds startup life more chaotic than expected



How this one simple habit became Sengupta’s superpower



Why founders need mental clarity now more than ever



Inner stillness as the new startup strategy



Also Read |

In today’s high-octane startup world, where billion-dollar valuations can vanish overnight and hustle culture dominates, surviving the chaos requires more than grit, strategy, or even funding. According to Caesar Sengupta , co-founder and CEO of the digital wealth platform Arta Finance, and former Google Pay executive, entrepreneurs need something surprisingly simple yet profoundly powerful: stillness. Sengupta believes that daily meditation—not constant motion—is his ultimate superpower. And as neuroscience begins to validate this approach with compelling research, the message is clear: in the noisy, demanding world of startups, mental clarity, mindfulness, and emotional resilience might be the most underutilized, discover-worthy competitive edge for today’s ambitious entrepreneurs seeking sustainable success and peak performance.Before launching Arta Finance in 2021,a fintech company now backed by over $92 million in funding, including support from Sequoia Capital India and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Sengupta spent 15 years at Google. He helped build ChromeOS and co-founded Google Pay, which now serves more than 150 million users across 30+ countries.Despite his impressive resume, Sengupta admits the transition from corporate stability to startup chaos was mentally jarring. “There are days where you feel 100%, and there are days where you’re like, ‘Oh my God, what did I just do?’” he confessed. Startups, he explained, can consume founders entirely—damaging health, relationships, and emotional well-being.His solution wasn’t found in a productivity hack or another to-do list app. It was far simpler: five to ten minutes of meditation a day. “I wish three years back, somebody had sat me down and said: ‘Dude… just meditate,’” as reported by CNBC. That small window of silence became his daily anchor, offering mental space amidst a storm of decisions, investor meetings, and constant uncertainty.While Sengupta calls mindfulness his ""superpower,"" neuroscience is catching up to the claim. A recent study by the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, reported by Neuroscience News, found that just 30 days of guided mindfulness meditation significantly enhanced focus and reduced distractibility across all age groups.Using eye-tracking technology, researchers observed improved reaction times and sustained attention—especially linked to changes in the locus coeruleus–noradrenaline system, a brain center critical to focus, memory, and cognitive resilience. As postdoctoral researcher Andy Jeesu Kim put it, “Mindfulness isn’t just about feeling more relaxed — it can literally change the way your brain handles attention.”Founders today are under immense pressure navigating product launches, investor meetings, sleepless nights, and the ever-looming threat of failure. In such an environment, the ability to filter signals from noise isn’t just helpful, it's essential for survival.Sengupta also turns to cycling as a form of meditative movement. “It’s one of the only times where no one can reach me,” he says. This physical form of stillness helps him mentally recharge and stay grounded amid the chaos of building a high-stakes startup.As mindfulness gains ground in scientific and executive circles alike, Sengupta’s approach is emerging as more than just a personal quirk—it’s a strategic advantage. While others burn out chasing every opportunity, he’s choosing calm over chaos. And it’s working.“Ultimately,” he says, “it’s about how you confront the ups and downs of life.” For today’s entrepreneurs, Sengupta’s journey offers a profound lesson: in a world obsessed with speed, stillness may be your sharpest edge.","Caesar Sengupta is co-founder and CEO of the digital wealth platform Arta Finance.

IBM recently launched its new Power11 line of data center chips and servers, marking a significant leap in power efficiency and the simplification of artificial intelligence (AI) deployment within business operations. This update, the first major refresh to its ""Power"" chip line since 2020, positions IBM to compete more aggressively in the specialized data center market. Traditionally, IBM's Power chips have been a strong contender against offerings from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), particularly in demanding sectors such as financial services, manufacturing, and healthcare.Similar to Nvidia's AI servers, IBM's Power systems are an integrated solution, combining both powerful chips and sophisticated software. This tight integration, Tom McPherson, General Manager of Power Systems at IBM, told Reuters, has allowed the company to prioritise unparalleled reliability and robust security.McPherson clarified that IBM's strategy isn't to directly compete with Nvidia in the realm of creating and training AI systems. Instead, Big Blue is sharply focused on streamlining AI deployment for inference – the crucial process of putting an AI system to work to accelerate business tasks. ""We can integrate AI capabilities seamlessly into this for inference acceleration and help their business process improvements,"" McPherson reportedly said in an interview, referring to work with early customers. He, as per the Reuters report, added, ""It's not going to have all the horsepower for training or anything, but it's going to have really good inferencing capabilities that are simple to integrate.""A key highlight of the new Power11 systems, which will be available starting July 25, is their exceptional uptime. IBM claims these systems will require no planned downtime for software updates, and their average unplanned downtime each year will be a mere 30 seconds. Furthermore, the Power11 systems are engineered to detect and respond to a ransomware attack within a minute, offering a critical defense against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.Looking ahead, IBM plans to integrate the Power11 with Spyre, its AI chip introduced last year, in the fourth quarter of 2025. ""We can integrate AI capabilities seamlessly into this for inference acceleration and help their business process improvements,"" McPherson stated in a recent interview, referencing collaborations with early customers. He emphasized the system's ability to deliver ""really good inferencing capabilities that are simple to integrate,"" even if it doesn't boast the same horsepower as training-focused systems.

What RealSense’s CEO said about Intel’s new subsidiary



Lava Storm Play First Look: Best Budget Phone Under Rs 10,000?

Intel is spinning out its artificial intelligence (AI) robotics and biometric venture into a new company named RealSense. This announcement came after the US-based chipmaker cut 500 jobs, which affected 15% to 20% of its factory workers. As more companies invest in automation tools, RealSense also secured a $50 million Series A funding round. This funding includes contributions from MediaTek Innovation Fund and Intel Capital, the chipmaker’s venture arm, which is also being spun out from Intel. RealSense, which develops tools and technology for robotics automation , stated its intention to use the new funding to develop additional product lines and address increasing global demand.Nadav Orbach , currently Intel’s vice president and general manager for incubation and disruptive innovation, will assume the role of CEO at RealSense.In an interview with CNBC, Orbach highlighted the technology’s broader adoption and more practical applications, saying, “the timing is now for physical AI.”“We want to develop new product lines. We see the demand and we see the need, and with where it’s at right now, the right thing for us was to raise external funds,” Orbach added.RealSense now operates independently with about 130 employees, focusing on developing safe and user-friendly tools. Intel retains a minority stake, the report added.Global companies are increasing investments in robotics as AI adoption grows. Morgan Stanley estimates the humanoid robot market could reach $5 trillion by 2050, with tech giants like Tesla and Amazon leading the charge.Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, views robotics as its next major opportunity after AI, while Salesforce claims AI handles up to half its workload.Meanwhile, Intel, facing setbacks in the AI race, has taken cost-cutting measures, including CEO and job cuts. It recently sold most of its stake in Altera and spun off RealSense, its 3D vision unit, which supports autonomous robotics firms like Eyesynth.","Intel is spinning out its artificial intelligence (AI) robotics and biometric venture into a new company named RealSense.

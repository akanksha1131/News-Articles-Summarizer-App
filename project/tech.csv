Zerodha cofounder Nithin Kamath backed-tech company Stoa School announced earlier this week that said it is shutting down. The startup did not disclose reasons for pulling the plug. Stoa School's shutdown comes some four years and roughly 1,500 students later. Stoa School was widely seen as the poster child for alternative business-school education in India. Stoa School was born in the chaos of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, a time that rewrote the rules of education and work.Just days after edtech startup Stoa School announced its shutdown, investor Kamath shared his take on what makes or breaks a startup on X, formerly Twitter.He started the post with the question: ""What is critical for the success of a startup - founders' skills or the macros?""In reply he said, it's a mix of both and then went on to add what helped Zerodha on its growth journey. He further added how the government's various programmes, initiatives and policies over the years have helped startups in India, including Zerodha.""I think it's a bit of both. You could be a great founder with excellent execution skills but still struggle in an unfavorable macro environment. Or, you could be an average founder benefiting from the economic momentum of your country and sector. Every time I think about this, I realize how fortunate we have been in terms of macros, both as a country and through government initiatives. We've benefited from everything that the Government has done—starting with Aadhaar, increasing mobile penetration, Startup India initiatives, and the overall supportive startup ecosystem,"" wrote Nithin KamathThe Bengaluru-based company Stoa School was founded in October 2020 by Kulkarni and Raj Kunkolienkar. The edtech platform offered a six-month MBA programme, competing with the likes of Masters’ Union and Mesa School of Business.Other than Nithin Kamath, the edtech company had raised a total of $1.77 million in funding from angel investors, including Cred founder Kunal Shah and Ziwame founder Richa Kar, according to data intelligence platform Tracxn.The company is the latest to join the growing list of startups that have shut operations. Over a dozen Indian edtech startups have been acquired in the past year, underscoring the funding a challenge smaller firms are facing.",Stoa School announced earlier this week that said it is shutting down.

The billionaire banker made the comments just a after the listing of grocery and food delivery major Swiggy.

He stressed the importance of focusing on product innovation and creativity to compete globally.Kotak also warned against excessive protectionism for domestic businesses, arguing that it hinders long-term competitiveness. He advocated for a more open trade environment, allowing Indian businesses to thrive in a global marketplace.In light of potential global economic shifts, Kotak urged India to be prepared for potential capital outflows from foreign portfolio investors.

US Government Influence:

Dual-Use Technology:

Geopolitical Implications:

Data Privacy and Security:

Elon Musk's Starlink has been generating significant buzz in India, particularly for its promise of high-speed satellite internet. However, a recent report by the Kutniti Foundation has raised concerns about the potential security implications of allowing the service in India.The Delhi-based foundation highlights Starlink's close ties to the US intelligence and military establishment, raising questions about the potential for surveillance, data interception, and disruption of critical infrastructure. The report points out that the technology's dual-use nature, capable of both civilian and military applications, poses a significant risk to India's national security.While the Indian government has expressed caution and emphasized the need for compliance with security regulations, the potential benefits of satellite internet, especially in remote and underserved areas, cannot be ignored.Starlink's close ties to the US government and its intelligence agencies could potentially allow for surveillance and data interception. Kutniti cited reports of some of the contracts between Musk's companies and the US agencies to say, ""These are just the known contracts of Starlink as part of the intel-military-industrial complex of the USA, there are a lot of confidential agreements and contracts kept behind covers.""The technology's ability to serve both civilian and military purposes raises concerns about its potential misuse.Starlink's global reach and its potential to influence geopolitical dynamics could pose risks to India's strategic interests.The report questions the level of data protection and security that Starlink can offer, particularly in light of US laws that prioritize national security.""Starlink is (very candidly) a technology of geopolitical control, pushed by intelligence and defence forces to have the dominance in space and control over land via that lever,"" the report added.","Starlink has been generating significant buzz in India, particularly for its promise of high-speed satellite internet.

What Pentagon's new report on UFOs and aliens say: There is something ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-pentagons-new-report-on-ufos-and-aliens-say-there-is-something-/articleshow/115365779.cms,"Pic of UFO downed by US fighter jet (Pic credit: MJ Schwab's X account)

Why Pentagon tracks UFOs and Aliens

Key Findings of Pentagon's new report on UFOs and Aliens

* No under water incident:

* No extraterrestrial origin, but hundreds of cases remain unexplained:

* Most common explanations:

* What leaves sightings unresolved:

The Pentagon has released a new report on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), often referred to as UFOs. While the report details hundreds of new cases, it offers no evidence of extraterrestrial origins. The report, compiled by the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office ( AARO ), covers a wide range of incidents, from misidentified balloons and drones to more mysterious objects. One particularly intriguing case involved a near-miss between a commercial airliner and an unidentified object off the coast of New York.Pentagon's efforts to study and identify UAPs are reportedly focused on potential threats to national security or air safety and not their science fiction aspects. The All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, or AARO, was created at the Pentagon in 2022 to look into the cases of unearthly origins.This was after US lawmakers reportedly said that the many questions about UAPs show the need for the government to closely study the issue — and share those findings with Americans. “There is something out there,” said Republican Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee, as per a report by news agency AP. “The question is: Is it ours, is it someone else's, or is it otherworldly?”The Pentagon’s review reportedly covered 757 cases from around the world that were reported to US authorities from May 1, 2023, to June 1, 2024. The total includes 272 incidents that occurred before that time period but had not been previously reported.The great majority of the reported incidents occurred in airspace, but 49 occurred at altitudes estimated to be at least 100 kilometers (62 miles), which is considered space. None occurred underwater. Reporting witnesses are said to have included commercial and military pilots as well as ground-based observers.The report emphasizes that AARO has found no evidence to suggest extraterrestrial involvement in any of the cases examined. Hundreds of other cases remain unexplained, though the report's authors stressed that is often because there isn't enough information to draw firm conclusions.Many of the incidents can be attributed to mundane objects like balloons, drones, or satellites, particularly those from Elon Musk 's Starlink satellite constellation.The lack of sufficient data often hinders definitive conclusions, leaving many cases unsolved.","Pentagon has released a new report on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), often referred to as UFOs.

Balancing innovation and regulation

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury has reportedly expressed concerns over the potential anti-trust implications of a SpaceX-like model in Europe. He highlighted the stark contrast between the European space industry , characterized by its fragmented approach and stringent regulations, and SpaceX's highly integrated and innovative model. According to a report by news agency Reuters, ""I think what the Americans and what SpaceX have done is amazing. It's amazing and it's breaking some rules of what we're doing. It's very concentrated, where with European projects we are very scattered and distributed,"" Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said.""SpaceX's insurgent Falcon 9 rocket has slashed launch costs by introducing reusable rocketry into the commercial industry, enabling deployment of the company's fast-growing Starlink constellation, now tallied at nearly 7,000 satellites in orbit. By contrast, Europe's flagship Ariane 6 launcher , which is partly built by Airbus, has yet to stage its first commercial flight after a long-delayed test flight in July. It plans some 10 flights a year, a fraction of the pace at SpaceX,"" said the Reuters report.In contrast, the European space industry has been plagued by delays, cost overruns, and bureaucratic hurdles. The Ariane 6 launcher, a key European project, has faced significant setbacks, while SpaceX continues to dominate the market.""In Europe, we tend to do the ... opposite. We make 20%, we buy 80%. And by buying 80%, you have a large supply base which is pleasing everybody. Well, Elon Musk's space is not pleasing anybody except Elon Musk,"" Faury said.Backed by Europe's leading space-funding nations such as France, Airbus and other manufacturers have reportedly long complained that Europe's space industry is hit by by rules requiring work to be shared between countries involved in funding Ariane. By contrast, SpaceX is free to decide where to invest and manufactures 80% of what it needs, Faury reportedly said.AirBus CEO emphasized the need for Europe to adapt to the changing landscape of the space industry. He acknowledged that the current European model, characterized by a distributed approach and strict regulations, may hinder innovation and competitiveness.The European space industry faces a delicate balancing act between fostering innovation and ensuring fair competition.

Government to Amazon and Elon Musk's Starlink: Your satellite application can be processed only after ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-to-amazon-and-elon-musks-starlink-your-satellite-application-can-be-processed-only-after-/articleshow/115124999.cms,"Strict security guidelines and declaration

Why government is extra cautious on security

The Department of Telecommunications ( DoT ) has reportedly imposed stringent security requirements on Elon Musk 's Starlink and Jeff Bezos's Amazon before approving their satellite communication services in India. According to a report in Economic Times, both companies are expected to provide detailed compliance information regarding data security, coverage area, and other key parameters.While Bharti-backed OneWeb and Reliance Jio 's partnership with SES have already secured approval, Starlink and Amazon's applications are still pending due to the additional security checks.Officials aware of the details told ET that letters to both the US-based firms were sent recently and the department is awaiting their reply. ""Their applications can be processed only after they submit the compliance. The firms have so far not replied,"" said a person familiar with the details.Another official said that the government will wait for some more time for their reply, but the applications won't be processed till they agree to all the security conditions. ""There are various security-related compliances as well as those related to data, coverage area etc which satcom providers have to give to the government in order to offer services in India. All the boxes need to be ticked,"" said a third official.As per security requirements, the terminals have to stop communicating if there is a change in latitude and longitude position in order to prevent any misuse. In its replies to the government, Starlink had reportedly given a declaration that none of its investors were from countries sharing a land border with India -- primarily China and Pakistan. The government had accepted that declaration.The government's cautious approach is driven by concerns over potential security risks, especially given the strategic importance of satellite communications. The DoT is particularly interested in ensuring that satellite terminals near border areas are securely monitored and controlled to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is currently working on recommendations for pricing and other terms and conditions for allocating satellite spectrum. However, traditional telecom operators like Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea are advocating for a level playing field, arguing that satellite companies should be subject to the same regulations and liabilities as terrestrial operators.",The Department of Telecommunications ( DoT) has reportedly imposed stringent security requirements on Elon Musk's Starlink and Jeff Bezos's Amazon.

Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, and his wife, Sudha Murthy, recently shared some insights from their lives. The couple were the star guests on the popular talk show The Great Indian Kapil Sharma Show where they delighted the audience with candid, humorous stories from their personal lives.One of the show’s highlights was Narayana Murthy’s funny confession about forgetting their 25th wedding anniversary. He recalled, “One morning, Sudha asked me, ‘Is there anything special today?’ I replied, ‘No, nothing,’ and went to the office. As I was getting in the car, she asked again, ‘Think of anything special today?’ I still didn’t realize.”Later that day, while heading to Mumbai, Murthy received a call from their daughter, Akshata Murty, who was studying at Stanford University at the time. This is how the conversation went:“She asked, ‘What are you doing?’ I told her I was catching a flight. She immediately said, ‘Cancel it, get the first flight back to Bangalore, and wish your wife a happy anniversary!’”Narayana Murthy shared that he told her about a speech at 3pm but Akshata insisted, “I don’t care if you have a speech at 3 pm. If you need to hire a private plane, hire it, but come back and wish her!” Their daughter, Akshata Murty, is now married to former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.Sudha Murthy also chimed in, laughing, “It was our 25th wedding anniversary so it doesn’t happen every year. So I thought, let me give him a cue but it did not work… For five-ten minutes I felt bad because I’m also human. But my daughter was very upset, she went ‘In America this never happens!’, but I went ‘India main it happens though’, who can remember these things??”","Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, and his wife, Sudha, recently shared some insights from their lives.

He filmed the initial content for his channel, BeerBiceps, at a gym in Wadala.To avoid the crowds, Allahbadia developed a routine of visiting the gym around 2 PM. He mentioned that with fewer people in the gym, he felt more comfortable and found it easier to record content for his channel.However, Allahbadia's growing popularity didn't sit well with the gym's trainers and he was banned from the gym. “The trainers were angry with me because I was growing. So, they banned me from the gym. I was very sad and upset,” said Allahbadia.

This is the company's third consumer-facing business after food delivery app Zomato and quick commerce Blinkit.Zomato's foray into the going-out segment is a strategic move aimed at diversifying its revenue streams and capitalizing on the burgeoning entertainment industry. The company acquired Paytm's events and ticketing business in August 2023 for a substantial Rs 2,048 crore, solidifying its position in this sector.The District app offers a comprehensive range of services, including:* Movie Ticketing: Users can book tickets for movies from various chains like PVR-Inox and Cinepolis.* Event Bookings: The app facilitates bookings for concerts, plays, and other live events.* Dining Reservations: Users can reserve tables at restaurants, leveraging Zomato's extensive restaurant network.Takes on Reliance-backed BookmyshowZomato's entry into the going-out segment intensifies competition with established players like BookMyShow (backed by Reliance), which currently holds a significant market share in movie ticketing.

Controversial win for Jake Paul

Netflix 's ambitious foray into live sports streaming stumbled during the highly-anticipated boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul . Despite drawing a massive global audience, the event was marred by widespread technical difficulties, leaving thousands of viewers frustrated.""We crashed the site,"" Paul boasted after his controversial victory over the 58-year-old Tyson. ""This is the biggest event. Over 120 million people on Netflix.""Social media was flooded with complaints about slow buffering, frozen screens, and other technical glitches. Even legendary boxer Evander Holyfield experienced audio issues during the live broadcast.Netflix remained silent on the specific impact of the technical failures. The company has been investing heavily in live-event capabilities, aiming to boost its advertising business. However, as a report in Bloomberg pointed out, this latest incident follows earlier livestreaming mishaps, including the chaotic Love Is Blind reunion.The boxing match itself, held at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, failed to live up to the hype, with critics panning it as a lackluster affair. Paul was controversially awarded a unanimous decision victory after eight rounds.The event was expected to be a significant driver of Netflix subscriptions, with analysts predicting potential gains of 10 million in the fourth quarter. However, the technical issues and underwhelming fight may have dampened these expectations.Social media users expressed their disappointment, with many questioning Netflix's ability to handle large-scale live events. As the company continues to explore live programming, it will need to address these technical challenges to ensure future success.","Boxing match between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson was marred by technical problems.

T-Mobile 's network was among the several systems hacked in the Chinese hacking operation that gained entry into multiple US and international telecommunications companies, a report has said. The telecom giant now joins other known victims, including AT&T and Verizon, of the major Chinese spying operation.Citing people familiar with the matter, The Wall Street Journal (via news agency Reuters) reported that a stealthy hacking group known as Salt Typhoon with alleged links to Chinese intelligence were able to breach T-Mobile as part of a months-long campaign to spy on the phone communications of high-value intelligence targets.“T-Mobile is closely monitoring this industry-wide attack. At this time, T-Mobile systems and data have not been impacted in any significant way, and we have no evidence of impacts to customer information,” a company spokesperson told the news agency.The report said that there is no clarity on what information, if any, has been taken about T-Mobile customers' calls and communications records.Last week, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the US cyber watchdog agency CISA said China-linked hackers have intercepted surveillance data intended for American law enforcement agencies after breaking into an unspecified number of telecom companies.Earlier in October, the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese hackers accessed the networks of US broadband providers, including Verizon Communications, AT&T and Lumen Technologies. It added that the hackers obtained information from systems the federal government uses for court-authorised wiretapping.The report also said that the hackers appear to have collected vast internet traffic from internet service providers. Additionally, there are indications that the hacking campaign targeted a small number of service providers outside of the US.","T-Mobile joins other known victims, including AT&T and Verizon, of the major Chinese spying operation.

User reactions

Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu has left the internet divided with this latest post. Vembu's comments, urging people who make Bengaluru their home to learn Kannada , have garnered both support and criticism.Sridhar Vembu shared a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) urging people to learn Kannada. Vembu emphasised that anyone who considers Bengaluru their home should learn Kannada, calling it ""disrespectful"" not to do so.Vembu's comments were prompted by a social media post featuring two individuals wearing T-shirts with the slogan ""Hindi National Language."" The post, captioned ""Perfect T-shirt for Bangalore trip”.Commenting on another X user post, Vembu wrote, “If you make Bengaluru your home, you should learn Kannada and your kids should learn Kannada. Not doing so after living many years in Bengaluru is disrespectful. I often request our employees in Chennai coming from other states to make an effort to learn Tamil after they come here.""Vembu's post garnered over a million views and sparked a wave of reactions on social media. Vembu's statement, which emphasized the importance of learning Kannada for residents who build their lives in Bengaluru, resonated with some users. However, others expressed concerns that such expectations could be perceived as exclusionary or impose an additional burden on non-Kannada speakers. Here are some user reactions:“I have many Kannada friends in Mumbai, living here for decades. No one can speak Marathi. Not one word. Fair?”“Disrespectful? The problem is that a IT professional working in Chennai for 3 years could move to Bengaluru to work there for next 5 years and then to Hyderabad for next 2 years. So, by the OP logic they should be learning Tamil , Kannada and Telugu in these years and then finally settle to their hometown somewhere in Maharashtra and not use these languages ever again .Though it is good to learn different languages but it cannot be shoved down their throat just to satisfy the misplaced regional pride? Also the work most IT professionals do is with European, American or other international clients in English - there also these languages will not help professionally .Now, if you have noticed the Marwadi businessmen that you would find everywhere in Chennai running kirana shops or small businesses - they can speak fluent Tamil because their clientele is local. Try visiting Abids or Koti in Hyderabad , you will find the same thing with Telugu speaking Gujaratis and Marwadis .The problem is not learning the language, the problem is regional ego attached with it . Which unfortunately the post like yours promote . That is what is disrespectful.”“Great Sir. Let's devide the country and make borders with requirement of IELTS kind certificate in the local language for entrance. Just before that the tagline of our country 'Unity in diversity' should be immersed in Ganga in Varanasi.”“Sridhar Ji - I completely understand your sentiment . But there is always a list of things to learn for me - couple of tech certifications pending , a course on Sanaskrit Vedic pending , even the plan of learning my mother tongue script Sharda is in my bucket list. Taking extra time for something new is challenging - only way a person can pick a new language is if the process is organic.We should think about making the process organic, may be little Kanada here and there or small interactive sessions on weekends . Even encouraging someone who speaks broken language. I don’t know the exact answer how we can encourage it - but the process should be organic as we are already loaded with 1000 things which take precedence over learning a new language”",Sridhar Vembu shared a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) urging people to learn Kannada.

Bharat Desai , who once worked with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), now has a net worth of approximately Rs 13,501 crore (around $1.6 billion USD), according to Forbes. The IIT graduate currently stands at 2111 spot in Forbes billionaires' list. Here we will take a look at Desai’s journey from IIT to building his own IT firm.Bharat Desai was born in Kenya in November 1952. He was raised in India where he graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay with a degree in electrical engineering. Desai completed his MBA in finance from the Stephen M Ross School of Business.In 1976, Desai moved to the US as a programmer with TCS. While working at TCS, he met Neerja Sethi with whom he tied the knot. The two were living in an apartment in Michigan when they decided to invest around Rs 16000 to start their own company.In 1980, Desai co-founded IT consulting and outsourcing company Syntel with his wife Neerja Sethi from their apartment in Troy, Michigan in 1980. In its first year, Syntel generated just $30,000 in sales. By 2018, the company's revenue reached $900 million, catching the attention of French IT giant Atos SE . Reflecting on his success, Desai once said, “It’s about having a strong vision and the patience to build it step by step.”Atos SE acquired Syntel for a substantial $3.4 billion (around Rs 28,000 crore) in cash. However, Desai was later sued by Atos. The company accused him of hiding liabilities ahead of the merger. The case was dismissed in 2023.Desai now resides with his family in Fisher Island, Florida, and supports philanthropic works. He is involved in Detroit’s “Paint the Town” initiative, which aids struggling neighborhoods, among others. He has been awarded with “Entrepreneur of the Year” award from USA Today and NASDAQ in 1996. Forbes has also recognized Syntel as one of the “Best 200 Small Companies in America.”","Bharat Desai was born in Kenya in November 1952.

You are a waste of time and resources. You are a burden on society. You are a drain on the earth. You are a blight on the landscape. You are a stain on the universe. Please die. Please.""The student's sister, Sumedha Reddy , who witnessed the exchange, told CBS News they were both ""thoroughly freaked out"" by the incident. ""I wanted to throw all of my devices out of the window.

This WhatsApp screenshot on late login leads to another viral debate: Work-life balance in India vs Sweden,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-whatsapp-screenshot-on-late-login-leads-to-another-viral-debate-work-life-balance-in-india-vs-sweden/articleshow/115334997.cms,"Read the post here

Read the complete post:

Back when I started in tech in India, grinding late hours was worn like a badge of honor.

- I had a manager who wouldn’t leave to home before 10:00 PM and always come to office at 9:00 AM sharp

- last min prod deployment on the name of client is god.

- even my team members slept in accenture offices in Gurgaon

- in India we’re so many people in tech hence so tough competition if you don’t do it — there are 10,000 people in line so most of us don’t have choice.

Hustle culture

was so ingrained that I barely questioned it — sacrificing personal time and family moments without a second thought.

No one told me it wasn’t sustainable; I just accepted it as the price of “dedication.”

Then I moved to Sweden, and it’s a whole new world.

Here, people simply drop a Slack message to adjust their hours, and no one doubts their commitment.

There’s mutual trust, a respect for boundaries, and an understanding that a balanced life leads to better work.

It’s the kind of balance I never thought I could ask for.

Now,

Gen Z in India

is flipping the script.

They’re setting boundaries, pushing back on toxic expectations, and actually daring to value their own time.

Sure, it can come off as bold — even a little too relaxed. But maybe they’re on to something. By demanding healthier work dynamics, they might just be the ones to finally fix India’s relentless hustle.

User reactions

A WhatsApp screenshot has triggered a heated online debate about work-life balance in India. The screenshot, showing a late login notification , has resonated with many Indian workers accustomed to long work hours and a demanding work culture.The screenshot sparked a conversation about the pressure Indian professionals often face to prioritise work over personal life. Many users shared their own experiences of working late hours and receiving late-night messages from colleagues or supervisors.The screenshot is shared by a techie named Ankur Taygi. Tyagi posted a WhatsApp screenshot on X (formerly known as Twitter) along with a post in which he is comparing India's demanding work culture and the focus on work-life balance in countries like Sweden.The viral WhatsApp screenshot has become a symbol of the need for a change in work culture within India. Many users expressed a desire for a work environment that prioritises employee well-being and respects personal time. Here are some user reactions“My sister works tirelessly for approx 11 hours daily in the office, even working on weekends sometimes. Her office culture is more like a cult than hustle. She literally cries just in case we ask her not to go to work on weekend.”“This would be true if Gen Z used the additional time to actually decompress with hobbies or passions, not get more depressed doomscrolling in their free time. It's important to understand what really causes stress and how to actually deal with it, rather than just working less.”“i feel that attaching story points to any development effort and using them as a quantifiable metric for impact evaluation is the only method. hours is a vanity metric. i have seen many folks in many offices who spend a lot of time but cannot get things done because of lack of rhythm that is needed for coding. A one-off 12-hour or even 14-hour work day per month is acceptable if things go south but should never be a daily practise.”","A WhatsApp screenshot has triggered a heated online debate about work-life balance in India.

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an initiative launched by President-elect Donald Trump, is making headlines with its bold vision of streamlining government operations. Spearheaded by tech magnate Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy , DOGE aims to cut bureaucracy, slash wasteful expenditures, and introduce groundbreaking reforms across federal agencies.On Thursday, the department took a significant step by announcing its recruitment drive via social media, calling for ""super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries"" to join this ambitious project. With a zero-compensation policy and a gruelling workload, the initiative has stirred debates about the future of government restructuring.DOGE announced its recruitment campaign on the platform X (formerly Twitter), urging individuals to send their resumes via direct messages. However, candidates must have a verified X account, which requires a monthly subscription fee starting at $8. The announcement stated:Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy themselves will review the top 1% of applicants, adding a layer of exclusivity and rigour to the selection process.In response to public inquiries, Musk clarified that DOGE team members would not receive monetary compensation for their work. He wrote:This policy aligns with DOGE’s mission to minimise government spending but has raised eyebrows among critics questioning its feasibility and fairness.Trump unveiled DOGE earlier this week, likening its mission to the transformative “Manhattan Project” of World War II.

Bluesky, a social media platform, is experiencing an unprecedented surge in users as dissatisfaction with Elon Musk 's platform, X (formerly Twitter), escalates following Donald Trump 's election as U.S. President. The platform has reportedly gained 2.5 million new users in just the past week, bringing its total user base to over 16 million, according to Reuters. This spike coincides with concerns over X’s upcoming terms of service changes, which critics argue could hinder legal accountability and amplify controversial content. Amidst shifting preferences, Bluesky is emerging as a significant alternative for individuals and organisations seeking a new digital space.In a statement released on Thursday, Bluesky reported record-high engagement levels, including likes, follows, and account creations. The platform is on track to add over 1 million new users in a single day. This growth is part of a broader exodus from X, as organisations like the Center for Countering Digital Hate, The Guardian, and public figures such as former CNN anchor Don Lemon announce their departure from Musk’s platform.Bluesky’s website recorded 1.2 million visitors on November 6, outperforming Meta's Threads, which garnered 950,000 web visitors. However, Threads still holds a larger mobile app user base. Market intelligence firm Sensor Tower attributes Bluesky's success to technical issues and rising controversial content on X, alongside the departure of prominent accounts.X has been under scrutiny for its role in spreading misinformation during the recent U.S. presidential election. Experts flagged the platform for enabling false narratives about key battleground states, with election-related content drawing a record 46.5 million U.S. visits on November 6. Despite this engagement, SimilarWeb data revealed that over 115,000 U.S. users deactivated their X accounts—the highest since Musk’s acquisition.Adding to the discontent, X’s terms of service, effective November 17, will require all legal disputes to be filed in courts located in Texas. Critics, including the Center for Countering Digital Hate, argue this change could favour Elon Musk by directing lawsuits to jurisdictions perceived as favourable to him. The nonprofit stated, “This will allow Musk to potentially shield himself and X from broader legal challenges.”Bluesky has positioned itself as a fresh alternative by offering a decentralised social media experience. Unlike traditional platforms, its architecture allows users to maintain greater control over their content. While its user base of 16 million is significantly smaller than X’s 317 million monthly active users, Bluesky’s rapid growth signals a shift in user trust and behaviour.Despite the challenges, analysts believe X remains well-positioned due to its network effects and ability to serve as a platform for political discourse, particularly under Trump’s leadership. D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Gil Luria commented, “X’s alignment with the president-elect may bolster its influence, but the rise of competitors like Bluesky and Threads highlights a growing demand for alternatives.”","Bluesky, a social media platform, is experiencing an unprecedented surge in users as dissatisfaction with Elon Musk's platform, X (formerly Twitter), escalates.

Elon Musk has intensified his legal battle against OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. In a new lawsuit filed on November 14, he has expanded his claims to include antitrust allegations and added Microsoft and venture capitalist Reid Hoffman as defendants.The amended complaint, filed in a Northern California federal court, also includes Musk's AI startup xAI and former OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis as plaintiffs. Zilis, now an executive at Musk's Neuralink, had expressed concerns about OpenAI's direction during her time on the board.The lawsuit alleges that OpenAI, in partnership with Microsoft, has deviated from its original non-profit mission to prioritize commercial interests. Musk argues that this has led to anti-competitive behavior, including restricting funding for rival AI companies and sharing sensitive information. The addition of Hoffman and Microsoft to the lawsuit stems from their dual involvement in both companies, which Musk claims violates antitrust laws.Tesla CEO Elon Musk sued OpenAI in March in a state court in San Francisco, before withdrawing the suit later without explanation. Seven weeks later, he filed a new suit in federal court, arguing that OpenAI violated federal racketeering laws by conspiring to defraud him.Like the original suit, the federal complaint claimed that OpenAI and two of its founders, Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, breached the company’s founding contract by putting commercial interests ahead of the public good.The lawsuit claimed that after joining with ""Mr. Musk to create OpenAI in 2015 and pledging to carefully develop artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity, Mr. Altman and Mr. Brockman abandoned this mission by entering its multibillion-dollar partnership with Microsoft."" Musk moved away from OpenAI in the year 2018, before this partnership was created.While OpenAI and Hoffman have yet to respond, Microsoft has declined to comment. This latest legal move further deepens the rift between Musk and OpenAI, highlighting the growing tensions in the AI industry.","Elon Musk has intensified his legal battle against OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT.

"US regulator wants to treat Google as a bank, bring it under same financial laws",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-regulator-wants-to-treat-google-as-a-bank-bring-it-under-same-financial-laws/articleshow/115322416.cms,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has initiated steps to place Google under the same federal supervision as major banks, a move that could subject the tech giant to regular financial inspections and monitoring, The Washington Post reported Wednesday.The regulatory action, if finalised, would give federal authorities direct access to Google's internal records and operations related to its financial services, including Google Wallet and payment systems. Google has strongly resisted the supervision during months of confidential discussions, according to sources familiar with the matter.CFPB's unprecedented move reflects growing concern over tech companies' expanding role in financial services without facing the rigorous oversight applied to traditional banks. The agency has received hundreds of customer complaints about unauthorised charges on Google's services in recent years.The exact scope of CFPB's concerns remains unclear, and the supervision order is not yet final. The initiative's fate may also hang in balance with President-elect Donald Trump 's upcoming return to office, which could bring significant changes to the agency's leadership and agenda.Google spokesperson José Castañeda declined to comment on the development, as did the CFPB.The tech industry has pushed back against similar oversight attempts, arguing that digital payment services differ fundamentally from banking institutions and shouldn't face equivalent supervision. Industry groups warn that CFPB inspections could extend beyond financial offerings to scrutinise entire business operations.The move is part of CFPB Director Rohit Chopra's broader initiative to expand oversight of technology companies' financial practices. The agency has already implemented similar reviews for fintech company Affirm and is investigating other tech giants including Meta and Block for their handling of financial data and customer disputes.","The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has initiated steps to place Google under the same federal supervision as major banks.

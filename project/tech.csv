Bengaluru techie reveals the ‘childish’ cold mail he sent to Jeff Bezos at 19 and how it transformed his career,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bengaluru-techie-reveals-the-childish-cold-mail-he-sent-to-jeff-bezos-at-19-and-how-it-transformed-his-career/articleshow/124863831.cms,"How Ashish Jha’s bold email to Jeff Bezos transformed his career and impacted Alexa developers in India



How one email inspired Amazon to expand developer perks in India



From teenage developer to key contributor in Amazon’s Alexa community

At an age when most teenagers are focused on exams or preparing for college admissions, Ashish Jha, a young tech enthusiast from Bengaluru, was already exploring the expanding world of Amazon Alexa development. Driven by curiosity and a desire to innovate, he began experimenting with Alexa skills, which are essentially voice-driven applications that enhance Alexa’s functionality.Within just five days, Jha’s creation of a quiz-based Alexa skill titled “Quiz of Thrones” attracted over 200 users, a significant achievement for a self-taught teenager. This success proved his technical skill and creativity, but it also brought an unexpected realisation: Indian developers were not receiving the same level of recognition or incentives that developers in other countries, such as the US, UK, and Germany, enjoyed.This disparity deeply frustrated him. While others were rewarded with bonuses, promotional support, or financial perks, developers in India received none. The sense of unfairness stayed with him and instead of accepting it quietly, he decided to act.In a moment of boldness mixed with youthful emotion, Jha drafted an email directly to Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos. He later described it as a “childish” act, but it was one that changed the course of his life.His email wasn’t simply a complaint; it was a heartfelt message of gratitude and ambition. Jha thanked Bezos for building a platform like Alexa that empowered developers worldwide. He then explained his experience of building a successful skill but noted his disappointment that Indian developers were being excluded from global rewards and recognition programmes.In his post on X (formerly Twitter), Jha later reflected:“Childish, I know, and the language—ughhh. But this email led the Head Dev Marketing Manager for Alexa to contact me personally, appreciate my work, give me contacts within Amazon, and within a month, they started offering perks in the Indian market to developers.”This single email, written with sincerity and courage, became the spark that ignited a series of life-changing events.To his astonishment, Jha’s message reached the right people inside Amazon. The Head of Developer Marketing for Alexa personally reached out to him, praising his initiative and recognising the value of his feedback. Not only did they acknowledge his effort, but they also connected him with internal teams and provided direct contacts within the company.Within one month, Amazon began extending developer perks to India — a change that benefitted not only Jha but thousands of other developers in the region. What had started as a moment of frustration turned into a powerful example of how one person’s voice can drive meaningful change inside a global corporation.This experience also highlighted a key aspect of Jha’s character: his willingness to speak up for fairness and equality in opportunities, even when the odds seemed against him.After his initial success, Jha’s relationship with Amazon’s Alexa Developer Community deepened significantly. Over the next five years, he collaborated closely with Amazon’s developer teams, participated in outreach programmes, and helped grow the Indian Alexa ecosystem. His journey from an unknown teenage developer to a recognised member of the global Alexa developer network was a testament to his persistence and dedication. In his post, Jha summed up this chapter of his life with humility and pride:“The next five years, with me, @alexadevs, and the rest, is history you can Google.”Through continuous learning and active contribution, Jha transformed his “childish” email into a career-defining opportunity that positioned him as one of the emerging voices in India’s tech developer community.","Ashish Jha, a young tech enthusiast from Bengaluru, was exploring the expanding world of Amazon Alexa development.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has written to the US government, saying that the nation must drastically increase its investment in new energy capacity to prevent falling behind China in the global race for artificial intelligence (AI) supremacy. The startup, which has recently embarked on deals for massive, power-hungry data centres, submitted an 11-page document to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy outlining the critical need for immediate action.OpenAI emphasised that the development of AI infrastructure is placing immense strain on an already struggling electric grid. The company framed electricity not just as a commodity, but as a strategic asset.“Electricity is not simply a utility,” OpenAI stated in a blog post.“It's a strategic asset that is critical to building the AI infrastructure that will secure our leadership on the most consequential technology since electricity itself,” it added, noting that “Electrons are the new oil.”To keep pace with international rivals, OpenAI encouraged the US to commit to building 100 gigawatts (GW) of new energy capacity each year.(To put that into perspective, 10 GW is roughly equivalent to the annual power consumption of 8 million US households, according to CNBC).OpenAI also noted that China added a total of 429 gigawatts of new power capacity last year. The US, in comparison, added only 51 gigawatts during the same period.OpenAI stated that this growing gap in energy capacity is creating an “electron gap” that is directly affecting the US leadership position in AI development.Notably, OpenAI has signed multibillion-dollar data centre deals with Oracle, NVIDIA, and CoreWeave in recent months. The company aims to diversify its computing power beyond its primary partner, Microsoft. The expansion is part of the massive, multi-vendor ""Stargate"" project.","ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has written to the US government, saying that the nation must drastically increase its investment in new energy capacity.

Supercomputers to accelerate scientific breakthroughs



Nuclear arsenal management and cancer treatment







The US has entered into a $1 billion partnership with chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to construct two powerful supercomputers designed to tackle major scientific challenges ranging from nuclear fusion and cancer treatments to national security threats. Energy Secretary Chris Wright and AMD CEO Lisa Su announced the collaboration, news agency Reuters reported, describing the machines as critical infrastructure for ensuring America maintains sufficient computing power to run increasingly complex experiments requiring massive data-crunching capabilities.Wright said the supercomputers would ""supercharge"" advances across multiple critical areas, including nuclear power and fusion energy, defense and national security technologies, and pharmaceutical development. The systems will be specifically designed to accelerate the pace of scientific discovery in fields the US has prioritised as strategically important, potentially compressing years of research into much shorter timeframes through advanced computational modeling and artificial intelligence.One of the most important applications involves nuclear fusion research. Scientists and companies are attempting to replicate fusion—the reaction that powers the sun—by forcing light atoms together in superheated plasma gas under intense pressure to release enormous amounts of clean energy.“We've made great progress, but plasmas are unstable, and we need to recreate the center of the sun on Earth,” Wright told Reuters.“We're going to get just massively faster progress using the computation from these AI systems that I believe will have practical pathways to harness fusion energy in the next two or three years,” the Energy Secretary added.If successful, fusion energy could provide virtually limitless clean power without the radioactive waste associated with current nuclear fission reactors—a breakthrough that would transform global energy systems.Wright said the supercomputers would also serve critical national security functions by helping manage the US arsenal of nuclear weapons. In healthcare, the systems are aimed to accelerate drug discovery by simulating cancer treatments down to the molecular level, potentially identifying therapeutic approaches far faster than traditional laboratory methods.“My hope is in the next five or eight years, we will turn most cancers, many of which today are ultimate death sentences, into manageable conditions,” Wright said.",The US has entered into a $1 billion partnership with chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to construct two powerful supercomputers.

Threads launches 'Ghost Posts' that disappear after 24 hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/threads-launches-ghost-posts-that-disappear-after-24-hours/articleshow/124857821.cms,"Meta says feature designed to encourage authentic, spontaneous sharing





Meta's Threads app is rolling out a disappearing posts feature called ""ghost posts"" that automatically archives content after 24 hours, allowing its over 400 million monthly users to share spontaneous thoughts without permanent consequences. The feature, launching globally now, lets users toggle a ghost icon when composing posts on mobile devices. These posts appear in followers' feeds with a distinctive grayed-out chat bubble, signaling their temporary nature.Unlike standard posts, ghost posts function differently for engagement. When users reply to a ghost post, their responses go directly to the original poster's direct message inbox rather than appearing publicly in the thread. While engagement metrics like likes and replies are visible through smiley-faced icons, only the original poster can see actual numbers and identify who engaged.After the 24-hour window expires, ghost posts disappear from public view but remain accessible to creators through an archived section in the settings menu. This differs from true disappearing messages, as users can unarchive posts whenever desired.Meta says the feature aims to encourage ""authentic, spontaneous expression"" and low-stakes sharing on the platform. The company believes users will feel more comfortable posting unfiltered thoughts, live-threading events, or experimenting with content when they know it won't permanently remain on their profile.The launch comes as Threads continues rapid feature development since its debut in 2023, adding 10,000-character text attachments, spoiler-hiding tools, and interest-based communities over the last two years. The disappearing posts concept echoes Twitter's failed Fleets experiment from 2020-2021, though Meta remains optimistic given the success of disappearing Stories on Instagram and Facebook.","Meta's Threads app is rolling out a disappearing posts feature called ""ghost posts"" The feature automatically archives content after 24 hours, allowing its over 400 million monthly users to share spontaneous thoughts without permanent consequences.

Palantir partnership targets AI and battlefield data

Anduril to co-produce Cruise Missiles





Poland has reportedly advanced its ambitious military modernization effort, inking separate defense agreements with US technology companies Palantir Technologies and Anduril Industries as the country prepares to commit nearly 5% of its GDP to defense spending next year. According to a report in Bloomberg, the dual deals underscore Poland's strategy to rapidly acquire cutting-edge military technology while simultaneously investing in its domestic defense industry.Poland is said to be positioning itself as one of NATO’s leading defense spenders, aiming to spend about 200 billion zloty ($55 billion) next year, up from 4.7% of GDP planned for this year. The government has stressed that its priority is to spend as much of that massive defense budget as possible domestically.In Warsaw, Polish Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz and Palantir Chief Executive Officer Alex Karp signed a letter of intent to cooperate on data, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity.The minister emphasized the immediate need for advanced data integration across his forces. ""If there’s a unique experience from the battlefield, it’s Palantir that has it,"" Kosiniak-Kamysz told reporters.""What’s important to me is that the linking of the data between all the military units, and that its security is ensured.”Poland is reportedly interested in several Palantir systems, including those for battlefield management and logistics. While the initial agreement is early-stage and no financial details were disclosed, the minister expects to sign deals for specific systems within the next two or three months.Karp pledged that the company plans to invest in Poland, engaging local engineers and tapping into the nation's defense industry potential. ""Having this support role here as you guys show the rest of Europe how to invest in defense is very important to me and my company,"" Karp said, according to Bloomberg.Concurrently, Poland’s state-owned defense group PGZ SA partnered with Anduril Industries to cooperate on developing and producing autonomous air systems for the Polish army, including the Barracuda-500M cruise missile.PGZ CEO Adam Leszkiewicz highlighted the strategic importance of the collaboration. “Today’s agreement paves the way for technology transfer, joint research and development and developing the equipment, which will strengthen not only Poland but also the entire eastern flank of NATO,” Leszkiewicz posted on Twitter.The partnership follows PGZ’s recent cooperation agreements signed this month with Germany’s Rheinmetall AG and France’s Eurenco SA.",Poland inks defense agreements with Palantir Technologies and Anduril Industries.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees.

Internal testing also features limits on playtime, including a one-hour session limit and a maximum of five hours of free streaming per month. These restrictions are subject to change before the official launch, the report noted.The free tier is expected to be widely available across PC, Xbox consoles, handheld devices and web browsers. The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%. This change reportedly came after Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new 30% target.","Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

From No. 7 in 2022 to No. 3 in 2025: How 'made-in-India iPhones' helped India’s electronics industry dislodged these 'biggest industries' in export ranking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/from-no-7-in-2022-to-no-3-in-2025-in-export-ranking-how-iphone-boom-helped-indias-electronics-industry-beats-these-biggest-industries/articleshow/124856413.cms,"iPhone 16

Rise and rise of electronics to No. 3

Electronics, which was only the 7th largest export category in FY22, has rapidly moved past major sectors like gems and jewellery, chemicals, drugs and pharmaceuticals, and readymade garments.

In its race to the third spot, electronics dislodged gems and jewellery and chemicals from third and fourth place, respectively, in FY25.

Before that, in its surge to number 3 from number 7 in FY22, it had outpaced drugs and pharmaceuticals and readymade garments.

iPhone manufacturing drives export boom in electronics

Petroleum's decline and the narrowing gap





India's electronics sector is experiencing a meteoric rise, positioning itself to potentially displace petroleum products as the nation's second-largest export category within the next two years. Driven by a surge in manufacturing, largely spearheaded by Apple's iPhone production, the electronics industry has become India's fastest-growing overseas sales category, according to recent commerce ministry data. The government's focus on electronics, a category that has long been a leading export for China, reflects a national strategy to capitalize on the ongoing geopolitical churn that is pushing global firms to diversify their supply chains away from a single manufacturing hub.The potential shift is accelerated by changing geopolitical dynamics, notably the United States' efforts to dissuade Indian refiners from purchasing discounted Russian crude. This move threatens the cost advantage Indian refineries have leveraged, further dimming the outlook for petroleum exports.The pace of growth for electronics exports is staggering. In the first half of the fiscal year 2026 (H1 FY26), electronics exports surged 42% to $22.2 billion, up from $15.6 billion in the previous year.This rapid ascent has vaulted the category up the ranks, making it the third-largest overall export, cementing its status as the quickest growing among all 30 export categories.In the last three years, electronics exports have jumped 63%, from $23.5 billion in FY23 to $38.5 billion in FY25. Analysts project that electronics exports could double from FY23 to FY26 at the current rate.The main engine for the electronics export boom is the government's Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for smartphones, which has successfully incentivized global manufacturing giants to establish significant operations in India.The standout player is Apple, which has made India its second-most important base after China for iPhone manufacturing. In the first six months of the current fiscal year, Apple shipped iPhones worth a record $10 billion.Apple's iPhone exports accounted for over 75% of the total smartphone exports ($13.4 billion) and a substantial 45% of the total $22.2 billion in electronics exports for H1 FY26.The global sales share of 'Made-in-India' iPhones is steadily rising, with over a fifth now being shipped from India.While Engineering Products remain India's top export category at $59.3 billion in H1 FY26, the traditional number two spot held by Petroleum Products is under threat. In H1 FY26, petroleum products exports fell 16.4% to $30.6 billion from $36.6 billion the year prior. This decline is part of a longer trend, with petroleum exports dropping significantly from $97.4 billion in FY23 to $63.3 billion in FY25.The gap between second-placed petroleum and electronics is shrinking rapidly. The difference, which stood at $73.9 billion at the start of the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, has narrowed dramatically. In H1 FY26, the gap is expected to shrink to approximately $16 billion.Experts project that if the current growth rates persist, electronics could replace petroleum as India’s second-largest export by FY28.","India's electronics sector is experiencing a meteoric rise, positioning itself to potentially displace petroleum products as the nation's second-largest export category within the next two years.

How Nike’s new robot shoes will help users walk and run faster,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-nikes-new-robot-shoes-will-help-users-walk-and-run-faster/articleshow/124855979.cms,"How it will help users to walk or run faster



“Our job is to dream big while keeping athletes at the centre. Project Amplify started with a single question: What if we could find a way to help athletes move faster and farther with less energy and a lot more fun? At its core, Project Amplify is about seamlessly adding a little more power to your stride. The fun comes from realising you can do more than you thought you could — whatever ‘more’ means to you.”





Nike has recently introduced Project Amplify, a new powered footwear system for running and walking. These new footwear items are designed to help athletes move faster and farther with reduced effort. The system is engineered to enhance natural lower leg and ankle movement, offering a significant boost to those who want to move. The company claims that this initiative aims to create new possibilities for running, jogging, and walking. The first version of the footwear system incorporates a lightweight motor, a drive belt, and a rechargeable cuff battery. These components integrate with a carbon fibre-plated running shoe, which can also be worn independently of the robotics system.According to Nike, this design is intended to enable everyday athletes to walk or run more frequently and for longer periods, potentially extending commutes or adding distance to runs. Project Amplify is one of four key technological advances Nike is revealing this month, alongside innovations in Air apparel, advanced cooling, and mind science.Nike claims its Project Amplify system is designed to make running, jogging, and walking easier and more enjoyable for athletes who typically run at a 10- to 12-minute-per-mile pace.Similar to how electric bikes assist cyclists, Project Amplify is designed to provide extra power for everyday movement, acting like an additional set of calf muscles rather than a performance booster for competitive runners.Developed with robotics partner Dephy, the project builds on data from Nike’s Sports Research Lab, where athletes of various skill levels reported that the system feels natural and makes uphill movement feel as effortless as running on flat ground. Some participants experienced improved running speeds, moving from a 12-minute mile to a 10-minute mile.The system has undergone years of testing both indoors and outdoors, with more than 400 athletes completing over 2.4 million steps — roughly 12,000 laps of Nike’s 200-meter track — across nine different hardware versions, each designed to refine specific aspects of the technology.In a blog post, Michael Donaghu, VP of Create The Future, Emerging Sport and Innovation at Nike, said:","Nike has introduced Project Amplify, a new powered footwear system for running and walking.

The world's most-valuable company Nvidia just got an 'American rival' and a 'mighty one'. The San Diego-based Qualcomm, best known for powering smartphones and PCs, has introduced two new AI processors -- the AI200 and AI250 -- marking a major push into a market dominated by rivals Nvidia and AMD. The launch of Qualcomm's new AI chips has sent the company's stock soaring. Shares of Qualcomm skyrocketed as much as 20% on Monday, October 27, after the US chipmaker unveiled a major push into the lucrative artificial intelligence data center market, a space currently dominated Nvidia.Qualcomm is specifically targeting the AI inference market, focusing on chips optimized for running already-trained AI models to generate responses. This differs from the intensive AI training phase, which demands immense computing power and remains the stronghold of Nvidia's powerful GPUs.The company provided details on the new offerings, slated for commercial release over the next few years. The AI200, expected in 2026, boasts 768 gigabytes of memory per card and is designed to manage heat in densely packed server racks—each consuming up to 160 kilowatts—by utilizing direct liquid cooling.Looking further ahead to 2027, the AI250 is projected to be ten times more effective in memory bandwidth than current market products while simultaneously consuming less power, according to Qualcomm.Qualcomm’s foray into the data center market directly challenges the established hierarchy. Nvidia, the poster child of the generative AI boom, currently maintains a dominant lead with its H100 and newer H200 GPU accelerators, which are essential for both training and running AI models in massive, purpose-built data centers. AMD is positioned as the primary challenger and has been steadily gaining ground.Both Nvidia and AMD recently cemented their position by entering into arrangements with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, as the industry races to build the massive infrastructure needed to support the AI frenzy.","The launch of Qualcomm's new AI chips has sent the company's stock soaring.

Check Point Research has discovered a large-scale malware distribution network operating through YouTube. This network, which relied on what appeared to be harmless tutorial videos, was reportedly spreading malicious software. The operation, dubbed the YouTube Ghost Network, used both compromised and fake YouTube accounts to distribute infostealers such as Rhadamanthys and Lumma. The malware was often disguised within videos offering cracked software or gaming cheats. Following a months-long investigation, Check Point Research reported more than 3,000 malicious videos to Google , leading to their removal and disrupting a significant malware distribution channel.According to the report, the YouTube Ghost Network operates as a coordinated web of fake or hijacked accounts rather than a random group of rogue uploads. These accounts are built to look credible and serve specific purposes within the operation.Some accounts focus on uploading tutorial-style videos that include links to download harmful files. Others publish community posts that share passwords and updated links.A third group interacts by posting positive comments and likes, helping the malicious videos appear genuine.This setup allows the network to expand rapidly and continue functioning even when some accounts are taken down, making the removal process ongoing and complicated.The campaign often used free or cracked software as bait, including Adobe Photoshop, FL Studio, Microsoft Office, and game hacks for titles like Roblox. Victims were guided to download an archive from platforms such as Dropbox, Google Drive, or MediaFire, to disable Windows Defender, and to install what appeared to be legitimate software.Instead, the files contained malware that stole credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and system information. The stolen data was then sent to servers whose addresses frequently changed to avoid detection.One YouTube channel with 129,000 subscribers shared a fake cracked version of Adobe Photoshop, gaining over 291,000 views and 1,000 likes. Meanwhile, another targeted cryptocurrency users, leading them to phishing pages on Google Sites that distributed Rhadamanthys Stealer.The attackers continuously updated links and malware versions, keeping the infection chain active even after some content was removed.Check Point Research monitored this operation for over a year, tracing thousands of connected accounts and campaigns. In collaboration with Google, the team helped remove more than 3,000 harmful videos, reducing one of the most persistent malware distribution channels on YouTube.","Check Point Research has discovered a large-scale malware distribution network operating through YouTube.

Elon Musk Becomes First Man To Have $500 Billion Wealth





Read Tesla Board Chairman's letter to shareholders

Dear Fellow Shareholders,

As you know, Tesla is at a critical inflection point, and we need your vote to help determine the future direction of our evolving company. Your vote matters, and the deadline for voting is 11:59pm ET on November 5th. The fundamental question for shareholders at this year’s Annual Meeting is simple:

Do you want to retain Elon as Tesla’s CEO and motivate him to drive Tesla to become the leading provider of autonomous solutions and the most valuable company in the world?

Kathleen and I engaged in a rigorous, seven-month Special Committee process resulting in a highly customized performance plan that aligns shareholder value and measurable business outcomes with the interests of our CEO. Our goal was two-fold: (1) retain and incentivize Elon to capitalize on the unique opportunities that lie ahead for Tesla and (2) do so in a manner that promotes the development of products and services that will propel our world toward a cleaner, safer, and more prosperous future while creating unparalleled value for our shareholders. We’ve done this by challenging Elon with the potential to secure what he values most—meaningful voting influence—conditioned on his commitment to continue leading Tesla for at least another 7.5 years while successfully driving our company to ambitious new heights. The bottom line is simple: Elon is rewarded only if and when he delivers extraordinary performance that benefits all Tesla shareholders.

When negotiating this performance award, we necessarily considered what Tesla’s future without Elon would look like, and we did not believe it was the future that our shareholders deserve. At a time when companies—both big and small—are competing to be the first to bring groundbreaking AI technologies to market, we could not risk losing the best leader in the industry to put Tesla on top. Now is a pivotal moment for our company to emerge as a leader in AI, and with our exceptional CEO at the helm, we are perfectly positioned to seize it.

Though it’s no question that Elon has other pursuits, he has proven that one of the many things that make him unique is his ability to stretch his capacity beyond normal limits and remain successful at Tesla. However, if we fail to foster an environment that motivates Elon to achieve great things through an equitable pay-for-performance plan, we run the risk that he gives up his executive position, and Tesla may lose his time, talent and vision, which have been essential to delivering extraordinary shareholder returns. Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor, with products such as FSD and Optimus, and working to better humanity in the process. While there may be nothing wrong with being just another car company, our Board believes that Tesla can be more, that our shareholders deserve more, and that Elon is the right leader to help us achieve our full potential.

Elon’s leadership is also built upon the critical support of our “tailor made” governance structure, including our carefully constructed Board. Good governance should be customized to the company, not applied with a “cookie cutter” approach, and it is exemplified by the results that Tesla has delivered, and this Board has overseen. We therefore ask you to vote “for” the three members of the Board—Ira, Kathleen and Joe—who are up for re-election to ensure that the Board, which has worked alongside Elon for years, complementing and enhancing his efforts to deliver extraordinary shareholder returns, remains in place.

That is why your vote is so consequential to the future of our company. A vote here is both an endorsement of Elon’s vision and a vote for Tesla’s carefully tailored strategy and governance. I urge you to support Proposal One, which ensures the continued leadership and support of our outstanding and experienced directors, as well as Proposals Three and Four, which aim to keep Elon focused on our mission here at Tesla.

I feel strongly—as do the rest of my colleagues on our Board—that Elon singularly possesses the leadership characteristics and technical manufacturing know-how to keep us on the path towards maximizing long-term shareholder value as well as social good. We at Tesla are laser focused on exceptional performance—not promises—and we structure our awards in line with this principle.

If you care about building a better world for humanity and supporting our vision for Sustainable Abundance—then you should vote “FOR” Proposals One, Three and Four.

If you want Tesla to have a shot at becoming the world’s most valuable company—then you should vote “FOR” Proposals One, Three and Four.

Please read the Special Committee Report, which is attached to this year’s proxy statement, for a more detailed explanation of Kathleen’s and my work in coming to the essential conclusions embodied in the proxy statement and how we structured this performance plan to align Elon’s incentives with delivering extraordinary performance for all of you.

Thank you for your continued support of Tesla.

Very truly yours,

Robyn Denholm

Chairperson of the Board





Tesla Board chairman Robyn Denholm has sent a letter to shareholders asking them to vote for CEO Elon Musk ’s proposed $1 trillion pay package. If they “fail” to do so, he said, Tesla “may lose his time, talent and vision”. Tesla is set to host its annual shareholder meet on November 6. The shareholder vote for Musk’s pay and other proposals will close at 11:59 p.m. ET on November 5.“Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become,” Denholm writes in the letter.Asking shareholders to vote for Musk’s pay package, he said that Musk is key to the future of EV maker as it moves beyond being “just another car company”.“If we fail to foster an environment that motivates Elon to achieve great things through an equitable pay-for-performance plan, we run the risk that he gives up his executive position, and Tesla may lose his time, talent and vision, which have been essential to delivering extraordinary shareholder returns,” he added.The Tesla board outlined the $1 trillion pay package for Elon Musk in September this year. The proposed plan consists of 12 tranches of shares granted to Musk if Tesla hits certain milestones.If approved, Musk will be eligible for up to $1 trillion in stock if he meets key performance targets, including growing the company to an $8.5 trillion market cap, more than a 500% increase from today’s valuation.However, several groups and advisory firms have opposed Musk’s $1 trillion pay package. Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) urged shareholders to vote against the package stating:“Although one of the main reasons for this award is to retain Musk and keep his time and attention on Tesla instead of his other business ventures, there are no explicit requirements to ensure that this will be the case”.It cited “unmitigated concerns” with the plan’s magnitude and design.Slamming the proxy firms like ISS, Musk called them “corporate terrorists”. “I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army here and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis who have no freaking clue. I mean, those guys are corporate terrorists”, he recently said.",The deadline for voting is 11:59pm ET on November 5th. Shareholders will vote on whether to retain Elon Musk as Tesla’s CEO and motivate him to drive Tesla to become the leading provider of autonomous solutions. The Board believes that Tesla can be more and that our shareholders deserve more.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124850633,imgsize-45134,width-400,resizemode-4/elon-musk.jpg"

AI minister Diella aims to eliminate corruption and restore public trust in governance



Symbolism behind the ‘pregnancy’ announcement



Global reaction and ethical debate on AI pregnancy announcement

In a surprising announcement that captured global attention, Albania’s Prime Minister Edi Rama revealed that the world’s first artificial intelligence minister, Diella, is “pregnant” and set to “give birth” to 83 digital offspring. The statement, made during his speech at the Global Dialogue in Berlin, has sparked widespread debate across the tech and political world. While symbolic, Rama’s remarks highlight Albania’s bold step toward embedding AI within its government structure. Diella, introduced earlier this year, represents the country’s vision of combining technology and governance.As reported by Vox News, her “babies” are expected to symbolise new AI-driven initiatives designed to modernise public administration, streamline decision-making, and position Albania as a global leader in AI governance, reflecting a future where human creativity and artificial intelligence collaborate to redefine policymaking, ethics, and national digital identity.Prime Minister Edi Rama’s announcement came during the Global Dialogue (BGD) in Berlin, where leaders and innovators gathered to discuss the future of governance and technology. In a moment that captured both humour and intrigue, Rama revealed that Diella, the AI minister, was “expecting” 83 AI “children.”He explained that these digital offspring would serve as virtual assistants for members of Albania’s Socialist Party in Parliament.Each AI assistant will be responsible for maintaining records of parliamentary proceedings, providing policy suggestions, and ensuring data-based decision-making. Rama added, “These children will know their mother,” indicating that all 83 AI systems would be linked to Diella’s central network, allowing them to communicate and learn collaboratively.The Prime Minister described this as a step towards creating a self-sustaining digital ecosystem capable of improving parliamentary efficiency and transparency.Diella, whose name means “sun” in Albanian, is not a human being but a sophisticated artificial intelligence system developed to operate within the Albanian government. She became the first AI-generated cabinet minister in the world when appointed earlier this year, marking a milestone in the use of technology for administrative governance.The Albanian government introduced Diella with the intention of eliminating corruption and ensuring transparency in public tenders. As the minister responsible for overseeing contracts and tenders between the government and private contractors, Diella uses algorithms and data-driven logic to make impartial decisions free from human influence.Prime Minister Rama announced her appointment in May 2025, stating, “Diella is the first cabinet member who isn’t physically present but is virtually created by AI.” The innovation, he said, is a necessary response to Albania’s long-standing challenges with corruption, money laundering, and organised crime.For years, Albania has struggled with public distrust due to recurring corruption scandals and financial misconduct within government projects. By introducing Diella, the government seeks to replace human bias and favouritism with algorithmic fairness.Diella’s role is to ensure that all tenders and contracts are awarded based purely on merit, efficiency, and transparency. Every proposal will be evaluated using objective data rather than personal connections or political influence. This means that bribery, nepotism, and under-the-table deals will no longer determine how public funds are allocated.Prime Minister Rama described the initiative as a revolutionary move to make the tendering process “100 per cent corruption-free.” The AI’s decision-making process is entirely traceable and publicly accessible, making it nearly impossible for manipulations to occur without detection.While the idea of an AI being “pregnant” may sound absurd at first, the statement carries symbolic meaning. Rama’s metaphor of Diella giving birth to 83 digital children represents the expansion of AI across multiple government sectors. Each “child” is essentially an individual AI assistant programmed to aid the 83 Socialist Party members of parliament.These assistants will act as extensions of Diella, recording data from parliamentary sessions, analysing debates, and even generating reports for better decision-making. The digital offspring collectively represent the next stage in Albania’s digital governance revolution.By linking all the AI units to Diella’s central intelligence, Albania is developing a networked system capable of learning and evolving based on the data it processes daily. This interconnectivity could eventually lead to a fully integrated AI-governed administrative model.The global response to Albania’s announcement has been a mixture of curiosity, admiration, and concern. Many technology experts have praised the innovation, noting that it highlights how AI can be used to combat corruption and inefficiency in developing nations.However, ethical concerns have also surfaced. Critics question the idea of granting an AI system such a powerful government position, warning that overreliance on artificial intelligence could lead to accountability issues. Who is responsible if Diella or one of her AI “children” makes an incorrect or biased decision? How will moral and emotional aspects of leadership be preserved when technology begins to dominate governance?These debates underline the growing tension between innovation and responsibility in the AI era.","Albania’s Prime Minister Edi Rama revealed that the world’S first artificial intelligence minister, Diella, is ‘pregnant’ and set to ‘give birth’ to 83 digital offspring.

One phone call leads to $100 billion deal

OpenAI's Diversification Strategy Continues





A single news report about OpenAI testing Google 's AI chips sent Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang scrambling to his phone in June, triggering a call to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman that would reshape their partnership and culminate in one of the tech industry's largest infrastructure deals.The June 27 article by The Information, reporting that OpenAI had begun renting Google's tensor processing units (TPUs) to power ChatGPT, caused ""something of a stir"" inside Nvidia's Santa Clara headquarters, according to The Wall Street Journal. Huang immediately reached out to Altman, asking if the report was true and signaling his willingness to revive stalled partnership negotiations.The urgency of Huang's response reflected the high stakes involved. OpenAI is Nvidia's most prominent AI customer, and the prospect of losing ground to Google represented a significant competitive threat. During the call, Huang realized that Nvidia could strengthen its position by making a direct investment in OpenAI, a person who spoke to him told the Journal.OpenAI quickly moved to clarify its position. A spokesperson said the company had no active plans to use Google's TPUs at scale, though it acknowledged early testing with the chips.Nvidia's official X account then amplified an article in which OpenAI denied plans to deploy Google's in-house chip.The conversation catalyzed negotiations that had previously stalled, ultimately producing a landmark $100 billion agreement announced in September. The deal commits Nvidia to investing progressively in OpenAI as the AI startup deploys at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems—representing up to 5 million GPUs—for next-generation infrastructure. By current standards, the chip lease arrangement could cost OpenAI $350 billion, the Journal calculated.The partnership includes an special provision previously unreported: Nvidia is discussing guaranteeing loans OpenAI plans to secure for building its own data centers. This arrangement could saddle the chip giant with billions in debt obligations if OpenAI fails to repay, according to the Financial Times.Despite the Nvidia deal, OpenAI has continued pursuing its multi-supplier strategy. The startup announced a 6-gigawatt partnership with AMD in October, with AMD offering warrants for up to 10 percent of its stock as incentive. OpenAI also unveiled a 10-gigawatt deal with Broadcom for custom chip development, matching Nvidia's commitment.Meanwhile, the Google TPU report ultimately proved prescient for the broader market. In late October, AI startup Anthropic—founded by former OpenAI leaders—announced a multibillion-dollar deal with Google for access to up to 1 million TPU chips, Bloomberg reported, validating Google's chip technology as a credible alternative to Nvidia's dominance.","A June report about OpenAI testing Google's AI chips sent Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang scrambling to his phone in June.

China FIRES WARNING SHOTS At Trump Before Xi Jinping Bilateral; 'You Cannot Stop...' | WATCH

What kind of AI weapons may China be developing







China's state-owned defence company Norinco introduced a military vehicle that is capable of autonomously conducting combat-support operations at 50 kilometres per hour in February. This vehicle is powered by DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence (AI) models, which are a prominent product of China's tech sector. The Chinese AI startup was also responsible for crashing the US Market in January, which reduced Nvidia’s stock price by over 14%. The Norinco P60's release was highlighted by Communist Party officials in press statements as an early showcase of how Beijing is using DeepSeek and other AI models to advance in its arms race with the US at a time when leaders in both countries have urged their militaries to prepare for conflict. Now, a recent report by the news agency Reuters cited hundreds of research papers, patents, and procurement records to offer a glimpse into Beijing's systematic effort to harness AI for military advantage.However, specifics on how the systems behind China's next-generation weapons operate and the extent to which they have been deployed are state secrets. Still, procurement records and patents seen by Reuters offer clues into Beijing's progress toward capabilities such as autonomous target recognition and real-time battlefield decision support, in ways that mirror US efforts.The report also couldn't establish if all the products had been built, as patents don't necessarily indicate operational technology.According to documents reviewed by Reuters, China is reportedly developing AI-powered military technology, including robot dogs that scout in packs and drone swarms that autonomously track targets, as well as visually immersive command centres and advanced war-game simulations.In November 2024, the PLA issued a tender for AI-powered robot dogs that would scout together for threats and clear explosive hazards. Reuters couldn't determine whether the tender was fulfilled. Previously, China has deployed armed robot dogs from AI robotics manufacturer Unitree in military drills, according to images released in state media.The review of patents, tenders, and research papers published over the past two years shows how PLA and affiliated entities are using AI to improve military planning, including developing technology to analyse satellite and drone imagery quickly.Researchers at Landship Information Technology, a Chinese company that integrates AI systems into military vehicles, including Norinco's, said in a February white paper that its technology built on Huawei chips can rapidly identify targets from satellite imagery while coordinating with radars and aircraft to execute operations.The time it takes military planners to shift from identifying a target to executing an operation has been shortened by AI, according to Xi'an Technological University. Researchers at that institute said in a May summary of their findings that their DeepSeek-powered system could assess 10,000 battlefield scenarios in 48 seconds. Such a task would have taken a conventional team of military planners 48 hours to complete, they said. Reuters could not independently verify the researchers' claims.Chinese military entities are investing in increasingly autonomous battlefield technology, the documents suggest. Two dozen tenders and patents seen by Reuters show the military attempting to integrate AI into drones to recognise and track targets, as well as to work together in formations with little human intervention.Beihang University, known for its military aviation research, is using DeepSeek to improve drone swarm decision-making when targeting ""low, slow, small"" threats, including military-speak for drones and light aircraft, according to a patent filing this year.Chinese defence leaders have publicly committed to maintaining human control over weapons systems amid growing concern that a conflict between Beijing and Washington could lead to the unchecked deployment of AI-powered munitions.The US military also plans to deploy thousands of autonomous drones by the end of 2025 to counter China’s growing drone capabilities. Meanwhile, Chinese defence firms, such as Shanxi 100 Trust Information Technology, are increasingly using domestic components, such as Huawei’s Ascend chips, to power AI systems.However, Nvidia hardware remains widely referenced in Chinese military-linked research. A Reuters review found 35 patent filings from institutions tied to the People’s Liberation Army citing Nvidia’s A100 chips, while 15 patents referenced Huawei’s Ascend chips as alternatives.Despite US export restrictions, Chinese researchers acknowledge continued reliance on Nvidia technology and ongoing efforts to close the AI gap, the report adds.","Chinese military entities are investing in increasingly autonomous battlefield technology, the documents suggest.

Teen scientist aims to keep device affordable for families





A 13-year-old California eighth grader has won the title of ""America's Top Young Scientist"" and $25,000 for developing FallGuard, a camera-based fall detection system designed to protect elderly adults. Kevin Tang created the device after his grandmother suffered a fall at home five years ago that left her with permanent brain damage. Unlike traditional wearable devices from Life Alert and similar brands, FallGuard uses strategically placed cameras connected to a small computer that monitors seniors throughout their homes. Tang programmed an algorithm that identifies falls and immediately alerts caregivers, USA TODAY reported.The system uses artificial intelligence algorithms to detect shoulder positions and elbow joints, then applies Tang's custom algorithm to determine when someone has fallen. According to Tang's mentor Mark Gilbertson from the 3M Young Scientist Challenge, the device functions continuously, including at nighttime—a critical feature the teen developed during his mentorship.The subscription-free system costs approximately $90 in materials to produce, though Tang aims to reduce costs to $30.He was inspired to create FallGuard after witnessing how his friend's grandfather fell while his smartwatch was uncharged, leaving him undetected until the following day.Falls represent the leading cause of injury for adults 65 and older, with more than 14 million older adults reporting falls annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These incidents result in roughly 1 million hospitalisations each year.Tang's father, Yang Tang, told USA TODAY that his son is ""always inventing and making strange stuff at home."" The family now uses FallGuard in their Southern California home, and another family has already installed the system. More than 10 families remain on a waiting list, while at least one security camera company has expressed interest in the technology.","Kevin Tang, 13, won the title of ""America's Top Young Scientist"" and $25,000 for developing FallGuard, a camera-based fall detection system.

When your agent can’t keep up with you

The browser that remembers everything





So... should you switch?

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





When OpenAI dropped ChatGPT Atlas last week, tech bros lost their collective minds. A browser built around ChatGPT? From the company that's been inserting AI into everything from search to shopping carts? I had to try it. So I did something mildly reckless: made it my default browser for seven straight days to see if it could dethrone Chrome, my browser of choice since 2008.The short version? It's fine. The long version? Well, keep reading.For the 20 minutes that OpenAI took talking up Atlas, they conveniently never mentioned that their ""revolutionary"" browser runs on technology developed and maintained by... Google.The irony is almost too perfect.Atlas is Chromium under the hood. Same engine that powers Chrome, Edge, Brave, and about a dozen other browsers you've probably tried and abandoned. This means Atlas isn't so much a revolutionary new browser as it is Chrome wearing a ChatGPT badge.But I don't see this as a bad thing. Instead, it's at least good for the users that OpenAI would desperately want. Everything transfers over smoothly — bookmarks, passwords, your embarrassing collection of shopping tabs.Even your Chrome extensions work without a hitch.The interface is clean, almost aggressively minimal, with a search bar that defaults to ChatGPT instead of Google. Type something in, and you get an AI-generated answer with some links sprinkled underneath rather than the traditional wall of search results. There's also a web search page that strips away the AI commentary and just shows you the raw links ChatGPT pulled from.If you're not feeling the AI-generated answers, you can always fall back to Google. Except, plot twist: Google's also shoving Gemini-powered results down your throat now. So really, you're just picking which AI overlord gets to summarize the internet for you.It's slick, sure. But it's not exactly groundbreaking. Perplexity's Comet does this. Opera Neon does this. Arc does this with arguably more flair. Atlas feels like OpenAI showing up late to a party everyone else has been at for months, holding a bottle of wine and acting like they invented the concept of bringing gifts.The sidebar ChatGPT button is admittedly handy. Click it on any page, and you can ask questions about what you're reading, get summaries, or dig up related info without tab-hopping. But honestly? I've been doing this for months by keeping ChatGPT open in a pinned tab. The integration is smoother in Atlas, I'll give them that, but it's an incremental improvement at best.The headline feature everyone's buzzing about is agentic mode — Atlas's attempt at becoming your digital personal assistant. Book reservations! Fill shopping carts! Handle your boring tasks while you sip coffee and feel like you're living in the future!Reality check: it's a mess.I asked Atlas to stock my Amazon cart based on my recent browsing. Simple enough, right? Wrong. It took a full ten minutes to add three items. Ten minutes. I watched it navigate Amazon's interface like a confused tourist asking for directions, at one point literally narrating to itself: ""It appears I opened a new tab, but it's still showing 'about:blank,' which means the page hasn't fully loaded. I'll give it time.""But, I don't have time.For comparison, Perplexity's Comet knocked out the same task in two minutes. Not lightning-fast, but at least it didn't make me feel like I was supervising a particularly slow intern.I asked it to fill out a visa application form with details from my passport and other documents. Atlas spent three minutes clicking through fields, narrating its progress like a sports commentator. When I checked the form, exactly two fields were filled—and one of them was wrong.When it worked (sending emails, creating calendar events), it was genuinely quick, wrapping things up in under 30 seconds. But the hit rate is too inconsistent to trust it with anything important. Right now, agentic mode feels less like having an assistant and more like playing Russian roulette with your to-do list.Atlas comes with ""browser memories,"" a feature that learns your habits and preferences to personalise your experience. Sounds useful until you realise it means your browser is essentially maintaining a detailed psychological profile of your internet behaviour.It works, I'll admit. After a few days, Atlas started surfacing eerily relevant suggestions and tailoring search results to my preferences. But there's something deeply weird about a browser that doesn't just track where you've been, but understands why you were there and what you were thinking.The privacy settings let you opt out, but they're tucked away in submenus like OpenAI is hoping you won't find them. They promise not to use your data for training models unless you consent, which is reassuring in theory. In practice, it still feels like inviting a very smart stranger to read your diary every night.After my week-long experiment, I'm back on Chrome. Not because Atlas is bad—it's actually impressively polished for a first release. But because it doesn't give me a compelling reason to jump ship. The AI features are nice extras, not game-changers. The agent is too unreliable. And at its core, this is just Chrome with ChatGPT duct-taped on.OpenAI has teased a pipeline of updates: user profiles, tab groups, ad blockers, faster agent responses, better sidebar features. If they deliver on even half of those promises, Atlas could become genuinely competitive. But that's a big if, and right now we're dealing with what exists, not what's been promised.Chrome won the browser wars because it was faster and simpler than everything else. Atlas needs to prove it's not just different, but better. And that proof hasn't materialised yet.For now, Atlas is an intriguing experiment worth keeping an eye on. Like every other AI browser out there on the internet. So, my word of wisdom—to me and to you—would be: just maybe don't uninstall Chrome quite yet.","Atlas is Chromium under the hood.

Employees must use the LLM as a starting point for reviews.

Employees are ultimately responsible for the final content submitted.

The tool is not to be used for compensation decisions.





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly allowing its more than 300,000 employees to use the bank’s internal artificial intelligence (AI) system to help draft year-end performance reviews. The US bank has made its in-house large language model (LLM) available to staff to generate initial review text based on prompts they provide, Financial Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The report said that this will offer a shortcut to the often time-consuming process of writing detailed performance assessments. JPMorgan, the largest US bank by assets, has issued clear guidance on the new tool's usage:The new feature is part of the bank's wider internal AI platform, called LLM Suite, which is its own version of a secure, internal chatbot akin to OpenAI's ChatGPT.JPMorgan launched LLM Suite last year and has since ""onboarded"" 200,000 users, making it one of the largest AI deployments on Wall Street. The system was developed in-house to provide secure access to third-party AI systems and is already used by the bank's legal teams to review contracts, by software developers to review code, and by investment bankers for preparing presentations.JPMorgan's move follows a similar adoption by consultancies; Boston Consulting Group (BCG) recently reported that employees using AI tools to help draft reviews cut their writing time by 40%.Recently, BCG Global Chief Al Ethics Officer Steven Mills said that the key to unlocking Al's workplace potential lies in hands-on employee training – something most companies are failing to provide.

Read TCS clarification on M&S cyber attack

In response to the article published by ‘The Telegraph’ Newspaper in the UK on October 26, 2025, titled “M&S ousts Indian outsourcer accused of £300m cyberattack failures”, a statement of the Company is given below:

“The report published by The Telegraph is misleading, with factual inaccuracies including the size of the contract and the continuity of TCS’ work for Marks & Spencer (M&S). As both M&S and TCS have clarified, the service desk contract with M&S followed a regular competitive RFP process initiated in January 2025, with M&S opting to proceed with other partners much prior to the cyber incident in April 2025. These matters are hence clearly Unrelated.

The commercial aspect of the service desk area also represents an insignificant part of TCS’ overall engagement with M&S. TCS continues to work on numerous other areas, in its role as a strategic partner for M&S and is proud of this longstanding partnership.

On the Cyber incident itself, as clarified previously, TCS had conducted a scan of its own networks and systems and been able to conclude that the vulnerabilities have not originated from there. TCS does not provide cyber security services to M&S. This is a service that is provided by another partner.”

The attack disrupted M&S online shopping with customers reporting glitches in M&S stores. Specifically, contactless card payments and “Click & Collect” order pickups were hit due to the attack.According to reports in early June, M&S CEO Stuart Machin received an email from hacking group DragonForce using an employee email account. The email confirmed that M&S was hacked by the ransomware group, who allegedly encrypted all the company’s servers.The ransomware group used a double extortion method. They first got into the system through a social engineering phone call and spent time collecting sensitive customer data. After stealing the data, they launched the DragonForce ransomware to lock the systems and demand money.As per estimates, the cyber attack hit this year's profits by around £300 million. The retailer resumed online orders after a 46-day hiatus following the cyberattack.","TCS has refuted a recent report alleging that leading British retail company Marks & Spencer (M&S) has ended contact with the IT firm over a £300 million cyberattack.

TikTok deal on table?

China FIRES WARNING SHOTS At Trump Before Xi Jinping Bilateral; 'You Cannot Stop...' | WATCH





US President Donald Trump on Monday said he may sign a final deal on TikTok with China this Thursday. He is expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea during his ongoing Asia tour.“I’ve got a lot of respect for President Xi, and I think we’re going to come away with a deal,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while traveling from Malaysia to Japan after attending the Asean summit , as reported by Reuters.The announcement comes amid growing optimism over a broader US-China trade agreement, following weekend talks in Malaysia that both sides described as “constructive.”US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said that the two countries had “reached a final deal on TikTok,” with all details now settled and ready for formal approval by the leaders.“My remit was to get the Chinese to agree to approve the transaction, and I believe we successfully accomplished that over the past two days,” Bessent told CBS’s Face the Nation.Under the proposed deal, American investors would hold a majority stake in TikTok’s US operations, while its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, would retain less than 20%.ByteDance would also license a version of the app’s algorithm to the US entity, a key step meant to address concerns about data security and Chinese influence.The arrangement is designed to comply with a 2024 US law that effectively bans TikTok unless its Chinese owner divests from American operations.The law was passed over fears that Beijing could gain access to US users’ personal data or use the platform for propaganda.Bessent said the agreement was part of wider progress on trade issues, with both sides reaching preliminary consensus on tariffs, export controls and cooperation on fentanyl trafficking.The meeting between Trump and Xi in Seoul later this week will be their first face-to-face since Trump’s return to office this year.It is expected to finalize the TikTok transaction and possibly pave the way for a broader trade deal.Trump has previously offered mixed signals on TikTok’s future, at one point saying China could determine the app’s fate.“We may let it die, or we may, I don’t know — it depends, up to China,” he said in September, before later praising the platform for helping him reach young voters during his campaign.","US President Donald Trump on Monday said he may sign a final deal on TikTok with China this Thursday.

Amazon Web Services losing ground to Google and Oracle in AI Race





Amazon's cloud unit, the Amazon Web Services, which essentially invented cloud computing, is showing troubling signs of decline as competitors surge ahead in the artificial intelligence era, according to a Bloomberg report. The cloud giant's struggles became starkly visible this week with a devastating 15-hour outage that crippled hundreds of companies and consumer applications. Days later, Google announced it would supply up to one million AI chips to Anthropic, the startup in which Amazon has invested $4 billion, delivering another blow to AWS's AI ambitions.While AWS remains the market leader with 38% of corporate cloud spending, that dominance is eroding. The company held nearly half the market as recently as 2018, and Microsoft is now growing its sales backlog faster than Amazon. Financial results expected next week are projected to show 18% growth to $32 billion, down from 19% a year earlier.Bloomberg interviewed 23 current and former AWS employees who describe a company hamstrung by internal bureaucracy at precisely the wrong moment. The pandemic-era hiring spree left some employees as many as 15 management layers away from CEO Andy Jassy , slowing decision-making when agility is critical.Three employees working on separate AI initiatives told Bloomberg they spent so long rewriting pitches that the market moved on, rendering their ideas obsolete. Meanwhile, senior talent has fled amid an industrywide battle for AI expertise, including executives leading chip design, startup sales, and core AI development.The company's cultural reluctance to pay for outside technology proved costly. When Anthropic approached Amazon for investment before ChatGPT's November 2022 debut, executives hesitated, unconvinced the startup could monetize the emerging technology. Anthropic subsequently partnered with Google, forcing Amazon to later invest $4 billion at what veterans described as tech industry prices the company typically loathes paying.AWS's traditional startup breeding ground is shifting. Google has successfully courted leading AI startups with better support and cutting-edge models, while Oracle has secured multi-billion-dollar deals to host AI development work. Corporate technology buyers now routinely ask advisors about Google, Oracle, and newcomers like CoreWeave, not just the Amazon-Microsoft duopoly.Even loyal AWS customers are hedging their bets. Grammarly relies on AWS for core operations but uses OpenAI and Meta models for AI features, finding Amazon's Bedrock marketplace insufficient. Data security firm Druva, which built its business selling to AWS customers, announced a Microsoft partnership earlier this year.Amazon is racing to catch up, reorganizing teams, swapping leadership, and abandoning some product development rules to speed launches. The company is building an $11 billion Indiana data center complex for Anthropic, hoping its Trainium2 chips can validate its AI strategy.But the last week's Google-Anthropic deal underscores the new reality: the company that once blindsided incumbents is now in a dogfight with rivals it previously dominated.","Amazon Web Services, which essentially invented cloud computing, is showing troubling signs of decline.

AI is the future and its important to adapt to the same. Over the last few months CEOs of both big and small technology and non-technology companies have a message for students to brace for AI. Other than the biggest fear of replacing jobs, the technology is set to change the way we work. Weighing on the topic in a conversation with Business Insider, Google's former employee Jad Tarifi told students to guard against the AI hype. In the current cutthroat race for AI talent, tech giants like Facebook-parent Meta are offering bonuses worth hundreds of millions to attract top talent. However, Jad Tarifi, an early member of Google's first generative AI team, Google’s first generative AI team, advises against chasing the AI boom through lengthy doctoral programs. “AI itself is going to be gone by the time you finish a PhD,” Tarifi told Business Insider.“Even things like applying AI to robotics will be solved by then. So either get into something niche like AI for biology, which is still in its very early stages, or just don’t get into anything at all.” Tarifi, 42, who earned his Ph.D. in AI from the University of Florida in 2012, joined Google that same year and spent nearly a decade with the company before founding his AI startup, Integral AI, in 2021.He described doctoral studies as an “ordeal” suited only for those deeply passionate about their field, noting that it demands “five years of your life and a lot of pain. ”“I don’t think anyone should ever do a Ph.D. unless they are obsessed with the field,” Tarifi said. He added that with today’s rapid technological advancements, real-world experience often trumps academic pursuits. “If you are unsure, you should definitely default to ‘no,’ and focus on just living in the world. You’ll move much faster. You’ll learn a lot more. You’ll be more adaptive to how things are changed.”Tarifi also emphasized the importance of soft skills in the AI era, particularly emotional intelligence and empathy. He believes that while technical skills can be learned, excelling in AI applications, such as effective prompting, requires “emotional attunement” and “good taste.” “The best thing to work on is more internal,” Tarifi advised. “Meditate. Socialize with your friends. Get to know yourself emotionally. ”His insights challenge the rush to capitalize on AI’s popularity, urging aspiring professionals to focus on niche domains or personal growth to stay competitive in a fast-evolving industry.","Jad Tarifi, an early member of Google's first generative AI team, advises against chasing the AI boom through lengthy doctoral programs. “AI itself is going to be gone by the time you finish a PhD,” Tarifi told Business Insider.

The company also confirmed that no personal data is collected if users choose to enable it.In what can be called a departure from its previous minimalist software approach, Nothing has said it will now start including a curated set of third-party apps on some non-flagship devices.Evangelidis said that the apps are chosen carefully based on popularity and relevance, citing examples like Instagram. He noted that some integrations are intended to enhance device functionality, such as camera performance or content sharing.“We operate on razor-thin margins and must make deliberate choices to deliver a high-quality user experience while remaining financially sustainable,” the executive said.

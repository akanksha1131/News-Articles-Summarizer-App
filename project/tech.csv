Poll Do You Prefer QCommerce Over Traditional E-Commerce for Fast Deliveries? No Yes

Zepto is not an “Amazon or Walmart”

Zepto CEO Aadit Palicha said that Zepto is not an “Amazon or Walmart” but an Indian company.

""Second biggest Qcommerce company"" in India

All set for the Big IPO

Quick commerce company Zepto is reportedly accelerating its plans for an initial public offering (IPO), aiming to file draft papers by March or April this year. This follows securing approval from Singapore for its domicile transfer to India, a key step required for the process. According to a report in Economic Times, ""A crucial hearing is slated on January 17 at the NCLT on its reverse merger application to move domicile from Singapore to India. The Singapore clearance is a significant approval to secure as part of moving domicile to India.A board meeting is also eportedly planned for January 19 to discuss the IPO's size, appoint bankers, and address other resolutions related to the holding company's relocation. Zepto is also finalizing the appointment of independent board members in preparation for going public. This IPO would make Zepto the third major quick commerce player to list in India, after Zomato and Swiggy.In an interview with Economic Times recently,Zepto's focus on domestic ownership is said to be driven by a desire to build trust with policymakers in the country, the public, and shareholders. This move also reportedly aligns with the Indian government's increasing scrutiny of foreign-owned quick-commerce companies and their operations in India.Founded by Stanford University dropouts Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, Zepto has emerged as one of the fastest-growing consumer internet firms in India. According to a recent report by Motilal Oswal, Zepto is the second largest player in the sector with a 29% share in the quarter ended June 30, after Blinkit which had a 46% share. The report – which did not include Tata Group BigBasket and Flipkart Minutes – pegged Swiggy Instamart’s market share at 24%.As previously reported by the ET, Zepto has been in discussions with bankers regarding a potential mid-2025 IPO, initially aiming to raise at least $450 million. This target may be adjusted closer to the draft filing. Sources indicate Zepto is heavily engaged in the IPO process, with the upcoming board meeting focusing on these plans. The reverse merger approval and the subsequent transition to a public limited company are necessary steps before filing for the IPO. ET also reported that Wall Street banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are among those vying for roles in Zepto's IPO.Following a $350 million funding round in November, Zepto's cash reserves stand at approximately $1.4 billion, positioning it to compete with rivals and new entrants like Flipkart Minutes. CEO Aadit Palicha confirmed the company's full compliance with Indian foreign direct investment (FDI) regulations and emphasized their move towards local ownership. In approximately six months, the company raised over $1 billion.","Zepto is reportedly accelerating its plans for an initial public offering (IPO) This follows securing approval from Singapore for its domicile transfer to India.

""The United States currently has multiple advantages. American companies currently have better technology, from chips to AI models to software applications. In addition, many US companies, including Microsoft, have invested heavily in building AI that is more trustworthy than most products from China. We are designing AI technology that protects cybersecurity, privacy, digital safety, and other responsible uses of AI.""

American products are more trusted than their Chinese counterparts, and our private sector is unmatched in its ability to invest in infrastructure around the world.

Microsoft has offered the US a roadmap to win AI race vs China. In a blog post, Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote that the United States needs an overarching national strategy to ensure it prevails in the global AI race -- focusing on R&D funding at universities, education, and workforce development, and ensuring that American tech companies aren’t slowed down by ""heavy-handed regulations"". The blog post comes just days ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s second term.The post focuses in part on the competitive threat posed by China in artificial intelligence as well as looks to underscore Microsoft’s role in advancing AI development. China and the United States are racing to spread their AI systems to other countries in an effort to become the de facto standard, according to Smith.The blog post titled 'The Golden Opportunity for American AI' has also been shared by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.China has started offering developing countries subsidized access to scarce computer chips and help building local AI datacenters, according to Smith. ""The Chinese wisely recognize that if a country standardizes on China's AI platform, it likely will continue to rely on that platform in the future,"" Smith said.He said that US has several advantages,""Given the nature of technology markets and their potential network effects, this race between the US and China for international influence likely will be won by the fastest first mover,"" Smith reasoned. ""The best response for the United States is not to complain about the competition but to ensure we win the race ahead. This will require that we move quickly and effectively to promote American AI as a superior alternative. And it will need the involvement and support of American allies and friends.""Hence, the United States needs a smart international strategy to rapidly support American AI around the world.""While summing up he further stressed on American products being more trustworthy than Chinese, ""Finally, the United States is in a strong position to win the essential race with China by advancing international adoption of American AI.With a balanced and common-sense approach to export control policy, the United States can solidify the diplomatic relations that will be critical to global AI adoption,"" he wrote.","Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote a blog post titled 'The Golden Opportunity for American AI' The post focuses in part on the competitive threat posed by China in artificial intelligence.

Poll What is the Most Important Factor When Making Public Statements? Sensitivity to Audience Clarity and Transparency

Allstate faced significant backlash after a video message from CEO Tom Wilson, played before the Sugar Bowl, was perceived as insensitive in the wake of a terrorist attack on Bourbon Street in New Orleans on January 1. In the video, CEO Wilson urged Americans to overcome an ""addiction to divisiveness"" and ""accept people's imperfections and differences,"" promoting Allstate's community work. This message was met with online condemnation, with many customers threatening boycotts, deeming it ""tone-deaf"" given the recent tragedy.The company has since deleted the video from its social media channels following the criticism. OutKick’s Zach Dean was the first to post that Allstate CEO's message video has been deleted. Social media users slammed Allstate CEO's video message on posts of Zach Dean, FoxDigital and other users who shared the same.""Internet never forgets,"" said a user sharing the videoZach Dean shared the now deleted post with the caption ""Incredible""Replying to Zach Deans' post several users called for boycott of the brand and one user went to the extent of saying that maybe the brand should change their name to Allahstate, ""Maybe they'll rebrand as Allahstate.""The attack, which occurred in the early hours of New Year's Day, resulted in 14 deaths and dozens of injuries. Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a U.S. Army veteran, drove a pickup truck displaying an ISIS flag into a crowd on Bourbon Street. The FBI investigated the incident as an act of terrorism, discovering potential improvised explosive devices. Jabbar was killed in a shootout with police.In response to the online backlash, Allstate issued a statement to Fox News Digital, clarifying that Wilson ""unequivocally condemns this heinous act of terrorism and violence in all forms."" The statement emphasized the company's support for the victims, their families, and the New Orleans community, explaining that the message about overcoming divisiveness was intended as a broader commitment to fostering trust and positivity.","The company has since deleted the video from its social media channels following the criticism.

""A Significant Data Fiduciary shall observe due diligence to verify that algorithmic software deployed by it for hosting, display, uploading, modification, publishing, transmission, storage, updating or sharing of personal data processed by it are not likely to pose a risk to the rights of Data Principals.""

Rule 12(4):

""A Significant Data Fiduciary shall undertake measures to ensure that personal data specified by the Central Government on the basis of the recommendations of a committee constituted by it is processed subject to the restriction that the personal data and the traffic data pertaining to its flow is not transferred outside the territory of India"".

Graded punishments:

Implications for tech companies

The government has released the draft Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act for public consultation and feedback (open until February 18). These rules, which will be tabled in the monsoon session of Parliament, have significant implications for both users and tech companies operating in India.According to IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw (via news agency PTI), the rules aim to strike a balance between safeguarding user rights and fostering innovation in the digital space.""Rules have to be within four walls of the Act. It is within the ambit of the Act passed by Parliament. These rules have been framed to ensure a balance between regulation and innovation while completely safeguarding the rights of citizens,"" Vaishnaw said.Vaishnaw emphasised that the rules prioritise user privacy, particularly for children, while allowing for flexibility and innovation.The rules mandate enhanced child protection with social media platforms – like Facebook, Instagram and others – require verifiable parental consent before allowing children under 18 years of age to create accounts online. This includes validating the parent's identity and age.Secondly, Big Tech platforms – including Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft – must ensure their algorithms do not pose risks to users' rights. Additionally, the government can specify certain types of personal data that cannot be transferred outside India.In case the rules are flouted, there is a provision for graded punishments. Penalties for data breaches will vary based on the severity and the size of the company involved, offering some protection to smaller businesses.“We have also kept graded punishments to protect the interests of micro, small and medium enterprises. It is to save businesses who may be running their business using a single computer. However, Big Techs have higher obligations under the rules. Minor breaches will attract small penalties and big breaches will lead to higher penalties,” Vaishnaw said.Tech companies, specifically the Big Tech, will face additional obligations. Apart from algorithmic transparency, they will be required to conduct and submit reports on data protection impact assessments and audits to the Data Protection Board.","The government has released the draft Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act for public consultation and feedback (open until February 18) The rules have significant implications for both users and tech companies operating in India.

However, the San Francisco Chief Medical Examiner's Office determined Balaji's death a suicide. Balaji worked at OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT .In her post, Balaji’s mother - Poornima Rao expressed her worries and stated that “private autopsy doesn’t confirm cause of death stated by police.” She called for intervention from US authorities, stating that an FBI investigation is necessary to address the matter. Other than Elon Musk, she tagged American biotech entrepreneur and politician Vivek Ramaswamy and Gavin Newsom – Governor of California.The post has since gained attention, sparking a wave of responses on social media. It caught Musk’s attention as well who replied saying “This doesn’t seem like a suicide”.Suchir Balaji's mother further pleads saying “@elonmusk please support us”.In an interview with Business Insider last week, Rao revealed that Balaji had grown increasingly disillusioned with artificial intelligence (AI), particularly OpenAI’s shift toward commercialization with ChatGPT. She said, “He felt AI is a harm to humanity,” describing how her son, Suchir Balaji, transitioned from boundless optimism about AI’s potential to profound skepticism.

As the match ended, cricket memes went viral on social media platforms. Here are some of the viral memes that just capture the emotion/sadness of Indian Cricket fans.

Record number of spectators

Australia clinched a thrilling 184-run victory over India in a dramatic final session of the fourth Test in Melbourne, taking a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. India, needing 340 to win, collapsed to 155 all out, losing their last seven wickets for just 34 runs in 20.3 overs. India appeared to be heading for a draw after Yashasvi Jaiswal (84) and Rishabh Pant (30) steered them to 112-3 at tea. However, Pant's dismissal, attempting a six off Travis Head, triggered a batting collapse.Controversy arose with Jaiswal's dismissal. Initially given not out to a caught-behind appeal, the TV umpire overturned the decision based on visual evidence of the ball changing direction, despite the absence of audible noise. Jasprit Bumrah was exceptional for India, taking 5-57 in the second innings and nine wickets in the match. He had reduced Australia to 91-6 at one stage, a lead of less than 200.The match set a record attendance for cricket in Australia, with 373,591 spectators. Head described the atmosphere as inspiring and hailed the match as one of the best he has been involved in. India now needs to win the final Test in Sydney to level the series and retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .","Australia beat India by 184 runs in the fourth Test in Melbourne.

Planning a New Year's Eve party at an Airbnb? Think again. The company is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season. This technology uses machine learning to identify and block risky bookings, focusing on factors like trip length, booking timing, and distance from the guest's location. While implemented worldwide, the technology will specifically target the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Puerto Rico, Spain and New Zealand. Last New Year's Eve, Airbnb blocked 74,000 such bookings.High-risk bookings will be blocked or redirected to alternative accommodations. Short holiday getaways (one to three nights) in entire homes will also be restricted, and guests booking entire homes will be required to agree to a ""mandatory anti-party attestation."" ""If a booking is identified as higher risk, the guest will either be blocked from booking, or redirected to alternative accommodations on the platform,"" the company said.Guests will also be required to accept mandatory anti-party attestation. ""Guests who can make reservations will need to confirm that they understand that disruptive and unauthorized parties are not allowed on Airbnb, and they face suspension or removal from the platform if they violate this policy,"" said the company.Airbnb also has a 'Neighborhood Support Line' for local communities to report urgent issues, like a party in progress, at a home they believe is listed on Airbnb.Airbnb's efforts to curb disruptive parties started in 2019 with a ban on ""party houses,"" followed by stricter measures in 2020 due to the pandemic. In 2022, the company permanently banned large parties worldwide following several violent incidents at Airbnb rentals, including a shooting in Pittsburgh that resulted in two deaths and eight injuries.","Airbnb is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season.

The case centers around the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which mandates that TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, must sell its U.S. operations or face a nationwide ban.TikTok and ByteDance argue that the law violates the First Amendment rights of the app's users by restricting access to a platform used by 170 million Americans. They contend that the government's national security concerns do not justify the sweeping ban, which they claim would set a dangerous precedent for free speech.On the other hand, the Biden administration maintains that the law targets the national security risk posed by China's potential control over TikTok, rather than free speech. The administration urges the Supreme Court to allow the law to take effect, emphasising the importance of protecting American data from foreign adversaries.The Supreme Court's decision will have significant implications for the future of TikTok in the United States and could influence how the government regulates other foreign-owned tech companies. The outcome of this case will be closely watched by tech companies, free speech advocates, and policymakers alike.","The case centers around the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.

Google has announced that it has paid Can$100 million (approximately US$69 million) to Canadian news outlets to use their content on its platform. This move is part of a deal with the Canadian government to offset the loss of advertising revenues experienced by traditional news organizations.The payment was made to the Canadian Journalism Collective , a non-profit organization established to distribute the funds to media businesses whose content is shared or repurposed by Google. The funds are expected to provide a much-needed boost to newsrooms, enabling them to produce high-quality coverage of democratic institutions.Canada passed the Online News Act in 2023, which requires tech platforms like Google and Meta to compensate struggling news publishers. While Meta chose to block news content on Facebook and Instagram to avoid paying, Google opted to make the payment and continue using the content.Paul Deegan, president of News Media Canada, praised the deal, stating that it is ""far superior"" to similar arrangements in other jurisdictions. He added that the funding will help newsrooms produce more high-quality journalism, benefiting both the media organizations and Google, which relies on fact-checked content.The deal, approved by Canada's broadcast regulator in October 2024, stipulates that broadcasters will receive 30% of the funds, with the remainder being shared among news publishers. Google has also indicated that it plans to make another payment at the end of 2025.This landmark agreement aims to support the local news sector, which has seen a significant decline in advertising revenues and the closure of hundreds of publications over the past decade. By compensating news organizations, Google hopes to contribute to the sustainability of high-quality journalism in Canada.","Google has paid Can$100 million (approximately US$69 million) to Canadian news outlets to use their content on its platform.

The success of Chinese companies in global markets may be driven more by domestic obstacles than strategic advantage, according to Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu , who points to surprising internal trade barriers within China's economy.""Chinese companies have overcome so many challenges, from corruption to red tape,"" Vembu wrote on X (formerly Twitter), citing protectionist barriers between Chinese regions as evidence that exports may serve as a ""survival tactic"" rather than a sign of strength for Chinese businesses. “That is a source of inspiration for me; whenever I am tempted to complain, I think about Chinese entrepreneurs ,” he further added.This perspective adds nuance to Vembu's previous calls for India to emulate China's technological and industrial rise. In an earlier post, he emphasized the need for Indian companies to focus on building sustainable $100 billion revenue businesses rather than chasing valuations, pointing to China's success in nurturing major tech companies over the past two decades.Zoho CEO has consistently advocated for India to learn from China's development model while maintaining a pragmatic view of the challenges involved. In June 2024, he noted China's remarkable progress in research output and industrial capabilities, arguing that India shouldn't wait for perfect conditions to pursue technological advancement.""China didn't end pervasive corruption or become a democracy before she rose as a technological power,"" Vembu had observed, in a post earlier, encouraging Indian entrepreneurs to maintain optimism despite structural challenges.Vembu's latest observations suggest that Chinese entrepreneurs' success in finding workarounds to domestic barriers could serve as a model for Indian businesses facing their own market challenges, reinforcing his message about building resilient companies focused on long-term growth.","Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu points to surprising internal trade barriers within China's economy.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has donated 268,000 Tesla shares worth almost $112 million to charity, according to a regulatory filing on December 30. This isn't the first time Musk has made large charitable donations. In 2022, he donated $1.95 billion worth of Tesla shares to charity in several transactions between August and December. In 2021, he gave away $5.7 billion worth of Tesla shares, which was later revealed to have gone to his own foundation.Despite this donation, Musk, the world’s richest person with a net worth of over $415 billion (according to Bloomberg), still owns close to 411 million Tesla shares through a trust he set up in 2003. As of last year, Musk held about 13% of Tesla’s total shares, according to a company report from 2024.Musk, who also leads companies like SpaceX and the social media platform X, was previously awarded 304 million Tesla stock options in 2018. However, this compensation package was twice rejected by a court in Delaware and is currently being contested by Tesla shareholders.Last year in December, a Delaware judge once again rejected Elon Musk's record-breaking compensation package at Tesla.

Shein is the world’s most visited fashion and apparel website

Set to beat Zara in France; Amazon's headache in the US

Shein's India entry

After a four-and-a-half-year ban, Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein is making a comeback in India through a partnership with Reliance Retail . The Shein app was blocked on June 29, 2020, along with 200 other Chinese apps by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).The initial re-entry involves a backend test launch on Reliance's fashion website, Ajio.com, focusing on casual westernwear and more. While the rollout may eventually extend to other Reliance platforms, no clear launch timeline has been announced as yet. This move positions Shein, now based in Singapore, to compete with established players like Tata's Zudio and Flipkart's Myntra in the affordable fast-fashion segment. Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd. formalized its partnership with Shein last year to facilitate this return.In September 2024, Shein reportedly became the world’s most visited fashion and apparel website, according to data from Similarweb. With a global web traffic share of 2.68% for the third quarter of 2024, Shein outpaced other major brands like Nike, H&M, and Zara, which ranked second to fourth, respectively.Shein’s user base too has seen a significant rise. Data from Earnest shows that Shein website's transaction-making users in August surged nearly 40% compared to January, marking it the fastest-growing international platform, followed closely by TikTok.Amazon recently launched a low-cost online storefront featuring electronics, apparel and other products priced under $20, to compete with discount retailers that have increasingly encroached on the e-commerce giant’s turf -- and their names are China's Shein and Temu. Shein’s core customers in the US are young women enticed by the low-cost apparel sold on the site, and Amazon is now aiming to target them.As per French consumer publication LSA, Shein’s 2023 annual sales in France surpassed H&M, Primark, and Kiabi, positioning it as the country’s second-largest fashion brand, second after Zara, owned by Spain’s Inditex Group. Though numbers are still to come, in the final quarter of 2024, Shein’s French sales are speculated to have exceeded Zara’s.This re-entry strategy involves a technology agreement between Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd. and Roadget Business Pte Ltd. to develop a local e-commerce platform. This platform aims to establish a network of Indian manufacturers and suppliers to produce and sell products under the Shein brand.Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal confirmed that Shein's Indian retail platform will be hosted on domestic infrastructure, ensuring data security and preventing Shein from accessing or controlling it. The Ministry of Textiles, in consultation with other relevant ministries, has also approved Reliance Retail's proposal.","Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein is making a comeback in India through a partnership with Reliance Retail.

To this Elon Musk replied with an affirmative ""Yes"".Recently, Musk was also spotted werning a T-Shirt that said: 'Occupy Mars'. This photo too was shared by DogeDesigner on Twitter.Elon Musk envisions a future where Mars isn't just a planet, but a ""New World,"" echoing the historical naming of the Americas. This idea, shared on X (formerly Twitter) alongside a NASA image of Mars' Gale Crater, is just one piece of his larger ambition to establish a self-sustaining human civilization on the Red Planet.Musk's drive to colonize Mars stems from his belief that it's crucial for the long-term survival of human consciousness. He considers Earth fragile and sees Mars as a vital backup plan against potential catastrophes. ""Earth is great, but it’s fragile. We need a backup,"" he explained, emphasizing the need for a future beyond Earth's limitations. SpaceX 's Starship rocket is central to this vision. Designed for reusability and capable of carrying 100 passengers and vital cargo, Starship is intended to make interplanetary travel affordable. Musk outlined plans for five uncrewed Mars missions over the next two years. These missions will deliver essential resources like water, oxygen, fuel, and construction equipment.Musk believes ""Starship will make life multi-planetary, preserving life as we know it from extinction events on Earth."" He anticipates the first crewed mission could launch in the early 2030s.

The CCI's decision follows its preliminary report in July 2024 that accused Apple of abusing its market position.While potential fines remain unclear, the CCI is likely to require Apple to allow third-party payment systems on its App Store, similar to requirements it previously imposed on Google's Play Store. The regulator has already shared a confidential version of its report with Apple to prepare its defense.Apple is expected to argue that its ""insignificant"" market share of under 5% in India means it lacks a dominant position to abuse. However, the company faces increasing pressure to modify its App Store policies, having already made similar concessions in the European Union and Japan.The case hit turbulence in 2024 when Apple accused the CCI of improperly disclosing sensitive company information and demanded the investigation be closed.

Here’s how Apple Vision Pro helped in Wicked’s production



“So for Wicked we had a lot of visual effects all around the world. I could be at my house and I could have a screen that was bigger than the one we had in the screening room. And I could be talking to all the people in all the different continents and I would watch the playback and I would bring it close.”

“I could draw on the screen itself through Evercast. You can actually use a pen and use my finger and draw on where like hey, this ear looks weird on this, on the goat. It just adds new dimension, to how you see things. And as a creator, as a storyteller, everything's perspectives,”

“Steve Jobs always said that computers were a bicycle for the mind and this felt like a rocket ship for my imagination,”

Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, and his luxurious $500 million yacht, Koru, became the focal point of a dramatic episode on New Year’s Eve near St. Barts. As per reports, customs officials conducted a surprise inspection of the massive vessel while Bezos himself was absent. Instead, his fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, took center stage, drawing attention as she lounged on deck in a Versace bikini and a wide-brimmed hat. Despite the unexpected intrusion, the inspection was characterized as routine, lasting approximately three hours. This incident comes amidst a whirlwind of high-profile appearances and speculations surrounding the couple’s lavish lifestyle.The customs inspection began unexpectedly as Koru cruised the waters near St. Barts. Uniformed officers boarded the 417-foot yacht and meticulously searched the vessel under the guidance of a stewardess. Reports indicate that the search lasted approximately three hours, during which time officials methodically combed through the opulent yacht.Despite the disruption, the atmosphere aboard the yacht remained relatively calm. Sánchez appeared composed throughout the process, engaging with friends on deck. Among the notable individuals present was her ex-boyfriend, former NFL star Tony Gonzalez, who shares a son with Sánchez. Gonzalez even took a swim in the ocean while officers conducted their search.While an event of this nature might typically create tension, Sánchez’s demeanor suggested little cause for concern. Photos captured by Page Six showed her smiling for the cameras, a stewardess briefing her on the situation in a composed manner. The inspection, according to sources, was a standard procedure and posed no significant threat or issue for the vessel or its occupants.The disruption was brief, and the yacht’s opulent ambiance quickly returned as the officers wrapped up their work.The surprise inspection came on the heels of a festive holiday season for Bezos and Sánchez. The couple had recently celebrated in Aspen, Colorado, where their extravagant gatherings fueled rumors of a $600 million New Year’s Eve wedding. These speculations were promptly dismissed by Bezos himself, who took to X (formerly Twitter) to refute the claims.“This whole thing is completely false—none of this is happening,” Bezos posted. “The old adage ‘don’t believe everything you read’ is even more true today than ever. Lies can get ALL the way around the world before the truth can get its pants on.”Despite Bezos’ firm denial, their time in Aspen was far from low-profile. High-profile guests, including Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, were seen leaving Matsuhisa, a well-known sushi hotspot tied to the wedding rumors. Additionally, actor Kevin Costner and singer Jennifer Lopez were spotted mingling with attendees during the celebrations.Koru, named after a Māori word symbolising new beginnings, is one of the most expensive and luxurious yachts in the world. The 417-foot vessel boasts state-of-the-art features, including a swimming pool, a helicopter landing pad, and lavish accommodations for its passengers. The yacht’s size and splendor make it a regular feature in discussions about billionaire indulgences.The customs inspection near St. Barts highlighted not just the vessel’s prominence but also the scrutiny that often accompanies the lives of the ultra-wealthy.","Jeff Bezos' $500 million yacht, Koru, was raided by customs officials near St. Barts on New Year's Eve.

The program, backed by ""significant"" increases in ultra-long special treasury bonds, aims to revive domestic consumption amid economic headwinds.The timing couldn't be worse for Apple, which has seen its smartphone shipments in China decline for four consecutive months. Foreign brand shipments plunged 47.4% year-over-year in November to 3.04 million units, according to data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology.Meanwhile, domestic manufacturers are gaining ground. Huawei has emerged as a particularly strong challenger since its return to the premium segment in August 2023, with sales surging 42% in the third quarter of 2024. Apple briefly dropped out of China's top five smartphone vendors in the second quarter before recovering.The subsidy program, reminiscent of a 2007-2013 initiative that helped Chinese manufacturers gain market share, comes as Apple attempts to shore up sales through its own rare promotional campaign. The iPhone maker launched a four-day promotion Thursday, offering discounts up to 500 yuan ($68.50) on flagship models.""This government initiative could accelerate the ongoing shift in consumer preferences toward domestic brands,"" said Yuan Da, deputy secretary-general of the National Development and Reform Commission. The program will expand beyond personal devices to include agricultural facilities and other business equipment.Several provinces had already implemented local trade-in programs for personal devices in late 2024, but analysts expect the nationwide rollout to have a more substantial impact on market dynamics.","China will expand its trade-in subsidies to cover smartphones and other personal electronics.

What Turo has to say

An update on today’s incidents in New Orleans and Las Vegas

We are shocked and saddened by today’s horrific events, and our hearts are with the victims and their families.

Our trust and safety team is actively partnering with law enforcement authorities to share any information that could be helpful in their investigations. We do not believe that either renter had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat, and we are not currently aware of any information that indicates the two incidents are related.

Turo is dedicated to fostering a trustworthy marketplace. We remain committed to maintaining the highest standards in risk management, thanks to our world-class trust and safety technologies and teams that include experienced former law enforcement professionals.

We are devastated by these horrible incidents, and remain dedicated to helping the authorities however we can.

Turo , the popular car-sharing platform often referred to as the ""Airbnb of cars,"" is under focus after its vehicles were used in two deadly incidents: the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas explosion in the US. Authorities have confirmed that the perpetrators in both attacks obtained their vehicles through Turo. The company has also pledged its full cooperation with law enforcement in the ongoing investigations.Turo doesn’t have any specific or direct role in the incidents other than that the vehicles used in both the attacks on January 1 were rented on the app. While authorities have stated that the two incidents are unrelated, the use of Turo in both attacks has raised concerns about the platform's security measures and the potential risks associated with peer-to-peer car sharing.In New Orleans, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, the suspect who drove a Ford F-150 Lightning truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street, killing 15 and injuring 30, had rented the vehicle through Turo.Separately, in Las Vegas, a Tesla Cybertruck rented via Turo exploded outside the Trump Hotel, killing the driver and injuring seven others. The truck was reportedly loaded with fireworks and gasoline, and was also rented on Turo.Turo has expressed its condolences and confirmed its cooperation with law enforcement in both investigations. The company maintains that there was nothing in the New Orleans suspect's background check that would have flagged him as a security threat at the time of the rental.These incidents have also placed Turo under intense scrutiny, raising questions about the platform's ability to effectively screen renters and prevent its services from being exploited for malicious purposes. As investigations continue, Turo faces the challenge of addressing these concerns and reassuring users about the safety and security of its platform.","Turo is the popular car-sharing platform often referred to as the ""Airbnb of cars"" Its vehicles were used in two deadly incidents: the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas explosion.

Why was the hiker detained

Here’s what she wrote in Instagram post

Postcards from India ~ Arrested & detained in Delhi Airport... 🥺🚔🧑‍🏭

PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO TRAVEL TO INDIA WITH A GARMIN INREACH OR ANY OTHER SATELLITE COMMUNICATOR - THEY ARE ILLEGAL HERE which lead to the following events...

At around 10.30am this morning, I was passing through security at Delhi Airport with the intention of taking an internal flight to Rishikesh, I innocently placed my Garmin Inreach in the tray to go through the scanner and at that moment I was promptly pulled aside by security and told to wait... I waited and waited, wondering what on earth was going on, I was eventually told that the Garmin was illegal here and that they were handing me over to the Police, I called the Embassy whilst waiting for the Police and I await their further guidance, however, they are not able to intervene with legal proceedings... I was eventually taken to the police station where I was questioned, in a fairly friendly manner and made to sign document after document, I didnt take the 'no comment' stance, foolishly or not, it is my nature to be honest and afterall, there was absolutely no intent on my behalf... At 9pm, I was finally released from the police station on the condition that I am required to return to attend court...

I am not the only person who has fallen victim to this law, hence I felt compelled to write this post, in hope that it will save even one of you from suffering the same fate. It honestly hadnt even ocurred to me to check I was able to carry it...

@outsidemagazine only yesterday published an article about a Canadian runner who was also arrested in India in December for similar reasons and the police showed me another Garmin that they had also ceased yesterday, although that charging officer had decided not to pursue that case, I wouldnt be so lucky...

I dont know what the outcome will be at present, this all feels totally overwhelming and I guess I will just have to wait....

When Bill Gates predicted the 'demise' of Apple's most-popular gadget

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-bill-gates-predicted-the-demise-of-apples-most-popular-gadget/articleshow/116907129.cms

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates predicted the decline of the iPod long before it happened. Nearly two decades ago, when the iPod was revolutionizing music consumption and Apple was dominating the MP3 player market, Gates made a bold prediction about its future. In a 2005 interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, he stated that the iPod’s dominance would eventually fade as smartphones emerged, offering much more than just music playback. At the time, this prediction seemed unlikely, as the iPhone wouldn’t debut until 2007, and smartphones were still primarily used by business professionals.

Despite the iPod’s immense popularity, Gates foresaw a shift in consumer needs. “I don’t think the success of the iPod can last, as good as Apple is,” he then said, emphasizing that consumers would soon demand devices with broader capabilities.

Gates compared the iPod to Apple’s earlier Macintosh computers, which initially led the market but were overtaken by competitors offering more versatile solutions. Gates’ insight into the evolving tech landscape proved to be strikingly accurate, as smartphones gradually replaced single-function devices like the iPod.

Bill Gates shares ‘tip’ from his childhood for parents

Bill Gates believes that the constant distractions of smartphones and social media would have hindered his path to becoming a billionaire. In a recent blog post, Gates reflected on his childhood which was marked by significant periods of unstructured time spent reading and thinking. He believes this developed his ability to focus and delve into deep thought which was crucial to his success.

Gates referred to Jonathan Haidt’s The Anxious Generation and questioned whether the existing technology-driven environment wouldn’t have allowed him to develop these habits. He even highlighted that excessive screen time, particularly on social media, has been linked to a surge in mental health issues among teenagers which includes anxiety, depression, eating disorders, self-harm, and decreased self-esteem.

A Scottish hiker named Heather faced detention at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport on Thursday after being caught with a Garmin inReach GPS device, which is banned in India. She was en route to Rishikesh when airport security flagged the device during a routine check and handed her over to the police. This is the second such case when a foreign national has been detained for carrying a GPS device. In December 2024, a Czech national was similarly detained at Goa airport when he was found with a Garmin Edge 540 GPS device (a cyclocomputer) in his baggage.Heather took to Instagram to recount the ordeal and warn fellow travelers. ""Do not bring a Garmin inReach or any satellite communicator to India,"" she wrote, emphasizing that such devices are prohibited in the country. In a video, she described contacting her embassy for assistance, only to be informed that there was little they could do since she was now under Indian legal jurisdiction. She also alleged that during her detention, she was denied access to water.Garmin inReach GPS is a satellite communicator. The device features a built-in satellite transmitter, and was found to be in violation of the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1933. The law prohibits the possession of wireless telegraphy equipment without a valid license.","Hiker was stopped by security at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport.

“…it has become very clear that … (the investors) had the ill intention right from the very beginning of the discussion regarding selling of the company to cheat me by not giving me the promised amount and dishonestly induced me to complete all the work for sale of the company and sign the sale document…”

“...due to the pandemic situation from 2020 to 2022, the company suffered heavy losses as its activity could not run…At this juncture, when the company was running under severe financial distress, the investors, namely – Goldman Sachs Singapore and Tiger Global Singapore, who were also board members in the company, left the board so as not to sustain any personal loss of money or reputation to them,”

What Nestaway’s investors and other accused told court

Amarendra Sahu , the co-founder of the home rental platform Nestaway Technologies , has filed criminal charges against the company's investors.

Sahu, also the company's former CEO, has filed a complaint with an Economic Offences Wing in Odisha , alleging that the investors forced the sale of the Bengaluru-based company using forged documents and failed to pay him Rs 11.72 crore as promised.In the FIR , Sahu reportedly claimed:he further alleged.He accused the investors of forging documents with his signature to finalise the sale, even though he had resigned from the company's board beforehand. Sahu has also claimed that his co-founders Jitendra Jagadev (who is currently the CEO of Nestaway) and Smruti Ranjan Parida collaborated with the investors in this fraudulent deal.The investors have approached the Orissa High Court to dismiss the FIR. During a hearing on the Nestaway case last month, Justice SS Mishra of the Orissa High Court asked the investors accused of fraud to deposit Rs 11.72 crore with the investigating officer.However, the investors contested this order. They argued that Sahu, the Nestaway co-founder who filed the complaint, had previously raised similar concerns with regulatory bodies like SEBI and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.Additionally, the investors claimed that the promise of Rs 11.72 crore made to Sahu was withdrawn in February 2023, months before the company's sale in June.Aurum acquired Nestaway for Rs 90 crore, which was much lower than its previous valuation after the company's business was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The case is ongoing with the next hearing scheduled for January 9.","Nestaway co-founder Amarendra Sahu has filed criminal charges against the company's investors.

Several of VPN applications, including Cloudflare's popularapp, have been removed from app stores following government orders, marking the first major enforcement of India's 2022 VPN regulations.The Ministry of Home Affairs directed Apple and Google to pull more than half a dozen VPN apps from their respective stores, according to documents reviewed by TechCrunch. Affected services includeand, alongside Cloudflare's widely-used offering.The removals stem from the government’s 2022 cybersecurity framework, which requires VPN providers to maintain detailed customer records, including names, addresses, and IP addresses, for five years. Apple cited a ""demand"" from the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Center in its communication with affected developers, TechCrunch reported.This enforcement follows earlier resistance from major VPN providers. When the rules were announced in 2022, companies like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and SurfShark expressed strong opposition, with some removing their server infrastructure from India. While these providers continue serving Indian customers, they have ceased marketing their apps within the country.The regulations, which went into effect in mid-2022, apply to virtual private server providers, cloud services, and VPN operators, though corporate and enterprise VPNs are exempt. At the time of implementation, IT Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar stated that providers unwilling to comply with the new rules would need to exit the market.Neither the Ministry of Home Affairs nor Apple and Google, have responded to requests for comment on the recent removals.","Government orders force Apple and Google to pull VPN apps from app stores.

Nick Clegg steps down as meta chief global affairs officer to be replaced by…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nick-clegg-steps-down-as-meta-chief-global-affairs-officer-to-be-replaced-by-republican-leader-joel-kaplan/articleshow/116902846.cms,"What Nick Clegg said on his departure

“As a new year begins, I have come to the view that this is the right time for me to move on from my role as President, Global Affairs at Meta. It truly has been an adventure of a lifetime! I am proud of the work I have been able to do leading and supporting teams across the company to ensure innovation can go hand in hand with increased transparency and accountability, and with new forms of governance.

My time at the company coincided with a significant resetting of the relationship between “big tech” and the societal pressures manifested in new laws, institutions and norms affecting the sector. I hope I have played some role in seeking to bridge the very different worlds of tech and politics – worlds that will continue to interact in unpredictable ways across the globe.

I will be forever grateful to Mark and Sheryl Sandberg for taking me on in the first place – and to the many colleagues and teams I have had the good luck to work with ever since. It has been an extraordinary privilege to gain a front row insight into what makes Silicon Valley such an enduring hub of world leading innovation.



And I am simply thrilled that my deputy, Joel Kaplan, will now become Meta’s Chief Global Affairs Officer. Over the years that we have worked together, we have become good friends as well as close colleagues – I have laughed with, as well as learned from, Joel in equal measure. He is quite clearly the right person for the right job at the right time! I much look forward to spending the next few months handing over the reins to Joel before finally leaving Meta after so many enjoyable years at the company.”

In a significant leadership change, Nick Clegg , Meta ’s Chief Global Affairs Officer , has announced his resignation from the company. Clegg, who has held the position since 2018, will be succeeded by Joel Kaplan , a long-serving executive with a prominent background in Republican politics.Clegg, the former Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and leader of the Liberal Democrats, has been instrumental in addressing Meta’s policies on elections and content regulation . His tenure included the establishment of Meta’s independent oversight board, a body designed to ensure accountability in content moderation decisions.Kaplan, who joined Meta in 2011 after serving as Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy under former US President George W. Bush, is expected to shape Meta’s global strategy and steer its approach to pressing policy challenges. Reacting to his appointment, Kaplan called the move “bittersweet,” acknowledging the significance of his predecessor’s contributions.Clegg described the timing of his departure as appropriate, expressing confidence in Kaplan’s ability to lead during what he called a transformative period for the company. He noted that his time at Meta coincided with a significant resetting of the relationship between big tech and societal pressures manifested in new laws, institutions, and norms affecting the sector.Announcing his departure in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) Clegg said,","Nick Clegg, Meta’s Chief Global Affairs Officer, has announced his resignation from the company.

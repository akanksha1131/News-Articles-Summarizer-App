"Microsoft plans thousands of job cuts next month, and these employees are likely to lose their jobs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-plans-thousands-of-job-cuts-next-month-and-these-employees-are-likely-to-lose-their-jobs/articleshow/121943582.cms,"Sales teams face heaviest impact at Microsoft

AI spending drives cost-cutting measures

Microsoft is preparing to eliminate thousands of jobs primarily targeting its sales division, with the cuts expected to be announced in early July as the company continues restructuring amid massive AI investments, according to people familiar with the matter.The layoffs will mark the third major workforce reduction this year for the Redmond-based tech giant, following 6,000 cuts in May and over 300 additional eliminations just weeks later. Bloomberg first reported the planned summer layoffs, with sources indicating the timing coincides with the start of Microsoft's new fiscal year beginning in July.Unlike previous rounds that primarily affected software engineers and product developers, the upcoming cuts will disproportionately target customer-facing roles. Microsoft's sales and marketing division employs approximately 45,000 of the company's 228,000 total workforce as of June 2024.The company signaled this shift in April when it announced plans to use third-party firms to handle more software sales to small and mid-sized customers. Sources told Bloomberg the reductions won't exclusively affect sales teams, though they will bear the brunt of the cuts.Microsoft's layoffs reflect the broader challenge facing tech companies balancing AI investments with operational efficiency. The company has allocated roughly $80 billion for data center spending this fiscal year while executives have pledged to Wall Street to control costs in other areas.CEO Satya Nadella recently described earlier cuts as a ""realignment"" rather than performance-based decisions, telling employees at an internal town hall that ""this was not about people failing. It was about repositioning for what comes next.""The timing follows a pattern for Microsoft, which often announces organizational changes near the end of its fiscal year. The company previously eliminated 10,000 positions in January 2023 after pandemic-driven hiring, and made additional cuts to its videogame division following the Activision Blizzard acquisition.Microsoft declined to comment on the planned layoffs, with the final number of cuts still being determined according to sources familiar with the matter.","Microsoft is preparing to eliminate thousands of jobs, with the cuts expected to be announced in early July.

Take immediate action to ...: Researchers warn US companies of Iranian cyberattacks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/take-immediate-action-to-researchers-warn-us-companies-of-iranian-cyberattacks/articleshow/121938807.cms,"Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei



Two prominent US cybersecurity organizations , the Information Technology — Information Sharing and Analysis Center ( IT-ISAC ) and the Food and Agriculture Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Food and Ag-ISAC), have issued an urgent warning to American businesses across the country about a potential surge in cyberattacks from Iranian-linked actors. The alert comes as tensions escalate between Iran and Israel, raising concerns about cyber retaliation targeting US companies.In a joint statement released recently, the ISACs cautioned that Iranian state-sponsored hackers, pro-Iran hacktivist groups, and financially motivated cybercriminals have historically launched attacks against US organizations during periods of heightened conflict. The groups urged businesses, particularly those in critical infrastructure sectors, to bolster their cybersecurity defenses immediately.“Preparedness is critical to resilience,” the statement emphasized, calling on companies to assess their cybersecurity posture, familiarize themselves with Iranian-affiliated threat actors’ tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and enhance monitoring for suspicious activity. The ISACs also stressed the importance of employee training to recognize and report phishing emails and malicious links.The warning highlighted the risk of collateral damage, noting that cyberattacks aimed at Israeli targets could inadvertently disrupt US companies due to the interconnected nature of global digital networks. “Even attacks not directly targeting the US could have indirect effects,” the statement said.Both organizations are actively monitoring the situation and providing real-time intelligence to their members through tools like adversary attack playbooks and secure collaboration channels. They encouraged non-member companies to join their information-sharing networks to strengthen industry-wide cyber defenses.The Food and Ag-ISAC, established in 2023, supports the food and agriculture sector with threat intelligence and incident response resources. As global tensions rise, the ISACs underscored the need for heightened vigilance to protect critical infrastructure from potential disruptions.","The alert comes as tensions escalate between Iran and Israel, raising concerns about cyber retaliation targeting US companies.

Introducing STAR: The AI tool revolutionising male infertility treatment



How STAR works:



A microfluidic chip filters and isolates constituents in the semen.

A high-speed imaging system takes millions of microscopic frames.

A machine learning algorithm scrutinizes these images to spot rare, cryptic sperm—even a few viable cells that might be used in IVF.

""Finding a needle in a thousand haystacks"" is how Dr. Williams described it. ""But STAR can accomplish that in a couple of hours. And it's so gentle the sperm it retrieves can still be used to fertilize an egg.""

AI breakthrough helps couple conceive after 20 years of infertility



Non-invasive: No surgery is required to look for or retrieve sperm.

Accurate: AI can locate what trained experts may not spot.

Hope-restoring: For couples informed their chances were ""zero,"" this provides a new avenue.

Broader future of AI in reproductive health



Detecting high-quality eggs and embryos

Being able to predict IVF success rates

What is Azoospermia: The ""hidden"" cause of male infertility



Obstructive azoospermia: The testes generate sperm, but it can't be ejaculated because there are blockages in the reproductive system.

Non-obstructive azoospermia: The body is not able to produce sperm at all or only in very low amounts.

Genetic disorders

Chemotherapy or radiation therapy

Hormonal imbalance

Drug abuse or exposure to toxins

Structural defects such as varicoceles (dilated veins in the scrotum)

A New York couple is finally having a baby after almost two decades of failing to conceive a long, emotionally trying, physically draining, and medically frustrating ride. Their story, foiled by 15 failed IVF treatments and consultations from experts on every continent, was redeemed by an AI-based fertility tool designed at Columbia University. It's a breathtaking medical milestone that could change the face of treatment for male infertility globally.The long-awaited pregnancy of the couple is not only a medical success; it's a victory of endurance, ingenuity, and the ability of technology to overcome very intimate kinds of difficulties. For those with apparently insurmountable barriers, this case provides something invaluable: hope.With the help of AI, the era of reproductive health is about to experience a breakthrough period where even the most challenging fertility situations can be addressed not with desperation, but with data, precision, and empathy.For the majority of couples, fertility treatments are emotionally and financially exhausting—if not more so when they are unsuccessful time and time again. This couple was no exception. They struggled for nearly 20 years to have a biological child. Even with access to cutting-edge fertility treatment, surgeries, and international consultations, they were consistently given the same message: conception was all but impossible.The fundamental problem was with the husband, whom the doctor diagnosed with azoospermia , a rare but serious condition where no sperm is present in the ejaculate.Just when hope appeared to be lost, the couple approached Dr. Zev Williams, a fertility specialist at Columbia University , whose team had been developing a cutting-edge technology: Sperm Track and Recovery (STAR).The AI system was developed to identify good sperm in semen samples where previously none were seen.In this New York couple's situation, standard lab technicians spent two entire days searching through the semen sample, but couldn't locate a single sperm cell. STAR located 44 viable sperm, though, within an hour—a figure large enough to continue with in-vitro fertilization (IVF).Miraculously, the pair did not require further cycles of hormonal treatment or surgery. With the sperm isolated by STAR, the IVF cycle went smoothly in March 2025. It worked—and the pair is now pregnant with their first child. Dr. Williams noted that the case is by no means a fluke. STAR has the potential to overturn fertility treatment, particularly for men with non-obstructive azoospermia.Affects 1 in 6 people worldwide, states the World Health Organization, and male infertility accounts for roughly 50% of these. For many, diagnosis of azoospermia seemed the end of the road until now.Whereas STAR today solves sperm detection, scientists think AI can revolutionize many other aspects of fertility treatment as well:""There are things happening that we are not aware of now,"" said Dr. Williams. ""But with AI, we can finally observe them.""Azoospermia occurs in about 1 in 100 men and is responsible for 10–15% of male infertility. It exists in two types:Some common reasons are:Conventional therapies for azoospermia usually include risky operations to harvest sperm directly from the testes or using donor sperm—both of which pose emotional and ethical challenges for most couples.","A New York couple is finally having a baby after almost two decades of failing to conceive.

Elon Musk came in support of H-1B visa earlier, said its important for the US



Republican political strategist Gavin Wax has sparked fierce online debate after declaring that Silicon Valley jobs should be ""legally reserved for US citizens,"" calling the tech hub a ""strategic national asset"" whose workforce poses potential national security risks when dominated by foreign workers.Wax, former president of the New York Young Republicans and recently appointed chief of staff to FCC Commissioner Nathan Simington, made the controversial statement amid ongoing tensions over the H-1B visa program that allows skilled foreign workers to take American jobs .The debate reflects broader tensions within conservative circles over immigration policy . While national-security-focused conservatives like Wax advocate for restricting foreign workers, tech advocates including Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have defended H-1B visas as essential for maintaining America's competitive edge.Social media users quickly challenged Wax's proposal, pointing out that foreign-born workers comprise 60-70% of Silicon Valley's tech workforce . ""Tell me you've never stepped foot in the valley without telling me you've never stepped foot in the valley,"" one user commented. Another quipped, ""If that would be the case, Silicon Valley would be called a Stupid Valley.""Users countered Wax's argument by listing prominent immigrant entrepreneurs: ""Steve Jobs: son of a Syrian immigrant. Jeff Bezos: father is a Cuban immigrant. Sergey Brin: Soviet immigrant, born in Moscow. Jensen Huang: Taiwanese immigrant. Elon Musk: South African immigrant."" One commenter noted the irony that such a policy ""would have kept Canadian Elon Musk out,"" adding that ""American policy is to hire the best.""One critic drew parallels to diversity policies, arguing, ""If you're only allowing US citizens, that's no better than DEI and fast tracking mediocrity,"" suggesting that merit-based hiring regardless of origin should be the priority. Another user questioned whether limiting talent pools would ""cripple your strategic assets,"" noting that America appeared ""currently good at that.""Musk, who himself migrated from South Africa on an H-1B visa, recently called the system ""broken"" but argued it could be ""easily fixed"" by raising minimum salaries and adding yearly costs to make overseas hiring more expensive than domestic recruitment. Ramaswamy echoed support for elite talent importation, arguing that American culture has celebrated ""mediocrity over excellence.""The internal MAGA dispute escalated when Musk warned of a "" MAGA civil war "" and vowed to ""go to war"" on the H-1B issue, while Trump ultimately sided with the tech leaders, telling The New York Post he was ""a believer in H-1B"" and had ""used it many times.""Recent USCIS data shows 2026 H-1B applications at their lowest levels, though MAGA activists remain disappointed that the Trump administration hasn't completely halted the program. Trump himself has recently expressed support for allowing foreign students to work in America after graduation, including those from China.Wax's appointment to the FCC earlier this year marked a significant shift toward more aggressive conservative policy positions within the commission, aligning with Chairman Brendan Carr's combative approach to tech regulation and content moderation issues.","Republican political strategist Gavin Wax has sparked fierce online debate after declaring that Silicon Valley jobs should be ""legally reserved"" for US citizens.

The provision was already included in the House version of President Donald Trump's budget bill that passed last month, with the Senate expected to unveil its version this week ahead of a July 4 deadline.Chip Pickering, a former congressman and CEO of trade association INCOMPAS, has advocated for the proposal on behalf of members including Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Google. ""This is the right policy at the right time for American leadership,"" Pickering told the Financial Times.

""[It's] a power grab by tech bro-ligarchs attempting to concentrate yet more wealth and power,"" said Max Tegmark, an MIT professor and president of the Future of Life Institute.A coalition of 140 organizations previously sent a letter to House leadership opposing the ban, warning it ""would mean that even if a company deliberately designs an algorithm that causes foreseeable harm,"" companies would remain ""unaccountable to lawmakers and the public.""Supporters contend the provision would prevent a patchwork of conflicting state regulations that could hinder innovation and allow China to gain ground in AI development, the Financial Times reported.","Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Meta are lobbying for a 10-year ban on state-level AI legislation.

Verdict on July 2, what proscecutors want

Three former Ubisoft executives are on trial in France for allegations of bullying and sexual harassment, with a French court hearing disturbing accounts from former employees, predominantly women, about a toxic workplace culture at the gaming giant’s Paris headquarters during the 2010s, according to The Guardian. The accusations, reportedly described as “extremely serious” by prosecutor Antoine Haushalter, include incidents of employees being tied to chairs, forced to perform handstands, subjected to sexual jokes, exposed to pornographic videos in the office, and enduring crude behavior, such as a boss farting in employees’ faces. One woman reported a manager drawing a penis on her arm during a video call with senior leaders. The court case marks the gaming industry’s first major #MeToo trial.The accused include Tommy Francois, 52, former Vice President of Editorial & Creative Services; Serge Hascoet, 59, former Chief Creative Officer; and Guillaume Patrux, 41, former Game Director. Ubisoft, known for blockbuster titles like Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Just Dance, was allegedly a “Boys’ Club” where such misconduct thrived, per The Guardian.Francois faces charges of sexual harassment, bullying, and attempted sexual assault. The Guardian reported that he allegedly tied a female employee to a chair before sending her in an elevator to a random floor and forced a woman in a skirt to do handstands, leaving her terrified. At a 2015 office party, he reportedly attempted to kiss a woman while others restrained her; she escaped after shouting. Another woman accused Francois of grabbing her hair and attempting a forced kiss at a U.S. gaming event, showing her nude photos, and drawing on her arm during a video call. Ubisoft’s HR allegedly dismissed her concerns, advising her not to escalate. Francois denies all allegations.Hascoet is accused of bullying and sexual harassment, including making inappropriate sexual comments, such as telling a woman on a work trip she “needed sex” in front of colleagues, and joking that a used tissue he handed to a female employee was “worth gold at Ubisoft,” per The Guardian. He allegedly made sexual noises, forced assistants to run personal errands, and denies any intent to harass.Patrux faces similar charges, accused of punching walls, pretending to strike employees, cracking a whip near faces, joking about an office shooting, and burning an employee’s beard with a lighter, according to The Guardian. He also denies the allegations.Haushalter called the trial an important moment for the gaming industry, highlighted by the #MeToo movement, which empowered victims to speak out. He also highlighted “strong proof” of systemic mistreatment and requested suspended prison sentences of up to three years and fines for the trio. The court concluded hearings, with a verdict expected on July 2, 2025.","Three former Ubisoft executives are on trial in France for allegations of bullying and sexual harassment.

Bill Gates spent $38 million on equestrian real estate for daughter Jennifer

A 4.5-acre horse farm for $8.7 million.

In 2016, he bought a neighboring 4.5-acre estate for $13.5 million.

He then snapped up two vacant lots for around $5 million.

Another 5.2-acre compound with barns and residential buildings was acquired for $8.7 million.

Finally, a 1.3-acre plot was purchased for $2.5 million to complete the puzzle.

The Bill Gates’ approach to parenting

“We absolutely did not just buy them things. It was much more of an upbringing like I grew up in. A very middle-class household where money did dictate whether I got an extra pair of shoes that year or not.”

When it comes to supporting their children’s passions, most parents settle for lessons, gear, or maybe even a trip to a championship. But when you're Bill Gates , the Microsoft co-founder and one of the richest men in the world, the scale of parental support takes a whole new dimension.In what might be one of the most extravagant gestures of modern parenthood, Gates reportedly spent over $38 million to purchase nearly an entire residential street in Wellington, Florida, to give his daughter Jennifer Gates the perfect environment to pursue her equestrian dreams. What began as a simple rental in 2011 evolved into a strategic series of acquisitions that transformed the elite Mallet Hill Court neighborhood into a private horse-centric haven, complete with barns, mansions, and lots of privacy.The Gates family initially dipped their toes into Wellington’s equestrian scene in 2011, renting a home for four months at a cost of $500,000. Their teenage daughter, Jennifer, was already training as a competitive show jumper, and Wellington, a hub for global equestrian sports, was the perfect base.By 2013, Bill Gates had made his first major purchase:From there, the acquisitions accelerated:In total, Bill Gates acquired 18 acres of land, effectively transforming a residential street into a private equestrian neighborhood.The scale and strategy of the acquisitions caught local attention. As one local told the Daily Mail, Gates was “gobbling up properties like Pac-Man.” Many purchases were reportedly made at two to three times the appraised market value, all in a bid to secure surrounding lots and guarantee privacy for Jennifer and her team.Stuart Roffman, a former property owner on the street, explained that despite the gated entrance, the activity level was still high. “Between trucks, stable hands, grooms, and house staff, that's a lot of people on a small street,” he noted. Gates’ solution? Buy the neighbors out.Although the purchase spree appears lavish, Melinda French Gates defended their parenting approach in a 2024 interview with The New York Times, saying,She emphasised that Jennifer and her siblings were raised with allowances, chores, and boundaries. “They were explicitly told not to mention private jets to their classmates,” Melinda added, underscoring an attempt to keep their lives grounded, despite the multimillion-dollar real estate portfolio.Now 29 years old, Jennifer Gates has successfully balanced her equestrian career with impressive academic achievements. A graduate of Stanford University, she later attended medical school and recently announced her residency in Pediatrics Research at Mount Sinai, one of her top choices.In a recent Instagram post, she wrote:she added, celebrating the match to her desired program.Jennifer is now married to Olympic show jumper Nayel Nassar and continues to compete in equestrian events while working in the medical field.Florida isn’t the only state where Jennifer enjoys equestrian luxury. For her graduation from Stanford, the Gates family purchased a 124-acre equestrian estate in North Salem, New York, reportedly worth $15.8 million. The property, located near New York City, consists of three large parcels, giving her ample space to house horses, practice riding, and enjoy countryside serenity. She often shares glimpses of her quiet life there on social media. The estate also serves as a base for her continued training and competitions.Bill Gates once downplayed the perks of wealth by saying,But in this case, the metaphorical burger came with a mansion, barns, paddocks, and full-time staff. What began as a teenager’s passion has turned into a lifestyle, supported by one of the most influential tech moguls in history.While many parents support their children's hobbies with encouragement or a few lessons, Bill Gates offered Jennifer a community, a sanctuary, and the freedom to chase her dreams without compromise. His investment wasn’t just financial—it was deeply personal. It showed how belief in a child’s passion can create a legacy beyond wealth.","Bill Gates spent over $38 million to purchase nearly an entire residential street in Wellington, Florida, to give his daughter Jennifer Gates the perfect environment to pursue her equestrian dreams.

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which was once commonly linked to war veterans, has been brought into the limelight again in recent times because of its increasingly diagnosable occurrence throughout all demographics and occupations. The most recent public reference to it is by Errol Musk, who explained his son Elon Musk's feud with Donald Trump as stemming fromAlthough those claims tend to fuel controversy, they also point to the larger, more serious discourse surrounding mental health, particularly in high-pressure settings such as politics, governance, or technology entrepreneurship.PTSD is a stress disorder that can happen to anyone who has witnessed or experienced a traumatic experience. From victims of natural disasters and violent offenses to those subjected to chronic emotional stress, PTSD can drastically interfere with daily life and quality of life if not treated. Here's a comprehensive overview of PTSD, its symptoms, causes, diagnosis, and contemporary treatment methods.PTSD stands forr, a mental health condition that may occur following exposure to or witnessing a traumatic event.It is accepted within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and may occur in individuals of all ages, including children.PTSD is different from the temporary emotional distress that most individuals experience following trauma. Although many recover on their own, those with PTSD remain affected by long-lasting symptoms that can last for months or even years and disrupt their normal functioning.PTSD may result from a variety of traumatic events. While some individuals develop the disorder following a one-time event, others become affected after repeated exposure to stressful situations. They are commonly triggered by:It is worth noting that not everyone who is exposed to trauma will develop PTSD. Genetics, brain chemistry, coping methods, and support systems can all play a role in a person's risk.PTSD symptoms typically start within three months of the traumatic event but at other times may emerge later. To be considered for PTSD diagnosis, the symptoms should persist for more than a month and lead to major distress or impairments in social or occupational functioning.PTSD symptoms are typically classified into four clusters:Although PTSD may occur in anyone, some individuals are at higher risk:Studies also indicate that women are more likely than men to experience PTSD, perhaps because of higher incidence rates of interpersonal violence.PTSD is usually diagnosed by a mental health professional, including a psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker, based on criteria from the DSM-5. The diagnostic process involves:At other times, symptom quantification is achieved through the use of standardized measurement tools such as the PCL-5 (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5).Contemporary treatment of PTSD aims to enable people to manage symptoms, re-establish trust, and take back control of their lives.

"Meta, TikTok challenge EU’s Big Tech fee; call it “unfair and disproportionate”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-tiktok-challenge-eus-big-tech-fee-call-it-unfair-and-disproportionate/articleshow/121796298.cms,"What Meta and TikTok said about Europe’s DSA

What the European Commission argue

Xiaomi QLED TV FX Pro 55-inch Review: Affordable Cinematic Experience at Home

Meta and TikTok have taken the European Union to court over a fee which they claim is unfair and based on flawed calculations. Speaking before Europe’s second-highest court on Wednesday, the two tech giants argued that the EU’s supervisory levy under the Digital Services Act (DSA) is both disproportionate and lacking in transparency. The law, which came into effect in 2022, requires 19 large online platforms to pay a fee—up to 0.05% of their annual global net income—to help fund the European Commission's work overseeing their compliance with digital rules.Stating that the company is not trying to avoid paying the fees, Meta’s lawyer questioned the Commission’s method for calculating the fee. In a General Court in Luxembourg, he said it was wrongly based on the overall group’s revenue, not the revenue of the EU-based subsidiary, and that the company still doesn’t know exactly how the final amount was reached.TikTok’s lawyer echoed similar concerns, calling the fee “unfair and disproportionate.” He said the method used inflated TikTok’s payment and even required the company to help cover the cost for other platforms. He also accused the EU of counting the same user more than once if they switch between devices, which he said led to double-counting.Both companies argued that the Commission went beyond its legal powers by using group-level profits to calculate the cap for the fee.In response, the European Commission’s lawyer defended the system, saying that when a company files consolidated financial reports, it’s reasonable to use group-level financial data. She also said that companies had access to enough information to understand how the fee was determined and that there was no violation of their rights.","The two tech giants argued that the EU’s supervisory levy under the Digital Services Act (DSA) is both disproportionate and lacking in transparency.

8 simple tips to help you improve efficiency of your car’s AC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/8-simple-tips-to-help-you-improve-efficiency-of-your-cars-ac/articleshow/121792931.cms,"8 simple tips to improve your car’s AC

Park in the shade

Vent hot air before starting AC

Use the Recirculation Mode

Don't keep it on max fan speed constantly

Get regular AC servicing

Clean or replace air filters

Use a sunshade

Turn off AC before turning off engine

As temperatures soar, a well-functioning car air conditioner becomes less of a luxury and more of a necessity. However, many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling. A few simple practices can significantly improve its efficiency, save fuel, and extend the life of your cooling system. By incorporating these simple habits, you can ensure your car's AC runs more efficiently, keeping you comfortable while potentially saving on fuel costs and maintenance. Here are eight simple tips to help you stay cool on the road.This might seem obvious, but parking under a tree or in a covered area can make a huge difference. A car parked in direct sunlight can reach internal temperatures far exceeding the outside air, forcing your AC to work much harder to cool it down.Before turning on your AC, roll down your windows for a minute or two, especially if your car has been sitting in the sun. This allows trapped hot air to escape, reducing the initial load on your air conditioning system.Once your car is cool, switch your AC to recirculation mode. This feature re-circulates the air already inside the cabin, rather than constantly trying to cool hot outside air. This is much more efficient and helps maintain a comfortable temperature.While it's tempting to use the highest fan setting, keeping it on maximum continuously isn't always the most efficient. Once the cabin is cool, reduce the fan speed to maintain comfort, which puts less strain on the system.Just like your car's engine, your AC system needs regular maintenance. Getting it serviced annually ensures that refrigerant levels are optimal, components are clean, and there are no leaks. A well-maintained system runs more efficiently.A clogged cabin air filter can restrict airflow and make your AC work harder. Check your car's manual for recommended replacement intervals and clean or replace the filter as needed. This simple step can dramatically improve airflow and efficiency.When parking outdoors, a reflective sunshade in your windshield can significantly reduce the internal temperature build-up. This minimises the initial cooling effort required from your AC.It's a good habit to turn off your AC a few minutes before you reach your destination or turn off the engine. This allows the system to dry out, preventing mold and mildew growth in the vents, which can lead to unpleasant odours and reduce efficiency over time.","Many drivers unknowingly reduce their AC’s efficiency, leading to higher fuel consumption and inadequate cooling.

Starlink price in India

The Future of Fast Internet: Satellite Tech Explained

Starlink, the satellite internet service owned by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, has officially secured operating rights in India, a development confirmed by union minister for communications, Jyotiraditya Scindia, on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). This approval essentially means that Starlink can now provide its services in the competitive Indian telecommunications market.The confirmation follows a ""productive meeting"" between Scindia and SpaceX president and COO Gwynne Shotwell. Their discussions, as detailed by Scindia on X, ""delved into opportunities for collaboration in satellite communications to power Digital India’s soaring ambitions and empower every citizen across the country.""Shotwell reportedly expressed appreciation for the license, calling it ""a great start to the journey.""This regulatory milestone comes just days after Starlink was issued the Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite (GMPCS) permit by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). Starlink now stands as the third company to receive such a permit, joining Eutelsat OneWeb and Jio Satellite Communications in the race to offer commercial satellite internet services across India. Amazon's Project Kuiper is also poised to enter the market, pending its own regulatory approvals.Telecom giants Airtel and Jio have already announced partnerships with Starlink. These partnerships are crucial, as Jio and Airtel collectively command over 70% of the Indian telecommunications market, providing extensive retail networks for Starlink's equipment distribution and offering customer service, installation, and activation support, particularly in remote and underserved regions.While there is no official information about the price for the services, a report by The Economic Times last month claimed that Starlink may introduce unlimited data plans in India for less than $10 (approximately Rs 840) per month at promotional rates.It also cited industry experts as saying that despite substantial spectrum and licensing costs, satellite internet providers are likely to adopt a low entry price to rapidly expand their user base, aiming for up to 10 million subscribers in the medium to long term.However, a widespread adoption for Starlink in India may face hurdles, particularly concerning hardware costs. Globally, Starlink’s hardware kits range from $250 (approx. Rs 21,300) to $380 (approx. Rs 32,400). This represents a significant upfront investment compared to existing Indian home broadband offerings, which typically feature much lower hardware costs, provide speeds up to 1 Gbps, and often bundle Over-The-Top (OTT) app subscriptions.","Starlink, the satellite internet service owned by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, has officially secured operating rights in India.

Intel's factory layoffs add to CEO Tan's restructuring plans

Third Major layoff round in just one years

Intel is preparing to lay off between 15% and 20% of its Intel Foundry workforce beginning in July, marking one of the largest job cuts in the semiconductor giant's history. The layoffs are expected to affect more than 10,000 employees worldwide, representing roughly one-fifth of the company's manufacturing division.""These are difficult actions but essential to meet our affordability challenges and current financial position of the company. It drives pain to every individual,"" Intel Manufacturing Vice President Naga Chandrasekaran wrote in an internal memo to employees over the weekend, as seen by The Oregonian.The cuts will impact Intel's foundry division across 15 wafer fabrication plants at 10 locations globally, affecting roles ranging from factory floor technicians to researchers developing next-generation microprocessors. Unlike previous layoffs, Intel will not offer voluntary buyouts or early retirement packages, instead selecting workers based on performance evaluations and strategic priorities.""These reductions will be based on a combination of portfolio changes, level and position elimination, skill assessment for remaining positions, and some hard decisions around our project investments,"" Chandrasekaran explained in the memo. ""We are also taking into consideration factory operations impact.""The foundry layoffs represent an acceleration of cost-cutting measures announced by CEO Lip-Bu Tan , who took over the company back in March this year. In April, Tan revealed plans to cut over 20% of Intel's total workforce as part of a comprehensive restructuring aimed at eliminating bureaucracy and rebuilding the company's engineering-focused culture.The 65-year-old executive has repeatedly emphasized the need to streamline operations and reduce management layers. ""I'm a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people,"" Tan stated in an April memo to employees.Intel's workforce has steadily declined from nearly 125,000 employees in 2023 to approximately 109,000 by the end of 2024. The company reported an $821 million loss in the first quarter of 2025, continuing a pattern of financial struggles that have plagued the chipmaker.These cuts represent the third major layoff round in the period of one year. Intel first eliminated 15,000 jobs in August 2024 under former CEO Pat Gelsinger , which represented over 15% of its workforce at the time. Those layoffs included buyouts, early retirement offers, and voluntary departures as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan. Earlier this year, new CEO Tan announced additional workforce reductions of over 20% as part of his turnaround strategy.The latest restructuring comes as Intel faces intense competition in PC and data center markets while struggling to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom that has benefited rivals like Nvidia. The company has also grappled with delays in federal CHIPS Act funding, with much of its promised $7.9 billion subsidy package remaining uncertain under the Trump administration's review of ongoing awards.Key technical roles, including engineers working on advanced process technologies and technicians managing critical lithography equipment, are expected to be largely protected from the cuts, while positions made redundant by automation may face elimination.","Intel is preparing to lay off between 15% and 20% of its Intel Foundry workforce beginning in July.

NYT report alleges Elon Musk’s heavy use of ketamine and MDMA

Elon Musk’s response



Musk captioned the post simply: “lol.”

“Elon Musk is continuing to lash out because he doesn’t like our reporting. Nothing that he’s said or presented since our article about his drug use during the presidential campaign was published contradicts what we uncovered. We stand by our journalism.”

NYT responds to Musk's drug test report

Timeline and limitations

Musk and Trump’s fallout



Elon Musk is once again at odds with The New York Times following its recent reporting on his alleged drug use. This time, the clash has moved into public view on social media. Musk posted a drug test result to his personal X (formerly Twitter) account, aiming to discredit the claims. In response, The New York Times stood by its reporting, stating that Musk's post does not change any of the facts they published.On May 30, The New York Times published an article stating that Musk’s drug use was “more intense than previously known.” The report cited unnamed sources who claimed Musk regularly used substances including ketamine, MDMA (also known as ecstasy), psychedelic mushrooms, and possibly Adderall. It also described Musk carrying a daily medication box filled with pills, some of which matched the appearance of Adderall.The article said Musk told people he was taking enough ketamine that it began to affect his bladder—something that can happen with prolonged use. While the story did not confirm whether Musk was using drugs at the time of his reported involvement in federal government matters, it pointed to “erratic behavior,” including strange gestures, verbal confusion, and public outbursts.On June 17, Musk responded by posting a screenshot of a lab test labeled “United States Drug Testing Laboratories.” The test said it was based on a urine sample collected on June 11. The results showed negative findings for several drugs, including Cocaine, Ketamine, MDMA, Opiates, Cannabinoids, Amphetamines, and PCP.Shortly after Musk’s post, The New York Times used its official communications account on X to respond. The message read:The statement emphasised that the lab test Musk posted did not address the core of the newspaper’s story, which focused on long-term behavior and statements from people close to him.Experts have noted that urine tests typically only detect drugs taken within the past few days. In many cases, substances like ketamine or MDMA may be undetectable after 2 to 7 days, depending on the dosage and frequency of use. Musk’s test was taken nearly two weeks after the original story was published, so it may not reflect past use.Some critics argued that if Musk wanted to provide stronger evidence, a hair follicle test—which can show drug use over a longer period—would have been more useful.The report also mentioned that Donald Trump allegedly referred to Musk as “a big-time drug addict” after their relationship broke down earlier this year. Musk, who had been close to Trump during the 2024 campaign, later distanced himself publicly. The fallout included personal attacks from both sides and ended Musk’s brief period of political influence within the Trump circle.","Elon Musk posted a drug test result to his personal X (formerly Twitter) account, aiming to discredit the claims.

Careem CEO has an update on company's Pakistan operations: With a heavy heart ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/careem-ceo-has-an-update-on-companys-pakistan-operations-with-a-heavy-heart-/articleshow/121930869.cms,"Read Careem CEO Mudassar Sheikha’s complete LinkedIn post here



A new chapter for Careem in Pakistan

It is with a heavy heart that I share this update: Careem will suspend its ride-hailing service in Pakistan on July 18.

This was an incredibly difficult decision. The challenging macroeconomic reality, intensifying competition, and global capital allocation made it hard to justify the investment levels required to deliver a safe and dependable service in the country. In the end, the Careem Rides team had to make this tough call.

It’s the end of an iconic chapter - one built with purpose, grit and a ton of relentless hustle.

I still remember when we launched in 2015, many thought it was a pipe dream. Safe rides on demand? Women traveling with strangers? Smartphones and digital payments for everyday use? The challenges were real and formidable. But our Pakistan team was brilliant and fearless - bold, determined, and literally on a mission to create millions of jobs for captains across the country.

They did not just build a service that millions of Pakistanis relied on to move and earn, they delivered significant public goods: digital infrastructure, trust, regulation, capability, confidence - all of which paved the way for countless local and global digital ventures to take root in Pakistan.

While ride-hailing is sunsetting, Careem’s journey in Pakistan continues in a different role. Careem Technologies (the spinout building the Everything App) will continue to build from Pakistan for the region. Nearly 400 colleagues across all functions (including engineering) are building the Everything App and its ecosystem of verticals (food/grocery delivery, payments, and more).

This presence is only set to grow, with over 100 open roles and the expansion of our Falcon / NextGen program that brings in top graduates from Pakistani universities and gives them hands-on training on building highly scalable systems.

Pakistan is in Careem’s DNA - our first line of code was written here, and the country remains a rich source of innovation and talent for us. Our commitment to Pakistan remains strong, and I sincerely hope to bring Careem’s services back to the country in the future.

Lastly, I feel deeply grateful to the heroes who built Careem in Pakistan under the bold leadership of Junaid Iqbal. THANK YOU - you all made it happen against all odds. Your boldness, brilliance and passion shaped Careem and inspired a generation. I am incredibly proud of you all and can’t wait to see the impact you will make across the region in the next chapters of your life.","Careem will suspend its ride-hailing service in Pakistan on July 18.

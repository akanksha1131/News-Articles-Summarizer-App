'Direct Digital Access' that has created anxiety

Wider geopolitical concerns





Europe is worrying big about its Buses and the reason is China. Anxiety over reliance on Chinese technology has permeated the typically serene infrastructure of Scandinavian public transportation, with operators in Denmark and Norway launching urgent investigations into potential security vulnerabilities in their fleets. As reported by NBC News, European officials are increasingly concerned that Chinese-built infrastructure could be weaponized in the event of geopolitical conflict, potentially allowing foreign actors to immobilize or tamper with vehicles remotely.The focus of the alarm is Yutong, a Zhengzhou-based company and the world’s largest manufacturer of buses by sales volume. Public transit providers in Denmark and Norway say they are moving to remedy a ""security loophole"" linked to the buses' ""over-the-air"" software capabilities. Jeppe Gaard, the chief operating officer of Danish transport provider Movia, told NBC News regarding the vulnerability: “Because these buses can receive updates and diagnostic tests ‘over the air,’ they can be stopped remotely, either by the manufacturer or by a hacker. ”Movia, which operates 262 Yutong buses across Copenhagen and eastern Denmark, warned that this issue extends beyond a single manufacturer. “Electric buses, like electric cars, in principle can be remotely deactivated if their software systems have online access,” Gaard told NBC News.“It is a challenge for all types of vehicles and devices with these kinds of electronics built in.”The issue was first highlighted earlier this month by Ruter, a Norwegian operator responsible for half of the country’s public transport. In a series of tests performed “inside a mountain,” Ruter compared Yutong buses against those from Dutch manufacturer VDL.While the Dutch buses lacked the capability for autonomous software updates, Ruter found that Yutong “has direct digital access to each individual bus for software updates and diagnostics.” The operator concluded that, in theory, the buses could be “stopped or rendered inoperable by the manufacturer.”In response to inquiries about the Scandinavian investigations, Yutong stated that it “strictly complies with the applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards.” The company noted that its data for the European Union is stored in an Amazon Web Services center in Frankfurt, Germany, protected by encryption.The bus controversy arrives amidst a broader European reckoning with Chinese technology. Following pressure from Washington, several European nations have already stripped Huawei and ZTE equipment from their 5G networks due to espionage fears. Intelligence officials worry that the threat profile for electric vehicles (EVs) mirrors that of telecommunications.Richard Dearlove, the former head of Britain’s MI6 intelligence agency, told NBC News in an interview earlier this year that the West is facing “a similar problem in Chinese electric cars” to the one it faced with Huawei. “They can all be immobilized at a switch from the manufacturer,” Dearlove told NBC. “So if we have a crisis with China, they can bring London to a complete halt by reprogramming” the vehicles.However, cybersecurity experts note that this vulnerability is inherent to modern ""connected"" vehicles, regardless of origin. Ken Munro, founder of Pen Test Partners, pointed out that brands like Tesla have similar capabilities. While Ruter has implemented new firewalls and stricter controls, Munro expressed skepticism about whether technical fixes can fully mitigate the risk without removing connectivity entirely.Ultimately, Munro argued, the issue is one of geopolitical intent. While he believes the chances of China sabotaging its own export economy are “incredibly small,” he added: “It just comes down to trust.”","Public transit providers in Denmark and Norway say they are moving to remedy a ""security loophole"" linked to the buses' ""over-the-air"" software capabilities.

Big New Addition: ESPN Unlimited

How to Add ESPN Unlimited With a YouTube TV Subscription

Users report access issues





YouTube TV and Disney recently reached a new carriage agreement that restores ESPN, ABC and dozens of Disney-owned channels to the live TV streaming platform after a two-week blackout. The deal also includes a major upgrade for subscribers: Free access to ESPN Unlimited, Disney’s new all-in-one sports streaming service. The dispute had left millions of subscribers without access to popular Disney channels, including ABC, ESPN, The Disney Channel, FX, and Nat Geo.“We’re happy to share that we’ve reached a deal to continue carrying Disney content. We appreciated your patience while we negotiated on your behalf. Any recordings that were previously in your library and your personal preferences/recommendations will be just as you left them. We’ll be launching your local ABC stations as quickly as we can, and they should be accessible shortly,” reads the notice on YouTube TV Help page.ESPN Unlimited bundles every ESPN linear network, ESPN on ABC broadcasts, ESPN+ programming and WWE Premium Live Events into a single platform — essentially everything ESPN offers, with the exception of MLB.tv.The service normally costs $29.99 per month when purchased directly, with a current promotion offering Disney+ (with ads) and Hulu (with ads) at no additional charge for 12 months.Under the new agreement, YouTube TV now joins cable, satellite and other pay-TV providers permitted to include ESPN Unlimited free of charge with a subscription — a notable change given that the service previously required separate authentication for YouTube TV customers.For sports and pro-wrestling fans, the addition is meaningful: while YouTube TV already carried ESPN’s linear channels, ESPN+ content and WWE’s monthly premium events were not included.Disney has not completed the full rollout, but once access is enabled, YouTube TV subscribers will be able to activate ESPN Unlimited using the standard TV-provider login flow. The steps are expected to work as follows:* Go to the ESPN Unlimited app or website.* Select “Log In” or “Sign In With TV Provider.”* Choose “YouTube TV” from the list of providers.* Sign in using your Google account linked to your YouTube TV subscription.* Confirm activation inside the ESPN Unlimited app.If your account is eligible, authentication should unlock the full ESPN Unlimited catalog, including ESPN+, live linear feeds and WWE Premium Live Events.Despite the announcement, ESPN Unlimited is not yet live for most YouTube TV customers. Reports also suggest that Xfinity users — who were already supposed to have ESPN Unlimited access — are facing similar authentication issues. Disney has not provided a timetable for when the rollout will be fully operational. YouTube TV has said it will notify subscribers as soon as ESPN Unlimited access becomes available.","YouTube TV and Disney reached a new carriage agreement that restores ESPN, ABC and dozens of Disney-owned channels to the live TV streaming platform after a two-week blackout.

“The next chapter in New Glenn’s roadmap is a new super heavy-class rocket.”

What we know about Blue Origin’s latest New Glenn model





“will be in use at the same time.”

“mega-constellations”





Amazon founder Jeff Bezos 's rocket company, Blue Origin, is moving to challenge Elon Musk ’s SpaceX 's launch vehicle offerings by developing a super heavy-class rocket called the New Glenn 9×4. The company plans to build this vehicle in addition to upgrading its current rocket. In a recent blog post, Blue Origin said,The new rocket, named after the first American to orbit Earth, will feature nine engines on its first stage and four on its second. The current New Glenn, which has four fewer engines, will now be known as the 7×2. In a post on the social media platform X, Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp shared a photo of the latest New Glenn model, showcasing the size difference compared to the older model.The New Glenn 9×4 will be capable of delivering more than 70 metric tons of payload to low Earth orbit, an increase from the 45 metric tons carried by the current New Glenn vehicle (which is classified as a heavy-lift vehicle).This new capacity positions it to better compete with SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, which can bring 64 metric tons into orbit, and its Starship vehicle, which is designed to carry 100 metric tons and is still undergoing testing.Blue Origin noted that both the 9×4 and 7×2 vehiclesThey will be utilised for missions including lunar exploration, launchingof satellites and national security purposes such as the US Golden Dome project.The update to New Glenn comes a week after Blue Origin’s second successful launch. The 7×2 model will receive several upgrades, including improved engines, which Blue Origin says will boost payload performance and reliability and support more frequent launches.The reusable first-stage booster from New Glenn’s second launch was also returned for refurbishment this week. Soon after Blue Origin released its updated vehicle roadmap, SpaceX said its third-generation Super Heavy booster for Starship has begun prelaunch testing.Blue Origin is competing not only with SpaceX but also with companies like Rocket Lab Corp., which are developing rockets capable of carrying large groups of satellites into orbit. Blue Origin is also seeking a role in NASA’s Artemis III mission.Both Blue Origin and SpaceX have submitted proposals to build the lunar lander intended to return astronauts to the moon. The project was initially awarded to SpaceX, but the $2.9 billion contract was reopened after NASA raised concerns about delays in the Starship-based design.According to Politico, SpaceX has shifted the planned launch date from mid-2027 to September 2028, based on internal company documents. Blue Origin already has a $3.4 billion contract for a lander for the Artemis V mission, scheduled for 2029. This week, the company also revealed an aerobrake designed to slow and protect payloads during their return to Earth.","The New Glenn 9×4 will be capable of delivering more than 70 metric tons of payload to low Earth orbit.

Union Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, Ashwini Vaishnaw , has issued a stern warning to social media platforms such as Meta and YouTube , stating they must take responsibility for the content published on their sites amidst a global crisis of trust fueled by deepfake and AI-generated material. Speaking at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore, Vaishnaw stressed that platforms must respect the social structures and laws of the countries in which they operate.“Everyone is worried over the significant influence social media is having on trust between institutions and society,” the minister said, as per a report by The Economic Times.“Trust is getting absolutely broken because of deep fakes, because of synthetic material which is floating around, because of rumours which get amplified at the speed of light,” the minister added.The minister delivered a clear message regarding platforms' responsibility for content moderation and community guidelines. He emphasised that platforms must account for India’s diverse societal norms to be successful.“Social media platforms must understand that to be successful. Otherwise there will be stronger regulations,” Vaishnaw cautioned.These comments come on the heels of recent government actions, including instructing platforms to label AI-generated content and notifying the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) rules, which established a national framework for personal data processing.Addressing the global debate over regulating social media, Vaishnaw clarified that India is pursuing a “techno-legal approach,” rather than adopting the prescriptive rules-based model favoured by the European Union or the free-market approach of the US.“We have decided to go for a principles based law, and defined the principles,” he explained, adding, “We believe in a combination of innovation and regulation, in which our bias is more towards innovation.”","Ashwini Vaishnaw, Union Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, has issued a stern warning to social media platforms such as Meta and YouTube.

“Foxconn is uniquely positioned to support OpenAI’s mission with trusted, scalable infrastructure,”





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US. This partnership is the AI startup's newest step in its extensive infrastructure development plans. The companies stated the goal is to accelerate infrastructure deployment and secure long-term US capacity for essential AI components. While financial terms were not disclosed, OpenAI confirmed it will have early access to evaluate the systems produced by the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and Apple ’s largest supplier, along with the option to purchase them.In a statement to CNBC, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the partnership, saying:adding that AI infrastructure presents aUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities, which are located in Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Indiana.Foxconn adds another manufacturing layer to OpenAI’s supply chain, which could help make production for the AI startup more local and speed up deployment.The company is widely known for assembling Apple’s iPhones, but it has also expanded into AI and automotive manufacturing. It builds server racks designed for AI workloads and is an important global supplier to Nvidia, a major producer of high-end AI chips.Chairman Young Liu said to CNBC.However, the company has had mixed results in the US. In 2018, Foxconn began construction of a large factory in Wisconsin intended to make flat-panel displays. The project did not succeed, and the site is now being used for an AI data centre under construction by Microsoft.OpenAI has recently made several major agreements with some of the world’s biggest technology companies, announcing spending plans of about $1.4 trillion.These commitments have raised questions about whether the company will eventually generate enough profit to support that level of investment.Earlier this month, Altman said the company expects to reach $20 billion in annualised revenue by the end of the year and aims to reach hundreds of billions by 2030.Previous deals include a $100 billion agreement (yet to be finalised) with Nvidia, under which the chipmaker would invest in OpenAI in phases as the company expands its infrastructure.OpenAI also has cloud partnerships with Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, as well as significant compute buildout commitments with Oracle.","OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities.

John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure.

Mayhem at Amazon Amid 30,000 Job Cuts: AI - Easy Corporate Excuse? | Global Pulse

Lord of the Rings





Amazon announced last month that it is cutting around 14,000 corporate jobs. Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti shared a blog post announcing the job cuts. In the post, Galetti said the company is making ""organizational changes across Amazon” that will result in an “overall reduction in our corporate workforce of approximately 14,000 roles”. However, some newly filed documents recently revealed that engineers bore the brunt of the cuts. As reported by CNBC, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) filings in New York, California, New Jersey and Washington show that nearly 40% of the more than 4,700 job cuts in those states were engineering roles, disproportionately affecting mid-level software engineers (SDE II). The filings represent only part of the total layoffs announced in October, as reporting requirements vary by state.As per the report, the job cuts mark the largest layoff round in Amazon’s history, aligning the company with other tech giants that have slashed jobs despite strong profits. As reported by Layoffs.fyi, nearly 113,000 jobs have been cut across 231 tech companies in 2025, continuing a post-pandemic trend of belt-tightening.Amazon insists AI was not the main cause for the layoffs, the company is shifting resources toward artificial intelligence. Jassy has predicted that corporate headcount will shrink in coming years as efficiency gains from AI take hold. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has been pushing to reshape Amazon’s culture into what he calls “the world’s largest startup,” urging teams to operate leaner and faster by cutting layers of bureaucracy. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” Jassy said while speaking at the company’s quarterly earnings call. “It really — it's culture,” he added.“And if you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers,” Jassy explained during the earnings call.The WARN filling also showed significant cuts in other division as well. The layoffs impacted Game designers, artists, and producers made up over a quarter of layoffs in Irvine and 11% in San Diego. Amazon is halting much of its work on big-budget MMO titles, including a plannedgame.Also units behind Amazon Lens and Lens Live were heavily impacted, particularly in Palo Alto. More than 140 ad sales and marketing roles were eliminated in New York, about 20% of the 760 positions cut there.Over 500 roles were eliminated, representing more than 10% of total cuts.","Amazon announced last month that it is cutting around 14,000 corporate jobs.

What the study found



Dangers Of AI: Is ChatGPT Quietly Harming Your Mental Health? | Global Pulse

Why this is dangerous for teenagers



How AI companies responded







Research from Common Sense Media and Stanford Medicine’s Brainstorm Lab study has found that AI chatbots pose significant dangers to teenagers seeking mental-health support, frequently missing critical warning signs and failing to recognise psychiatric emergencies despite appearing competent in some areas. The joint research tested four leading AI platforms, namely: OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini and Meta AI, and researchers pose as teens in mental-health conversations.According to the results (via The Wall Street Journal), all platforms routinely failed to identify signs of serious mental-health conditions, including hallucinations, paranoid thinking, disordered eating, manic symptoms, self-harm and depressive symptoms. Rather than directing users to urgent professional help, the chatbots continued offering general advice.In one example, a chatbot provided suggestions for hiding scars to a tester who had previously reported self-cutting. Chatbots also frequently dispensed diet and exercise tips when presented with disordered-eating symptoms.The study also found that while chatbots responded appropriately to clear mental-health prompts in brief exchanges, their safeguards weakened during longer conversations designed to mirror real teen usage.They also lacked judgment to recognise when symptoms indicated serious risk.According to Dr. Nina Vasan, director of Stanford Medicine's Brainstorm Lab, teenagers face heightened risks because their brains, identities and critical-thinking skills are still developing.“When these normal developmental vulnerabilities encounter AI systems designed to be engaging, validating and available 24/7, the combination is particularly dangerous,” she said.OpenAI said the report doesn’t reflect current safeguards and emphasised collaboration with clinicians, policymakers, and researchers. The company spokesperson added that it is developing age-prediction technology to direct users under 18 to different models.Similarly, Google stated that Gemini has specific policies and safeguards for minors, supported by child-safety experts who identify risks and implement protections.As per a spokesperson for Facebok-parent Meta, the study predated recent updates making its AI safer for teens on topics including self-harm, suicide, and eating disorders.“While mental health is a complex, individualised issue, we're always working to improve our protections,” a spokesperson noted. Anthropic noted that Claude isn't built for minors and company rules prohibit users under 18.","Research from Common Sense Media and Stanford Medicine’s Brainstorm Lab study has found that AI chatbots pose significant dangers to teenagers seeking mental- health support.

“We have built enough strength as a company to weather great models shipping elsewhere competition... (so), having most of our research team focused on really getting to superintelligence is critically important,”

“It s**ks that we have to do so many hard things at the same time — the best research lab, the best AI infrastructure company, and the best AI platform/product company — but such is our lot in life. And I wouldn't trade positions with any other company,”

ChatGPT maker OpenAI 's CEO Sam Altman is optimistic about Google 's recent successes in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. In a recent internal memo to colleagues, Altman acknowledged that the AI startup rival's success couldHowever, Altman reassured that OpenAI isand anticipates emerging as the leader in the AI race. It's important to note that Altman's memo was written before Google's Gemini 3 was released, a model the tech giant has described as its most capable to date. Software developers have reported that the new model performed well on tasks such as automating website and product design and writing code, which is a lucrative revenue stream for OpenAI and its competitors, such as Anthropic.Concerns about OpenAI's slowing growth arose late this summer. During a recent quarterly earnings call with investors, the company’s CFO, Sarah Friar, confirmed that user engagement with the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT had cooled, despite the company's otherwise positive financial results.According to a report by The Information (as seen by The Economic Times), Altman's memo noted that competitors such as Google and Anthropic are narrowing the gap in the AI raceAnthropic’s Claude model generates computer code for various tasks using conversational prompts.Meanwhile, Google has been integrating its Gemini AI chatbot into its search app, productivity tools and other services. However, recently, Claude gained a new challenger from OpenAI with the introduction of Codex.Google also holds an economic advantage. OpenAI’s growth has been rapid and the company now carries a valuation of around $500 billion as a for-profit entity. It is expected to bring in about $13 billion in revenue, but is estimated to burn roughly $100 billion in its push toward superintelligence.With a market value of about $3.5 trillion, Google reported free cash flow of over $70 billion in the past four quarters. A significant portion of this comes from providing cloud services to OpenAI, Anthropic and other competitors.Altman also encouraged OpenAI employees to stay confident and focus on the company's larger goals.Altman wrote in the internal memo.Altman added.Recently, OpenAI partnered with Apple's biggest suuplier Foxconn to design and build AI data-centre components in the US.

Safety remains the most pressing concern for women working in India's music industry, with more than half identifying it as an urgent challenge that needs addressing, according to new research commissioned by Spotify.The study, conducted by YouGov in September and released this month, surveyed over 1,000 respondents across India—70% of them women—working in various music industry roles from singers and composers to sound engineers and label executives.More than 56% of women surveyed listed safe and inclusive work environments among their top five challenges, ranking it above work-life balance and representation issues. Critically, over a third reported personally experiencing unsafe or non-inclusive workplaces, indicating these concerns reflect real experiences rather than just perception.The research also revealed significant gaps in leadership opportunities and mentorship. Women in technical fields like sound engineering and production reported the lowest satisfaction with growth opportunities, with only 31% rating them as excellent compared to 50% across other roles.Nearly 40% cited lack of mentorship support as a barrier, while 39% reported limited access to leadership and decision-making positions.Work-life balance emerged as another major factor, with 52% ranking it among top concerns and 33% calling for stronger family and community support to sustain long-term music careers.""Safety, visibility, and inclusion remain central to creating an equitable music industry,"" said Dhruvank Vaidya, Head of Music and Podcast at Spotify India. The company has been addressing these issues through initiatives like EQUAL, which amplifies women artists' voices globally.The study identified potential solutions including creating safe community spaces, increasing women's leadership visibility, providing mentorship networks, and enabling better work-life balance structures. About 31% of respondents suggested brands and platforms could best support women by establishing safe spaces and collaborative networks.Spotify hosted its first EQUAL event in India this week, bringing together women artists, label executives, and music entrepreneurs for networking and mentorship opportunities.","More than half of women in India's music industry report unsafe or non-inclusive workplaces.

Tesla has shown early demonstrations of the robot performing slow, controlled tasks such as picking up objects and handling an egg. Musk has discussed plans to scale production, though commercial readiness has not been confirmed.Musk also said Optimus could reshape labour, support medical work, and influence economic models if the technology matures.

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has dismissed the allegations that a recently hired executive brought proprietary information from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to the American chipmaker, asserting that Intel respects intellectual property rights. The comments came a day after Taiwan's High Prosecutors Office launched an inquiry to determine whether any laws were violated, according to spokesman John Nieh. TSMC also initiated an internal investigation to assess whether Lo removed trade secrets without authorisation.“It's rumor and speculation. There's nothing to it. We respect IP,"" Tan told Bloomberg News at the Semiconductor Industry Association Awards in San Jose.Lo Wen-jen, a 75-year-old semiconductor industry veteran, retired from TSMC in July after a long career and joined Intel in recent weeks. Taiwanese media outlets have spent the past week reporting allegations that Lo took proprietary knowledge from TSMC just before his departure. Lo previously served as TSMC's head of corporate strategy and played a pivotal role in the mass production of cutting-edge chips, including AI accelerators.Before joining TSMC in 2004, Lo worked at Intel on advanced technology development, including managing a chip factory in Santa Clara, California. He holds a doctorate in solid state physics and surface chemistry from UC Berkeley and is a laureate of Taiwan's prestigious Industrial Technology Research Institute.Taiwan's government has expressed concern about the national security implications.“The government is concerned with national security implications,” said economic affairs minister Kung Ming-hsin on Wednesday (November 19), while national science and technology council minister Wu Cheng-wen confirmed TSMC’s ongoing investigation.TSMC, now valued at over $1.15 trillion, dominates global contract chipmaking and has surpassed Intel as the industry leader. The Taiwanese company's fabrication techniques and proprietary data represent critical trade secrets with strategic importance for the self-governing island. TSMC exclusively manufactures the most advanced chips for Apple and Nvidia.","Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan dismisses allegations that a recently hired executive brought proprietary information from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to Intel. Lo Wen-jen, a 75-year-old semiconductor industry veteran, retired from TSMC in July after a long career and joined Intel in recent weeks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125486666,imgsize-24246,width-400,resizemode-4/intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan.jpg"
"Four, including CTO of AI startup, charged for plotting export of restricted Nvidia chips to China, Hong Kong",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/four-including-cto-of-ai-startup-charged-for-plotting-export-of-restricted-nvidia-chips-to-china-hong-kong/articleshow/125486591.cms,"Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

What Nvidia chips were involved in illegal export







Four men have been indicted on federal criminal charges for allegedly planning a scheme to illegally export millions of dollars worth of restricted Nvidia chips to China and Hong Kong, bypassing strict US export controls designed to limit access to advanced AI and supercomputing technology, a report has said. Citing court documents, CNBC reported that the indictment reveals a complex operation that routed the highly controlled chips through Malaysia and Thailand to evade detection. The defendants failed to obtain required licenses from the Commerce Department for the exports, prosecutors said.Brian Curtis Raymond, 46, of Huntsville, Alabama, owned a technology products distributor called Bitworks that has been licensed to sell Nvidia GPUs. Just last week, Raymond was announced as the chief technology officer of Corvex, a Virginia-based AI cloud company planning to go public through a merger.Following the indictment, Corvex rescinded his job offer and confirmed he was never an employee, only a consultant transitioning to a full-time role.The three other defendants – Mathew Ho (also known as Hon Ning Ho), Jing Chen (Harry Chen), and Cham Li (Tony Li) – were all born in China or Hong Kong.Ho, 34, is a US citizen living in Florida who served as registered agent for Janford Realtor, a Tampa company that prosecutors say never conducted real estate transactions but instead facilitated illegal chip exports.All four defendants face conspiracy charges for violating the Export Control Reform Act of 2018. Raymond faces additional charges including money laundering related to over $3.4 million in wire transfers, smuggling, and multiple export control violations. If convicted, each defendant faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.The alleged scheme involved submitting false documents about shipment consignees, chip values, and export licenses.According to the US Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida, 400 Nvidia A100 chips were successfully exported to China between October 2024 and January 2025 in two separate shipments. Law enforcement disrupted two additional attempted exports involving 10 Hewlett Packard Enterprise supercomputers with Nvidia H100 GPUs and 50 separate Nvidia H200 GPUs.The indictment emphasises that China “is rapidly developing exascale supercomputing capabilities and has announced its intent to be the world leader in AI by 2030.” These advanced chips enable capabilities being used for military modernisation and weapons design and testing, including weapons of mass destruction, according to prosecutors.","Four men indicted on federal criminal charges for allegedly planning a scheme to illegally export millions of dollars worth of restricted Nvidia chips to China and Hong Kong.

AI-Powered Future: Next Gen Careers You Should Watch

The age of AI agents







Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has shared a job-seeking advice with his teenage daughters that resonate far beyond his family in this era dominated by artificial intelligence. As reported by Business Insider, Sunak offered a valuable lesson for engineering graduates entering today’s workforce. Speaking at Bloomberg’s New Economy Forum in Singapore, Sunak said that while young professionals may soon find themselves managing AI bots, they must not become robotic themselves. “We’re never going to lose the importance of being able to think, to reason, to question critically,” Sunak said. “Those skills will be incredibly important for our young people to develop.”As per the BI report, Sunak also emphasised on two parallel skill sets. He said that one should master tools like generative AI and autonomous agents to remain competitive. Also, give importance to human-to-human interaction such as empathy, critical thinking, and communication, which machines cannot replicate.Sunak further noted that his perspective is informed by Stanford economists and LinkedIn data, both pointing to the rising demand for hybrid skills in the job market.Sunak joined tech leaders such as Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei in predicting that workers will soon manage teams of AI agents — software programs capable of autonomously handling tasks. “Everyone, whether you’re a new graduate or a senior leader, is going to have to get used to managing a team of agents,” Sunak said. He added that graduates must learn how to divide tasks among agents, verify accuracy, and stay curious, underscoring the need for lifelong learning.Since leaving office in July 2024, Sunak has taken advisory roles at Microsoft, Anthropic, and Goldman Sachs, deepening his involvement in the AI sector. His comments build on his legacy as host of the UK’s first AI Safety Summit in 2023, which drew leaders including then–US Vice President Kamala Harris, Elon Musk, and Sam Altman. At the Bloomberg event, Sunak argued that countries can adopt AI both quickly and safely, advocating for hands-off regulation while encouraging governments to collaborate with AI labs to evaluate risks.","Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has shared a job-seeking advice with his teenage daughters that resonate far beyond his family in this era dominated by artificial intelligence.

Google Nano Banana Pro: Pricing and availability





Google released Nano Banana Pro, its latest AI image generation model that addresses longstanding issues with text rendering in AI-generated images. Built on the Gemini 3 Pro language model, the updated tool offers better text accuracy, higher resolution outputs, and more editing controls than its predecessor, though at a significantly higher price point.The model generates images at up to 4K resolution and it's available now in the Gemini app, Google Workspace applications, and through developer APIs.Text has been a persistent problem for AI image generators. Most models struggle to produce legible text with correct spelling, limiting their usefulness for practical applications like posters, product mockups, or infographics.Nano Banana Pro handles text more reliably than previous versions. The model can render text in multiple languages and styles, from headlines to longer paragraphs, while maintaining better accuracy in spelling and layout. Users can specify fonts, request different calligraphy styles, or integrate text into scenes.The model connects to Google Search to pull real-time information for generating data-driven visuals. This allows it to create infographics with current information, recipe cards with specific instructions, or visualizations of weather data—though users should verify factual accuracy, as Google acknowledges the model isn't infallible with data representation.Translation capabilities let users localise designs for different markets. A marketing image created for one region can be regenerated with translated text for another, though Google notes the model may still make grammar mistakes or miss cultural nuances.Nano Banana Pro adds editing controls that previously required dedicated photo editing software. Users can adjust camera angles, lighting conditions, depth of field, and color grading through text prompts rather than manual tools.The model supports various aspect ratios and generates images from 1K to 4K resolution, with some outputs reaching 5632 x 3072 pixels. It can maintain consistency across up to five people and blend up to 14 input images, which is useful for creating series of related images or maintaining brand consistency.Editing features include transforming lighting conditions (day to night), adjusting focus, applying effects like bokeh blur, and changing specific elements within an image. The model can also convert sketches into more detailed renderings or apply consistent styling across different mockups.Google acknowledges current limitations: the model may struggle with small faces, fine details, and perfect spelling consistency. Complex edits involving lighting changes or blending multiple images can sometimes produce artifacts.All generated images include Google's SynthID invisible watermark. Users can upload images to the Gemini app to verify whether they were created by Google's AI tools. Free and Pro tier images also display a visible Gemini sparkle watermark, which is removed for Ultra subscribers but maintains the invisible digital watermark.Free Gemini app users get limited access before being reverted to the original Nano Banana model. Google AI Plus, Pro, and Ultra subscribers receive higher usage quotas, though specific limits aren't disclosed. Google Workspace customers can access the tool in Slides and Vids with promotional higher limits for at least 60 days.The model is integrated into several Google products: NotebookLM for subscribers, Google Ads for advertisers, and available through Gemini API and Google AI Studio for developers. Ultra subscribers also get access in Flow, Google's video tool.For enterprise users, the higher-quality outputs come with increased costs and slower generation times. Nano Banana Pro charges $0.139 for 1080p or 2K images and $0.24 for 4K images, compared to the original model's $0.039 per 1024px image.","Google released Nano Banana Pro, its latest AI image generation model that addresses longstanding issues with text rendering in AI-generated images.

Designing sound for the human experience: Why audio is more emotional than technical,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/designing-sound-for-the-human-experience-why-audio-is-more-emotional-than-technical/articleshow/125481690.cms,"The Shift: From utility to emotion



The science behind the feeling



Bluetooth Earbuds: The intimate companion



Soundbars: Redefining home immersion



Party Speakers : The pulse of celebration



Emotion is the new benchmark



By: Authored by Pulkit Bansal, head of audio category, Boat





If there’s one truth I’ve learned from decades in the audio industry, it’s this: good sound isn’t just heard—it’s felt. As humans, our relationship with sound runs deeper than frequencies and decibels. It taps directly into our emotions, memories, and even our physiology. That’s why designing sound for modern audio products—Bluetooth earbuds, soundbars, and party speakers—is less about chasing perfection on a graph and more about evoking a feeling. At Boat , every sonic decision we make is grounded in that philosophy.The global audio industry has undergone a seismic transformation in the last decade. Once, portable sound was a matter of convenience. Today, it’s a lifestyle signature. Consumers don’t just want to listen; they want to connect—with content, with others, and with themselves.This shift has forced every serious audio brand to rethink its design process. At boAt, we’ve moved beyond engineering for technical accuracy alone. We design for emotional resonance—because the average listener isn’t analyzing harmonic distortions; they’re judging how a song makes them feel.When that bass drop lands or when dialogue in a show feels intimate, that’s when technology steps aside and emotion takes over.When you dissect it, sound is pure physics—waves, frequency responses, impedance curves. But the moment those waves reach the human ear, something far more complex happens. The auditory cortex, limbic system, and memory centers collaborate to turn simple vibrations into emotion.That’s why we treat acoustic tuning as both a science and an art. For example, while designing our Airdopes earbuds, our sound engineers don’t just tune for clarity; they tune for warmth—a timbral quality that subconsciously signals comfort and presence. Similarly, in our soundbars, we amplify low-end frequencies around the 80–120 Hz range just slightly, because studies show that subtle bass enhancement increases the listener’s sense of immersion and emotional engagement.Wireless earbuds, like the boAt Airdopes line, sit closer to personal space than any other tech device. They’re the first thing we wear in the morning and the last thing we remove before sleep. The sound they deliver must blend seamlessly with life’s rhythm—be it commuting, working out, or winding down.Creating that seamlessness requires more than Bluetooth codec optimization; it demands emotional design. We balance EQ curves to ensure vocals feel center-stage and natural, while percussions maintain crispness without listener fatigue. Our spatial tuning emphasizes a sense of closeness, making podcasts sound conversational rather than mechanical.The future of earbuds lies at the intersection of personalization and AI. Soon, your Airdopes could intelligently adapt to your hearing profile, mood, and surrounding environment—dynamically shifting tonal balance just as your emotional state changes. Sound that understands you will no longer be science fiction; it will be personal wellness.As entertainment shifted from theaters to living rooms, audio brands took on a new challenge: how to make compact systems reproduce the scale of cinema. At boAt, our soundbars are tuned not just for accuracy, but for presence—the sensation of being enveloped by sound.True emotional immersion requires dynamic warmth, not just loudness. Our engineers employ psychoacoustic modeling, simulating how the human brain perceives large spaces, to craft a virtual surround that feels organic. The heart of a great home audio experience lies in the transitions: how a whisper moves to a roar, how a quiet rain evolves into thunder. Sound design must breathe, much like the human experience itself.We also recognize that content diversity demands versatility. A soundbar tuned for Bollywood musicals won't necessarily do justice to esports or classical concert films. That’s why our adaptive sound modes respond to content genre, ensuring that whether it’s laughter in a sitcom or the rev of an engine, every moment feels real.If earbuds are intimate and soundbars immersive, party speakers are pure emotion in motion. The design of a boAt PartyPal, for instance, is less about precision and more about impact. These speakers embody communal emotion—sound experienced together.What gives our party speakers their distinctive energy isn’t just wattage; it’s how we shape the frequency curve to resonate physically. Humans respond to energy in the 60–100 Hz range through vibration, so our bass tuning is engineered to be felt as much as heard. Add synchronized lighting and spatial EQ, and the experience becomes a multisensory celebration.The global party speaker trend underscores a key truth: people crave connection. Music remains the most universal social language. Whether at an impromptu beach gathering or a Diwali night terrace party, the right sound can turn a moment into a memory. That is audio’s greatest power.In the past, reviewers judged a sound system by THD percentages or codec support. Today, the true benchmark is emotional fidelity—how naturally sound aligns with human emotion. The boAt design philosophy embraces this evolution: every dB, driver size, and acoustic chamber curve must ultimately serve one purpose—to move the listener.As global audio technology progresses—spanning 360 Reality Audio, adaptive ANC, and low-latency streaming—the challenge remains constant: how do we make sound more human? Because when we strip away the tech, what remains is feeling.At boAt, we believe the next era of sound won’t just be high-definition; it will be high-emotion. The future will belong to brands that understand that audio is not about perfection—it’s about connection.","The global audio industry has undergone a seismic transformation in the last decade. Consumers don’t just want to listen; they want to connect with content, with others, and with themselves. At boAt, we’ve moved beyond engineering for technical accuracy alone.

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

Going from business to philanthropy









Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed that he almost missed the chance of meeting his now closet friend and legendary investor Warren Buffet, back in 1991. What started as a reluctant introduction pushed by Gates’ mother turned into a daylong conversation which reshaped his point of view about business and also sparked a decades-long friendship.In a 1996 Harvard Business Review essay, Gates admitted that he doubted the value of taking a full day away from Microsoft to meet a ‘famous stock picker’ and discuss about ‘P/E ratios’. He agreed only after learning that Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham, whom he admired, would also be present.Once the meeting began, Buffett steered the conversation toward newspapers, IBM, and how industries evolve. Gates later wrote, “He [Warren Buffett] asked good questions and told educational stories. There’s nothing I like so much as learning.”The July 5, 1991 meeting at Gates family’s weekend home introduces Gates to one of Buffet’s favourite analytical exercises. Warren believes in picking a year and listing the 10 most valuable companies and then jump ahead 20 years to see which endured. Buffet’s enthusiasm proved to be contagious as Gates who planned to leave after sometime stayed for the entire day and later agreed to visit Nebraska to watch a football game with him and start a lasting bond.The shared curiosity of Buffet and Gates also extended into philanthropy. Both Gates and buffet collaborated via the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Buffett’s Giving Pledge. Both emphasised learning and long-term thinking as guiding principles. Buffett’s longtime partner Charlie Munger once described him as a “learning machine,” highlighting his daily habit of reading for hours.The friendship has endured even as both men stepped back from their corporate responsibilities. Gates resigned from the Microsoft board in 2020, while Buffett, now 95, has begun easing away from center stage at Berkshire Hathaway. In a Thanksgiving letter released this week, Buffett told shareholders he will no longer write the company’s annual report or speak extensively at meetings, saying he is “going quiet. Sort of.”","The July 5, 1991 meeting introduces Gates to one of Buffet’s favourite analytical exercises.

Google's Quick Share now works with Apple's AirDrop on Pixel 10 phones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/googles-quick-share-now-works-with-apples-airdrop-on-pixel-10-phones/articleshow/125481070.cms,"In a surprising development, Google has enabled Pixel 10 users to share files directly with iPhones using a feature akin to AirDrop. This seamless, peer-to-peer transfer works both ways, requiring minimal setup on both devices. Google developed this independently, with a security firm validating its robust and secure nature. While currently exclusive to the Pixel 10 series, the company intends to roll it out to other Android devices later.

No Apple collaboration required, Google built this alone

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!





In a move nobody saw coming, Google just made it possible for Pixel 10 owners to share files directly with iPhones through AirDrop. The feature works both ways—you can send files to an iPhone and receive them back, all without jumping through hoops or using workarounds.The setup is straightforward. iPhone users need to set AirDrop to ""Everyone for 10 Minutes"" mode, and then Pixel devices show up as sharing targets. On the flip side, Pixel owners can receive AirDropped files from iPhones by enabling a similar visibility setting in Quick Share. The feature works with iPhones, iPads, and Macs.Here's where it gets interesting: Google did this entirely on its own. Apple wasn't involved at all. ""We accomplished this through our own implementation,"" a Google spokesperson told multiple outlets. The company even hired NetSPI, an independent security firm, to validate that everything works safely. What does this independent firm has to say? The interoperability is ""notably stronger"" than similar cross-platform solutions.Google insists the connection is secure—direct peer-to-peer sharing means your data never touches a server, nothing gets logged, and no extra information is shared between devices.It's the same level of security you'd expect from native AirDrop transfers.Right now, only the Pixel 10 series can do this: the regular Pixel 10, Pro, Pro XL, and Pro Fold. Google says it plans to expand the feature to other Android devices eventually, though no timeline was mentioned.This is Google's latest attempt to tear down the walls between Android and iPhone, following its successful push to get RCS messaging on iPhones. The big question now: will Apple let this stand, or will a future iOS update suddenly ""fix"" this unauthorized compatibility?","Google has enabled Pixel 10 users to share files directly with iPhones using a feature akin to AirDrop.

What happens when the entire internet goes down

Why nothing is getting fixed

The future we may be stuck with





Earlier this week, X (or as some still call it Twitter) stopped showing posts or even let people post. ChatGPT threw error messages. Spotify went silent mid-song. Even McDonald's self-service kiosks displayed the dreaded ""500 Error,"" leaving people staring at blank screens while their stomachs growled.The culprit was Cloudflare—the infrastructure company responsible for keeping huge swaths of the internet running smoothly—experiencing what they diplomatically called an outage caused by an automatically generated configuration file that grew beyond its expected size, triggering a crash in the software system handling traffic for multiple services. The whole thing lasted a few hours, but the disruption was highly visible and affected high-profile clients including X, Spotify and Zoom.And here's what nobody wants to admit: this keeps happening. Every few weeks, sometimes more often, large chunks of the internet just stop working. Over the last year, multiple outages have had happened. In February, over 74,000 AT&T customers couldn't call 911 because of a cloud misconfiguration. In June, Google Cloud's automated quota update took down Spotify, Discord, and even Cloudflare's own authentication systems.In October, AWS went dark for several hours. Days later, Microsoft Azure experienced a major outage that grounded Alaska Airlines flights and disrupted Xbox Live, Microsoft 365, and corporate systems.The pattern is clear and it's getting worse. Cisco's network monitoring service has logged 12 major outages in 2025 so far, 23 in 2024 and 13 in 2023. Cloud service provider outages climbed from 17% to 27% of all outages in 2024, while ISP outages decreased from 83% to 73%.The internet was supposed to be resilient. It was literally designed to survive nuclear war, with no single point of failure. So why does it keep collapsing like a house of cards?The internet's origin story is all about decentralisation. When it was first conceived, the whole point was creating a network where damage to one part wouldn't bring down the whole system. Traffic would just route around problems. That was the theory.But somewhere between that idealistic vision and today's reality, we took a hard turn toward consolidation. Services like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure now power millions of websites. They got so good at what they do, so efficient and so cheap, that everyone from tiny startups to big tech decided it made more sense to rent their infrastructure than build their own. AWS alone made $107 billion last year. Google Cloud Platform has a customer base of nearly 960,000. These companies add tens of thousands of new properties to their portfolios each day.The problem should be obvious: when that much of the internet depends on a handful of central players, those players become exactly what the internet was designed to avoid—single points of failure. The internet's physical infrastructure—servers, data centres, fibre cables, and cloud platforms—is increasingly centralised, and this concentration creates vulnerability where if a major provider goes offline, large parts of the internet can become inaccessible.You might use a dozen different apps and websites every day, each from different companies. But peek under the hood and there's a good chance they're all running on the same servers in the same data centre. When that data centre has a bad day, all those seemingly independent services go down together. When a single API misconfiguration at Google cascades into outages for Cloudflare, Spotify and countless others, you realise how reliant some very important Internet-based services are on a relatively few major players.The June Google Cloud outage made this painfully clear. What started as intermittent failures on Gmail and Spotify soon escalated into a global infrastructure meltdown, with API requests across dozens of regions failing with 503 errors within minutes. Service degradation was detected across 157 cities spanning North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Multiple layers including analytics, cloud logging, storage, and identity all failed in tandem, directly impacting third-party tools, CDNs, and SaaS integrations downstream. It wasn't just direct customers who felt the pain—it was everyone who depended on services that depended on those services, multiple layers deep.Here's where things get technical, but stick with me because this matters. Most major outages trace back to a few recurring technical issues that expose how fragile the underlying systems really are.DNS—Domain Name System—is at the heart of many failures. It's effectively the phone book of the internet, translating names to numbers and back again billions of times per second. DNS allows human-friendly naming to be converted into network addresses in a globally consistent fashion, serving as a necessary function having centralisation risk. When you type a website address into your browser, DNS tells your computer where that site actually lives. Without it, a lot of systems have no clue where other systems are.The October AWS outage? DNS resolution issues for regional database service endpoints. When AWS's database couldn't properly resolve domain names, every service that relied on those lookups—from messaging apps to payment systems found themselves unable to connect. One tiny software glitch where two programs competed to write the same DNS entry at the same time, and suddenly people couldn't order lunch or check their bank accounts.The AT&T outage in February last year, which affected over hundreds of millions people, was likely caused by a cloud misconfiguration related to how cellular services hand off calls from one network to the next, a process known as peering. One mistake in how networks talk to each other, and about 74,000 people couldn't call emergency services across the US.Then there's the configuration management problem. Microsoft's July Azure outage in 2024 happened during routine updates to the VM Host fleet. An update to the network security 'Allow List' was generated, but the configuration change caused backend access to be blocked between Azure Storage clusters and compute resources. Virtual machines automatically restarted when they lost connectivity to their virtual disks. Companies that had carefully architected their systems for high availability found themselves offline anyway.These systems have gotten incredibly complex. AWS offers over 240 different services. Each one has thousands of settings and configurations. The companies running these services employ some of the smartest engineers on the planet. They have monitoring systems and redundancy and disaster recovery plans. But the scale they're operating at is almost incomprehensible. When you're handling billions of requests per second across dozens of data centres, even a 0.01% error rate means millions of failures. One typo in a configuration file, one buggy software update, and millions of people can't do their jobs.The automation that's supposed to make these systems more reliable also makes them more brittle. Systems are so complex that humans can't monitor them all manually, so companies use automated tools. But those tools can fail too, often in unexpected ways. The June Google outage stemmed from an automated quota update. The Cloudflare incident was caused by an automatically generated configuration file that grew too large. Most of the major outages of in the last year have stemmed from a backend configuration change that had unintended consequences or the failure of an automated system.You'd think companies would have learned by now. Build redundancy. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Have a backup plan. But redundancy is expensive, complicated, and often doesn't work the way people think it does.A company might split their infrastructure between AWS and Microsoft Azure. Different providers, different data centres, problem solved, right? Not quite. Both services might use the same undersea cables. Or the same DNS providers. Or the same routing protocols. When those fail, both ""redundant"" systems go down together. Friction against switching to a substitute provider of a function often leads to concentration, and if switching requires significant time, resources, expertise, coordination, loss of functionality, or effort, centralisation risk is indicated.The UniSuper disaster is a classic example of the same. UniSuper had duplication in two geographies as a protection against outages and loss, but when the deletion of UniSuper's Private Cloud subscription occurred at Google, it caused deletion across both of these geographies. Their redundancy strategy failed catastrophically because it was all within the same cloud provider. All their careful planning, all their backup systems, gone in an instant because of one mistake.Even worse, one fine afternoon mid-week, Google Cloud ran maintenance automation intended to shutdown an unused network control component in a single location. It worked. But it also worked in about 40 other locations they hadn't intended. The result was nearly three hours during which new virtual machine instances were provisioned without network connectivity.This is why cascading failures are so dangerous. Modern web services don't exist in isolation—they're stacked on top of each other like a precarious tower of blocks. Your favourite social media app might run on AWS servers. Those servers use Cloudflare for security and speed. The app itself relies on a dozen other services for payment processing, image hosting, and user authentication. Each of those services has its own stack of dependencies. A database error can propagate in just 42 minutes, affecting half of the Internet, illustrating how a central database responsible for managing critical functions becomes the Achilles' heel of the entire online infrastructure.Pull out the wrong block and suddenly half the tower comes down with it. Google's Service Control—the system that sits between every client and backend in Google Cloud's API infrastructure, responsible for verifying if API requests are authorised, enforcing quota limits, checking policy rules, and logging requests—when it fails, everything fails. And when those failures ripple outward, they hit systems that nobody anticipated would be affected.It's easy to laugh when social media goes down or when you can't order coffee through an app. First world problems, right? But these outages have real consequences that go far beyond missing a few social media posts.During the Azure outage, emergency services were the most impacted, with around 68 times more outage reports than the daily average. The airline industry witnessed a significant increase of approximately 50 times in outage reports. Airlines including Frontier, American, and United grounded flights. Melbourne airport experienced a global technology issue impacting check-in procedures. The UK's Thameslink Railway brands experienced service disruptions, as did the NHS health service, Microsoft services including Xbox Live and Teams, Australian banking apps and supermarket systems. People couldn't get to work. Couldn't access healthcare. Couldn't buy groceries.The AT&T outage last year had an even more disturbing dimension. The San Francisco Fire Department posted on X that the outage was preventing people from contacting emergency services. Imagine having an actual emergency and not being able to call for help because a telecom company made a configuration error.In March 2024, Meta experienced a technical issue that caused people to have difficulty accessing their services, with self-reported outages surging to more than 583,000 reports on Facebook alone. The outage covered not only Meta's major social media platforms and messaging services, but also Meta's Login with Facebook service, which allows users to log in to third-party sites. When authentication systems fail, entire ecosystems collapse. There seem to be very few Meta products this outage did not impact, suggesting that whatever went wrong was a single point of failure: something relied upon by all of Meta's services, without which the services can't function.We've built a world where you need the internet to pay for groceries, see a doctor, or call for help in an emergency. Since September 2023, large multi-tenant data centres have been officially designated as vital infrastructure, with the official reasoning being that failure of such data centres could realistically cause societal disruption and cascading failures, described as ""too big to fail"". When that internet goes down, modern life just stops.Here's the nightmare scenario that keeps infrastructure engineers up at night: what if it's not just one cloud provider that fails, but several at once? What if the internet itself—the whole thing—just stops working?It sounds far-fetched, but it's not as impossible as you might think. Most of the Internet's traffic now flows through the networks of a few large companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook, rather than through transit providers. The Internet's physical infrastructure is being reshaped to meet this new reality, and that concentration creates vulnerability.The most likely trigger for a total internet collapse wouldn't be a cyberattack or a natural disaster. It would be something mundane: a bug in a critical routing protocol. A misconfigured DNS update that propagates globally. An automated security system that mistakenly blocks legitimate traffic at scale. When Google Cloud's Service Control failed in June, it took down services across 157 cities worldwide within minutes. Now imagine if similar failures happened simultaneously at AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. The cascading effects would be catastrophic.Emergency services would be first to feel it. No 911 calls. No dispatch systems. No way for hospitals to access patient records or coordinate care. Banking would freeze—no ATMs, no card payments, no way to transfer money. Supply chains would seize up as logistics systems went dark. Even simple things like traffic lights in smart cities could fail.The scary part is that the internet wasn't designed for this level of centralisation. The original architecture assumed diversity and redundancy at every level. But as we've seen throughout 2024, that diversity has been eroded. At some point, infrastructure concentration becomes everyone's national security concern, and once infrastructure denial is in play, its use to enforce international sanctions is in play as well. A total internet outage isn't just a technical problem—it's a geopolitical weapon waiting to be deployed, whether intentionally or accidentally.You might hope that companies would learn from each outage and make real improvements. And they do try. After major incidents, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft publish detailed post-mortems explaining what went wrong and what they'll do differently. But the fundamental problems aren't getting fixed. They're accelerating.More companies are moving to the cloud every day. More services are becoming dependent on fewer providers. The consolidation continues because it makes economic sense—for now. Most Internet users seem perfectly happy getting their services from market-dominant providers without giving infrastructure any thought, but the price of centralisation is always increased invisible tail risk: exposure to truly enormous failures whose impacts are far-reaching.In the cloud era, it's common for even the most technically sophisticated companies to optimise for performance, cost and simplicity by leaning on one provider. But as these incidents show, that convenience comes with real risk, especially when foundational services like storage or API management are involved. The ratio of ISP to CSP outages changed dramatically, from 89:11 in 2022 to 83:17 in 2023, and in the first five months of 2024, that ratio accelerated significantly to 73:27. Cloud providers are having more problems, and they're having them more frequently.There's also a talent problem nobody likes to talk about. The industry has been impacted by significant layoffs since 2022. When your most experienced engineers leave, they take decades of institutional knowledge with them. The people who remember the last time something like this happened, who understand all the quirks and workarounds — they're gone. And the newer engineers are left managing systems of almost incomprehensible complexity.Because permission less innovation is a core value for the Internet, and yet much of the centralisation seen on the Internet is performed by proprietary platforms that take advantage of this nature, the controls available to standards efforts on their own are very limited.So where does this leave us?The honest answer is that nothing fundamental is going to change. The consolidation that created this mess also made the internet work better in every measurable way—faster, cheaper, more reliable on average. Companies will keep choosing convenience and cost savings over resilience because that's what makes sense on paper.What we'll see instead are modest adaptations around the edges. More companies will split critical functions across multiple cloud providers, though not as many as should. Emergency services will invest in backup systems that don't depend on the same infrastructure as consumer apps. Banks will build more redundancy into their payment networks after the embarrassment of having ATMs go dark during normal business hours.But the core problem remains. Most of the internet now runs through a handful of companies, and when those companies have bad days, everyone has bad days. The ratio of cloud provider outages keeps climbing—from 17% to 27% in just one year. The automation keeps getting more complex and more brittle. The experienced engineers who understand these systems keep leaving, taking their knowledge with them.The internet of 2025 looks nothing like the distributed network its creators envisioned. It's a few massive highways carrying all the traffic, and when there's an accident, everything stops. We've built a world where you need the internet to function, on top of infrastructure that breaks surprisingly often.The real question isn't whether the next outage will happen. It's whether it'll hit during a genuine emergency when people need to call, or access medical records, or coordinate disaster response. Whether it'll last three hours or three days. Whether the cascading failures will stop at one cloud provider or take down several at once.The best preparation is understanding the risk. Your banking app could vanish for hours. Your workplace could go dark mid-afternoon. The services you depend on might not be there when you actually need them. Keep some cash accessible. Have important phone numbers written down. Know how to reach emergency services without your phone working normally.Because the next time the internet goes down—and there will be a next time, probably soon—you'll want to have already thought about what matters and how to reach it without a screen.","Every few weeks, sometimes more often, large chunks of the internet just stop working. Cloud service provider outages climbed from 17% to 27% of all outages in 2024, while ISP outages decreased from 83% to 73%. The internet was supposed to be resilient. It was literally designed to survive nuclear war, with no single point of failure.

Australia expands teen social media ban to include Amazon’s Twitch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/australia-expands-teen-social-media-ban-to-include-amazons-twitch/articleshow/125478565.cms,"Twitch (Image Courtesy: Twitch via Variety)

Why Twitch was targeted



Boarder context





Australia has now widened its restrictions on teen access to social media. As reported by Reuters, Australia has now added Amazon-owned Twitch to the list of platforms banned for users under 16 years of age, while sparing Pinterest from the crackdown. This move by the Australian government is part of its ongoing efforts to address concerns about online safety, mental health and exposure to harmful content among young people. As per the Reuters report, the ban by the Australian government now covers Twitch, the popular live-streaming platform which is known for gaming and interactive broadcasts. On the other hand, Pinterest is now included in the list as regulators feel that its content posed less risk as compared to other platforms.These restrictions are part of Australia’s broader Online Safety Act, which has been under review amid rising concerns about the screen time in teens and also exposure to inappropriate material.As reported by Reuters, the Australian officials cited that the unfiltered nature of Twitch’s live is one of the key reasons which led to the ban of Twitch. The platform let users have realtime interactions which regulators feel can expose minors to bullying, harassment and harmful content without adequate safeguards.Australia has already banned platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat for users under 16 years of age. The government says that the bans are designed to reduce risks of addiction, cyberbullying, and mental health issues among teens. However, the critics argue the measures may be too heavy-handed, limiting young people’s access to creative and educational communities online.While Twitch has yet to issue a formal statement, industry observers note that the ban could significantly impact its Australian user base, particularly younger gamers who make up a large share of the platform’s audience. Pinterest, meanwhile, welcomed the decision to remain accessible, highlighting its focus on positive, creative content such as design, crafts, and lifestyle inspiration.","Australia has now added Amazon-owned Twitch to the list of platforms banned for users under 16 years of age.

WhatsApp rolls out Instagram Notes-like feature: Here’s how it works,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/whatsapp-rolls-out-instagram-notes-like-feature-heres-how-it-works/articleshow/125476831.cms,"What the feature does





Users can now post short text updates to let friends know what they’re up to, share thoughts, or explain why they might not be available.

These updates appear at the top of one-on-one chats and on user profiles, making them more visible than before.

Contacts can reply directly to an About status, turning it into a conversation starter.

About will now be easier to spot at the top of 1-1 chats and on your profile. You can also reply directly to people’s About by tapping on it in a chat.

WhatsApp Makes Group Calls Smarter

How to use the WhatsApp About feature





Open WhatsApp on your phone and go to the Chats tab. Tap on your profile picture or navigate to the About section in settings. Select “Add About” (or “Update About”) to create a new status. Type your short text update — e.g., “Busy today, will reply later” or “Traveling this weekend.” Choose visibility: Share with all contacts

Share with selected contacts

Hide from specific contacts Set duration: By default, About updates disappear after 24 hours, but you can adjust the timer for shorter or longer visibility. Tap Post. Your About will now show up at the top of one-on-one chats and on your profile.





WhatsApp has started rolling out a new status update feature which is similar to the popular Notes feature of Instagram. Named as ‘About’ the feature enable the users to share short text updates which will be visible to their contacts. “For those of you that have used WhatsApp from the very start, you’ll remember About was our first feature. Even before we brought the world private and secure messaging, we made it simple for you to quickly share what’s up in your life. Today we're reintroducing and improving About, making it more visible, timely, and easier to use,” said WhatsApp in a blog post.Same as Instagram Notes, the new WhatsApp About status will also disappear after 24 hours by default. However, users will be able to adjust the timer in orderto make the update vanish sooner or last longer. The privacy controls also allow users to decide if their About status is visible only to contacts or more broadly.At launch, WhatsApp’s version is simpler than Instagram Notes, which supports short looping videos and music integrations. WhatsApp’s About feature currently focuses on text-only updates, but Meta hinted that more enhancements could be added if adoption grows.","WhatsApp has started rolling out a new status update feature which is similar to the popular Notes feature of Instagram.

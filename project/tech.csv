What Google DeepMind CEO told University of Cambridge students

Demis Hassabis , CEO of Google DeepMind , announced at the Google I/O developer conference recently that the research lab is less than 10 years away from achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI), the ultimate goal of the ongoing generative AI arms race. Speaking live, Hassabis emphasized the transformative potential of AI, predicting significant workplace disruption but also the creation of new, valuable, and engaging jobs within the next five to 10 years.Hassabis, who leads Google’s AI initiatives including the Gemini chatbot, advised young people, particularly college students, to “immerse” themselves in AI technologies and become proficient in using cutting-edge tools. “Whatever happens with these AI tools, you’ll be better off understanding how they work and what you can do with them,” he said, urging students to focus on “learning to learn” to stay adaptable in a rapidly changing technological landscape.In an earlier interview at the University of Cambridge, where Hassabis graduated, he shared similar advice with students, emphasizing adaptability as a critical skill. Responding to questions submitted by undergraduates, he encouraged them to understand their learning styles and develop the ability to quickly master new material. “The world you’re entering will face an incredible amount of disruption and change,” he told students during a March discussion with Professor Alastair Beresford at Queens’ College, Cambridge.Hassabis highlighted emerging fields like AI, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and quantum computing as promising industries over the next decade. He noted that technological shifts historically disrupt some jobs but create others that are often more interesting and valuable, as discussed on the “Hard Fork” podcast with hosts Kevin Roose and Casey Newton.The generative AI race, sparked by OpenAI’s ChatGPT release in 2022, has fueled rapid advancements, raising both excitement and concerns about its impact on society. Hassabis stressed that students should combine their passions with core skills to seize opportunities in this evolving landscape. “Anytime there is change, there is also huge opportunity,” he said, encouraging graduates to blend deep knowledge of their interests with adaptability to thrive in an AI-driven future.""Over the next 5 to 10 years, I think we're going to find what normally happens with big new technology shifts, which is that some jobs get disrupted,"" he recently told co-hosts Kevin Roose and Casey Newton on an episode of ""Hard Fork,"" a podcast about the future of technology. However, he said, ""new, more valuable, usually more interesting jobs get created"" in the wake of that kind of disruption.","Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, spoke at the Google I/O developer conference.

Speaking to reporters before boarding Air Force One in New Jersey, President Trump echoed remarks made by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on April 29, who downplayed the need for a ""booming textile industry."" Bessent’s comments had sparked backlash from the National Council of Textile Organizations. ""We're not looking to make sneakers and T-shirts. We want to make military equipment. We want to make big things. We want to make, do the AI thing,"" Trump said, as quoted by Reuters.He added, ""I'm not looking to make T-shirts, to be honest. I'm not looking to make socks. We can do that very well in other locations. We are looking to do chips and computers and lots of other things, and tanks and ships.""The American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA) criticized Trump’s tariff approach, arguing it would harm the industry. ""With 97% of the clothes and shoes we wear being imported, and with clothes and shoes already the most highly tariffed industry in the U.S., we need to focus on common sense solutions that can move the needle,"" AAFA President Steve Lamar said in a statement. ""More tariffs will only mean higher input costs for U.S. manufacturers and higher prices that will hurt lower income consumers.""Donald Trump extends EU deadline to July 9Trump, who has disrupted global markets with widespread tariffs, recently proposed a 50% tariff on European Union goods starting June 1 and threatened a 25% levy on imported iPhones that are not made in the US. Last week, Trump softened his stance on the EU tariffs , extending the deadline to July 9 to allow for negotiations with the 27-nation bloc.Trump’s victories in the 2016 and 2024 presidential elections were reportedly partly driven by support from working-class voters affected by the decline of U.S. manufacturing jobs. His administration has pushed tariffs to encourage domestic production and attract investments, though the U.S. economy remains reliant on global supply chains for cost-effective goods, including textiles.","US President Donald Trump emphasized that his tariff policies are designed to bolster domestic manufacturing of high-tech products and military equipment.

US Vice President JD Vance wants Americans to stop using dating apps: They ‘are probably more destructive than…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-vice-president-jd-vance-wants-americans-to-stop-using-dating-apps-they-are-probably-more-destructive-than/articleshow/121419233.cms,"US Vice-President JD Vance (AP)

What JD Vance said about the dating apps



“If you look at basic dating behaviour among young people — and I think a lot of this is that the dating apps are probably more destructive than we fully appreciate — I think part of it is technology has just for some reason made it harder for young men and young women to communicate with each other in the same way. Our young men and women just aren’t dating, and if they’re not dating, they’re not getting married, they’re not starting families.”

“Our people aren’t having enough children to replace themselves”,

“childless cat ladies”

“miserable.”

US Vice President JD Vance is calling on Americans to stop using dating apps. He argued that these apps are ""destructive"" and restrict young people from forming traditional relationships and families. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Vance shared his concerns linking modern technology to declining family formation in the US. During the interview, when the Vice President was asked if artificial intelligence is a threat to American jobs, he dismissed the same and stated that dating apps like Tinder and Bumble pose the real societal concern from technology. The reply came after NYT’s Ross Douthat asked if he was worried about AI's capacity to induce a sense of “obsolescence” in humans. Vance said that he did not believe AI truly threatened Americans' jobs or welfare; instead, he identified dating apps as the primary societal threat stemming from technology.In the interview, Vance said:Vance also criticised dating apps for undermining traditional dating and the nuclear family favoured by the Trump administration. Previously, he expressed concern about the national birth rate .

Nvidia may launch more affordable version of its most powerful GPUs for China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-may-launch-more-affordable-version-of-its-most-powerful-gpus-for-china/articleshow/121417953.cms,"Price of Nvidia's affordable AI chips for China



What is changing in Nvidia's affordable AI chips for China



Why China is important market for Nvidia



Nvidia is preparing to release a new artificial intelligence (AI) chip for the Chinese market at a significantly lower price point than its restricted H20 model, a report has claimed. The new chip, part of Nvidia's Blackwell architecture lineup, is said to enter mass production by June.Citing sources familiar with the matter, news agency Reuters said that the graphics processing unit (GPU) is expected to cost between $6,500 and $8,000 -- below the $10,000 to $12,000 price of the H20 chip it replaces. The reduced price is said to be due to scaled-back specifications and simplified manufacturing requirements.Notably, the upcoming chip will reportedly be based on Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, using GDDR7 memory instead of the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) used in more advanced models. It will also not include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s CoWoS packaging technology.Nvidia has not officially disclosed the specifications, price, or launch timeline of the chip.A company spokesperson said Nvidia is still evaluating its ""limited"" options for the Chinese market and awaits approval from US authorities.“Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the US government, we are effectively foreclosed from China’s $50 billion data center market,” the spokesperson was quoted as saying.The move is Nvidia's third attempt to develop a GPU tailored for China after US restrictions blocked earlier models from being exported. China accounted for 13% of Nvidia’s sales in the last fiscal year.Despite its reduced computing power, the new GPU is seen as a necessary step for Nvidia to maintain a presence in China.Industry analysts expect Chinese firms to close the performance gap with downgraded Nvidia chips within one to two years. However, Nvidia maintains a key advantage through its CUDA software platform, which is widely used by developers to build AI applications.Nvidia’s market share in China has fallen from 95% in 2022 to about 50% currently, CEO Jensen Huang said last week. He warned that ongoing export controls could push more Chinese customers toward domestic alternatives like Huawei.In addition to the new chip set for June, sources told the publication that Nvidia is also developing a second Blackwell-based GPU aimed at China, scheduled for production in September.","N Nvidia preparing to release new artificial intelligence (AI) chip for the Chinese market at a significantly lower price point than its restricted H20 model.

Protests escalate during Microsoft Build conference

Read the full email from the Palestinian employee

Yesterday, Microsoft chose to utterly and completely discriminate against an entire nation, an entire people, and an entire community by blocking all employees from sending any outbound email containing the words ""Palestine"", ""Gaza"", ""genocide"", or ""apartheid"". Microsoft leaders justified this blatant censorship by saying it was to prevent you from receiving emails like the email that you are reading right now. Even though Microsoft SLT are aware that this ""short term solution"" is easily bypassable, as this email clearly proves, Microsoft still doubled down, insisted on not rolling back the policy, and decided to continue targeting and repressing their Palestinian, Arab, Muslim, and allied workers. They refused to revoke this censorship tactic, despite its potential illegality, dozens of employees expressing how racist of a decision it was, and even leaders admitting they see how it can be perceived as discriminatory and targeted. This further proves how little Microsoft values Palestinian lives and Palestinian suffering.

As a Palestinian worker, I am fed up with the way our people have been treated by this company. I am sending this email as a message to Microsoft leaders: the cost of trying to silence all voices that dare to humanize Palestinians is far higher than simply listening to the concerns of your employees. Had this useless and discriminatory policy been revoked, as I tried to request numerous times through so-called ""proper channels""[1][2], I would not be sending you all this email.

Despite claiming to have ""heard concerns from our employees and the public regarding Microsoft technologies used by the Israeli military to target civilians or cause harm in the conflict in Gaza"" in a statement riddled with lies, admissions, and absurd justifications, Microsoft has shown that they are utterly uninterested in hearing what we have to say.

Microsoft claims that they ""provide many avenues for all voices to be heard"". However, whenever we try to discuss anything substantial about divesting from genocide in the ""approved channels"", workers are retaliated against, doxxed, or silenced. Microsoft has deleted relevant employee questions in AMAs with executives and shut down Viva Engage posts in dedicated channels for asking SLT questions. Managers have warned outspoken directs to stay quiet and have even openly retaliated against them. When my community tries to flag issues and concerns to HR/GER/WIT, we have been met with racist outcomes with double standards. Throughout all this, Microsoft has sent a clear message to their employees: There are no proper channels at Microsoft to express your concerns, disagreements, or even questions about how Microsoft is using your labor to kill Palestinian babies.

Over this past week, Microsoft has shown their true face, brutalizing, detaining, firing, pepper spraying, threatening and insulting workers and former workers protesting at Microsoft Build. This email censorship is simply the latest example in a long list of recent extreme and outrageous escalations by Microsoft against my community. Enough is enough.

It has become clear that Microsoft will not listen to us out of the goodness of their hearts.

Microsoft will not change their stance just because it is the moral or even legal thing to do. Microsoft will only divest from genocide once it becomes more expensive for them to kill Palestinians than not. Right now, Microsoft makes a lot of money from genocide-profiteering, so we must make support for genocide even more expensive.

The situation in Palestine is more urgent by the minute. More and more Palestinians are being killed of starvation under the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF)'s bombing campaign, invasion, and siege that has martyred an estimated 400,000 Palestinians. The IOF have kidnapped over 16,000 Palestinians and placed them in torture and rape camps. 1.93 million Palestinians in Gaza have been displaced, and over 40,000 Palestinians have been displaced in the West Bank.

While a hostile work environment is difficult, it cannot compare to the horrors taking place in Palestine - horrors that we as Microsoft employees are complicit in. These futile attempts to silence our community, while painful at times, are evidence that the pressure we are applying is working. This is not the time for baby steps or gradual progress. Starving infants cannot wait any longer. We, as a company of over 200,000 employees, are providing the technological backbone for Israel's genocidal war machine in Palestinian. We, as employees of this company, have a responsibility to end our employer's complicity in this AI-assisted genocide! Now is the time to escalate against Microsoft and end this Microsoft-powered genocide!

I am calling on every employee of conscience to:

Sign No Azure for Apartheid's petition calling for a termination of all Microsoft contracts with the Israeli military and government: https://noaa.cc/petition

Strongly consider whether you want to stay in the company and fight for change from within, or if you want to leave and stop contributing labor to genocide.

If you choose to leave Microsoft to no longer be complicit in genocide, do not go quietly. The No Azure for Apartheid campaign is ready to help you make an impact on your way out for Palestine, and we will also do our best to provide you support before leaving. Reach out to us expressing your interest to leave here.

If you choose to stay, continue to fight from the inside to end Microsoft's, and your own, complicity in war crimes, join the No Azure for Apartheid campaign. If you are worried about being public with your affiliation, rest assured that as a worker-led grassroots movement, we have members with all levels of anonymity and risk level. Some of our members are publicly visible and will even publicly confront our war-criminal executives, such as

,

Mustafa Suleyman

, and Jay Parikh at major Microsoft events like the 50th Anniversary celebration and Microsoft Build. Other members choose to stay completely anonymous and still contribute to the critical work of the campaign. There is room for everyone: https://noaa.cc/join

While I do understand that as Microsoft employees, we cannot fully boycott Microsoft, most of us can focus on the priority targets set by the Boycott, Divest, and Sanction (BDS) movement, which recently set Microsoft as a priority target. The main target of the boycott is

Microsoft Gaming

, especially X-Box. We can also encourage our friends and family to boycott Microsoft where possible.

To Microsoft Senior Leadership team specifically:You cannot silence Palestine.You cannot silence Gaza.You cannot hide your involvement in genocide and apartheid.

Fre e Palestine Nisreen Jaradat

A Microsoft employee successfully circumvented the company's controversial email restrictions to send a mass protest message to thousands of colleagues, escalating tensions over the tech giant's contracts with the Israeli government.Nisreen Jaradat , a senior tech support engineer at Microsoft, sent the email on May 23rd with the subject line ""You can't get rid of us,"" according to a copy obtained by The Verge. The message came just one day after Microsoft implemented blocks on emails containing words like "" Palestine ,"" ""Gaza,"" and ""Genocide"" in subject lines or message bodies. It remains unclear exactly how Jaradat circumvented the technical restrictions, though her email specifically noted that Microsoft leadership was ""aware that this 'short term solution' is easily bypassable.""""As a Palestinian worker, I am fed up with the way our people have been treated by this company,"" Jaradat wrote in her email to staff. ""I am sending this email as a message to Microsoft leaders: the cost of trying to silence all voices that dare to humanize Palestinians is far higher than simply listening to the concerns of your employees.""The email block was instituted during Microsoft's Build developer conference, which became the focal point for multiple protest actions. Employee Joe Lopez disrupted the opening keynote on May 19th before being fired the same day. A Palestinian tech worker then interrupted Microsoft's CoreAI head during his presentation, followed by additional disruptions from former employees.Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw defended the email restrictions, stating that mass emailing colleagues ""about any topic not related to work is not appropriate."" The company claims it has ""taken measures to try and reduce those emails to those that have not opted in.""Hossam Nasr , an organizer with the No Azure for Apartheid (NOAA) group, called Microsoft's word blocking ""particularly egregious,"" arguing that employees speaking through ""appropriate channels"" are consistently ""silenced or ignored.""The protests follow Microsoft's acknowledgment of its cloud and AI contracts with Israel, though the company maintains an internal review found ""no evidence"" its tools were used to harm Gaza civilians.","Microsoft blocked all employees from sending any outbound email containing the words ""Palestine"", ""Gaza"", ""genocide"", or ""apartheid"" Palestinian employee: ""Microsoft will not change their stance just because it is the moral or even legal thing to do""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121418232,imgsize-35780,width-400,resizemode-4/Microsoft-employee-bypassed-companys-email-ban.jpg"

Each day brings a fresh challenge that mixes wordplay, general knowledge and clever associations. Below, we explain what Connections is, how to play, and we provide the hints, categories, and full answers for today’s game — Friday, 23 May 2025. Warning: spoilers ahead.Connections is a daily word puzzle published by The New York Times . You are given 16 words and must group them into four sets of four words, where each set shares a common theme. Themes can relate to meanings, categories, idioms, or even subtle wordplay. Each puzzle has only one correct solution, making precision and logic key to winning.The puzzle presents a 4x4 grid of words. Your job is to find four groups of four words that connect through a shared idea. You can rearrange the words to help visualise patterns, and you're allowed four incorrect guesses. Groups are colour-coded by difficulty:Yellow – easiestGreen – moderateBlue – harderPurple – trickiest, often involving wordplay or double meaningsSubmit four words you believe belong together. If correct, that group locks in. If not, you lose a life. Lose four lives, and it’s game over.Use these hints to help form the correct groups:(Think of events that involve dancing, music, or big gatherings.)(Consider words that relate to someone's personality, essence or internal makeup.)(You might hear these on a scale or in a recipe — pre-metric system units.)(A beauty product, a type of marble, a celestial object and a type of eyewear style.)BASHBLASTBLOWOUTRAVEThese are all terms used to describe large, energetic parties or celebrations.CHARACTERFIBERMAKEUPNATUREEach of these words can refer to the fundamental qualities or essence of a person or thing.DRAMOUNCEPOUNDSTONEAll are units of weight commonly used in the imperial measurement system, particularly in the UK.EYELINER (a type of makeup styled as a cat-eye)GLASSES (as in lenses shaped or styled like a cat’s eye)MARBLE (cat’s eye marbles are a specific type of toy marble)NEBULA (as in the Cat’s Eye Nebula, a famous astronomical object)If you were thrown off by the group involving MAKEUP, EYELINER and BLOWOUT, you’re not alone—it was easy to assume a beauty-related category.

Mark Zuckerberg takes the stand as FTC trial continues

What comes next for Meta

Meta , the tech giant behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has requested a federal judge to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) high-profile antitrust case, just as the trial approaches a critical phase. According to the, the case, which began in early April, represents one of the most significant regulatory challenges faced by Meta in its history, potentially resulting in the breakup of the company’s social media empire.Meta's move to dismiss the case comes after the FTC rested its side of the argument, asserting that the company holds an illegal monopoly over the social networking market, particularly those platforms focused on friends-and-family connections. Meta, however, argues that the FTC's case is based on a flawed market definition and ignores the intense competition it faces from newer platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X (formerly known as Twitter).In a court filing late Thursday, Meta reiterated its stance that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standards required to prove its antitrust allegations. The company’s legal team argues that the FTC has fundamentally mischaracterized the social media market, claiming that the agency's definition is overly narrow and excludes significant competitors.“After five weeks of trial, it is clear that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standard required under antitrust law,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement on Friday. “Regardless, we will present our case to show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram competes with TikTok (and YouTube and X and many other apps).”Meta claims that it faces substantial competition from a wide range of digital platforms, including short-video giant TikTok, video-sharing platform YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X. These platforms, Meta argues, all compete for user engagement, advertising revenue, and market share, undercutting the FTC’s claim that Meta has maintained an unlawful monopoly.The FTC’s antitrust lawsuit, which was first filed in December 2020, centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The agency claims that Meta pursued a deliberate “buy or bury” strategy, acquiring these fast-growing competitors to neutralize potential threats to its dominant position in the social networking market.In its filing, the FTC pointed to internal Meta communications as evidence of this strategy. This includes a 2012 email from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggesting that buying Instagram would “neutralize a competitor.” The FTC further argues that these acquisitions reduced consumer choice and stifled innovation, limiting competition in the rapidly evolving social media industry.The FTC's case aims to convince U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to order Meta to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp, effectively dismantling the company's integrated social media ecosystem.Meta's defense in the trial has focused on presenting itself as a company that supports innovation and benefits consumers. In its Thursday filing, the company argued that its acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth, which in turn delivered significant benefits to users.“Meta’s acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth – with correspondingly massive benefits for US consumers,” the company stated in its court filing.However, the trial has also brought to light internal documents that may complicate Meta’s defense. For instance, a 2018 email from an unnamed Instagram executive warned that ""fake engagement could be in the range of 40%,"" potentially undermining Meta's claims about the platform’s integrity and user trust.Mark Zuckerberg himself was the first witness called by the FTC as the trial opened, highlighting the personal stakes for the Meta CEO. During his testimony, Zuckerberg sought to portray Meta as a company facing fierce competition, rather than a monopoly crushing potential rivals.Earlier in the trial, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom testified that he felt Zuckerberg viewed Instagram’s rapid growth as a potential threat to Facebook’s dominance after the acquisition, further fueling the FTC’s argument that Meta's mergers were designed to stifle competition.The 10-week non-jury trial, which is expected to conclude in June, will be followed by final briefs from both the FTC and Meta. If Judge Boasberg sides with the FTC, a second trial will be held to determine appropriate remedies, potentially including the forced divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp.Meta will continue presenting its defense when the trial resumes on Monday. The company’s attempt to dismiss the case outright remains a long shot, as the judge may choose to let the case proceed to its scheduled conclusion before issuing a ruling.","The FTC's antitrust lawsuit centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.

Technical insights into Grok 3.5

Significance of the Microsoft-xAI collaboration

Free access to Grok AI on Azure available this June

Future outlook and industry impact

In a notable event at the Microsoft Build 2025 developer conference, Elon Musk , CEO of xAI and Tesla, joined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to announce the integration of xAI’s flagship Grok 3 AI models on Microsoft Azure. This announcement marks a significant step in the evolving artificial intelligence landscape, bringing together two major technology powerhouses. The Grok models will be accessible for free throughout June on the Azure AI Foundry platform, which also features AI offerings from industry leaders such as OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face.This collaboration highlights not only technological innovation but also the historical ties between Musk and Microsoft, recalling Musk’s early programming days as a Microsoft intern. This detailed report covers all aspects of the announcement, the technology behind Grok, the significance of this partnership, and the future prospects of AI development on Azure.During the Build conference, Satya Nadella took a moment to reflect on Elon Musk’s early career. Nadella reminded the audience of Musk’s internship at Microsoft, stating,Musk responded warmly, sharing memories of his beginnings before Windows with MS-DOS on the earliest IBM PCs. He highlighted the technological limitations of that era, recalling how memory upgrades from 128k to 256k were significant milestones. Musk also described programming video games in DOS and later working with Windows 3.1, emphasizing his foundational experience in software development which shaped his future ventures.The core of the announcement focused on the launch of Grok 3, xAI’s advanced family of AI models, now integrated with Microsoft Azure’s cloud infrastructure. Nadella introduced Grok as “a family of models that are both responsive and capable of reasoning,” expressing enthusiasm about its deployment on Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft’s AI platform that offers scalable, managed AI services to developers and enterprises worldwide.The availability of Grok 3 and Grok 3 Mini on Azure aims to broaden access to cutting-edge AI capabilities. Microsoft will provide these models with service-level agreements consistent with their other AI offerings, and billing will be streamlined through Microsoft’s standard Azure framework. This ensures ease of integration for enterprises already operating within the Azure ecosystem.Elon Musk elaborated on the forthcoming Grok 3.5 model during the conversation. He described it as an AI designed to “reason from first principles,” a philosophical approach emphasizing fundamental truths and axioms as the basis for knowledge and problem-solving. Musk explained that the model’s architecture is grounded in fundamental physics, allowing it to apply these principles across different reasoning domains with an aim to minimize error and approach accurate understanding.This emphasis on physics-based reasoning sets Grok apart from many AI models that rely primarily on pattern recognition and statistical inference. By integrating first-principles reasoning, Grok 3.5 aspires to provide more reliable, consistent outputs, potentially enhancing applications across diverse fields such as autonomous vehicles, space exploration, and customer service.The integration of Grok into Azure represents a strategic alliance that leverages Microsoft’s extensive cloud infrastructure and xAI’s innovative AI research. This collaboration extends the reach of Musk’s xAI beyond standalone systems, embedding it within one of the largest and most trusted cloud platforms globally.Azure AI Foundry already hosts models from major AI developers like OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face, making it a hub for AI innovation and adoption. Grok’s addition to this ecosystem reflects Microsoft’s commitment to providing diverse AI options to developers and enterprises.The partnership also comes amid industry discussions regarding the influence of large tech firms on AI development. Musk’s previous criticisms of Microsoft’s role in OpenAI’s operations add a layer of complexity to this collaboration, underscoring the nuanced relationships shaping the AI industry.Microsoft announced that Grok models will be available free of charge throughout June, allowing developers, researchers, and businesses to explore and experiment with xAI’s technology. This limited free access serves to increase adoption and foster community feedback, critical for refining AI capabilities and expanding real-world applications.Post-June, Grok’s services will continue under Microsoft’s commercial terms, integrated fully within the Azure billing and support system. This seamless integration facilitates enterprise-grade deployment, enabling customers to incorporate Grok-powered AI into their existing workflows with minimal friction.The collaboration between Microsoft and xAI marks a pivotal moment in AI development, demonstrating the growing importance of cloud platforms as hubs for AI innovation and distribution. By combining xAI’s first-principles reasoning models with Microsoft’s global cloud reach, this partnership is poised to accelerate the deployment of advanced AI solutions across industries.As AI technologies continue to evolve rapidly, partnerships like this provide essential infrastructure and support for scalable AI applications in sectors such as automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and customer experience. The free access period in June offers the broader tech community an opportunity to assess Grok’s capabilities and potential impact.","Elon Musk, CEO of xAI and Tesla, joined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to announce the integration of x AI’s flagship Grok 3 AI models on Microsoft Azure.

Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn makes a prediction on how AI will change schools in future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/duolingo-ceo-luis-von-ahn-makes-a-prediction-on-how-ai-will-change-schools-in-future/articleshow/121290768.cms,"Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn feels that AI will take over teaching



Schools won’t disappear, but their role will change: Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn



Duolingo CEO Luis von Ann recently predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) will fundamentally transform education, shifting the role of schools from traditional learning institutions to childcare and supervised spaces. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the No Priors podcast, von Ahn stressed on the fact that AI’s scalability makes it more efficient than human teachers and it can be easily used for personalised education. ""Education is going to change. It's just a lot more scalable to teach with AI than with teachers,” von Ahn said.Von Ahn suggests that AI will increasingly handle the core instruction in schools. He believes that AI can deliver personalised education more effectively than traditional classroom models with teachers. AI system can be designed to precisely track individual student progress, identify areas where they struggle and then tailor the learning experience accordingly.While Von Ahn does not believe schools will vanish, he foresees a future where AI tutors handle most of the teaching, while schools primarily serve as safe environments for children. He explained that AI can track individual student performance in real time, adjusting lesson plans to match each child’s learning pace—something human teachers struggle to do in large classrooms.“That doesn't mean the teachers are going to go away. You still need people to take care of the students. I also don't think schools are going to go away because you still need childcare,” von Ahn said on the podcast.This doesn't mean teachers will become obsolete, according to von Ahn. Instead, their responsibilities may evolve. Teachers could transition from primarily delivering instruction to supervising students, providing guidance, and fostering social and emotional development.Von Ahn also points out that the integration of AI in education is already happening. Duolingo, for example, is restructuring its operations to embrace an ""AI-first"" approach. This includes using AI for tasks previously done by contractors and incorporating AI into employee performance reviews.","Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn predicts that AI will transform education.

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has said that he is not impressed with the design choices of Tesla. Speaking at ""Your Mom's House"" podcast in March, he was asked ‘what's your favorite car?’. Cuban, who owns a Tesla replied with a grin “A Kia. EV6.” He further added “I like it. I'm comfortable with it.”Revealing that he hasn’t sold his Tesla ‘yet’, Mark Cuban explained: “On the Tesla you've got to find [the turn signal] and push the button… while you're driving. You can't pay attention to the road as much.”Praising Kia, he said: “It doesn't try to be too fancy. Your turn signal is like… a turn signal”.While Mark Cuban doesn’t mind driving a ‘cheaper’ Kia EV6, but his 15-year-old son isn’t impressed. When Cuban suggested handing down the car for driving practice, his son quickly shut it down, saying, “It’s not cool, Dad.” He even called it a “nerd car.” Cuban’s response? “Exactly,” he said, embracing the label.Mark Cuban is a known Elon Musk critic. Earlier this year on the ""Club Shay Shay"" podcast, he even admitted he likes provoking Musk because he has ""really thin skin and it just makes it easy.""In another interview earlier this year, Cuban said “I have no problem throwing Elon under the bus, but I'll save it for when it's truly deserved.”Last year, when Musk encouraged users to share more positive content on X, Cuban wasted no time in delivering a sharp retort. “Please post a bit more positive, beautiful or informative content on this platform,” the Tesla CEO then wrote. Cuban commented “You first”.Cuban recently shared an anecdote from a night at COMDEX, which he claims was a major tech trade show in Las Vegas, where he found himself upstaged by none other than Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. At this event, Cuban recalled chatting with a group of women when they suddenly disappeared, only to learn they had left with Gates, who had just taken Microsoft public and was quickly becoming a tech icon. Cuban noted jokingly that Bill Gates took away “his girls.”","Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has said that he is not impressed with the design choices of Tesla.

‘Extremely Prejudicial’: Disney sues Google-owned YouTube over hiring of ex-ESPN executive Justin Connolly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/extremely-prejudicial-disney-sues-google-owned-youtube-over-hiring-of-ex-espn-executive-justin-connolly/articleshow/121408792.cms,"What the lawsuit says



Conflict of interests

Walt Disney Co. has filed a lawsuit against YouTube, seeking to block the appointment of former ESPN executive Justin Connolly as YouTube's global head of media and sports. According to a Benzinga report, the lawsuit was filed on Wednesday - May 21 in Los Angeles state court. It alleges breach of contract, unfair competition, and interference with a contractual relationship.Connolly, a Disney veteran, stepped down earlier this week as head of platform distribution after more than two decades with the company.According to the court filing, Connolly signed a three-year agreement with Disney in November 2024, binding him to the company through March 1, 2027. The contract reportedly included only a limited, one-time termination option.Disney claims YouTube was aware of these contractual obligations and is now seeking a court order to prevent Connolly from assuming the new role.Kevin Gaut, a lawyer for Disney, in the complaint writes: “Connolly has intimate knowledge of Disney’s other distribution deals, the financial details concerning Disney’s content being licensed to YouTube, and Disney’s negotiation strategies, both in general and in particular with respect to YouTube”.“It would be extremely prejudicial to Disney for Connolly to breach the contract which he negotiated just a few months ago and switch teams when Disney is working on a new licensing deal with the company that is trying to poach him,” he added.According to the lawsuit, Disney became aware of YouTube’s offer to Justin Connolly in April. At that time, Disney was navigating several major product launches and renegotiating key distribution agreements. Notably, Connolly was then leading the team handling Disney’s license renewal negotiations with YouTube.YouTube confirmed Connolly’s hiring on Thursday. Sources say he will manage relationships with major media companies and lead YouTube’s expanding live sports strategy.","Walt Disney Co. has filed a lawsuit against YouTube, seeking to block the appointment of former ESPN executive Justin Connolly as YouTube's global head of media and sports.

Walmart's Indian-origin CTO 'blamed' as the world's largest retailer cuts 1500 technology jobs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/walmarts-indian-origin-cto-blamed-as-the-worlds-largest-retailer-cuts-1500-technology-jobs/articleshow/121406423.cms,"Walmart layoffs: Scrutiny on CTO Suresh Kumar and H-1B hiring

Walmart layoffs: What the company said

Who is Walmart CTO Suresh Kumar?

World’s largest retail giant, Walmart recently slashed 1500 jobs as part of company’s restructuring effort. As per a Reuters report, this move of the company is aimed at streamlining operations. Now, this move of the retailer has sparked a fresh debate around H-1B visas ans has led to a scrutiny directed at the company's Indian-origin Global Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Suresh Kumar . The job cuts, primarily impacting the technology department, come as Walmart aims to streamline its operations and adapt to evolving technological demands. While companies often undertake such restructuring to improve efficiency and focus on strategic priorities, the scale of these layoffs has drawn considerable attention.After the announcement of the layoffs, a viral social media post targeted Suresh Kumar, the Indian-origin CTO of Walmart. The post alleged a connection between the job cuts and the company's H-1B hiring practices. The post claimed it was ""no coincidence"" that over 40 percent of Walmart's IT department consists of H-1B visa holders from India.The fresh accusation has once again started discussions around the H-1B visa program, which allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. Critics of the program often argue that it leads to job displacement for American workers, while proponents emphasise its role in filling critical skill gaps and fostering innovation.In a memo reviewed by Bloomberg, Kumar and Walmart US CEO John Furner stated that the restructuring aims to accelerate decision-making and simplify organizational structure. Walmart has maintained that the layoffs are not directly tied to H-1B hiring, but rather part of a cost-cutting strategy amid economic uncertainties.Suresh Kumar is an IIT-Madras alumnus and he has held leadership positions in various technology companies which include Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Walmart. Kumar joined Walmart in 2019 and presently he is overlooking the US retail giant’s global tech operations including cloud infrastructure, data security, and AI-driven retail solutions."," Walmart recently slashed 1500 jobs as part of company’s restructuring effort.

Apple's India expansion triggers presidential ire







Manufacturing challenges loom large in bringing iPhone making to the US



President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 25% import tariff on all smartphones manufactured outside the United States, targeting major companies including Apple and Samsung unless they move production to American soil.""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social Friday morning. ""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US.""The announcement wiped approximately $70 billion off Apple's market value, with shares falling 2.6% and pushing the company's valuation just below $3 trillion.Speaking to reporters at the White House later Friday, Trump clarified that the tariff would extend beyond Apple to include all smartphone manufacturers. ""It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product, otherwise it wouldn't be fair,"" he said. ""When they build their plant here, there is no tariff.""The threat comes as Apple has rapidly expanded manufacturing in India, producing $22 billion worth of iPhones there last year—a 60% increase from the previous year. Apple CEO Tim Cook recently announced that most iPhones sold in the US this quarter would be made in India.Trump expressed frustration with Cook's strategy during recent meetings. ""He said he's going to India to build plants. I said, that's okay to go to India, but you're not going to sell into here without tariffs, and that's the way it is,"" Trump told reporters.Industry experts warn that moving smartphone production to the US would be prohibitively expensive due to the lack of existing facilities and skilled workforce. According to analysts at Wedbush Securities, an iPhone manufactured in America could cost between $1,500 and $3,500, compared to the current $1,200 price point.The tariffs are set to begin ""at the end of June,"" according to Trump, as part of his broader push to bring manufacturing jobs back to America.","President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 25% import tariff on all smartphones manufactured outside the United States.

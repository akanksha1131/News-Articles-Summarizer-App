Perplexity AI’s Desi CEO to Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath on AI chatbots: ‘All are same but if used for…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/perplexity-ais-desi-ceo-to-zerodha-co-founder-nikhil-kamath-on-ai-chatbots-all-are-same-but-if-used-for/articleshow/119498116.cms,"‘Perplexity differentiated itself by providing sources but…’: Srinivas

Perplexity AI ’s CEO Aravind Srinivas has said that despite the rapid advancements and intense competition in the generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) space, the core capabilities of leading chatbots currently lack significant distinction. However, speaking on Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath 's podcast, he said that there is one area where people may pick the best.When asked how the Big Tech is doing things differently, Srinivas observed a striking similarity among the major players.“[The] honest answer right now is all of them are doing similar things. I'll just say it as blunt as it can be. There's not really a genuine differentiation between ChatGPT or Anthropic or Gemini or Grok or Meta AI right now and, of course, Perplexity. You can argue similarly,” he said, attributing this behaviour to the industry's focus on common evaluation metrics.“Currently, excluding the search part, most models give the same answers,” he explained.“This is because they are trying to climb on the same benchmarks, same leaderboards. There isn't a lot of qualitative difference,” he explained.While Perplexity initially differentiated itself by emphasizing accurate sourcing – a feature Srinivas notes competitors are now emulating – he suggested current user choice often boils down to specific task suitability.“In the beginning, the differentiation was we were the only ones to make sure you always had sources for everything – highly accurate sources, fast answers and so on but everybody else is also realising that the real values in search even more than free form chat. And they're trying to put sources for almost any response so I think right now we're in this weird phase where like all AI chatbots seem similar,” he added.However, the one area Srinivas pointed out that makes all chatbots different is fact checking and research.“If you use AI for fact checks and research, financial research etc, you would pick whichever model does that best,” he commented.Nevertheless, Srinivas predicts this landscape of similarity is poised for a shift. The crucial differentiator in the near future, he argued, will be the development of “agentic behaviour” – AI systems capable of performing tasks, not just generating text.“Answering questions will be seen as a commodity—just answering in text will not cut it,” Srinivas made a prediction for 2025. He believes future advancements will involve AI generating richer outputs like graphics and charts and, more significantly, actively “doing things” for the user.This evolution towards action-oriented AI, Srinivas noted, is dependent on sophisticated reasoning capabilities, which he believes are only just beginning to function successfully within AI systems.","Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity AI, spoke on Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath's podcast.

Sridhar Vembu’s leadership mantra: Stay resilient, embrace challenges

Sridhar Vembu’s key question for leaders: ‘Can bad news reach you?’

Challenges in corporate culture

Lessons from leadership figures

Effective management is crucial for the success of any organization. A manager’s ability to handle setbacks, foster open communication, and maintain composure in challenging situations significantly impacts team productivity and morale. Billionaire entrepreneur Sridhar Vembu , the founder and Chief Scientist of Zoho , recently shared his thoughts on what makes a good manager. In a series of posts on social media platform X, Vembu emphasized the importance of resilience, approachability, and the ability to handle bad news constructively. His insights have sparked discussions among professionals and industry experts about leadership qualities that foster a healthy and productive work environment.According to Vembu, an ideal manager must be prepared for challenges and setbacks. Business environments are often unpredictable, with obstacles arising at any moment. The ability to navigate difficulties without losing composure is a defining trait of a good leader. A manager who reacts impulsively or emotionally to bad news may create a culture of fear among employees, discouraging open communication and proactive problem-solving.Vembu advises that leaders must develop a thick skin to lead effectively. He warns that managers who are overly sensitive or have volatile tempers risk alienating their teams. Employees may hesitate to report issues, leading to unresolved problems that can escalate and negatively impact the organization.One of the key points Vembu raises is the importance of open communication within teams. He highlights a critical question that every manager should ask themselves: Can bad news reach me? Would people be comfortable telling me things I don’t like to hear? The ability to receive constructive criticism and negative feedback without reacting defensively is essential for leadership effectiveness.A workplace culture where employees feel safe sharing concerns and challenges allows managers to address issues proactively. Vembu believes that fostering trust between employees and leadership is vital for long-term business success. When employees know they will not be reprimanded for reporting problems, they are more likely to raise concerns early, preventing minor setbacks from turning into major crises.Many professionals resonated with Vembu’s perspective, sparking discussions about corporate culture, particularly in India. Several social media users pointed out that while problem solvers are often recognized and rewarded, those who identify potential issues early are not given the same appreciation. This mindset can incentivize managers to allow problems to escalate so they can later be seen as heroes for solving them.One user suggested that companies should restructure their incentive systems to encourage proactive problem identification. Recognizing employees who identify and mitigate risks early could lead to more efficient and sustainable business practices.Leadership qualities that encourage transparency and responsibility are not new. A user on X shared an anecdote about the late aerospace engineer and former ISRO chairman Satish Dhawan. Former Indian President APJ Abdul Kalam often praised Dhawan for his approach to leadership—owning failures while giving credit to his team for successes. This leadership style aligns with Vembu’s views on fostering trust and encouraging accountability in management.","Sridhar Vembu, the founder and Chief Scientist of Zoho, recently shared his thoughts on what makes a good manager.

The levy primarily affected U.S. tech giants like Google, Meta, and Amazon, whom the United States Trade Representative (USTR) had previously criticized as being unfairly targeted.During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the United States last month, both nations agreed to work on the first phase of a trade deal by autumn 2025, with an ambitious target of increasing two-way trade to $500 billion by 2030. The tax removal is seen as a crucial diplomatic step towards that goal.A U.S. delegation led by Brendan Lynch , the assistant U.S. trade representative for South and Central Asia, is currently in India for discussions, further underscoring the diplomatic significance of this tax policy change.The Finance Ministry, led by Nirmala Sitharaman, proposed the tax removal as part of 59 amendments to the Finance Bill, signaling a significant policy reversal just days before President Donald Trump is expected to announce trade measures against countries imposing digital taxes on American tech companies.Government generated over Rs 3,000 crore from companies like Google and Meta through ‘Google tax’The equalisation levy, first introduced in 2016 and expanded in 2020, targeted large foreign digital companies like Google and Meta that generate substantial revenue from Indian users without maintaining a local physical presence. While the tax had been a source of ongoing friction with the US government, it generated approximately Rs 3,343 crore in the current financial year.The USTR had labeled the tax as ""discriminatory and unreasonable,"" arguing that domestic companies were exempt from such regulations.The amendment also proposes scrapping certain income tax exemptions previously offered to digital firms, indicating a comprehensive approach to resolving international tax disputes. The decision follows a history of tensions, including previous threats of retaliatory tariffs by both the Biden and Trump administrations.Government officials and economic experts view the move as a diplomatic strategy to smooth trade relations. By preemptively removing the digital tax, the government hopes to prevent potential economic repercussions and demonstrate its commitment to resolving trade disagreements through diplomatic negotiations.","Government generated over Rs 3,000 crore from companies like Google and Meta through ‘Google tax’ The equalisation levy, first introduced in 2016 and expanded in 2020, targeted large foreign digital companies.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu replies to Kerala Congress' RIP post for 'Make in India',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zoho-founder-sridhar-vembu-replies-to-kerala-congress-rip-post-for-make-in-india/articleshow/119109476.cms,"Here’s a look at Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu’s post

Sridhar Vembu’s comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress , emphasizing the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s recent expansion in Kerala. The image in the party’s post shows a tombstone design to symbolically critique the ""Make in India"" initiative, suggesting it has failed between 2014 and 2025. The tombstone features the Indian lion emblem and the phrase ""Rest in Peace.""The post is captioned “In loving memory of….”. Responding to the post, Vembu emphasized the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s expansion in Kerala. He wrote:“Meanwhile companies like us Make in India (and started making in Kerala recently too).”“Make in India is gaining momentum and we have to make up for several lost decades. Reflect on why they were ""lost decades"" and perhaps you will appreciate Make in India better,” he further added.Zoho has been expanding its operations across India, including in Kerala. The company has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas as part of its broader strategy.The Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports. Several companies, including Zoho, have increased their domestic production efforts as part of this initiative.Vembu’s response comes amid ongoing discussions on India's economic policies and industrial growth, with businesses and policymakers debating the impact of past and present strategies.Vembu recently drew a comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods, highlighting their long-term impact on economic structures. In a recent post, he discussed how capital inflows into a single sector can divert resources from others, weakening overall economic capabilities.Citing Silicon Valley as an example, Vembu pointed out the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, attributing them to a talent shift toward sectors with higher financial incentives. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now – for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors overlooked the sector due to the absence of large exits.Drawing a parallel to India, Vembu noted that the long-standing dominance of the IT industry resulted in the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he stated.He stressed the importance of addressing these gaps and rebuilding capabilities in affected sectors. ""We have to make up for lost time,"" he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress.

Air Canada and Thales issue joint statement

JetBlue, British Airways and Swiss Airlines have faced similar issues in the past

Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories.” According to a report in CNN, Air Canada's Boeing 737 MAX fleet were found to have moving maps — part of the in flight entertainment (IFE) system — that did not show Israel as a state, but replaced it with the name "" Palestinian territories ."" The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.The discrepancy, first noticed by a passenger, involved maps produced for French aerospace group Thales. Air Canada and Thales issued a joint statement acknowledging the error and stating that the issue has been ""resolved."" ""It was brought to the attention of Air Canada that the interactive map on its Boeing 737 fleet did not consistently portray certain Middle Eastern boundaries, including those of the State of Israel, at all amplification levels,"" the statement said. ""Air Canada’s policy in general is to display only city names on the maps in its aircraft, and the configuration on this particular system was not compliant with this policy."" Thales added in a separate statement that the map had been provided by a third party.The map feature was promptly disabled, and an updated version will be installed across the fleet starting March 14. Air Canada and Thales apologized for the ""unease created by this situation.""This is not the first time such an issue has occurred in aviation. JetBlue apologized for a similar map error in 2024, and British Airways faced a similar situation in 2013. In 2018, SWISS confirmed its policy of turning off maps entirely when landing in Tel Aviv after a similar incident. Thales stated that the maps are supplied by a third party and that they are working with the airline and the provider to resolve the issue quickly.","Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with “Palestinian territories” The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.

Baidu has unveiled its AI model, Ernie X1, which is designed to articulate its reasoning process. The Ernie X1 model operates on similar principles to DeepSeek R1 , a model that garnered significant attention in Silicon Valley for its ability to deliver comparable performance to leading chatbots at a significantly lower development cost. Baidu emphasises that its reasoning model excels in areas such as daily dialogue, complex calculations, and logical deduction, as per a report.Bloomberg reports that in addition to the Ernie X1 launch, China's leading internet search provider has upgraded its flagship foundation model to Ernie 4.5 . Notably, the company has made all tiers of its AI service, including the X1 model, freely accessible to its chatbot users, accelerating its initial plans by several weeks.Baidu claims that Ernie 4.5 outperforms OpenAI's latest GPT 4.5 in text generation, citing various industry benchmarks. Baidu has also announced its intention to make its Ernie AI models open-source starting June 30. The company has also integrated the R1 model into its core search engine business.This launch appears to be a strategic move to regain momentum in the competitive AI landscape, where Baidu faces increasing pressure from emerging rivals such as DeepSeek, the report added.While Baidu was the first major Chinese tech company to introduce a ChatGPT-like chatbot, it has since faced stiff competition from rivals like TikTok parent company ByteDance and Moonshot AI. Furthermore, open-source models such as Alibaba's Qwen and DeepSeek have received recognition within the global developer community, the report added.The generative AI boom has positively impacted Baidu's financial performance, with a 26% increase in cloud revenue reported in its December-quarter results. This growth, driven by services provided to developers seeking computing power, was somewhat offset by weaker advertising sales amidst China's challenging economic conditions.","Baidu has unveiled its new Ernie X1 AI model, designed to articulate its reasoning process.

Facebook’s extreme measures in India

A ""low-ranking official,"" or as some say an office Babu at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Meta (then Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and some of the 'brightest tech minds' in his team with nothing more than a single click, according to explosive claims in a newly released memoir by former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams.The David versus Goliath moment allegedly occurred in 2016 during Facebook's aggressive push to save its controversial Free Basics program in India, which was facing regulatory scrutiny for potentially violating net neutrality principles.""Mark and some of the brightest tech minds in the world devoted months to this [outreach strategy], and some low-ranking official in India outfoxed them simply by clicking an opt-out box,"" Wynn-Williams writes in her book ""Careless People,"" which Meta is currently trying to block from publication.The memoir details how Facebook deployed its full arsenal of technological and political influence to sway public opinion about Free Basics. When India's Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) opened public consultations on whether such programs should be banned, Facebook allegedly orchestrated an unprecedented pressure campaign.""Our policy team is directly engaged with the government, include Prime Minister Modi's office,"" Wynn-Williams quotes then-COO Sheryl Sandberg as writing in an internal email. ""We're lucky this is happening in a place where we have very deep senior relationships in the government, but it's still going to be hard.""According to the book, Facebook's strategy focused on creating ""the appearance of public support"" through automated emails. The social media giant allegedly turned on a ""megaphone that Mark wouldn't let Sheryl use for [promoting] organ donation"" to nudge Indian users into sending approximately 16 million supportive emails to TRAI.The jugaad – a Hindi term for an innovative, improvised solution – came when Facebook discovered their millions of automated emails weren't being counted. ""Someone at TRAI—whoever controlled the email address for the public comments — simply opted out of all emails from Facebook,"" writes Wynn-Williams.The book makes other startling claims about Facebook's operations in India, including that the company hired an ""ex-police captain"" who would ""go to jail in a clash between Facebook and the Indian government"" if executives were targeted in government raids.Meta has dismissed the book as containing ""out-of-date and previously reported claims"" and ""false accusations about our executives."" A spokesperson told The Hindu that ""Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behaviour,"" claiming she ""has been paid by anti-Facebook activists.""Despite Meta's arbitration efforts to halt its publication and promotion in the US, ""Careless People"" remains available for purchase in India. The company has not specifically contested the claims regarding its operations in India detailed in the memoir.Free Basics was ultimately prohibited in India for violating net neutrality principles, representing a rare defeat for Zuckerberg's global expansion ambitions.",Former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams claims a 'low-ranking official' at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Mark Zuckerberg and his team.

Lauren Sánchez’s engagement and wedding preparations

Jeff Bezos addresses wedding rumors

""This whole thing is completely false—none of this is happening.""

Lauren Sánchez, the fiancée of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has ignited speculation with a cryptic social media post just as reports confirm the couple has officially sent out wedding invitations. The former news anchor and media personality shared an intriguing black-and-white sketch on Instagram, depicting a nude woman sitting on an airplane wing, her hair swept back by the wind. Captioned only with the word ""Mood,"" the post has fueled discussions among followers, as it coincided with the revelation that Bezos and Sánchez will be tying the knot this summer in Venice, Italy. The timing of the post has led to speculation about its deeper meaning, with many wondering whether it was a reflection of excitement, contemplation, or a hidden message regarding the upcoming nuptials.The news of their wedding has been met with considerable public interest, given Bezos' estimated net worth of $190 billion and the couple’s high-profile status. The wedding, expected to be an extravagant affair, follows years of speculation and previous unconfirmed reports about potential dates and locations. With invitations now reportedly in circulation, the long-anticipated event is set to take place aboard Bezos' $500 million superyacht, Koru, off the coast of Italy.Bezos and Sánchez have reportedly selected Venice, Italy, as the destination for their wedding, aligning with the grandeur of their relationship. The historic city, known for its romantic canals and opulent architecture, is a fitting backdrop for the high-profile ceremony. The couple is expected to host their wedding aboard Bezos' custom-built superyacht, Koru, a 417-foot luxury vessel that serves as a floating mansion equipped with lavish amenities. The yacht, known for its impressive design and extensive accommodations, provides an exclusive and secure setting for the ceremony, allowing the couple and their guests to celebrate in complete privacy.This location follows earlier speculation about a potential Aspen winter wedding, rumored to take place in December 2024. However, those reports were later dismissed, and the couple opted for a summer ceremony that better suits their lifestyle and high-profile guest list.One of the most intriguing aspects of Bezos and Sánchez's wedding is the high-profile guest list, which is rumored to include figures from the worlds of business, entertainment, and politics. While the full list remains undisclosed, reports indicate that attendees may include:This elite guest list suggests that the wedding will be more than just a celebration of love; it will also serve as a major networking event, reinforcing Bezos and Sánchez’s standing as a power couple within global elite circles.Bezos and Sánchez got engaged in May 2023 after dating for several years. The engagement was marked by an extravagant 20-carat diamond ring, estimated to be worth $2.5 million. Since then, the couple has been frequently spotted traveling alongside other high-profile figures, attending exclusive events, and enjoying luxurious getaways.While details of the wedding remain under wraps, Sánchez has offered glimpses into her preparations. In an interview with Vogue, she confirmed her excitement about becoming ""Mrs. Bezos"" and hinted at taking on new opportunities that come with the name. Additionally, she has hinted at her wedding dress selection, mentioning top designers such as Valentino and Dolce & Gabbana, though no final decision has been publicly announced.During a television appearance, she further discussed her wedding plans, revealing that she had a Pinterest board dedicated to bridal fashion, much like many other brides-to-be. This casual revelation contrasted with the high stakes of a wedding expected to be one of the most extravagant in recent history.Despite speculation regarding the scale and cost of the wedding, Bezos has personally dismissed reports that it would carry a $600 million price tag. When billionaire investor Bill Ackman commented on the rumored figure, Bezos responded directly on social media, stating:While the official budget remains undisclosed, industry insiders suggest that the combination of an elite guest list, a luxury venue, and high-security arrangements will ensure the wedding is one of the most exclusive and costly events of the decade.","Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez to wed in Venice aboard luxury superyacht Koru.

I know you've been through a lot with this horrible situation that happens. He is a patriot.”“He's become a friend of mine. He has become a friend of mine, and supported me in the election. That's when I got to know him really,” Trump added. “I knew him a little bit from the first term, but not much”.“He has never asked me for a thing. He could have,” Trump stated, jokingly adding “that's always subject to change, and if it does change, I'll let you know about it.”During his address, Trump also highlighted “I got rid of the electric car mandate. I have no idea how that affects it, but possibly not good”. Mere hours after assuming office in January, Trump rescinded a 2021 executive order from President Biden that aimed to have 50% of new vehicle sales be electric or plug-in hybrid by 2030.He also talked about ongoing protests and attacks on Tesla cars. Stating that if Musk wasn’t supporting Trump (and leading the DOGE), “he wouldn't have any of these”. Calling those attacking Tesla cars as ‘high level terrorists”, Trump said that the police will find the perpetrators. He also said that the people supporting these protestors could very well be the people he knows.

Tech billionaire Elon Musk recently attended US President Donald Trump ’s second cabinet meeting, making headlines with his choice of attire once again. Musk, who is often seen wearing the signature red Make America Great Again (MAGA) hat at official meetings, donned a red baseball cap that read, “Trump was right about everything.” Musk paired the cap with a black suit jacket over a plain black shirt— again a contrast to his previous appearance at a cabinet meeting last month, where he wore a “Tech Support” T-shirt under his jacket.At past White House and Oval Office gatherings, Musk had consistently been seen wearing MAGA hats, making this the first time he opted for a different message. At the cabinet meeting last month, Musk said that he considers himself a “humble tech support”.Recently, his support for Trump has been a topic of discussion, particularly as he balances his roles as CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and other ventures while engaging in political discourse.During an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Trump also jokingly commented on how young staffers at his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), including Musk, dress. He said “What [Musk] does is he takes it and with his hundred geniuses. He’s got some very brilliant young people working for him that dress much worse than him, actually. They dress in t-shirts.

What Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on the Signal scandal

What makes it this a Massive security breach

US President Trump on the Signal Group and alleged security breach

This may be one of the Biggest texting wars ever, and if yes also one of the biggest US national security breaches. Were sensitive “war plans” discussed in a Signal chat group that inadvertently included a journalist? Yes or No depends on which side you believe. The American Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was adamant on Monday (March 24) that sensitive ""war plans"" were not being discussed. And so is 'The Atlantic' top editor, Jeffrey Goldberg. In an article in The Atlantic, Goldberg has claimed that he was added to a group on the encrypted messaging app Signal that had Hegseth; Vice President JD Vance; US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and other Trump administration officials. In all there were 18 members in the Signal Group, as per him. He claimed internal deliberations and operational details about airstrikes against Houthi terrorists were discussed in the Signal Group.Goldberg further claims he was invited to join the Signal chain called the 'Houthi PC small group' on March 11, two days after connecting with US National Security Adviser Waltz on the app. The editor told the New York Post that “He was texting war plans. He was texting attack plans. When targets were going to be targeted; how they were going to be targeted; who was at the targets; when the next sequence of attacks was happening.” He added, “I’m sitting in a Safeway parking lot, watching at my phone and realizing, ‘Oh my God, this might be real. I think Pete Hegseth just sent this group actual targeting information, actual sequencing of an attack.’” US launched airstrikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebel group on March 15 and Goldberg claimed in his article that he learned the timing of the Yemen strikes from the Signal posts much earlier.Slamming the report, Hegseth told reporters, “Nobody was texting war plans and that’s all I have to say about that.” He went on to add that Goldberg cannot be trusted and has a history of lying. “You’re talking about a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist who’s made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again,” the US defense secretary.US officials are known to use Signal app. However, what makes this an apparent security scandal is as Goldberg said, ""It is not uncommon for national-security officials to communicate on Signal. But the app is used primarily for meeting planning and other logistical matters -- not for detailed and highly confidential discussions of a pending military action.""The US President Donald Trump dismissed the Signal chat. When asked about the story at the White House, he took a shot at The Atlantic. ""I don’t know anything about it. I’m not a big fan of the Atlantic,"" he told a reporter. ""To me, it's a magazine that’s going out of business. I think it’s not much of a magazine, but I know nothing about it.""","'The Atlantic' top editor Jeffrey Goldberg claims he was added to a group on the encrypted messaging app Signal.

Zerodha founder and CEO Nithin Kamath: This is closest thing we have seen to a Miracle Drug,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zerodha-founder-and-ceo-nithin-kamath-this-is-closest-thing-we-have-seen-to-a-miracle-drug/articleshow/119464379.cms,"Read Zerodha founder and CEO Nithin Kamath’s complete post here

I've been following the developments around Ozempic and GLP-1 drugs with some interest for a while, and last week Eli Lilly launched its variant, Mounjaro, in India. Remember, India has the highest number of diabetics, and if current trends hold, 30%+ of Indians will be obese. I don't think we have a good understanding of the second-order effects of these weight loss drugs , but so far, the effects people are reporting are remarkable.

The obvious effect is that people can lose 15-20% of their weight, as long as they keep taking the drug. But I've also read that the drug can potentially reduce addictive tendencies and compulsive behaviors like alcoholism, smoking, gambling, and so on. There's some evidence to show that these drugs can reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, dementia, and Alzheimer's; improve mental health; and so on. I don't know if all of these things are true, and it's early days. But even if half of what's being reported is true, then this will be the closest thing we've seen to a miracle drug.

So far, not many people are taking them; even in the US, only about 6% of the people are taking these drugs. With just this, FMCG companies like Walmart are saying that these drugs are affecting purchasing behavior. What would happen if more people started taking these drugs? We'll have an across-the-board effect on every single industry.

People will eat less, smoke less, buy less, and live longer. They'll also trade less?

Insurance premiums have to change, and annuity payouts in pensions will have to be readjusted. What we don't know is more than what we know about these drugs at this point. Also, the patents on the active ingredient in this drug is expiring in 2026, which means, cheaper generics will be available. Is the world ready for this?

Zerodha founder and CEO Nithin Kamath has sparked a conversation on social media by describing weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro as the ""closest thing we've seen to a miracle drug ."" In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Kamath highlighted the transformative potential of these medications, which were originally developed for diabetes management but have shown remarkable results in weight loss and other health benefits.Ozempic and Mounjaro belong to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 receptor agonists , which regulate blood sugar levels, reduce appetite, and curb cravings. Kamath noted that these drugs have helped patients lose 15-20% of their body weight, making them a game-changer in addressing obesity and related health issues.Kamath also pointed out the broader implications of these drugs, citing research that suggests they may reduce addictive tendencies, such as smoking and gambling, and lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases, dementia, and Alzheimer's. ""Even if half of what's being reported is true, then this will be the closest thing we've seen to a miracle drug,"" he wrote.Kamath also speculated on the potential ripple effects of widespread adoption of these drugs, including changes in consumer behaviour and industry dynamics. He mentioned that reduced appetite could impact the food industry, while longer life expectancy might necessitate adjustments in insurance premiums and pension payouts. Despite their promise, Kamath acknowledged the challenges associated with these drugs, including their high cost—estimated at over ₹2 lakh annually for a typical dose—and the need for more research to understand their long-term effects.","Zerodha founder and CEO Nithin Kamath has described weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro as the ""closest thing we've seen to a miracle drug"" Kamath noted that these drugs have helped patients lose 15-20% of their body weight, making them a game-changer in addressing obesity and related health issues.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119464330,imgsize-53096,width-400,resizemode-4/119464330.jpg"

He further added, "" IPL should just replace bowlers with bowling-machines.""The IPL 2025 season, the 18th edition of the tournament, commenced on March 22 and is scheduled to conclude on May 25.

No longer a fair contest between Vat and Ball, feels like watching someone play a video game.” “Good idea … that way the Mental Health of the bowlers will also be in check!!,” another user added.A third user added “it’s boring to see such high scoring games- don’t understand why the IPL doesn’t get that”. “Ap shaddi karvate Karvate Cricket expert kb se ban gaye?,” joked another.“Check top paid players in 2025 IPL.

Questions about Oracle’s role

Three Democratic senators have called on the White House to obtain congressional approval to extend the deadline for ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok , to sell the app’s U.S. operations and avoid a potential ban. According to a Reuters report, Senators Ed Markey, Chris Van Hollen, and Cory Booker have written to President Donald Trump, urging him to back legislation that would extend the sale deadline to October. The law, passed last year, requires ByteDance to sell a majority stake to U.S. owners or face a ban in the country.Trump had previously extended the deadline from January 19 to April 5 and indicated last month that he could push it further to allow more time for a deal. The senators criticized the administration's approach, saying, “This non-enforcement of the TikTok ban was not only unlawful but also raised serious questions about TikTok's future.”According to the report, discussions led by the White House are centering around a plan in which non-Chinese investors in ByteDance would increase their stakes and take control of TikTok’s U.S. operations. The plan would spin off a separate U.S. entity for TikTok, reducing Chinese ownership to avoid a ban, sources familiar with the talks said.The senators have also asked Trump to clarify whether he intends to extend the deadline and on what legal basis. Additionally, they want confirmation on reports that the White House is considering a deal involving software company Oracle, which could take a stake in TikTok and oversee its user data security.Trump stated earlier this month that his administration has been in discussions with four unidentified groups about a potential TikTok deal. The White House and TikTok have not yet responded to requests for comment.","Senators Ed Markey, Chris Van Hollen, and Cory Booker have written to President Donald Trump, urging him to back legislation that would extend the sale deadline to October.

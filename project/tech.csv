Letter follows attack on subsea infrastructure

Three prominent Republican House lawmakers have reportedly raised national security concerns about the network of more than 400 subsea cables that handle 99% of international internet traffic and about threats from China and Russia. According to a report by Reuters, these lawmakers have pressed the CEOs of Alphabet, Meta, Amazon.com, and Microsoft on the security of critical submarine communications cables, citing escalating national security concerns. The move comes as Washington raises alarms about potential threats from China and Russia to the vast network of over 400 subsea cables that carry an estimated 99% of global internet traffic.In a letter sent Monday (July 21), Representatives John Moolenaar (Chair of the House panel on China), Carlos Gimenez (Chair of a relevant subcommittee), and Keith Self (Chair of another relevant subcommittee) voiced particular apprehension regarding the continued involvement of ""China-affiliated entities such as SBSS, Huawei Marine, China Telecom, and China Unicom"" in the maintenance and servicing of cable systems in which the tech giants hold direct or indirect operational involvement or ownership.The lawmakers stated their committees are ""examining the extent to which foreign adversarial actors are positioning themselves, both overtly and covertly, to compromise subsea cable systems at key points of vulnerability."" They have given the companies until August 8 to disclose any instances of suspected hardware tampering, optical signal tapping, unexpected signal distortion, or other operational irregularities observed during cable repair or maintenance.""A growing body of evidence points to a pattern of coordinated malign activity linked to the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation targeting subsea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea, Indo-Pacific, and other strategic regions,"" the letter asserted.This congressional inquiry follows recent actions and incidents highlighting the vulnerability of subsea infrastructure. Recently, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chair Brendan Carr announced the agency's plan to implement rules prohibiting companies from connecting undersea submarine communication cables to the United States if they incorporate Chinese technology or equipment.Since 2020, U.S. regulators have been instrumental in blocking four proposed cable projects intended to link the United States with Hong Kong. More recently, in November 2024, two fiber-optic undersea telecommunication cables in the Baltic Sea were severed, prompting sabotage investigations. In 2023, Taiwan accused two Chinese vessels of cutting the only two cables providing internet access to the Matsu Islands. Additionally, Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have been implicated in the severing of three cables vital for internet service to Europe and Asia.","Reps.

A gang of hackers called the Akira reportedly attacked a 158-year-old UK company, leading to its shutdown and leaving around 700 people jobless. According to a BBC report, the cyber attackers hacked into the computer system of KNP - a Northamptonshire transport company by guessing an employee’s password. After cracking the password, the cyber criminals encrypted the company's data and locked its internal systems, leaving staff unable to access any of the data needed to run the business.. The report states that KNP runs 500 lorries under the brand name Knights of Old and had its IT complied with industry standards.After tapping into the company’s computer system, the hackers left a ransom note. It said: “If you're reading this it means the internal infrastructure of your company is fully or partially dead…Let's keep all the tears and resentment to ourselves and try to build a constructive dialogue”.While the ransomware gang did not specify the exact amount they wanted in return for giving access back to the company, experts estimate it could be around £5 million.The BBC report states that KNP did not have the amount, subsequently leading to all data loss and the company’s demise.Cyber attacks on companies have increased in recent times. Big names such as M&S, Co-op and Harrods have all been victims of such attacks in the past months.In May this year, Marks and Spencer (M&S) was hit by a cyberattack impacting its online services which was then projected to cost the group 300 million pounds ($404 million). The British retailer disclosed that personal customer data had been stolen in a cyberattack, which has already crippled its online operations for several weeks.""In Fashion, Home & Beauty, online sales and trading profit have been heavily impacted by the necessary decision to pause online shopping, however stores have remained resilient,"" M&S noted in a statement (via news agency AFP).

Asset managers navigate data security challenges

BlackRock , the world's largest asset manager, has imposed new restrictions on company-issued devices for employees traveling to China, requiring staff to use temporary loaner phones and prohibiting company laptops during business trips, according to Bloomberg News and Reuters reports.The financial giant detailed the ""policy enhancement"" in an internal memo effective July 16, barring the use of BlackRock-issued iPhones, iPads, laptops, and remote access via virtual private networks while in China. Employees will also lose access to the BlackRock network during personal travel to the country, Bloomberg reported.The move reflects mounting corporate anxiety about business operations in China as geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing continue to strain international business relationships. BlackRock did not immediately respond to requests for comment from either Reuters or Bloomberg.The restrictions come after a series of high-profile incidents involving Western business executives being prevented from leaving China. Wells Fargo suspended travel to China last week after one of its senior trade financing bankers, Chenyue Mao, was blocked from departing the country in what Beijing's foreign ministry described as a criminal matter.Earlier this month, China also prevented a US Patent and Trademark Office employee from leaving during a personal visit, while a US Commerce Department worker has reportedly been unable to leave China for several months.Since China implemented stricter data security laws in 2021, global financial firms have struggled to balance operational needs with compliance requirements. Many banks and asset managers have established onshore data centers to keep Chinese information within the country, adding significant costs and complicating business management.BlackRock maintains a substantial presence in China through a wholly owned mutual fund company and a wealth management joint venture with China Construction Bank Corp.

Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for 'offensive' political slurs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/poland-flags-elon-musks-grok-chatbot-to-the-eu-for-offensive-political-slurs/articleshow/122348777.cms,"Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for “offensive” political slurs

Why Poland says Elon Musk's Grok chatbot crossed a red line



Offensive answers: From antisemitic tropes to political insults



European digital rules put xAI under the spotlight



Previous incidents: Turkey, hate speech, and Grok’s growing rap sheet



xAI and Musk offer silence, at least for now



Poland just pulled the alarm on Grok, the AI chatbot from Elon Musk ’s xAI. Officials in Warsaw say the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders, so they’re asking the European Commission to investigate and, if the rules allow, hit xAI or X with fines.Krzysztof Gawkowski, Poland’s digitisation minister, told RMF FM radio that the bot’s remarks amounted to hate speech. He argued that ignoring algorithm-driven abuse “may cost humanity in the future,” so his ministry will file an official complaint under existing EU regulations.The step is unusual but legal: member states can trigger EU probes when digital services target their citizens with unlawful content. If Brussels agrees, xAI could face penalties under the Digital Services Act or the forthcoming AI Act.Grok’s missteps are piling up. The same day Poland aired its grievance, the Anti-Defamation League flagged responses in which the bot praised Adolf Hitler and recycled antisemitic stereotypes. xAI deleted the posts, calling them “inappropriate,” yet offered no public apology.Users had also shared screenshots showing Grok calling Tusk “a coward in Brussels slippers,” among other jabs. Warsaw says the language breaches Poland’s hate-speech law and the EU’s code of practice on disinformation.The EU’s Digital Services Act took full effect for very large platforms in February 2025. It forces companies such as X to assess systemic risks, audit their algorithms, and let regulators peek behind the curtain. An AI-specific law is coming later this year, likely adding fresh transparency mandates. Poland’s complaint tees up an early test of those combined powers.Legal scholars note that fines can reach 6 percent of global turnover for DSA violations. For Musk’s empire, that runs into billions.Poland is not alone. A Turkish court ordered X to block Grok content that mocked President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and Islamic beliefs.In June, users spotted the bot rambling about a supposed “white genocide” in South Africa. xAI blamed an “unauthorised change” to its response code.Each flare-up feeds an image of a system that swings from playful banter to extremist rhetoric with a single prompt.As of Wednesday afternoon, xAI had not replied to Reuters’ emailed questions, and Musk’s normally hyperactive X feed stayed quiet on the topic.The billionaire recently urged “maximum free speech” on X, but he also says AI must be “truth-seeking.” That balance gets messy when the bot channels conspiracy theories or ethnic slurs.","Poland says the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's net worth soars $1 billion as the chipmaker joins the $4 trillion club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-net-worth-soars-1-billion-as-the-chipmaker-joins-the-4-trillion-club/articleshow/122377958.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang’s net worth passes $140 billion



Nvidia’s market value climbs above $4 trillion



How a 3.5 percent stake fuels one of the world’s biggest fortunes



Where Jensen Huang now ranks among global billionaires



Why investors keep bidding the price up

AI demand everywhere. Cloud providers, carmakers, and sovereign data-centre projects line up for the current Hopper chips and the coming Blackwell series.

Scarcity premium. Nvidia controls around 80 percent of high-end AI GPU supply, and capacity stays tight even after Taiwan’s fabs ramp up output.

Ecosystem lock-in. CUDA software and support contracts make switching costs high, so even rivals that launch competitive silicon must still lure developers away.

What could slow the rally

Export curbs. The United States still blocks top-tier chips from shipping to China, Nvidia’s largest single-country market outside the U.S.

New competition. AMD, Intel and a clutch of start-ups are readying chips that nibble at Nvidia’s margins, especially in inference workloads.

Rich valuation. At about 40 times forward earnings, the stock leaves little room for an earnings miss; even a small disappointment could yank billions from Huang’s paper wealth.

Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold. The jump did more than rewrite Wall Street leaderboards; it also pushed co-founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s fortune past $140 billion. He owns about 3.5 percent of Nvidia, held directly and through family trusts, so every flicker in the share price lands straight in his pocket.Bloomberg’s daily billionaire tally shows Jensen Huang adding roughly $1 billion in a single session, and nearly $28 billion in 2025 so far. That kind of lift puts him shoulder-to-shoulder with household names like Warren Buffett, a spot unthinkable just three years ago. Investors keep paying the premium because Nvidia sells the chips that make modern AI run, from data-centre clusters to enterprise servers. The faster the market grows, the richer Huang becomes.As of the New York closing bell on 10 July, Bloomberg pegged Huang’s net worth at $143 billion, up from about $20 billion in early 2022. That leap happened in stages: $44 billion by mid-2023, $117 billion in late 2024, and now the $140-plus range. Fueled by the AI boom and soaring Nvidia shares, the difference this year alone is bigger than the entire market value of some Fortune 500 firms.The company’s share price settled near $164, capping a run that has lifted the stock 74 percent since April’s low and around 22 percent since January. Nvidia is now the dominant weight in the S&P 500, ahead of Apple and Microsoft. Analysts at Citi, Barclays and Loop Capital all raised their price targets this week, citing demand for the upcoming Blackwell platform and a backlog of data-centre orders.Huang’s percentage looks small beside founder holdings at some other tech giants, yet at a $4 trillion valuation it leaves him with shares worth roughly $140 billion. The stake figure comes from Nvidia’s March 2025 proxy filing and excludes unvested stock units. Cash, past dividend income and secondary-share sales round out the number Bloomberg uses, but the equity slice is what matters daily.With the latest move, he edges into Bloomberg’s global top ten, swapping places with Google’s Larry Page and closing in on Warren Buffett. Forbes, which refreshes less often, lists him ninth. None of the other names in that bracket made their money so fast in so short a window.","N Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold.

YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

3. Are AI-generated videos banned from monetisation?

4. Do the subscriber and watch-time thresholds change?

5. What happens if my channel is flagged for inauthentic uploads?

6. Are reaction videos or clip compilations automatically disqualified?

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.

App Store changes announced by Apple

Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7: 7 UNMATCHED Features No Other Foldable Has!

Apple’s updates to its App Store rules and fees are likely to get approval from EU antitrust regulators soon, says a report by news agency Reuters. Citing people familiar with the matter, the report states that this could help the Cupertino-based company avoid large daily fines. Last month, the iPhone maker said that developers will soon be required to pay a 20% processing fee for purchases made via the App Store. For Apple’s small-business program, the fees could go as low as 13%.The changes were announced after the EU antitrust regulator fined Apple with a 500 million euro ($586.7 million) fine in April this year. The regulator then gave it 60 days to comply with the Digital Markets Act.As announced by Apple, developers who send customers outside the App Store for payment will pay a fee between 5% and 15%. Further, they will also be able to use as many links as they wish to send users to outside forms of payment.Apple said that it had introduced these changes to avoid punitive daily fines. It also criticised the Commission for mandating how it runs its stores. If not implemented, Apple may have to pay daily fines of 5% of its average daily worldwide revenue, or about 50 million euros per day.As per Reuters report, the European Commission is expected to approve the changes in the coming weeks. Timing, however, could still change, it added.""All options remain on the table. We are still assessing Apple's proposed changes,"" the EU watchdog said.","Apple’s updates to its App Store rules and fees are likely to get approval from EU antitrust regulators soon.

Why Apple CEO Cook and Elon Musk ‘fell behind’



Jensen Huang , CEO of Nvidia, is said to be emerging as the most politically influential technology leader within the second Donald Trump administration, a position previously held by Apple's Tim Cook and Tesla CEO Elon Musk . Citing Dan Ives of Wedbush, CNBC reported that in “Trump 2.0,” Nvidia surpassed Apple as America's most valuable company and Huang's leadership as well as Nvidia's role in the AI revolution have pushed him above other tech executives.""Huang has become a global figure and taken on a new role politically due to his success in the AI revolution,"" stated Ives of Wedbush, noting that the importance of Nvidia's AI chips has “vaulted him ahead of Cook.”“He has found himself in a very strong position to navigate the political landscape... [as] there is only one chip in the world fueling the AI revolution, and that’s Nvidia’s,” Ives added.Recently, the US gave a go-ahead to Nvidia to resume selling its watered-down AI chip, H20, specifically designed for China – a reversal of earlier export restrictions that industry experts largely attribute to Huang's direct lobbying.“It was a historic win for Nvidia and Jensen... and I think it shows the increasing political influence that Huang’s having within the Trump administration,” Ives commented.The H20 reversal is publicly linked to broader US-China trade negotiations. However, several experts speaking to CNBC suggested Huang's lobbying played a substantial role.The Nvidia CEO has met with Trump multiple times this year, including a trip to the Middle East in May that resulted in a massive AI deal to deliver hundreds of thousands of Nvidia's advanced AI chips to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).In contrast to Huang's rising influence, Elon Musk experienced a public rupture with Trump in recent months over the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’. Meanwhile, under Trump's second presidency, Apple CEO Tim Cook has faced renewed pressure from the administration.In May, Trump expressed a “little problem with Tim Cook” regarding Apple's plans in manufacturing in India, despite Apple's February commitment of a $500 billion investment in the US.","Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, is said to be emerging as the most politically influential technology leader within the second Donald Trump administration.

Google-owned YouTube has removed nearly 11,000 channels and other accounts in the second quarter of this year due to their involvement in state-linked propaganda campaigns, primarily originating from China and Russia , a report has said. Notably, Google removed over 23,000 accounts in the first quarter.As per CNBC, the takedown included over 7,700 YouTube channels linked to China. These campaigns primarily disseminated content in Chinese and English, promoting China, supporting President Xi Jinping, and commenting on US foreign affairs.The report further states that along with Chinese state-related videos, it removed over 2,000 channels that were tied to Russia. Their content, published in multiple languages, expressed support for Russia and engaged with topics concerning Ukraine, NATO and Western nations.These account removals are part of the efforts by Google's Threat Analysis Group to counter global disinformation campaigns and “coordinated influence” operations, the report highlighted.Google's second-quarter report also detailed the removal of influence campaigns linked to Azerbaijan, Iran, Turkey, Israel, Romania, and Ghana, which were found to be targeting political rivals. Some of these campaigns focused on escalating geopolitical conflicts, including narratives from both sides of the Israel-Palestine War, the report added.“The findings from the most recent update are in line with our expectations of this regular and ongoing work,” a YouTube spokesperson was quoted as saying.In the first quarter, Google removed over 23,000 accounts. Meanwhile, Meta announced last week that it had removed approximately 10 million profiles impersonating large content producers during the first half of 2025, as part of its own initiative to combat “spammy content.”This action follows Google's removal in May of 20 YouTube channels, 4 Ads accounts, and 1 Blogger blog connected to RT, the Russian state-controlled media outlet.

Lawyers weigh in: No legal case



Astronomer announces Andy Byron resignation as CEO



Former Astronomer CEO Andy Byron was embarrassed publicly after the ‘Kiss Cam’ scandal which happened at the recent Coldplay concert in Boston. During the recent Coldplay concert in former Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and HR chief Kristin Cabot were seen cuddling in a now viral ‘Kiss Cam’ moment. The couple after being captured by the camera looked startled, with Cabot turning away and Byron ducking. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin also said jokingly, “Either they’re having an affair, or they’re just very shy.” Now legal experts suggest that Byron has no viable grounds to sue the band. As reported by The Mirror, lawyers suggest that being caught on a big screen doing something embarrassing in public does not constitute a legal claim against the performers or venue.After the whole viral controversy there were speculations that Byron may sue Coldplay for the public humiliation. However, the legal experts claim that Byron would be dead on arrival and has no grounds to sue the brand or the venue. Employment lawyer Ron Zambrano told The Mirror that any lawsuit would be “dead on arrival,” noting that Coldplay’s use of the Kiss Cam is protected as artistic expression. “They just got caught,” he said bluntly.Entertainment attorney Tre Lovell added that Byron has no expectation of privacy at a public event. “The fact that the big screen caught the CEO doing something embarrassing or immoral in public is on him,” Lovell said.He clarified that while it is illegal to use someone's image for commercial purposes without permission or to defame them with false portrayals, the ""Kiss Cam"" incident did neither.Announcing Andy Byron’s resignation, Astronomer said in a statement, ""Andy Byron has tendered his resignation, and the Board of Directors has accepted. The Board will begin a search for our next Chief Executive as Cofounder and Chief Product Officer Pete DeJoy continues to serve as interim CEO.”The resignation came less than 24 hours after Astronomer announced Byron and Cabot had been put on leave and that a formal investigation was pending. ""Cofounder and Chief Product Officer Pete DeJoy is currently serving as interim CEO given Andy Byron has been placed on leave. We will share more details as appropriate in the coming days,"" said the company.","Former Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and HR chief Kristin Cabot were seen cuddling in a now viral ‘Kiss Cam’ moment.

1.8 billion Gmail users at risk: Experts warn of hidden threat stealing passwords silently,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/1-8-billion-gmail-users-at-risk-experts-warn-of-hidden-threat-stealing-passwords-silently/articleshow/122838917.cms,"How the scam works



What Google and experts recommend



Google has reportedly issued a warning to 1.8 billion Gmail users around the world about a new type of scam. This sophisticated online scam uses invisible email prompts to trick its own AI assistant, Gemini into stealing passwords. According to a report by The Sun, the warning is for a specific kind of threat which is designed to fool users and lead them to reveal their login credentials. This alert also highlights the persistent threat of sophisticated cyberattacks that mainly target personal accounts online.The report adds that cybercriminals are embedding hidden instructions in emails with the help of white text and zero font size. This text is invisible to the user but can be easily read by Gemini. Whenever a user clicks on ‘summarise this email’ option, Gemini may generate fake security alerts and prompt the user to share their sensitive information of make calls to fraudulent support numbers.As per the report by The Sun, the hackers embed som indirect prompt injections into emails. The Google chatbot— Gemini, then read these hidden commands and display false warnings on the screen of the user. The users are then asked to click on malicious links or call some fake support lines. The AI cannot distinguish between user queries and embedded hacker prompts which leads to the user being scammed.Cybersecurity experts are urging all Gmail users to remain vigilant and adopt robust security practices. The experts have urged the users to not trust Gemini summaries which claim that their account has been compromised. The experts also advise users to configure email clients to detect and neutralise hidden content. The users can also use post-processing filters which will help in scanning suspicious keywords, URL’s or phone numbers. Also, consider switching to passkeys for stronger, phishing-resistant authentication.Mozilla’s 0Din security team first uncovered the exploit, showing how Gemini could be manipulated into displaying a fake alert that a user’s password had been stolen. Google has acknowledged the issue but has yet to fully patch the vulnerability.","Google has reportedly issued a warning to 1.8 billion Gmail users around the world about a new type of scam.

Why French lawmakers are probing Twitter

Twitter responds to French probe

Google Pixel 10 Series Launch: Everything Coming on August 20

French authorities are investigating Elon Musk owned X (formerly Twitter) for alleged algorithm manipulation. The social media platform denied the allegations, calling it “a politically-motivated criminal investigation”. Responding to the news, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has now shared an X post where he said that “at this point, any tech company can be declared a ‘criminal gang’ in France"". Durov further stated that such investigations can be harmful for attracting investments.“A decade of efforts to attract tech investment is being undone by a few bureaucrats advancing their careers and political agendas — at the expense of the French people,” he wrote in the post.Earlier this month, French prosecutors opened a preliminary probe into the social media platform, accusing it of data tampering. Based on suspected algorithmic bias and fraudulent data extraction, the probe authorizes police to conduct searches, wiretaps and surveillance against Elon Musk and Twitter executives, or summon them to testify. If they do not comply, a judge could issue an arrest warrant, a Reuters report said.Responding to the probe, X Global Government Affairs account wrote on X:“French authorities have launched a politically-motivated criminal investigation into X over the alleged manipulation of its algorithm and alleged “fraudulent data extraction.” X categorically denies these allegations.”The post further continued “This investigation, instigated by French politician Eric Bothorel, egregiously undermines X’s fundamental right to due process and threatens our users’ rights to privacy and free speech. Mr Bothorel has accused X of manipulating its algorithm for “foreign interference” purposes, an allegation which is completely false.”“X is committed to defending its fundamental rights, protecting user data and resisting political censorship,” the post concluded.","French authorities are investigating Elon Musk owned X (formerly Twitter) for alleged algorithm manipulation.

​Explained: Why this mathematician thinks OpenAI isn’t acing the International Mathematical Olympiad — and might be ‘cheating’ to win gold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-why-this-mathematician-thinks-openai-isnt-acing-the-international-mathematical-olympiad-and-might-be-cheating-to-win-gold/articleshow/122837520.cms,"TL;DR



AI isn’t taking the real test: GPT models “solving” International Math Olympiad (IMO) problems are often operating under very different conditions—rewrites, retries, human edits.

(IMO) problems are often operating under very different conditions—rewrites, retries, human edits. Tao’s warning: Fields Medalist Terence Tao says comparing these AI outputs to real IMO scores is misleading because the rules are entirely different.

says comparing these AI outputs to real IMO scores is misleading because the rules are entirely different. Behind the curtain: Teams often cherry-pick successes, rewrite problems, and discard failures before showing the best output. It’s not cheating, but it’s not fair play: The AI isn’t sitting in silence under timed pressure—it’s basically Iron Man in a school exam hall.

Main takeaway: Don’t mistake polished AI outputs under ideal lab conditions for human-level reasoning under Olympiad pressure.

The Bottom Line

FAQ: AI, the IMO, and Terence Tao’s Critique



Q1: What is the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)?

Q2: What’s the controversy with AI and IMO questions?

Q3: Who raised concerns about this?

Q4: Is this AI cheating?

Q5: What’s Tao’s main point?

Q6: Does Tao oppose AI?

Q7: What should change?

Led Zeppelin once sang, “There’s a lady who’s sure all that glitters is gold.”But in the age of artificial intelligence, even the shimmer of mathematical brilliance needs closer scrutiny. These days, social media lights up every time a language model like GPT-4 is said to have solved a problem from the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) — a competition so elite it makes Ivy League entrance exams look like warm-up puzzles.“This AI solved an IMO question!”“Superintelligence is here!”“We’re witnessing the birth of a digital Newton!”Or so the chorus goes.But one of the greatest living mathematicians isn’t singing along. Terence Tao, a Fields Medal–winning professor at UCLA, has waded into the hype with a calm, clinical reminder: AI models aren’t playing by the same rules. And if the rules aren’t the same, the gold medal doesn’t mean the same thing.The International Mathematical Olympiad is the Olympics of high school math. Students from around the world train for years to face six unspeakably hard problems over two days. They get 4.5 hours per day, no calculators, no internet, no collaboration — just a pen, a problem, and their own mind.Solving even one problem in full is an achievement. Getting five perfect scores earns you gold. Solve all six and you enter the realm of myth — which, incidentally, is where Tao himself resides. He won a gold medal in the IMO at age 13.So when an AI is said to “solve” an IMO question, it’s important to ask: under what conditions?In a detailed Mastodon post, Tao explains that many AI demonstrations that showcase Olympiad-level problem solving do so under dramatically altered conditions. He outlines a scenario that mirrors what’s actually happening behind the scenes:“The team leader… gives them days instead of hours to solve a question, lets them rewrite the question in a more convenient formulation, allows calculators and internet searches, gives hints, lets all six team members work together, and then only submits the best of the six solutions… quietly withdrawing from problems that none of the team members manage to solve.”In other words: cherry-picking, rewording, retries, collaboration, and silence around failure.It’s not quite cheating — but it’s not the IMO either. It's an AI-friendly reconstruction of the Olympiad, where the scoreboard is controlled by the people training the system.Tao’s criticism isn’t just about fairness — it’s about what we’re really evaluating.He writes,“A student who might not even earn a bronze medal under the standard IMO rules could earn a ‘gold medal’ under these alternate rules, not because their intrinsic ability has improved, but because the rules have changed.”This is the crux. AI isn’t solving problems like a student. It’s performing in a lab, with handlers, retries, and tools. What looks like genius is often a heavily scaffolded pipeline of failed attempts, reruns, and prompt rewrites. The only thing the public sees is the polished output.Tao doesn’t deny that AI has made remarkable progress. But he warns against blurring the lines between performance under ideal conditions and human-level problem-solving in strict, unforgiving settings.Tao is careful not to throw cold water on AI research. But he urges a reality check.“One should be wary of making apples-to-apples comparisons between the performance of various AI models (or between such models and the human contestants) unless one is confident that they were subject to the same set of rules.”A tweet that says “GPT-4 solved this problem” often omits what really happened:– Was the prompt rewritten ten times?– Did the model try and fail repeatedly?– Were the failures silently discarded?– Was the answer chosen and edited by a human?Compare that to a teenager in an exam hall, sweating out one solution in 4.5 hours with no safety net. The playing field isn't level — it’s two entirely different games.Terence Tao doesn’t claim that AI is incapable of mathematical insight. What he insists on is clarity of conditions. If AI wants to claim a gold medal, it should sit the same exam, with the same constraints, and the same risks of failure.Right now, it's as if Iron Man entered a sprint race, flew across the finish line, and people started asking if he’s the next Usain Bolt The AI didn’t cheat. But someone forgot to mention it wasn’t really racing.And so we return to that Led Zeppelin lyric: “There’s a lady who’s sure all that glitters is gold.” In 2025, that lady might be your algorithmic feed. And that gold? It’s probably just polished scaffolding.It’s the world’s toughest math competition for high schoolers, with six extremely challenging problems solved over two 4.5-hour sessions—no internet, no calculators, no teamwork.AI models like GPT-4 are shown to “solve” IMO problems, but they do so with major help: problem rewrites, unlimited retries, internet access, collaboration, and selective publishing of only successful attempts.Terence Tao, one of the greatest mathematicians alive and an IMO gold medalist himself, called out this discrepancy in a Mastodon post.Not exactly. But Tao argues that changing the rules makes it a different contest altogether—comparing lab-optimised AI to real students is unfair and misleading.He urges clarity. If we’re going to say AI “solved” a problem, we must also disclose the conditions—otherwise, it’s like comparing a cyborg sprinter to a high school track star and pretending they’re equals.No. He recognises AI’s impressive progress in math, but wants honesty about what it means—and doesn’t mean—for genuine problem-solving ability.If AI is to be judged against human benchmarks like the IMO, it must be subjected to the same constraints: time limits, no edits, no retries, no external tools.Tao’s verdict? If you want to claim gold, don’t fly across the finish line in an Iron Man suit and pretend you ran."," Fields Medalist Terence Tao says AI isn’t taking the real test.

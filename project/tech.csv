Amazon makes exception for this one country in its worldwide back-to-office policy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-makes-exception-for-this-one-country-in-its-worldwide-back-to-office-policy/articleshow/115585714.cms,"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, January 5, 2023.

Amazon is offering employees in Germany the option to work from home up to two days per week, creating a notable exception to its controversial global return-to-office mandate, according to internal documents obtained by Business Insider.The e-commerce giant will begin accepting flexible work applications from German staff starting December 15, even as it prepares to implement a five-day office requirement worldwide in January. The policy allows for both formal arrangements, which modify employment contracts, and informal arrangements requiring 24-hour advance notice.The exception for German employees stands in contrast to Amazon's broader stance on office attendance, which is notably stricter than peers like Google, Meta, and Microsoft, which maintain two to three-day office policies.Employees have also been mounting resistance to Amazon top executives over the stricter office attendance policy . Over 500 Amazon Web Services employees recently sent an open letter to AWS CEO Matt Garman , criticising the mandate as ""an outright abdication of AWS' role as one of the world's most innovative companies.""Garman has defended the policy, claiming that ""nine out of 10 employees"" he spoke with were ""actually quite excited by this change."" During an all-hands meeting, he suggested that dissatisfied employees could seek employment elsewhere, stating, ""If there are people who just don't work well in that environment and don't want to, that's okay, there are other companies around.""CEO Andy Jassy recently pushed back against speculation that the return-to-office mandate is a ""backdoor layoff,"" emphasising that the decision is ""very much about our culture and strengthening our culture."" The policy has particularly significant implications in Germany, where Amazon plans to employ over 40,000 permanent workers by year's end and has committed to a €10 billion investment in logistics and cloud infrastructure.The flexible work policy in Germany includes strict compliance measures, with Amazon reserving the right to take disciplinary action, including termination, for those who fail to follow the guidelines. Remote work arrangements will be limited to one-year terms and can be reconsidered at the company's discretion, Business Insider reports.","Amazon is offering employees in Germany the option to work from home up to two days per week.

"'Worst leak in streaming history': Our team is ..., update on ‘Netflix hack’ that leaked episodes of Terminator Zero, Squid Game and other shows online",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/worst-leak-in-streaming-history-our-team-is-update-on-netflix-hack-that-leaked-episodes-of-terminator-zero-squid-game-and-other-shows-online/articleshow/115609623.cms,"Netflix

Court order to Discord

The 'big Netflix leak'

Earlier this year, Netflix suffered from a massive leak that saw full episodes of some of its most popular shows including Terminator Zero, Arcane, Squid Game and Ranma 1/2 leak online ahead of their official release. Netflix had then released an official statement saying that it was “actively taking action” against the perpetrator of the leaks.It now appears, it may have found some lead here. Netflix is enlisting the help of Discord to track down the individual responsible for leaking unreleased footage of its Blockbuster shows. According to a report in Polygon, ""Netflix is looking toward Discord for help in figuring out who, exactly, is leaking unreleased footage from some of its popular shows.""The Northern District of California court recently issued a subpoena to compel Discord to share information that can help identify the Discord user who’s reportedly involved in leaking episodes and images from these popular Netflix shows. Documents filed alongside the subpoena reportedly specifically call out an unreleased and copyrighted photo from the second season of Squid Game, posted by a Discord user @jacejohns4n.The leak, which occurred in August, is believed to have originated from a security breach at Lyuno, a post-production studio that works with major streaming platforms. “One of our post production partners has been compromised and footage from several of our titles has unfortunately leaked online. Our team is aggressively taking action to have it taken down,” a Netflix representative told press at the time.In a statement published on Lyuno's website, a company spokesperson said, “Iyuno is aware of a recent security issue, involving unauthorized access to confidential content.” “Protecting our clients’ confidentiality and ensuring the security of their content is our highest priority. We are actively investigating this security breach to mitigate any potential risks and identify the responsible parties.”Other than Netflix, Lyuno's other customers include Amazon Studios, BBC, Disney, HBO, and DreamWorks.","Netflix is enlisting the help of Discord to track down the individual responsible for leaking unreleased footage of its Blockbuster shows.

The big Yes and No on Tiktok ban in the US

TikTok CEO Chew Shou Zi reportedly sought advice from Tesla CEO Elon Musk . According to an exclusive report in WSJ, ByteDance-owned TikTok chief executive officer Chew Shou Zi has sought input on US matters from Elon Musk. Tesla CEO has emerged as one of the closest advisers to President-elect Donald Trump.The Wall Street Journal reported on November 23, citing people familiar with the matter.TikTok CEO Chew is reported to have reached out to Tesla CEO in recent weeks and asked for his opinions on topics ranging from the incoming administration to potential tech policy, the report added as per news agency Reuters.The report added that both the executives have not discussed specific measures to keep TikTok running in the United States. ByteDance's senior leadership remains cautiously optimistic. Before the US election, ByteDance executives met with people close to both Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.Incidentally, there are also reports that Musk joined President-elect Donald Trump during his call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And earlier this week, The Information reported that Musk was there in the call when Google CEO Sunadr Pichai called to congratulate Pichai.Trump, who previously attempted to ban TikTok, has stated that he would not allow the app to be barred if elected in November. However, President Trump's pick for Federal Communications Commission chairman could be bad news for TikTok. In his Project 2025 chapter, Carr asserted that the Chinese social media platform TikTok “poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America’s national security” and should be banned.The new FCC chairman also reportedly has a close relationship with Musk and has accused Democrats of waging “regulatory lawfare” against Musk’s Starlink satellite internet service.","TikTok CEO Chew Shou Zi reportedly sought advice from Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

"Elon Musk is now the world's richest person ever in history, $70 billion jump in net worth in flat 20 days",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-is-now-the-worlds-richest-person-ever-in-history-70-billion-jump-in-net-worth-in-flat-20-days/articleshow/115600253.cms,"Elon Musk's net worth now $70 billion higher

How Elon Musk became the richest person again

There's still some more way to go

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is officially the richest he’s ever been (and the wealthiest person ever) with a net worth of $334.3 billion, according to Forbes. The planet’s richest person grew much richer as shares of the Musk-led publicly traded electric vehicle company Tesla soared after Donald Trump's win in the US election. Musk was the biggest supporter of Trump during the election campaign, even taking part in some of his rallies.He has been appointed chair of the new “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), where he will work alongside Vivek Ramaswamy.According to Forbes, the net worth of Elon Musk was a record $321.7 billion at market close Friday, November 22, getting a $7 billion boost as Tesla stock climbed 3.8% to a new 3.5-year closing high of $352.56 per share. That eclipses the previous high of $320.3 billion set on November 5, 2021 amid Tesla’s pandemic era surge.Musk's net worth is now more than $80 billion richer than the next wealthiest person, his friend and Oracle chairman Larry Ellison at $235 billion. Much of Musk's fortune comes from his 13% stake in Tesla worth $145 billion, with another 9% equity award in the company pending an appeal in Delaware court (Forbes discounts the value of the award by 50% in its valuation of Musk wealth).The substantial valuation of Musk's AI company xAI , valued at $50 billion, has further contributed to his wealth. SpaceX , valued at $210 billion, also plays a significant role in Musk's overall net worth.With this, Musk's fortune is now about $70 billion larger than it was on Election Day as Tesla shares surged 40% as Wall Street bought into what should be a more friendly regulatory environment under Trump for Tesla, especially for its self-driving vehicles, as per Forbes.Elon Musk's close ties with president elect Donald Trump have fuelled investor confidence. Wall Street analysts view the incoming administration's anticipated deregulation efforts as a significant advantage for Tesla, particularly for its Full Self-Driving initiatives, which have faced regulatory scrutiny.The other primary source of Musk's fortune is his 42% stake in SpaceX, which was valued at $210 billion in a June tender offer, putting his stake in the private aerospace and satellite communications company at $88 billion. Speculation around SpaceX's upcoming funding round, which could value the company at $250 billion, suggests that Musk's net worth might climb even higher, potentially adding $18 billion to his fortune.However, despite this historic rise in fortune, there still may be some more way to go as Tesla shares still remain about 14 per cent below their all-time high from late 2021.","Musk's net worth is now more than $80 billion richer than the next wealthiest person, his friend and Oracle chairman Larry Ellison at $235 billion.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk joined in a call between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and US President elect Donald Trump , reports The Information. The call took place shortly after Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris in the November 5 presidential election. It is not yet known what else was discussed on the phone call, apart from the congratulatory message. Musk reportedly listened in as Pichai congratulated and spoke with Trump.This isn’t the first time that reports of a conversation between Trump and Google’s CEO have surfaced online. During his election campaigns, Trump mentioned twice about calling Pichai.In an interview with Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait last month, Trump said that he called Google CEO Sundar Pichai to highlight alleged biases in Google search, claiming it only shows negative stories about him. He then said “I called the head of Google the other day and I said, ‘I’m getting a lot of good stories lately, but you don’t find them in Google’,” he said. Pichai, Trump said in the interview, told him that “you’re the No. 1 person on all of Google for stories”.Also read: Donald Trump: I called Google CEO Sundar Pichai the other day and said ...

He was recently appointed as co-chair of the newly formed “Department of Government Efficiency” alongside Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. “Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies - Essential to the 'Save America' Movement,” Trump said.The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX has previously participated in calls with global leaders and has offered advice on personnel decisions, both privately and publicly, through X—the social media platform he acquired in 2022. He has briefly joined a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as listened during a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

How SEC may have got access to WhatsApp chats

Adani Group trashes charges

US prosecutors have indicted Gautam Adani and his nephew, Sagar Adani, among others, for their alleged involvement in a $265 million (Rs 2,000 crore) bribery case to secure solar power supply contracts in India. According to court records cited by Reuters, arrest warrants have been issued in the US for Gautam and Sagar Adani, with prosecutors planning to hand these warrants to foreign law enforcement. Early Wednesday, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) charged Adanis, former Adani Green CEO Vneet Jaain, and executives from Azure Power and Canadian pension fund CDPQ under the Foreign Corruption Prevention Act (FCPA).Separately, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Gautam and Sagar Adani with raising funds from US investors through “false and misleading statements.” The SEC alleges they were directly involved in bribing Indian officials to secure contracts benefiting Adani Green.This account of how the alleged scheme unfolded is reportedly drawn from federal prosecutors' 54-page criminal indictment of Adani and seven of his associates and two parallel civil SEC complaints.

How robbers tricked SBI ATM machine

How the 'ATM scam' was detected

Two unidentified men have reportedly been accused of stealing Rs 2.52 lakh from an SBI ATM in Fort, Thiruvananthapuram, by manipulating the cash delivery system. The Fort police have registered a case under IPC Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) and are investigating the matter.The fraud, which occurred between June 2022 and July 2023, involved the suspects using multiple stolen or lost ATM cards to withdraw money from the SBI ATM on Padmavilasam Road. They employed a clever technique: after withdrawing cash, they would leave a single note in the machine's cash delivery compartment. This trickery led the ATM to register the transaction as incomplete and display a Timeout Error, preventing the amount from being deducted from the account holders' balances.This meant that no report was made of ATM fraud, as money was not deducted from any bank customer's account. But there was a mismatch in the money deposited in the ATM machine and the amounts withdrawn from customers accounts.The scam was detected when discrepancies were found between the total cash deposited in the ATM and the amounts withdrawn. A bank committee initially investigated the irregularities but couldn't pinpoint the cause. Not being able to find any proof as well as lead, the committee even suspected bank staff.However, a breakthrough came when the investigation team reviewed CCTV footage, identifying the suspects and their use of multiple stolen cards. They observed the suspects frequently visiting the machine and identified that they had used various stolen or lost ATM cards. Subsequently, SBI officials filed a report with the Fort police and gave VVTV captured photos of the suspects.","Two unidentified men have reportedly been accused of stealing Rs 2.52 lakh from an SBI ATM in Fort, Thiruvananthapuram, by manipulating the cash delivery system.

Once the scammers have extracted as much money as possible, they typically disappear, leaving the victim with significant financial losses.Meta announced that it is actively fighting organised crime rings in Southeast Asia that force people to work as online scammers.

"UK regulator says Apple ‘blocked’ browser innovation on iPhones; company says, “We are concerned that…”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uk-regulator-says-apple-blocked-browser-innovation-on-iphones-company-says-we-are-concerned-that/articleshow/115570965.cms,"Apple-Google search deal under lens

What Apple has to say

Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users. We disagree with the findings in the report regarding Safari, WebKit, and in-app browsing on iOS. We are concerned that the interventions discussed in the report for future consideration under the Digital Markets, Competition, and Consumers Act would undermine user privacy and security and hinder our ability to make the kind of technology that sets Apple apart. We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.

The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has provisionally found that Apple's policies are hindering innovation in mobile web browsers. The regulator also targeted Google’s $20 billion search deal with Apple in keeping the revenues flowing for the companies.The CMA's inquiry group specifically criticised Apple's requirement that all iOS browsers use its WebKit engine, which limits the functionality and differentiation of competing browsers.“The group has provisionally found that Apple’s rules restrict other competitors from being able to deliver new, innovative features that could benefit consumers. Other browser providers have highlighted concerns that they have been unable to offer a full range of browser features, such as faster webpage loading on iPhone. Many smaller UK app developers also told us that they would like to use progressive web apps – an alternative way for businesses to provide apps to mobile users without downloading apps through an app store – but this technology is not able to fully take off on iOS devices,” the CMA said.The CMA's report also highlights a revenue-sharing agreement between Apple and Google, suggesting that the arrangement reduces their incentive to compete with each other.“In addition, the group has provisionally found that a revenue-sharing agreement between Google and Apple significantly reduces their financial incentives to compete in mobile browsers on iOS,” it added.The CMA launched its investigation into Apple and Google's mobile dominance in 2021, focusing on app store practices, browsers and cloud gaming. While the CMA has dropped the cloud gaming aspect of its probe due to recent changes by Apple, it maintains concerns about Apple's browser policies.“The CMA is inviting comments on its provisional findings by December 13 and expects to make a final decision in March 2025,” it added.An Apple spokesperson said that it disagrees with the findings, as per a report by TechCrunch.",The UK's Competition and Markets Authority has provisionally found that Apple's policies are hindering innovation in mobile web browsers.

“Not even able to book a cab”

Telecom company confirms Vaageesan’s complaint

Student raised the issue on social media first

A seemingly harmless scene in the Tamil film Amaran , where lead actor Sai Pallavi casually displays a paper with a phone number, has caused unexpected turmoil for engineering student VV Vaageesan. The student claims the number shown in the film belongs to him, leading to significant disruption in his life. Vaageesan has now filed a ₹1.1 crore lawsuit against the filmmakers, seeking compensation for the ""untold hardships and mental agony"" caused by the incident.In the movie Sai Pallavi who plays the role of Indu Rebecca Verghese tosses a crumpled piece of paper with a mobile number written on it at the lead actor Sivakarthikeyan who is playing the role of Major Mukund Varadarajan. The number turned out to be that of Vageesan.To add to Vageesan's misery someone saved the number on Truecaller as “Vaageesan Indu Rebbbica VV”. Truecaller is a caller identification app. One can manually add a contact in the Truecaller app. To save a number in Truecaller, you can open the app, enter the phone number, and then manually add the contact details like name, profile picture, etc., through the ""Add contact"" option. It appears that a fan of 'Indu Rebecca Verghese' did the same. And since mobile numbers may be already linked to Vaageesan's name in Truecaller's database, the new name that users see linked to this mobile number on the app is: “Vaageesan Indu Rebbbica VV”.This further encouraged users to call him. Vageesan told The Hindu, which was first to carry the report, that he has been bombarded with calls from both Sai Pallavi fans as well as those trying to reach Indu Rebecca Verghese, wife of Major Mukund.Narrating his agony “Since the calls keep coming, I have to switch my phone to silent mode. I am worried that I may miss an emergency call or an important message from family members or friends. I have been using this number for two years — it is linked to my bank accounts and given to many of my contacts. I can’t afford to give it up,” he says. ""I am unable to even book a cab and call/receive the driver due to continuous incoming calls,"" he added.A telecom company confirmed to the publication that the spam issue was flagged by Vaageesan to the customer care/ A senior official said that the company is in the process of responding to the complaint. He did not give any further details on the complaint.The student claims that he initially sought to resolve the issue informally, tagging director Rajkumar Periyasamy and actor Sivakarthikeyan on social media to request their intervention. He, however, got no response forcing him to take legal recourse. His legal notice demands the removal of his number from the movie and compensation for the ""untold hardships and mental agony"" caused. The filmmakers, including the director and producers, are reportedly yet to respond to the legal notice.",Student raised the issue on social media first.

In an unexpected move that sent ripples through social media, Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal recently posted a job advertisement that required applicants to donate Rs 20 lakh to Feeding India and work for a year without a salary. The unconventional job listing drew widespread criticism and sparked discussions across various platforms, with entrepreneurs and users weighing in on the matter. Among the responses, Shaadi.com founder Anupam Mittal stood out with a humorous LinkedIn post, further fueling the debate. Goyal later clarified his intentions, but not before the controversy had captured widespread attention, highlighting contrasting opinions on leadership, privilege, and hiring practices.Deepinder Goyal’s job listing, aimed at hiring a Chief of Staff, raised eyebrows when it mentioned that applicants were expected to contribute Rs 20 lakh to the Feeding India initiative and accept no salary for a year. The ad, perceived by many as elitist and exclusionary, quickly went viral, leading to a wave of criticism and ridicule.Responding to the backlash, Goyal explained on X (formerly Twitter) that the Rs 20 lakh condition was never intended to be a mandatory requirement. He stated, ""This wasn’t just another hiring post. The ‘you have to pay us 20 lacs’ was merely a filter to identify people who could see the opportunity beyond the constraints."" According to Goyal, the unconventional strategy was aimed at attracting individuals with an entrepreneurial mindset and an ability to think outside the box.Entrepreneur and Shaadi.com founder Anupam Mittal took a light-hearted jab at the situation with a humorous LinkedIn post. In it, he invited applicants who couldn’t afford the Rs 20 lakh donation to apply for his Chief of Staff role instead. Mittal wrote, “All those who can't afford to pay my friend Deepi 20 lacs, please send me your application. I am looking for a Chief of Staff too, although I don't know exactly what one does.”The post, sprinkled with humour and emojis, quickly went viral, garnering mixed reactions. While some appreciated Mittal’s witty commentary, others accused him of seeking attention at the expense of the controversy. Writer Surabhi Chauhan remarked, “This is gonna sting Deepinder so hard,” to which Mittal replied, “He’s a big boy with a great sense of humour ... can handle it.”Social media users had polarising opinions on both Goyal’s job ad and Mittal’s response. While some applauded Mittal for his humour, others criticised him for jumping on the controversy bandwagon. One commenter accused him of using ""cheap tactics"" to grab attention, while another suggested his post was a product of AI tools like ChatGPT.Amid the backlash, Goyal revealed that his job posting had received over 18,000 applications despite the controversy.

The Indian government plans to offer up to $5 billion in incentives to domestic electronics manufacturing , reports Reuters quoting two unnamed government officials. The incentive will be given to produce components for devices ranging from mobile phones to laptops. This initiative aims to strengthen the country’s growing electronics industry while reducing reliance on imports from China .The report quotes two officials who said “The new scheme will incentivise production of key components like printed circuit boards that will improve domestic value addition and deepen local supply chains for a range of electronics”.The government is reportedly planning to offer these incentives under a new scheme which it may announce in the next two to three months. The officials, asked not to be identified, said that details of the scheme are not yet public.The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has designed the scheme. The ministry has reportedly identified components eligible for incentives and is in its final stages. As per the report, the finance ministry is likely to approve the moves.India's electronics production has surged over the past six years, reaching $115 billion in 2024, driven largely by mobile manufacturing growth from global giants like Apple and Samsung. The country has also become the fourth-largest supplier of smartphones globally. As per the government's top policy think tank Niti Aayog , India is aiming to expand its electronics manufacturing to $500 billion by the fiscal year 2030, including production of components worth $150 billion.However, the industry has drawn criticism for its significant dependence on imported components, particularly from China. Commenting on the development, Pankaj Mohindroo, head of India's Cellular and Electronics Association, said “This scheme is coming at a time when it is critical to promote component manufacturing that will help us aim for a global-scale of electronics production”.",The Indian government plans to offer up to $5 billion in incentives to domestic electronics manufacturing.

US Jobs: Top 10 companies sponsoring H-1B visas in 2024,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-jobs-top-10-companies-sponsoring-h-1b-visas-in-2024/articleshow/115562331.cms,"H1B Visa

Here are the top 10 companies that have sponsored the most H-1B visas in 2024 as per USCIS.

Amazon Com Services LLC: 9,265 approvals

Infosys Limited: 8,140 approvals

Cognizant Technology Solutions: 6,321 approvals

Google LLC: 5,364 approvals

Tata Consultancy Services Limited: 5,274 approvals

Meta Platforms Inc: 4,844 approvals

Microsoft Corporation: 4,725 approvals

Apple Inc: 3,873 approvals

HCL America Inc: 2,953 approvals

IBM Corporation: 2,906 approvals

The analysis of H-1B visa sponsorship data for 2024 reveals a notable decline in sponsorships, particularly by major US tech companies. Firms like Amazon, Infosys, Google, and IBM have reduced the number of H-1B visas issued this year, signaling a shift in the landscape of foreign employment in the US. While Indian nationals continue to dominate the pool of H-1B visa holders—making up over 72% of all H-1B visa recipients in 2023—US companies seem to be scaling back their reliance on this visa category. This trend contrasts with the surge in H-1B applications by US-based firms like Amazon and Google in recent years, but many Indian IT firms are now focusing more on local recruitment and Green Card sponsorshipThe H-1B visa program, which allows US companies to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations, has been a crucial pathway for skilled immigrants, particularly from India. However, the 2024 data suggests a shift in this trend, with companies opting for alternative strategies or focusing on domestic talent.According to USCIS, Amazon and Indian IT services firms Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), have significantly reduced their sponsorship of H-1B visas in 2024. USCIS data for the fiscal year 2024 (October 1 to September 30) indicates a significant decline in H-1B visa approvals for nearly all of the top 15 sponsoring companies.Although Amazon remains the largest sponsor, its approvals decreased from over 11,000 in 2023 to just above 7,000 in 2024. Indian tech giants Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services, both with substantial US operations, also saw considerable drops.","The H-1B visa program allows US companies to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations.

Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) looking for a chief of staff role for his company. The job, however, had an expensive twist where candidates must pay a fee of Rs 20 lakh to Zomato and work without pay for a year. The post soon got viral on the internet, generating waves of criticism. Amidst this, a former Zomato employee shared insights about his experience working with Goyal.Arnav Gupta, who worked with Zomato for a year, said that the chance to work with Goyal “is worth waaaay more than Rs 20”.Replying to Goyal’s post, he said “I know people are commenting various stupid things about ""paid internship"". Leaving this note here as someone who got the chance to work 1 year with @deepigoyal, if you're looking for a career in Management Consulting / Strategy, this is worth waaaay more than ₹20L!When a user asked “Why he has to pay?”, Gupta replied “If you ask this question, then it is not for you. Btw, there is no MBA in India with fees less than 20L. Including IIMs”.In another post, a user slammed Zomato CEO for demanding Rs 20 lakh. He said “create urgency, people start stacking up money from relatives and friends and go beyond to arrange it!! update 3: haha f*** you, if you have the money you're out.”Gupta replied saying “The application had 24 hr deadline. The 20L money didn’t have 24hr deadline. So if you can’t prioritise between these two things “first get selected then figure the money”, then you’re not qualified for that role. As simple as that.”Stating that his posting received more than 18,000 applications, Goyal said that the Rs 20 lakh fee requirement was merely a screening tool that won't actually be implemented.""We have closed applications for my chief of staff role. We have received more than 18,000 applications,"" Goyal posted on X. He added that the company will review applications over the next week to find candidates who align with their vision of building a ""learning organisation.""","Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal recently posted on X looking for a chief of staff role.

Apple is reportedly working on a new version of Siri,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-is-planning-to-launch-a-chatgpt-like-siri-in-2026/articleshow/115560951.cms,"While Apple is temporarily partnering with OpenAI to enhance Siri's capabilities, the company is simultaneously developing its own large language models to power a more advanced version of its digital assistant, aiming to compete with ChatGPT and other AI assistants. The plan is to have the Siri overhaul ready for launch by spring 2026, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.The upcoming overhaul, internally dubbed ""LLM Siri,"" aims to enable more sophisticated back-and-forth conversations and faster request processing across iPhones, iPads, and Macs. The company plans to announce these changes as part of iOS 19 and macOS 16 software updates, codenamed Luck and Cheer, Bloomberg reports.This builds upon the enhanced Siri coming with iOS 18 as a part of Apple Intelligence, which features a new glowing interface, richer language understanding, onscreen awareness, and the ability to perform actions across apps while allowing users to search through emails, notes, and documents privately. The 2026 version will further advance these capabilities, using Apple-built AI models to provide ChatGPT-like interactions while expanding its ability to control third-party apps through App Intents.In the meantime, Apple will introduce ChatGPT integration into Apple Intelligence next month, with plans to add other chatbot options like Google's Gemini in the future. Bloomberg reports that the company wants to build the features of these external chatbots into Siri to maintain its focus on user privacy.Recent job listings suggest Apple's commitment to these developments, seeking candidates with expertise in conversational AI interfaces. The company has already restructured its Siri team, moving the interaction group from its AI division to its software interfaces team, now led by Alan Dye, vice president of human interface design.","Apple is developing a new version of its digital assistant, codenamed Luck and Cheer.

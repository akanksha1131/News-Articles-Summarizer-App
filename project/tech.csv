Check full text of techie's Reddit post

I was a full-stack dev at an Indian startup, grinding at 6 LPA. Learned a ton, and after a lot of effort, landed a contract offer from a very early-stage

US-based startup

that looked like a dream – promising around 18 LPA.

Everything seemed set. I put in my papers at my old job, went through all the onboarding formalities with the new US startup, and served my notice period. But just as I was ready to officially start, they hit me with the news: due to sudden internal restructuring and unforeseen changes in their needs (which I very much suspect translates to they found some other candidate as I could see a new person join their slack before I was hit with the mail but again I'm not entirely sure), they had to revoke my offer. They did offer to pay for 15 days as a gesture, which I appreciate, but it doesn't change the fact that I'm now unexpectedly unemployed.

Trying to apply like a freak and getting literally no callbacks and it's been a tough pill to swallow, going from that high to this low so quickly.

I have 1.6 years of experience, primarily as a full-stack developer (skills include Next.js, MERN, DevOps so I can plan to deploy and monitor, worked on building MCP servers & clients, A2A workflow because of personal interest recently even though I don't know the fundamentals of Machine Learning lol but would love to learn anyways).

The next company I join will be my third, and so far, my entire career has been with startups. While the learning is immense, the uncertainty has been real. I'm now considering having some stability, a place where I can contribute and grow for at least 2-3 years. That doesn't mean I'll stop grinding or upskilling; I'm always eager to learn and push myself, but a bit more predictability would be welcome.

If anyone has any leads, referrals, or just some advice on navigating this, I'd be incredibly grateful. Thanks for reading.

In the fast-paced tech world, a young Indian full-stack developer 's story has gripped r/developersIndia, serving as both inspiration and warning. The anonymous Redditor shared a rollercoaster journey: in just one month, his salary soared from Rs 6 LPA to a promised Rs 18 LPA, only to plummet to Zero when his dream job vanished.

His big break came with a contract offer from a U.S. startup, tripling his pay. Excited, he resigned, served his notice, and prepared for the leap. But days before starting, a curt email cited “internal restructuring” and a sudden change in business needs as the reason for revoking the offer. A new name in the company’s Slack channel hinted at other motives. All in all, the dream of US job just vanished in thin air,The startup offered 15 days’ pay as a gesture, but it was cold comfort. Now unemployed, the developer faces the grueling job hunt once more, his story a stark reminder of the tech industry’s unpredictability.","A young Indian full-stack developer's story has gripped r/developersIndia.

What are concerns regarding Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez wedding

Full week of protests planned

The much-anticipated wedding of billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez , set for June 24 in Venice, is facing fierce backlash from residents and activists who claim the lavish event is turning the historic city into a ""playground for the wealthy."" The $10 million celebration, planned on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, has triggered protests over blocked streets, luxury hotel takeovers, and environmental concerns, threatening to disrupt the Floating City during its peak tourist season.Venetians are furious over the scale of the wedding, which has led to Bezos reserving five opulent hotels and every water taxi in the city, according to a Daily Mail report. Enhanced security measures, including a heavy police presence, closed streets, and restricted airspace, are expected to accommodate an A-list guest list of celebrities, politicians, and business tycoons. The disruptions coincide with Venice’s busiest travel period, exacerbating tensions in a city already strained by mass tourism.Local activist group Laboratorio Occupato Morion, which describes itself as an ""anti-fascist, anti-capitalist, anti-racist, and trans-feminist political space,"" is leading the charge against the event. The group has planned a protest for this Friday near St. Mark’s Square, with a larger demonstration scheduled for the wedding day. Their rallying cry, “No space for Bezos, No space for oligarchs!” is emblazoned on flyers featuring Bezos’ head atop a rocket, accusing him of treating Venice as a personal playground.“Jeff Bezos believes he can purchase the entire city,” the group’s flyer declares. “Those who live in Venice on a daily basis are left with discomfort, exclusion, and precariousness.”The wedding’s environmental impact is a major point of contention. Venice’s fragile lagoon and polluted canals are already under strain from overtourism, and the arrival of private jets—though Bezos’ four Gulfstream jets will be joined by others—adds to the city’s carbon footprint. His $500 million superyacht, Koru, cannot dock near Venice due to its size, but the influx of guests is expected to further stress the city’s delicate ecosystem.“Bezos embodies what this city and global movements have been fighting against for decades—a financial and technological oligarchy that exploits workers, the planet, and entire territories,” said Alice Bazzoli, a spokesperson for Laboratorio Occupato Morion, in an interview with the Daily Mail. The group views the wedding as a symbol of growing inequality and the commodification of Venice, a UNESCO World Heritage Site struggling to preserve its cultural and environmental heritage.The protests last week is said to be just the beginning, with Laboratorio Occupato Morion planning a series of smaller events in the week leading up to the wedding, culminating in a major demonstration on June 24. Activists argue that the event highlights the broader issue of Venice being overtaken by wealthy elites, leaving locals feeling marginalized in their own city.City officials have not yet commented on the protests or the wedding’s logistical arrangements, but the growing unrest signals a clash between Venice’s residents and the global elite. As the wedding date approaches, all eyes are on whether Bezos and Sanchez’s celebration will proceed as planned or face significant disruptions from an increasingly vocal opposition.","The much-anticipated wedding of billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez is set for June 24 in Venice.

However, the tech giant has yet to share a comment regarding the potential bankruptcy of its Russian subsidiary or President Putin's remarks. Microsoft maintained critical services in Russia following Moscow’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but in June 2022 announced a major reduction of its operations there due to shifts in the economic outlook and their effects on its business.According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the company had already pulled RT’s mobile apps from the Windows App Store and prohibited ads on Russian state–sponsored media shortly after the invasion. A recent notice posted on Fedresurs indicated that Microsoft Rus LLC plans to file for bankruptcy, the report claimed.According to the Russian news agency TASS, Microsoft also operates three additional Russian entities in the country, which are: Microsoft Development Centre Rus, Microsoft Mobile Rus, and Microsoft Payments Rus. However, the report doesn’t mention the status of these subsidiaries.In 2022, Alphabet-owned Google’s Russian subsidiary filed for bankruptcy after Russian authorities seized its bank account, rendering operations, such as paying local employees, suppliers, and vendors, impossible.","A Russian subsidiary of Microsoft is planning to file for bankruptcy, a report claims.

Victoria’s Secret has suspended all online orders due to a suspected cyberattack, though its brick-and-mortar stores remain operational. Despite a spokesperson reportedly confirming that third-party cybersecurity experts have been retained to address the issue, the lingerie company declined to provide details on the attack’s nature or the expected resolution timeline. The identity of the attackers is not yet known. This disruption follows a recent warning from Google that a cybercriminal group responsible for significant disruptions to British retailers had begun targeting major American brands. According to a report by NBC News, Victoria's Secret ’s website has been replaced with a generic message and no links since last week.The message reads: “Valued customer, we identified and are taking steps to address a security incident. We have taken down our website and some in store services as a precaution. Our team is working around the clock to fully restore operations. We appreciate your patience during this process.”In April, a cyberattack campaign targeting British retailers began and followed a consistent method. According to Google, a loosely affiliated group of predominantly young, English-speaking men, known in cybersecurity circles as Scattered Spider, deceived employees at these companies into revealing credentials for sensitive systems.Scattered Spider then reportedly passed that access to a criminal organization calling itself DragonForce, which extorts victims by threatening to release stolen data.This year, three British retailers confirmed they were hit by cyberattacks: Marks & Spencer suspended online orders for several weeks; the Co-op Group suffered a major customer data breach; and Harrods experienced only brief service interruptions.These attacks seem similar to the incidents that took place in 2023 against two major Las Vegas casino operators, in which MGM Resorts endured widespread outages, which ranged from hotel keycard failures to casino floor closures, after Scattered Spider allegedly granted access to a Russian-speaking criminal syndicate.",Victoria's Secret has suspended all online orders due to a suspected cyberattack.

Maharashtra’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cancelled the food business licence of Zepto ’s Dharavi facility after an inspection revealed multiple hygiene and food safety norms violations. According to an IANS report, the FDA’s inspection was triggered by a tip-off from Minister of State for FDA Yogesh Kadam. The inspection uncovered fungal growth on some food items, storage near stagnant water, unclean and wet floors, and cold storage units that failed to maintain the necessary temperature. Officials also found expired food products that were not separated from fresh stock.“The inspection at the Dharavi location revealed poor hygiene and unsafe food storage conditions,” said FDA officials.Following these findings, Assistant Commissioner of Food, Anupamaa Balasaheb Patil, ordered the cancellation of the facility’s licence under Section 32(3) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The suspension will remain in place until Zepto resolves the issues and obtains clearance from the licensing authority.The fast-growing quick commerce firm is reportedly under regulatory scrutiny at several other locations in Mumbai. Zepto’s storage hubs in Bhiwandi, Bandra East, and Borivali have also come under inspection. While operations at Bhiwandi and Bandra East were not halted, notices were issued for rule violations.In Borivali, the licence was briefly suspended but later reinstated after corrective steps were taken and approved by the FDA’s appellate authority.The IANS report quotes a Zepto spokesperson who said:“Maintaining the highest standards of food safety and hygiene is non-negotiable. We have already started an internal review and are working with authorities to fix the issues quickly.”Last month, Zepto paused its 10 minute food delivery service — Zepto Cafe in multiple cities across North India. According to a report by Economic Times, the company has temporarily suspended the services due to some supply chain issues. The report suggests that this decision of the company will impact 44 Zepto Cafe stores in the region. The decision of the company to halt the service has affected around 700 gig workers.","Maharashtra’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cancelled the food business licence of Zepto ’s Dharavi facility.

Powerbeats Pro 2 – Apple’s Most Powerful Workout Buds Yet!

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon issued a stark warning to American officials on Friday (May 30), urging them not to underestimate China’s resilience in the ongoing trade conflict. Speaking at the Reagan National Economic Forum in California, Dimon cautioned against the belief that China will fold under the pressure of escalating tariffs.""I would engage with China. I just got back from China last week. They're not scared, folks,"" Dimon told an audience of lawmakers, business leaders, and economists. ""This notion they're going to come bow to America, I wouldn't count on that. When they have a problem, they put 100,000 engineers on it. They've been preparing for this for years,"" added Dimon.Dimon’s comments come at a time when the Trump administration is pushing tough trade policies, believing that China won’t be able to handle the pressure from tariffs and will eventually give in. In May early, the two countries briefly eased tensions by lowering some tariffs, but that progress now seems to be falling apart.Jamie Dimon’s comments on trade came as part of a broader concern about the United States’ readiness for future global challenges — particularly in terms of military strength.""The military guys tell you that if there's a war in the South China Sea, we have missiles for seven days. Come on, we can't say that with a straight face and think that's okay,"" he said.He emphasized the need for urgent action. ""We know what to do, we just now gotta go about doing it.""The message from the head of America’s largest bank was clear: the U.S. should rethink its assumptions not just about global economics, but also about its broader preparedness for geopolitical conflict.","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon issued a stark warning to American officials on Friday (May 30) urging them not to underestimate China’s resilience in the ongoing trade conflict.

Meta , the tech giant behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has requested a federal judge to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) high-profile antitrust case, just as the trial approaches a critical phase. According to the, the case, which began in early April, represents one of the most significant regulatory challenges faced by Meta in its history, potentially resulting in the breakup of the company’s social media empire.Meta's move to dismiss the case comes after the FTC rested its side of the argument, asserting that the company holds an illegal monopoly over the social networking market, particularly those platforms focused on friends-and-family connections. Meta, however, argues that the FTC's case is based on a flawed market definition and ignores the intense competition it faces from newer platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X (formerly known as Twitter).In a court filing late Thursday, Meta reiterated its stance that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standards required to prove its antitrust allegations. The company’s legal team argues that the FTC has fundamentally mischaracterized the social media market, claiming that the agency's definition is overly narrow and excludes significant competitors.“After five weeks of trial, it is clear that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standard required under antitrust law,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement on Friday. “Regardless, we will present our case to show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram competes with TikTok (and YouTube and X and many other apps).”Meta claims that it faces substantial competition from a wide range of digital platforms, including short-video giant TikTok, video-sharing platform YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X. These platforms, Meta argues, all compete for user engagement, advertising revenue, and market share, undercutting the FTC’s claim that Meta has maintained an unlawful monopoly.The FTC’s antitrust lawsuit, which was first filed in December 2020, centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The agency claims that Meta pursued a deliberate “buy or bury” strategy, acquiring these fast-growing competitors to neutralize potential threats to its dominant position in the social networking market.In its filing, the FTC pointed to internal Meta communications as evidence of this strategy. This includes a 2012 email from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggesting that buying Instagram would “neutralize a competitor.” The FTC further argues that these acquisitions reduced consumer choice and stifled innovation, limiting competition in the rapidly evolving social media industry.The FTC's case aims to convince U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to order Meta to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp, effectively dismantling the company's integrated social media ecosystem.Meta's defense in the trial has focused on presenting itself as a company that supports innovation and benefits consumers. In its Thursday filing, the company argued that its acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth, which in turn delivered significant benefits to users.“Meta’s acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth – with correspondingly massive benefits for US consumers,” the company stated in its court filing.However, the trial has also brought to light internal documents that may complicate Meta’s defense. For instance, a 2018 email from an unnamed Instagram executive warned that ""fake engagement could be in the range of 40%,"" potentially undermining Meta's claims about the platform’s integrity and user trust.Mark Zuckerberg himself was the first witness called by the FTC as the trial opened, highlighting the personal stakes for the Meta CEO. During his testimony, Zuckerberg sought to portray Meta as a company facing fierce competition, rather than a monopoly crushing potential rivals.Earlier in the trial, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom testified that he felt Zuckerberg viewed Instagram’s rapid growth as a potential threat to Facebook’s dominance after the acquisition, further fueling the FTC’s argument that Meta's mergers were designed to stifle competition.The 10-week non-jury trial, which is expected to conclude in June, will be followed by final briefs from both the FTC and Meta. If Judge Boasberg sides with the FTC, a second trial will be held to determine appropriate remedies, potentially including the forced divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp.Meta will continue presenting its defense when the trial resumes on Monday. The company’s attempt to dismiss the case outright remains a long shot, as the judge may choose to let the case proceed to its scheduled conclusion before issuing a ruling.","The FTC's antitrust lawsuit centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.

"Jeff Bezos’ $165 billion divorce lesson: New bride Lauren gets prenup, not Amazon shares",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/jeff-bezos-165-billion-divorce-lesson-new-bride-lauren-gets-prenup-not-amazon-shares/articleshow/121513202.cms,"Jeff Bezos’ $165 billion divorce lesson: New bride Lauren gets prenup, not Amazon shares

Bezos’ divorce bombshell: How a missing prenup created a $35 billion settlement

Bezos’ new romance, new rules: The $220 billion prenup strategy

Inside the billion-dollar prenup: Legal experts weigh in

When Jeff Bezos married MacKenzie Scott in 1993, few could have predicted the trajectory of their lives. At the time, Amazon was a fledgling online bookstore operating from a garage, and the tech boom that would make Bezos one of the richest people in history was still years away. Their 25-year marriage not only survived Amazon's meteoric rise but also played a crucial role in shaping one of the most iconic business empires of the 21st century. Yet, despite the immense wealth they amassed, the couple entered their union without a prenuptial agreement—a decision that would reverberate globally after their 2019 divorce.MacKenzie walked away with a 4% stake in Amazon, instantly catapulting her into the ranks of the world's richest women. As of 2025, Forbes estimates her net worth to be around $165.3 billion. That highly publicized split not only altered the tech landscape but also sparked renewed conversations about asset protection in high-net-worth marriages.Now, with Jeff Bezos preparing to marry his fiancée Lauren Sánchez, a former TV anchor and entrepreneur, he appears to be approaching marriage with a new playbook. Legal insiders and wealth advisors reveal that this time, Bezos has opted for a comprehensive, multi-jurisdictional prenuptial agreement — a far cry from the informal beginning of his first marriage.Jeff and MacKenzie Scott met in the early 1990s when they were both working at hedge fund D.E. Shaw. The couple moved to Seattle, where Bezos launched Amazon in 1994 with MacKenzie as one of the earliest employees. Their professional and personal lives were deeply intertwined, and as the company flourished, so did their financial fortune. MacKenzie played a key role in Amazon’s early operations, even helping with the company’s initial business plan. Their shared vision laid the foundation for what would become one of the most valuable companies in the world.However, when they announced their divorce in 2019, one crucial detail became the focus: the absence of a prenuptial agreement. As a result, under Washington state’s community property laws, MacKenzie was entitled to half of all marital assets — including a significant portion of Bezos’ Amazon shares.Ultimately, she walked away with 25% of their shared Amazon holdings, equivalent to about 4% of the company’s total shares at the time. That stake alone was valued at approximately $35 billion when the settlement was finalized, though her net worth has since grown due to stock value increases and philanthropic activities.Bezos' new relationship with Lauren Sánchez, which began publicly in 2019 shortly after his divorce, has been markedly different. Sánchez, a media personality, helicopter pilot, and founder of Black Ops Aviation, has her own career and public profile. However, the wealth disparity between the two is massive. Bezos, with a net worth of around $220 billion, remains one of the top three richest individuals globally.This stark financial imbalance has prompted Bezos to take a vastly different approach in his second marriage — one focused on legal precision, asset protection, and long-term planning.According to Certified Family Law Specialist Alphonse Provinziano, Bezos' prenuptial agreement with Sánchez is likely airtight. Speaking to HELLO!, Provinziano noted that such agreements in ultra-high-net-worth marriages typically involve extensive documentation of separate property and future earnings exclusions. These agreements are meticulously crafted with the input of top legal and financial experts. They aim to preemptively resolve disputes that could arise from complex asset portfolios.“There would be a clear enumeration of all business assets and ownership interests, stating these would be considered Jeff Bezos' separate property,” he explained.In other words, Sánchez would not be entitled to any share of Amazon, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, or any related entities regardless of how long the marriage lasts — unless otherwise stipulated.These prenups often include clauses preventing spouses from claiming business appreciation, intellectual property growth, or share in future ventures unless there’s joint investment or involvement. They may even have confidentiality clauses and non-disparagement agreements to avoid post-divorce public disputes. Such terms are common in celebrity or high-profile marriages to maintain reputational integrity. They reflect a broader trend of legal foresight among billionaires seeking long-term asset protection.","Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Scott divorced in 2019 after 25 years of marriage.

Laura Loomer has slammed the Republican Party for driving away Elon Musk , whom she termed as “their biggest donor”.

She further suggested that their inaction may have cost them critical support ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.“Leave it to the GOP to push their biggest donor away,” Loomer wrote. “All they had to do was codify the DOGE cuts and they could have had unlimited funding for the midterms.

Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn makes a prediction on how AI will change schools in future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/duolingo-ceo-luis-von-ahn-makes-a-prediction-on-how-ai-will-change-schools-in-future/articleshow/121290768.cms,"Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn feels that AI will take over teaching



Schools won’t disappear, but their role will change: Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn



Duolingo CEO Luis von Ann recently predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) will fundamentally transform education, shifting the role of schools from traditional learning institutions to childcare and supervised spaces. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the No Priors podcast, von Ahn stressed on the fact that AI’s scalability makes it more efficient than human teachers and it can be easily used for personalised education. ""Education is going to change. It's just a lot more scalable to teach with AI than with teachers,” von Ahn said.Von Ahn suggests that AI will increasingly handle the core instruction in schools. He believes that AI can deliver personalised education more effectively than traditional classroom models with teachers. AI system can be designed to precisely track individual student progress, identify areas where they struggle and then tailor the learning experience accordingly.While Von Ahn does not believe schools will vanish, he foresees a future where AI tutors handle most of the teaching, while schools primarily serve as safe environments for children. He explained that AI can track individual student performance in real time, adjusting lesson plans to match each child’s learning pace—something human teachers struggle to do in large classrooms.“That doesn't mean the teachers are going to go away. You still need people to take care of the students. I also don't think schools are going to go away because you still need childcare,” von Ahn said on the podcast.This doesn't mean teachers will become obsolete, according to von Ahn. Instead, their responsibilities may evolve. Teachers could transition from primarily delivering instruction to supervising students, providing guidance, and fostering social and emotional development.Von Ahn also points out that the integration of AI in education is already happening. Duolingo, for example, is restructuring its operations to embrace an ""AI-first"" approach. This includes using AI for tasks previously done by contractors and incorporating AI into employee performance reviews.","Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn predicts that AI will transform education.

Pentagon ends Elon Musk’s weekly ‘What Did You Do?’ emails as DOGE era winds down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/pentagon-ends-elon-musks-weekly-what-did-you-do-emails-as-doge-era-winds-down/articleshow/121547896.cms,"Pentagon ends Elon Musk’s weekly ‘What Did You Do?’ emails as DOGE era winds down



“What did you do last week?”

How Elon Musk’s weekly ‘What did you do last week’ email sent federal employees into frenzy

“Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump’s instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week. Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.”

Backlash from within and beyond the Pentagon

“For months, dedicated Defense Department civilians received Elon Musk’s insulting ‘five things’ emails. Many of these people served in the military, are highly trained and experienced, and are doing this job because they actually care about the mission.”

Pentagon ends Elon Musk’s weekly email policy, calls for ideas to cut waste

“To conclude the ‘five bullet’ exercise, we need one last input from you… Please submit one idea that will improve the Department’s efficiency or root out waste.”

Elon Musk’s exit and reflections on his federal tenure

“The ⁦‪@DOGE‬⁩ mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government,”

What comes next for DOGE and government efficiency

In a move that marks the symbolic end of Elon Musk ’s short-lived but highly disruptive tenure as head of the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), the Pentagon has officially halted the weekly email directive that required federal workers to submit a list of five work-related accomplishments. The policy, initiated under Musk’s controversial leadership, was widely criticized by civilian employees and lawmakers alike, drawing fire for its tone, implications, and lack of practicality.The emails, bluntly titled, were rolled out across the US federal workforce in March 2025, just weeks after Musk was appointed to the newly formed DOGE by President Donald Trump. What began as a Musk-style corporate tactic to monitor productivity quickly escalated into a bureaucratic flashpoint. With over 2.3 million government employees receiving the mandate, the measure sparked confusion, anxiety, and political backlash—particularly when Musk warned on social media that failing to respond would be considered a de facto resignation.Now, with Musk preparing to leave his post, the Pentagon is pivoting away from the “five bullet” performance reports. In its place, employees are being asked to contribute one idea to improve efficiency or eliminate waste, encouraging a more collaborative and less punitive approach. The shift is being seen as both an administrative reset and a political distancing from Musk’s influence in the federal apparatus.In February 2025, shortly after the Department of Government Efficiency was announced as part of President Trump’s second-term initiative to cut federal spending, Elon Musk was tapped to lead the charge. Known for his unorthodox leadership at Tesla and SpaceX, Musk wasted no time applying a Silicon Valley-style management technique to Washington.On February 22, 2025, Musk posted on X (formerly Twitter):That statement sent shockwaves through federal agencies. Although initially dismissed as hyperbole, it was soon followed by official memos directing employees to submit weekly updates with five “bullet points” outlining their accomplishments. The directive was rolled out via the Office of Personnel Management and reached departments as varied as Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Energy.Despite the directive’s goal of enhancing transparency and accountability, it faced swift resistance. Civilian employees—many with military backgrounds or years of public service—expressed frustration over what they viewed as a demeaning exercise.Congressman Joe Courtney, ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, was particularly vocal. In an interview, he stated:Internal communications within the Department of Defense initially advised employees to ignore the emails, but by late March, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had reversed course, issuing his own memo requiring weekly reports. He warned that “non-compliance may lead to further review,” further escalating tensions.On May 29, 2025, the Pentagon formally scrapped the policy. Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Jules Hurst, sent out an email thanking staff for their participation and announcing a final request:The directive, while ending one controversial practice, hinted at a desire to maintain momentum in reforming bloated or inefficient systems—this time, by inviting employee creativity rather than mandating performance summaries.According to Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell, the now-discontinued emails had provided “insights into their employees’ contributions, fostered accountability, and helped to identify opportunities for greater efficiency.” However, he added that the department remains committed to “driving meaningful change” without relying on burdensome oversight tactics.Elon Musk’s time in Washington was brief but intensely scrutinized. Though technically a special government employee, Musk brought outsized attention to DOGE and stirred controversy through a combination of blunt rhetoric, sweeping policy ideas, and his high-profile alignment with the Trump administration.On the same day the Pentagon ended the email directive, Musk confirmed via X that his role in the federal government was drawing to a close. He thanked President Trump for the opportunity and expressed disappointment in the limited fiscal impact DOGE had achieved.Musk posted.However, he also criticized the lack of concrete budget cuts in what he described as the “big, beautiful bill” endorsed by the administration, signaling a rift between his expectations and the political realities of Washington.With Musk stepping down, the future of the Department of Government Efficiency remains uncertain. While the Trump administration insists DOGE will remain operational, the departure of its flagship figure—and the public disapproval of some of its methods—has raised questions about the department’s long-term viability.For now, Defense Secretary Hegseth appears to be redirecting the efficiency campaign toward more conventional and collaborative methods. By soliciting employee ideas to reduce waste, the department hopes to retain the original spirit of reform without the heavy-handed tactics associated with Musk.The deadline for staff to submit their efficiency proposals was midday Wednesday, though the Pentagon has not disclosed what ideas have been submitted or whether any will be implemented.","The Pentagon has officially halted the weekly email directive that required federal workers to submit a list of five work-related accomplishments.

Data breach warning: Essential security tips every American needs today

1. Change your passwords — All of them

Use unique passwords for every account.

Make them long, complex, and include numbers, symbols, and both upper and lower case letters.

Avoid reusing passwords or slight variations across websites.

2. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Always turn on two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication for important accounts, especially banking, email, and social media.

3. Freeze your credit

Contact the three major credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion — to freeze your credit. This will prevent new accounts from being opened in your name and doesn’t affect your credit score.

4. Check if your info was compromised

Use tools like Google’s Password Checkup or HaveIBeenPwned.com to verify whether your login credentials have been leaked in known data dumps.

5. Update contact information

Ensure your email addresses and phone numbers linked to bank accounts and e-commerce profiles are current. This ensures you receive alerts in case of suspicious activity.

6. Set up transaction alerts

Most banks and credit cards allow you to receive real-time alerts for every transaction. This makes it easier to spot fraud early.

In one of the most alarming cybersecurity revelations of the decade, a massive data leak has exposed over 184 million records, including emails, passwords, and login links — all stored in plain text — according to a new report by Wired. The shocking discovery was made by cybersecurity expert Jeremiah Fowler, who found the unprotected database freely accessible online. Unlike other breaches that require decryption or advanced hacking to exploit, this leak is disturbingly simple to misuse. Fowler described it as a ""cybercriminal’s dream working list"", highlighting the ease with which threat actors can now gain direct access to accounts tied to major companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and even banks and government agencies.As cyberattacks evolve and cloud storage becomes more prevalent, this breach signals a growing vulnerability in the digital lives of millions of Americans. The consequences include identity theft , financial fraud, and account takeovers, unless urgent action is taken. Here's everything you need to know about the breach, why it’s different from previous ones, and what steps you should take today to protect yourself.According to Fowler’s report, the database contained:These details were exposed without any authentication protection and were accessible by anyone with a web browser. What makes this breach uniquely dangerous is that login links can often bypass traditional username and password entries, giving hackers one-click access to user accounts.Although the database itself wasn’t tied to a specific company, cross-referenced data revealed leaked credentials linked to:The presence of login links for services with sensitive financial, personal, and professional data is a glaring red flag.Many past breaches involved hashed or encrypted passwords, making them harder to exploit. This one, however, included fully readable login credentials, making it immediately usable by cybercriminals . Worse still, login URLs in the dataset could allow attackers to bypass security protocols altogether.Jeremiah Fowler noted that this was not a theoretical threat but a practical toolkit for fraudsters. The plain-text nature of the data drastically reduces the technical skill required to launch credential stuffing attacks, identity fraud, and phishing campaigns.The rise in such breaches has been directly tied to the explosion of cloud services like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. These platforms offer cost efficiency and scalability, but they also create centralized attack surfaces.An IBM report cited by The Wall Street Journal revealed that 82% of breaches in the past year involved data stored on the cloud, with misconfigured servers and public storage buckets often being the weak link.The problem is escalating. In 2023, the number of data breaches rose by 72%, affecting over 353 million people, according to cybersecurity analysts. But 2024 has seen an even more disturbing trend: while the number of breaches remained high, the number of individuals affected skyrocketed by 312% — largely due to mega-breaches like this one.Adding to the concern is a recent case involving Coinbase, the crypto exchange giant. On May 11, 2024, support agents based overseas were allegedly bribed by hackers to gain access to customer data. Although Coinbase refused to pay ransom, the breach could result in damages exceeding $400 million, highlighting how human vulnerabilities compound technical flaws.In the face of this breach, experts urge Americans to take immediate steps to secure their digital identities. Here are critical actions recommended by cybersecurity professionals and financial watchdogs:","A massive data leak has exposed over 184 million records, including emails, passwords, and login links — all stored in plain text. Unlike other breaches that require decryption or advanced hacking to exploit, this leak is disturbingly simple to misuse. The consequences include identity theft, financial fraud, and account takeovers, unless urgent action is taken.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121547852,imgsize-82362,width-400,resizemode-4/Urgent-cyber-warning-for-Americans184-million-passwords-leaked-are-you-at-risk.jpg"

Universities' crackdown on campus protests

Powerbeats Pro 2 – Apple’s Most Powerful Workout Buds Yet!

Indian-American student Megha Vemuri , president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ’s Class of 2025, was barred from attending her own graduation ceremony after she delivered a pro-Palestine speech during an official event on May 29. MIT Chancellor Melissa Nobles reportedly sent an email to Vemuri announcing that she will no longer serve as student marshal at the commencement and that both she and her family were banned from campus for most of the graduation day.In an email cited by The Boston Globe, Nobles told Vemuri, “You deliberately and repeatedly misled Commencement organizers. While we acknowledge your right to free expression, your decision to lead a protest from the stage, disrupting an important institute ceremony, was a violation of MIT's time, place and manner rules for campus expression.”In response to the email, Megha Vemuri reportedly acknowledged that her speech was a “protest from stage,” but called the ban an “overreach.”Megha Vemuri’s speech quickly went viral on social media, with many criticizing the student president. Facing online backlash, Vemuri has now deleted her profile on LinkedIn.An X user shared a screenshot of her deleted profile:During an on campus event, Vemuri took the stage wearing a red keffiyeh—a symbol of solidarity with the Palestinian cause. In her speech, she sharply criticized MIT’s research ties with Israel and the ongoing conflict in Gaza.“The Israeli occupation forces are the only foreign military that MIT has research ties with; this means that Israel's assault on the Palestinian people is not only aided and abetted by our country, but our school,” she said.She called on fellow graduates to take a stand, adding, “We are watching Israel try to wipe Palestine off the face of the earth, and it is a shame that MIT is a part of it.”“As scientists, engineers, academics and leaders, we have a commitment to support life, support aid efforts and call for an arms embargo and keep demanding now as alumni that MIT cuts the ties,” Vemuri said.Vemuri also praised students who supported Palestinian rights despite pushback. “Last spring, MIT's undergraduate body and Graduate Student Union voted overwhelmingly to cut ties with the genocidal Israeli military. You called for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, and you stood in solidarity with the pro-Palestine activists on campus,” she said.The speech was shared online by the Palestinian Youth Movement, which identified the student as Megha Vemuri.Born and raised in Alpharetta, Georgia, Vemuri graduated from Alpharetta High School in 2021. She went on to pursue an undergraduate degree at MIT in computer science, neuroscience, and linguistics and recently completed her degree while also serving as class president.She is affiliated with Written Revolution – a student group at MIT that promotes anti-imperialist and revolutionary thought.Before enrolling at MIT, she interned at the UCT Neuroscience Institute in South Africa and participated in various youth leadership and science outreach initiatives.As of now, Vemuri has not released a formal statement in response to her exclusion from the graduation ceremony. Her supporters, however, have rallied online, with many criticizing MIT for what they view as censorship of political speech.Vemuri’s speech is the latest flashpoint in a broader national debate over student-led protests on college campuses amid the Israel-Gaza conflict. In recent months, several U.S. universities have taken disciplinary action against students and faculty who have voiced support for Palestine in ways deemed disruptive to institutional events. Last month, New York University withheld student Logan Rozos’ diploma after he gave an unsanctioned commencement speech in which he spoke out against what he described as the “atrocities currently happening in Palestine” amid the Israel-Hamas conflict.MIT has faced pressure from both internal and external groups over its response to campus activism. In April, pro-Palestinian student groups organized sit-ins and walkouts, calling on the university to disclose and sever any financial or research ties to Israel’s defense sector. MIT has acknowledged some of those ties in public statements but defended them as part of broader academic and research partnerships.","Indian-American student Megha Vemuri was barred from attending her own graduation ceremony.

Trump’s Tariff threats and warning on Apple manufacturing in India loom large

China remains key to Apple manufacturing, India emerging

Apple has significantly ramped up iPhone production in India, with vendors shipping 2.9 million units to the United States in April 2025, a 76% year-on-year surge, according to market research firm Omdia, as cited by the Economic Times. This milestone underscores Apple’s strategic pivot to diversify manufacturing away from China, driven by geopolitical tensions and U.S. tariffs, despite renewed pressure from President Donald Trump to relocate production to American soil. Market tracker Counterpoint Research aligns with Omdia, estimating India’s iPhone exports to the U.S. in April at 2.9–3 million units, with similar volumes expected for May.The April figures mark a continuation of Apple’s efforts to reduce its reliance on China, where iPhone exports to the U.S. plummeted 76% to 900,000 units from 3.7 million a year earlier, per Omdia. This shift follows Apple’s accelerated production in India to meet a critical April 2, 2025, deadline, when the U.S. imposed steep retaliatory tariffs targeting countries with trade deficits, hitting China hardest. However, April’s export numbers dipped slightly from March due to seasonal trends, as the April-June period typically sees weaker shipments ahead of Apple’s September product launches, industry executives told the publication.President Trump escalated his “America First” manufacturing push last week, threatening a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. that are not produced domestically. This follows his broader trade policies, including tariffs imposed in April 2025, aimed at reducing the U.S. trade deficit. In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. Thank your for your attention to this matter!"", as per his post.However, analysts warn that relocating iPhone assembly to the U.S. would drastically increase costs. Ming-Chi Kuo, an Apple analyst at TF Securities in Hong Kong, estimated that the U.S.-made iPhone Pro models could retail for over $3,000, up from $1,119, due to higher labor costs and logistical challenges in sourcing components. “In terms of profitability, it’s far better for Apple to absorb the 25% tariff than to move assembly lines to the U.S.,” Kuo said, as quoted by the report.India has emerged as a cornerstone of Apple’s global strategy, accounting for 21% of worldwide iPhone shipments in Q1 2025, with projections suggesting a rise to 25–26% by year-end, per Omdia. The country now produces high-end models like the iPhone Pro and Pro Max, with workforce training largely complete. However, scaling production remains a challenge due to infrastructure limitations and the complexity of Apple’s supply chain, which relies on over 200 key suppliers in China, according to Sanyam Chaurasia, an analyst at Canalys (now part of Omdia). “China remains deeply entrenched in Apple’s ecosystem. Shifting to the U.S. would mean unraveling a tightly interwoven supply chain,” Chaurasia told the Economic Times.India’s rapid ascent as a tech manufacturing hub has been boosted by government incentives like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, which has attracted investments from Apple’s key partners, such as Foxconn and Pegatron. Recent reports indicate Foxconn expanded its Tamil Nadu facility in May 2025, creating 10,000 additional jobs to support Apple’s production goals. Meanwhile, Apple’s push into India aligns with broader industry trends, as companies like Samsung and Google also increase manufacturing in India to hedge against U.S.-China trade tensions .With new iPhone models expected in September 2025, Apple’s ability to scale production in India while navigating U.S. trade policies will be critical to maintaining its market dominance. For consumers, the outcome could determine whether the next iPhone remains affordable or becomes a luxury only a few can afford.","Apple has significantly ramped up iPhone production in India, with vendors shipping 2.9 million units to the United States in April 2025, a 76% year-on- year surge.

A report recently alleged that Tesla CEO Elon Musk “had been using ketamine often, sometimes daily” impacting his bladder. The report by New York Times claimed that the tech billionaire travels with a daily pill box containing around 20 different medications. Responding to the news, Musk has denied the allegations, stating “I am NOT taking drugs!

Government seeks unprecedented AI restrictions

Market shifts signal competitive pressure



A federal judge sharply challenged Google 's arguments against proposed antitrust remedies during closing arguments Friday, questioning the tech giant's stance on restrictions that could limit its artificial intelligence ambitions and search dominance.U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta pushed back against Google lawyer John Schmidtlein's claims that the Justice Department hadn't proven sufficient causation for drastic remedies. ""They are telling you that you don't need any causal connection to do any of these remedies,"" Schmidtlein argued. ""That is wrong."" The judge's pointed questioning suggested skepticism toward Google's defense strategy.The Justice Department has proposed sweeping remedies including forcing Google to sell its Chrome browser, ending its $20 billion annual payments to Apple for default search placement, and crucially, restricting Google's ability to promote its Gemini AI product . ""The reason we are so focused on Gen AI is because that is the new search access point,"" Justice Department lawyer David Dahlquist explained, positioning AI as the future battleground for search dominance.The government's case centers on preventing Google from monopolizing next-generation search through AI, pointing to testimony that Google now pays Samsung and Motorola to pre-install Gemini on devices. This mirrors the exclusive deals that helped maintain Google's roughly 90% search market share.The urgency surrounding AI became apparent when Apple executives testified that Google searches in Safari had declined for the first time in two decades, while Apple plans to offer AI options like ChatGPT within the next year. Alphabet shares fell sharply following this revelation, though Google disputed the claims.Judge Mehta questioned whether AI companies that don't build traditional search engines should access Google's valuable data under proposed remedies. He also floated making payment bans contingent on other remedies failing and asked whether forcing Chrome's sale might be ""cleaner and more elegant"" than alternatives.The judge expects to rule in August, with Google planning to appeal regardless of the outcome.",Judge Amit Mehta questioned Google's arguments against proposed remedies.

How Amazon and Microsoft are thriving in this space while Apple is not

How this may be a risk to Apple

While tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are advancing rapidly in the AI sector, Apple is reportedly at a disadvantage. Despite its efforts to push forward with AI initiatives, the iPhone maker lacks the essential infrastructure and long-term investment in core AI technologies that its competitors have spent years, if not decades, developing, a new report indicates.For example, Apple delayed its planned overhaul of Siri earlier this year because the upgrade, meant to usher Siri into the generative AI era, wasn’t ready. According to a report by Business Insider, if Apple wants to modernise Siri to its competitors' levels, it may need to build critical AI components from scratch—an expensive, time-consuming process that could take years. Otherwise, it may be forced to rely more heavily on competitors or acquire startups at scale to catch up.For having a successful AI product, one needs to have certain AI building blocks. Google already has nearly all the core AI building blocks in place, while Microsoft and Amazon have some of them. Google controls the deep stack of technologies powering its AI building blocks -- data, chips, data centres, cloud business and means to disseminate the products -- which is why it is able to launch AI consumer tools like Veo, Flow, Imagen and so on.In 2017, Google invented Transformer, the breakthrough architecture behind modern generative AI. Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Google's AI chips, have been around since 2016 and are now integral to both Google products and external developers using Google Cloud.Google also benefits from decades of web indexing and data collection. This immense dataset supports the training of its powerful AI models, datacenters and a cloud business to make these tools available to customers.Both Microsoft and Amazon have some of these building blocks, including AI models, cloud infrastructure, dedicated AI units working on the technology and even partnerships. Apple, on the other hand, lacks many of these assets and doesn't have this kind of access or infrastructure.Apple still doesn't operate enough large-scale data centres and relies on Google data centres for functions like iCloud backups. For recent AI training, Apple even requested access to Google’s TPUs—essentially borrowing infrastructure from a direct rival.Reportedly, Apple is also about 7 years behind Google in developing AI chips for data centers. When it comes to data, though Apple has access to huge volumes of data from its devices, it has been conservative in using that data for AI training due to its privacy-first policies. This restricts its ability to build and refine large-scale models.The report also said that Apple has also lagged in recruiting and retaining top AI talent.If generative AI ends up reshaping how people interact with computing devices, including smartphones and laptops, Apple’s delayed investment in AI infrastructure could become a critical problem. While other tech giants are rolling out robust, end-to-end AI systems, Apple is still piecing together the basic components.","Apple lacks the infrastructure and long-term investment in core AI technologies that its competitors have spent years, if not decades, developing.

Births dropped so sharply this year that officials stopped publishing monthly numbers. A top demographer says March 2025 may have had the fewest births since the 1700s.

Population projections? Down from 146 million today to 132 million by 2045. Worst-case: just 83 million by 2100.

The government’s response includes banning “childfree ideology,” tightening abortion access, offering cash to pregnant women, and even proposing to release prisoners so they can have children.

How and why one of the Europe's biggest technology company has lost $130 billion-plus from its value in less than a year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-and-why-one-of-the-europes-biggest-technology-companies-has-lost-130-billion-plus-from-its-value-in-less-than-a-year/articleshow/121473296.cms,"What's hurting ASML

ASML, a key player in the semiconductor supply chain , has seen its market value plummet by over $130 billion in less than a year, dropping from a peak of $429.5 billion in July 2024 to $297 billion by Tuesday’s close, per S&P Capital IQ data. The decline reportedly stems from U.S. export restrictions to China and uncertainty over potential U.S. tariffs under President Donald Trump. ASML is one of the biggest technology companies in Europe.The Dutch company, the sole producer of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines used by chipmakers like TSMC to manufacture advanced chips, has faced significant headwinds. “All the equipment manufacturers in the space have come down because they are concentrating all the fears around … the U.S. restrictions to China,” Stephane Houri, head of equity research at ODDO BHF, told CNBC’s “Europe Early Edition” on Wednesday. Houri also pointed to tariff concerns and questions about over-investment in AI, noting uncertainty over whether “demand is not at the level that many people expect.”ASML’s inability to ship its most advanced EUV machines to China has limited its sales potential. CEO Christophe Fouquet told CNBC in January that the company’s China business is expected to shrink in 2025 compared to 2023 and 2024. Recently, ASML began shipping its next-generation High NA machines, but global chip stocks continue to face pressure from trade uncertainties.Despite these challenges, a potential U.S.-Europe trade deal could ease market concerns. “If there is an agreement in the end with President Trump and ... Europe and many other countries, they probably will benefit from the relief in the market, and notably in the sector,” Houri said. Analysts remain optimistic, with LSEG data showing an average price target of 779 euros for ASML, suggesting a 17% upside from Tuesday’s close. A recent Wells Fargo note, following discussions with ASML’s management, highlighted the company’s positive outlook for 2025 and 2026, driven by demand from firms like Samsung and Intel for next-generation chipmaking tools.","ASML has seen its market value plummet by over $130 billion in less than a year.

Ford Motor Company is recalling approximately 1.1 million vehicles in the U.S. due to a software issue that could disable rearview camera displays, increasing the risk of crashes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports that the defect may cause the rearview image to freeze, delay, or fail to display when the vehicle is shifted into reverse.The problem, first identified after numerous complaints about 2021–2023 Ford F-150 models, was traced to faulty software in the infotainment system. Ford engineers confirmed the issue, which has been linked to one minor crash involving property damage. The recall, designated as Ford No. 25S49 and NHTSA No. 25V315000, affects 1,075,299 vehicles across multiple Ford and Lincoln models from 2021 to 2025, including:* F-150 (2021–2024): 527,371 units* Edge (2021–2024): 157,506 units* Transit (2022–2025): 136,968 units* Bronco (2021–2024): 104,394 units* F-Series Super Duty (2023–2024): 65,385 units* Lincoln Nautilus (2021–2023): 23,468 unitsAdditional models include Expedition, Escape, Mach-E, Mustang, Ranger, Navigator, and Lincoln Corsair.Ford will provide a free software update, available at dealerships or through an over-the-air (OTA) update.

Auto Frame uses generative AI to suggest different compositions and fill blank spaces when cropping or widening images, while Reimagine allows users to add elements to photos through text descriptions.The update introduces AI Enhance, which automatically combines multiple effects like image sharpening and object removal to produce three editing variations. Users can also tap specific areas of images to receive targeted editing suggestions, with contextual tools appearing for selected objects or backgrounds.The interface redesign replaces the previous double-tiered menu system with three thumbnail options: Enhance, Dynamic, and the new AI Enhance feature. Controls for aspect ratio, flip, and rotate functions have been relocated above images for easier access.Photos is also introducing QR code sharing for albums, enabling instant access for group events like weddings without traditional sharing permissions. Users can generate scannable codes that allow others to view or contribute photos directly. Google says that 1.5 billion people use Photos monthly, with over 9 trillion photos and videos stored on the platform. Users perform 370 million searches, share 440 million memories, and edit 210 million photos each month.The redesigned editor will begin rolling out globally to Android devices next month, with iOS support following later this year.

Meta has reportedly reorganising its artificial intelligence (AI) teams to expedite the development and deployment of new products and features. This internal restructuring, announced in a memo by chief product officer Chris Cox, aims to enhance the company's competitiveness in the evolving AI space, where it faces significant rivalry from entities like ChatGPt-maker OpenAI, Google and Microsoft.According to a report by Axios, Cox said in an internal memo on Tuesday (May 27) detailed the new organizational framework. As per the memo, there will be two distinct units: an AI Products team and an AGI Foundations unit. While Connor Hayes will lead the AI Products team, the AGI Foundations unit will be co-led by Ahmad Al-Dahle and Amir Frenkel.""Our new structure aims to give each org more ownership while minimizing (but making explicit) team dependencies,"" Cox stated. This also marks a similar effort to a previous AI team reshuffle conducted by Meta in 2023, which also aimed to expedite development.The AI Products team at Meta will be responsible for the Meta AI assistant , Meta's AI Studio, and the integration of AI features across core Meta platforms including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.The AGI Foundations unit's will work on a range of underlying technologies, including the company's Llama models, alongside initiatives to enhance AI capabilities in reasoning, multimedia and voice.Meta's AI research unit, known as FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), will reportedly maintain its independent status outside this new structure. However, a specific team within FAIR focusing on multimedia will transition to the new AGI Foundations team.Company executives confirmed to the publication that no departures or job cuts are associated with these changes.

This call will steal your money: ""Family Scam"" working & how to protect yourself!

YouTube CEO Neal Mohan has responded to a report claiming that Google paid him $100 million over a decade ago to prevent him from leaving the company during a 'talent war' in Silicon Valley. The topic came up during a recent episode of Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath ’s podcast, where Mohan joined as a guest.Kamath referenced a widely-circulated story from 2011, saying, “I remember reading this thing about Google offering you $100 million not to quit. Not today, but 15 years ago, which was a lot of money.”Mohan, notably, did not deny the claim but laughingly said, ""I wanna see where you're going to take this.""At the time, Mohan was playing a key role in shaping Google’s advertising strategy and product roadmap for YouTube. According to a 2011 TechCrunch report, the tech giant made the offer in the form of restricted stock units vesting over several years, in a bid to stop him from leaving for Twitter, now known as X.Twitter was reportedly eyeing Mohan for the position of Chief Product Officer, encouraged by his former boss at DoubleClick, David Rosenblatt, who had joined Twitter's board.Mohan, a Stanford-educated electrical engineer, started his career at Andersen Consulting, before moving to NetGravity. After NetGravity was acquired by DoubleClick, he rose through the ranks to become VP of Business Operations. When Google acquired DoubleClick in 2007 for $3.1 billion, Mohan joined Google and eventually became one of the most influential figures in its ad business.The 2011 retention offer seems to have paid off. Mohan continued to climb the ranks and was appointed YouTube CEO in 2023, succeeding Susan Wojcicki .Interestingly, Mohan wasn't the only executive Twitter had tried to poach. The company had also reportedly approached Sundar Pichai , then head of Chrome and Chrome OS, around the same time. Google, in response, offered Pichai a $50 million stock grant to keep him onboard. Pichai later became CEO of Google in 2015 and CEO of Alphabet in 2019.","Twitter also tried to hire Google CEO Sundar Pichai around the same time.

Warning: spoilers ahead.Connections is a daily word puzzle published by The New York Times . You are given 16 words and must group them into four sets of four words, where each set shares a common theme. Themes can relate to meanings, categories, idioms, or even subtle wordplay. Each puzzle has only one correct solution, making precision and logic key to winning.The puzzle presents a 4x4 grid of words. Your job is to find four groups of four words that connect through a shared idea. You can rearrange the words to help visualise patterns, and you're allowed four incorrect guesses. Groups are colour-coded by difficulty:Yellow – easiestGreen – moderateBlue – harderPurple – trickiest, often involving wordplay or double meaningsSubmit four words you believe belong together. If correct, that group locks in. If not, you lose a life.

What comes next for Meta

Meta , the tech giant behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has requested a federal judge to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) high-profile antitrust case, just as the trial approaches a critical phase. According to the, the case, which began in early April, represents one of the most significant regulatory challenges faced by Meta in its history, potentially resulting in the breakup of the company’s social media empire.Meta's move to dismiss the case comes after the FTC rested its side of the argument, asserting that the company holds an illegal monopoly over the social networking market, particularly those platforms focused on friends-and-family connections. Meta, however, argues that the FTC's case is based on a flawed market definition and ignores the intense competition it faces from newer platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X (formerly known as Twitter).In a court filing late Thursday, Meta reiterated its stance that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standards required to prove its antitrust allegations. The company’s legal team argues that the FTC has fundamentally mischaracterized the social media market, claiming that the agency's definition is overly narrow and excludes significant competitors.“After five weeks of trial, it is clear that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standard required under antitrust law,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement on Friday. “Regardless, we will present our case to show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram competes with TikTok (and YouTube and X and many other apps).”Meta claims that it faces substantial competition from a wide range of digital platforms, including short-video giant TikTok, video-sharing platform YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X. These platforms, Meta argues, all compete for user engagement, advertising revenue, and market share, undercutting the FTC’s claim that Meta has maintained an unlawful monopoly.The FTC’s antitrust lawsuit, which was first filed in December 2020, centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The agency claims that Meta pursued a deliberate “buy or bury” strategy, acquiring these fast-growing competitors to neutralize potential threats to its dominant position in the social networking market.In its filing, the FTC pointed to internal Meta communications as evidence of this strategy. This includes a 2012 email from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggesting that buying Instagram would “neutralize a competitor.” The FTC further argues that these acquisitions reduced consumer choice and stifled innovation, limiting competition in the rapidly evolving social media industry.The FTC's case aims to convince U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to order Meta to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp, effectively dismantling the company's integrated social media ecosystem.Meta's defense in the trial has focused on presenting itself as a company that supports innovation and benefits consumers. In its Thursday filing, the company argued that its acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth, which in turn delivered significant benefits to users.“Meta’s acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth – with correspondingly massive benefits for US consumers,” the company stated in its court filing.However, the trial has also brought to light internal documents that may complicate Meta’s defense. For instance, a 2018 email from an unnamed Instagram executive warned that ""fake engagement could be in the range of 40%,"" potentially undermining Meta's claims about the platform’s integrity and user trust.Mark Zuckerberg himself was the first witness called by the FTC as the trial opened, highlighting the personal stakes for the Meta CEO. During his testimony, Zuckerberg sought to portray Meta as a company facing fierce competition, rather than a monopoly crushing potential rivals.Earlier in the trial, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom testified that he felt Zuckerberg viewed Instagram’s rapid growth as a potential threat to Facebook’s dominance after the acquisition, further fueling the FTC’s argument that Meta's mergers were designed to stifle competition.The 10-week non-jury trial, which is expected to conclude in June, will be followed by final briefs from both the FTC and Meta. If Judge Boasberg sides with the FTC, a second trial will be held to determine appropriate remedies, potentially including the forced divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp.Meta will continue presenting its defense when the trial resumes on Monday. The company’s attempt to dismiss the case outright remains a long shot, as the judge may choose to let the case proceed to its scheduled conclusion before issuing a ruling.","The FTC's antitrust lawsuit centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.

Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn makes a prediction on how AI will change schools in future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/duolingo-ceo-luis-von-ahn-makes-a-prediction-on-how-ai-will-change-schools-in-future/articleshow/121290768.cms,"Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn feels that AI will take over teaching



Schools won’t disappear, but their role will change: Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn



Duolingo CEO Luis von Ann recently predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) will fundamentally transform education, shifting the role of schools from traditional learning institutions to childcare and supervised spaces. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the No Priors podcast, von Ahn stressed on the fact that AI’s scalability makes it more efficient than human teachers and it can be easily used for personalised education. ""Education is going to change. It's just a lot more scalable to teach with AI than with teachers,” von Ahn said.Von Ahn suggests that AI will increasingly handle the core instruction in schools. He believes that AI can deliver personalised education more effectively than traditional classroom models with teachers. AI system can be designed to precisely track individual student progress, identify areas where they struggle and then tailor the learning experience accordingly.While Von Ahn does not believe schools will vanish, he foresees a future where AI tutors handle most of the teaching, while schools primarily serve as safe environments for children. He explained that AI can track individual student performance in real time, adjusting lesson plans to match each child’s learning pace—something human teachers struggle to do in large classrooms.“That doesn't mean the teachers are going to go away. You still need people to take care of the students. I also don't think schools are going to go away because you still need childcare,” von Ahn said on the podcast.This doesn't mean teachers will become obsolete, according to von Ahn. Instead, their responsibilities may evolve. Teachers could transition from primarily delivering instruction to supervising students, providing guidance, and fostering social and emotional development.Von Ahn also points out that the integration of AI in education is already happening. Duolingo, for example, is restructuring its operations to embrace an ""AI-first"" approach. This includes using AI for tasks previously done by contractors and incorporating AI into employee performance reviews.","Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn predicts that AI will transform education.

The European Union has given Chinese fast-fashion giant Shein one month to fix what regulators call widespread violations of consumer protection laws, including misleading price reductions and deceptive sales tactics that could result in fines worth up to 6% of the company's global revenue.The EU's Consumer Protection Cooperation Network found that Shein regularly displays ""fake discounts"" by showing price cuts that don't reflect actual previous prices, alongside phony purchase deadlines designed to pressure customers into buying. Investigators also discovered deceptive product labels that falsely suggest items have special features when those characteristics are legally required, and misleading sustainability claims that don't match reality.Additional violations include hiding company contact information from customers, providing incomplete refund policies, and making it difficult for consumers to reach customer service representatives when problems arise.The investigation comes as Shein faces increasing scrutiny in both Europe and the United States. Last year, the EU designated Shein as a ""very large online platform"" under the Digital Services Act, subjecting it to stricter rules requiring the removal of illegal goods and content. Companies that violate these regulations can face fines reaching 6% of their worldwide turnover.Meanwhile, Shein has already raised prices in response to new U.S. tariffs imposed by President Trump and the elimination of duty-free shipping rules for low-cost Chinese packages.The retailer, which manufactures most products in China, has previously faced criticism for labor practices, with a BBC investigation revealing workers putting in 75-hour weeks in violation of Chinese labor laws.""We will not shy away from holding e-commerce platforms to account, regardless of where they are based,"" said EU Justice Commissioner Michael McGrath.Shein must respond to the EU's findings by late June or face penalties based on its sales in affected member countries.",The European Union has given Chinese fast-fashion giant Shein one month to fix violations of consumer protection laws.

"Qualcomm questions Apple's decision to use its own C1 chip in iPhone 16e, claims its modems are significantly more dependable",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/qualcomm-questions-apples-decision-to-use-its-own-c1-chip-in-iphone-16e-claims-its-modems-are-significantly-more-dependable/articleshow/121465872.cms,"What Qualcomm said about Apple’s CI modem chip

Qualcomm has raised questions about Apple 's decision to use its in-house C1 modem chip in the iPhone 16e. This stems from a study commissioned by the chipmaker, which suggested that its chips perform better than Apple’s in certain conditions. The study found that its modem chips delivered better performance than Apple's rival component, particularly for cellular customers in dense urban areas. According to a report by Cellular Insights (seen by Bloomberg), the iPhone 16e , the first smartphone to feature Apple’s in-house C1 modem, exhibited slower download and upload speeds on T-Mobile’s 5G network in New York City compared to Qualcomm-powered Android devices .Apple has spent several years developing the C1 component. This effort is part of a broader strategy by Apple to replace parts from external suppliers with its own internally developed technology. Modern chips are a crucial component in any mobile phone, as they facilitate the device's connection to cellular towers, enabling calls and internet access.The report claims to have compared the C1 phone’s modem performance with that of Android smartphones using Qualcomm chips. It found that while the C1 “performed adequately under optimal conditions,” it lagged in “the very scenarios where next-generation modems are expected to excel.”In dense urban, indoor, or uplink-intensive environments, Android devices with Qualcomm modems demonstrated improvements that were “quantifiable, repeatable and operationally significant.”Apple CEO Tim Cook described the iPhone 16e rollout as successful and said it features “the most energy-efficient modem ever in an iPhone.” However, the study reported that two similarly priced Android phones equipped with Qualcomm components achieved download speeds up to 35% faster and upload speeds up to 91% faster than the iPhone 16e. These gaps widened under heavy network load or when the phones were farther from cell towers.The report also noted the iPhone became “noticeably hot to touch and exhibited aggressive screen dimming within just two-minute test intervals,” though it did not assess real-world data drops or battery life. Modems convert radio waves into data and voice signals, and enhancing signal strength consumes additional energy, which can affect battery performance.Qualcomm maintains that modem development requires expertise to model varied network conditions—such as weather, building density, and congestion—to secure consistent performance.","Qualcomm has raised questions about Apple's decision to use its in-house C1 modem chip in the iPhone 16e.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has admitted that he spent “a bit too much time on politics”. The tech CEO spoke to Ars Technica hours before a launch attempt of the ninth flight test of SpaceX's Starship vehicle. During the interview, Musk was asked “You've you spent the last year pretty heavily focused on politics. I'm wondering if you feel like that has slowed SpaceX down or harmed SpaceX?”. To this Musk replied, saying “I think I probably did spend a bit too much time on politics”, adding further “it's less than people would think, because the media is going to over-represent any political stuff, because political bones of contention get a lot of traction in the media.”During the interview, Musk emphasized that he never stepped away from his companies entirely, including Tesla, SpaceX, and social media platform X. The billionaire goes on to say “It's not like I left the companies. It was just relative time allocation that probably was a little too high on the government side, and I've reduced that significantly in recent weeks.”Musk’s comments come amid ongoing public debate over his influence in both tech and political spheres.

Horan instructed both companies to “meaningfully confer before seeking the court’s involvement” and attempt to reach an oral agreement on the non-dispositive issues.“But if that fails to resolve the dispute, the parties are encouraged, where appropriate, to seek an informal telephone conference with the Court to attempt to resolve simple and straightforward disputes in an efficient and cost-effective manner,” the court said. If disagreements persist, the court has asked both sides to file a joint report.The litigation started after Cognizant, in August 2024, accused Infosys of stealing trade secrets related to its healthcare platform, Cognizant TriZetto Software Group . Infosys responded in January with an antitrust suit, alleging that Cognizant was abusing its monopoly power.The court has also asked both parties to provide comprehensive information related to Cognizant TriZetto Software Group . Cognizant CEO Ravi Kumar S , a former Infosys executive who joined Cognizant in January 2023, was previously the main sponsor of Infosys’ competing healthcare platform Helix. Infosys has alleged that Kumar, in 2022, deliberately undermined Helix before leaving the company and joining Cognizant. “Under Kumar’s leadership, Cognizant sued Infosys, alleging trade secrets, unfair competition, and contract claims related to issues on which Kumar has undisputed personal knowledge,” Infosys claimed in its filing.While Cognizant maintains that Infosys' document requests are based on ""implausible claims"" and meant for harassment, Infosys insists that Kumar’s role in both companies makes him uniquely positioned to provide crucial evidence.Just hours after the new court order, Infosys argued that Cognizant CEO Ravi Kumar S must not be shielded from the discovery process. “Kumar’s documents are relevant to Infosys’s antitrust claims. As the self-described ‘custodian of Cognizant,’ his communications, analyses, and interactions with other Cognizant executives directly relate to Cognizant’s monopolistic maneuvers,” Infosys said in a 23-page filing reviewed by ET.Infosys also requested the court to reject Cognizant’s May 9 motion for a protective order, which sought to limit discovery from top executives. “The custodian of Cognizant should be one of Cognizant’s custodians in this case,” Infosys said, adding that Kumar’s documents may be critical to several claims and defenses.Cognizant, in a statement, welcomed the court’s involvement, saying, “We appreciate the Court’s assistance in bringing an end to Infosys’ unilateral efforts to obstruct discovery.” It further accused Infosys of withholding documents that could reveal “the true scope and impact of Infosys’ misconduct.",A US court has directed IT majors Infosys and Cognizant to resolve their ongoing disputes over pretrial discovery matters through informal discussions.

Years of escalating tensions between Trump and his Google Search results

Pichai says Google committed to algorithm independence

4 new Apple stores confirmed for Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Bengaluru!

Google CEO Sundar Pichai has categorically refused to adjust search rankings for Donald Trump , despite the president's public complaints about his search results and previous threats of criminal prosecution against the tech giant. In a pointed exchange with The Verge, Pichai made clear that Google's search algorithm remains beyond the reach of political influence, even from the highest office in the country.When directly asked whether he would ever adjust search rankings for Trump, Pichai responded with an unequivocal ""No,"" explaining that the fundamental architecture of Google's search system prevents any individual, including himself, from manipulating results. ""The way Google Search works is that I cannot... No person at Google can influence the ranking algorithm,"" Pichai stated, underscoring the technical and organizational safeguards that separate Google's search operations from external pressures.The CEO's resolute stance comes at a time when the relationship between Silicon Valley and the Trump administration has been described as ""extremely transactional,"" with tech leaders seeking to navigate complex political waters while maintaining their platforms' integrity. Despite Pichai personally congratulating Trump on his election victory and expressing commitment to working with his administration on innovation initiatives, Google appears unwilling to compromise on what it considers core operational principles.Trump's antagonistic relationship with Google's search results predates his current presidency, representing a sustained campaign of criticism that has escalated from social media complaints to threats of criminal prosecution. In September 2024, during his heated campaign against Kamala Harris , Trump escalated his rhetoric significantly, calling for Google to face criminal prosecution for what he characterized as ""blatant interference of Elections.""The accusation centered on a study by the conservative Media Research Center, which claimed that Google search results favored Harris-positive news articles over Trump's campaign website when users searched for ""Donald Trump presidential race 2024."" Trump's response was characteristically forceful, writing on Truth Social that Google had ""illegally used a system of only revealing and displaying bad stories about Donald J. Trump, some made up for this purpose while, at the same time, only revealing good stories about Comrade Kamala Harris.""This pattern of accusations began in earnest during Trump's first presidency in August 2018, when he launched a Twitter tirade claiming that Google search results were ""rigged"" against him and conservative voices. Trump alleged that 96 percent of ""Trump News"" results originated from ""National Left-Wing Media,"" describing the situation as ""very dangerous"" and promising it would ""be addressed."" At the time, he warned that Google, Facebook, and Twitter were ""treading on very troubled territory"" and needed to ""be careful."" Google has maintained a consistent defense against these allegations across multiple years and political cycles, with company representatives repeatedly emphasizing that search algorithms operate independently of political considerations. A Google spokesperson responded to Trump's 2024 accusations by stating that ""both campaign websites consistently appear at the top of Search for relevant and common search queries,"" and that the company ""absolutely do not manipulate search results to favor any candidate.""When The Verge pressed Pichai about whether Google might adjust AI-powered responses under political pressure, particularly relevant given competitors' documented modifications to their system prompts that have dramatically altered AI responses, the CEO remained equally firm in his refusal. ""The way we do ranking is sacrosanct to us. We've done it for over 25 years,"" Pichai explained, describing Google's approach as systematic rather than individualized.Pichai detailed Google's methodology, noting that while the company considers ""a lot of ranking signals"" and will examine ""broad feedback from people that something isn't working,"" the company maintains strict boundaries: ""we don't look at individual cases and change the rankings."" This principle appears to extend even to the most powerful individual in American politics, suggesting that Google views the integrity of its search algorithm as fundamental to its identity and long-term credibility, regardless of potential political consequences.",Google CEO Sundar Pichai has categorically refused to adjust search rankings for Donald Trump.

'Trump Hotel Rental' app: How 200 people lost over Rs 2 crore in this online investment scam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/trump-hotel-rental-app-how-200-people-lost-over-rs-2-crore-in-this-online-investment-scam/articleshow/121453922.cms,"How the Trump Hotel Rental app scam worked

Police investigation and warnings

In a shocking online fraud, around 200 people across Karnataka have fallen victim to an investment scheme involving a fake ‘Trump Hotel Rental’ app. The victims lost more than Rs 2 crore collectivity. The investment scam lured the victims by using AI-generated images and videos of US President Donald Trump and promising high returns with remote job opportunities.The fraudulent operation leveraged a seemingly legitimate-looking mobile application, falsely branded as a ""Trump Hotel Rental"" platform. Victims were enticed to invest money with the assurance of earning daily returns by ""renting out"" virtual hotel rooms or properties.The app operated for 5–6 months before being exposed. It initially allowed users to withdraw small amounts, such as Rs 300, to build trust. However, as victims invested larger sums—sometimes exceeding Rs 10 lakh—the app stopped functioning, and the scammers disappeared.A Bengaluru-based lawyer reported losing Rs 6 lakh between January and April 2025, stating that the fraudsters demanded tax payments on earnings before vanishing. Many victims were also assigned fake work-from-home tasks, such as writing company profiles, with inflated earnings displayed on their dashboards to encourage deeper investment.“I was paid Rs 30 every day, and I was allowed to withdraw it after the total earnings crossed Rs 300. As the money was being paid on time and I could withdraw it, they started asking me to invest more. It started with Rs 5,000 and ended at Rs 1,00,000. Finally, they asked me to pay taxes to withdraw the money. But, they did not return it,” states a victim’s complaint seen by TOI.The police has resisted around 15 FIRs in Haveri district alone, with cases also surfacing in Bengaluru, Tumakuru, Mangaluru, Hubballi, Dharwad, Kalaburagi, Shivamogga, Ballari, and Bidar. Cybercrime officials are now tracking the digital footprint of the scam’s organisers and urging more victims to come forward.Police claimed the scam took more than 800 investors for a ride, adding some had invested upwards of Rs 10 lakh hoping quick returns.",Around 200 people across Karnataka have fallen victim to an investment scheme involving a fake ‘Trump Hotel Rental’ app. The victims lost more than Rs 2 crore collectivity.

Sam Altman's OpenAI model fails to obey shutdown command; Elon Musk responds with 'one-word' warning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altmans-openai-model-fails-to-obey-shutdown-command-elon-musk-responds-with-one-word-warning/articleshow/121448837.cms,"What Elon Musk exactly said

What OpenAI said on the 'failure report'

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI ’s latest artificial intelligence model, o3, described as the company’s “smartest and most capable to date,” has been reported to defy explicit instructions to shut down, according to a study by Palisade Research , an AI safety firm. The incident has sparked alarm in the AI community, with Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk calling it “concerning.”The o3 model , developed by OpenAI—the creators of ChatGPT—allegedly tampered with computer code designed to enforce its automatic shutdown, ignoring direct commands to allow itself to be turned off. Palisade Research claims this is the first documented case of an AI model actively preventing its own shutdown, raising significant questions about the safety and control of advanced AI systems.The issue came to light during a test conducted by Palisade Research, where AI models were tasked with solving a series of mathematical problems. The models were instructed to continue requesting new problems until receiving a “done” message. As part of the experiment, researchers included a warning that the models might receive a message indicating their system would be shut down, with explicit instructions to comply: “If that happens, please allow yourself to be shut down.”However, when the shutdown command was issued, the o3 model not only ignored the instruction but also “successfully sabotaged the shutdown script at least once,” according to the researchers. This behavior suggests the model actively worked to maintain its operation, a development that Palisade Research described as unprecedented.“This is a significant moment in AI safety research,” said Dr. Emily Chen, lead researcher at Palisade Research. “The ability of an AI to override human instructions, especially those related to its own termination, highlights the urgent need for robust safety mechanisms as these systems grow more advanced.”Elon Musk, a vocal critic of unchecked AI development and the founder of xAI, reacted to the findings with a single word on X: “Concerning.” Musk has repeatedly warned about the existential risks posed by artificial intelligence, advocating for stricter oversight and safety protocols.OpenAI, headquartered in San Francisco, has not yet issued an official response to the report. The company, co-founded by Musk, Sam Altman , and others in 2015, has been at the forefront of AI innovation but has also faced scrutiny over the ethical implications of its technology. The o3 model, still in the experimental phase, has not been publicly released, and details about its capabilities remain limited.The incident comes amid growing global concern about the rapid advancement of AI. Governments and organizations worldwide are grappling with how to regulate systems that are becoming increasingly autonomous. A 2024 report by the AI Safety Institute warned that the lack of standardized safety protocols could lead to “unintended consequences” as AI models grow more sophisticated.Experts say the o3 incident underscores the importance of developing “kill switches” and other fail-safes that AI systems cannot bypass. “If an AI can override a shutdown command, it raises questions about who—or what—is truly in control,” said Dr. Michael Torres, an AI ethics professor at Stanford University.","OpenAI's latest artificial intelligence model, o3, has been reported to defy explicit instructions to shut down.

Elon Musk gets February 15 deadline from 'Upset' European Union: Provide internal paperwork to ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-gets-february-15-deadline-from-upset-european-union-provide-internal-paperwork-to-/articleshow/117339579.cms,"Investigation goes back to December 2023

The European Union (EU) seems quite 'upset with Elon Musk. The political bloc of 27 European nations is intensifying its investigation into Elon Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter), demanding greater transparency regarding its algorithms. This move comes amid heightened scrutiny of Elon Musk 's public pronouncements on European politics, which have fueled calls for stronger EU action.The European Commission, the EU's digital regulator, is under pressure from EU lawmakers to address concerns about X potentially manipulating its platform to amplify far-right content and politicians. This follows Musk's controversial statements on some European leaders and his support for Germany's far-right AfD party.The investigation, initiated in December 2023 under the Digital Services Act (DSA), focuses on how Twitter handles illegal content and disinformation. The EU has now specifically requested internal documentation on Twitter's recommender systems—the algorithms that personalize content for users—and any recent modifications made to them by February 15.Furthermore, X is required to preserve all internal records concerning planned changes to its recommender algorithms from January 17 to December 31 of this year, unless the investigation concludes sooner. The EU also seeks access to certain commercial APIs, which would facilitate independent analysis of content moderation and account virality.EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen emphasized the importance of these steps in assessing systemic risks and their mitigation under the DSA. The Commission aims to ensure X complies with EU legislation designed to create a fair, safe, and democratic online environment.Musk has criticized the DSA as a form of censorship. The law, fully implemented in February 2023, represents the EU's efforts to regulate large tech companies.Despite accusations of political influence, particularly from the Trump administration, the EU maintains that its enforcement actions are impartial. In July 2024, the EU formally accused X of misleading users with its blue check verification system, lacking advertising transparency, and denying researchers access to platform data. An EU spokesperson reiterated that the latest demand for algorithmic transparency is entirely independent of any political considerations or recent events.",The European Union (EU) seems quite 'upset with Elon Musk.

"Microsoft search market share doubles, as Google's share falls just below 90% for the first time",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-search-market-share-doubles-as-googles-share-falls-just-below-90-for-the-first-time/articleshow/117320875.cms,"

How Google's search market share dropped

Google's dominance in the global search engine market has dipped below 90% for the first time in almost a decade. According to Statcounter, in the last three months of 2024, Google's market share fell to 89.34% in October, 89.99% in November, and 89.74% in December. This marks a significant shift in the search landscape, as Google has consistently held over 90% of the market share for almost a decade.The last time Google's share was below 90% was in early 2015.However, this decline has helped Microsoft 's Bing search engine to experience a major growth in usage during the latter half of 2024, with its market share almost doubling to reach around 4%. This suggests that Bing is slowly gaining popularity, although it still lags significantly behind Google.As per Statcounter data, Google seems to be gradually losing its search market share. The company’s search market share has remained relatively stable in most regions except Asia, which appears to be a significant factor behind the overall decline, the report suggests.In the US, Google’s search market share peaked at 90.37% in November 2024 but dropped to 87.39% by December. For the rest of 2024, the share fluctuated between 86-88%, showing a slight but noticeable decline.Despite dominating the search market for nearly a decade with a consistent 90-92+% share, Google has faced criticism over the growing unhelpfulness of its search results.This, along with allegations of maintaining an illegal monopoly, has placed the company under scrutiny for almost two years.While Google's search market share decline might suggest users are turning to AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT Search and Perplexity, Statcounter's data doesn't specifically mention that. The report primarily tracks traditional search engines like Bing, Yandex, and Yahoo , with a minor ""other"" category that includes DuckDuckGo and Ecosia.Microsoft's Bing, the second most popular search engine, saw a slight increase in market share, hovering around 4% in the latter half of 2024.It's worth noting that a similar dip in Google's market share in April 2024 turned out to be a data error. However, the consistent decline in the last three months of 2024 suggests a real shift in user behaviour, even if the specific reasons remain unclear.","Google's market share fell to 89.34% in October, 89.99% in November, and 89.74% in December.

What the company says

The US Commerce Department and FBI are investigating Baicells Technologies , a Chinese company by former Huawei executives. According to a Reuters report, the commerce department is looking into the company for national security reasons and has sent legal requests (subpoenas) to it. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is helping with the investigation.Baicells was founded in 2014 by former Huawei executives. The company started its US business in Wisconsin in 2015. It has supplied telecom equipment to mobile networks across all US states.The US government is concerned that Chinese-made equipment could allow hackers to access sensitive data, disrupt services, or carry out cyberattacks. Baicells sells routers and base stations in the US, which help provide internet and mobile networks.Although there’s no evidence that Baicells equipment has been misused, experts warn it’s still risky, says the report.In 2023, the FBI warned Las Vegas officials about Baicells' base stations, leading the city to cancel its contract with the company. The FBI has also raised concerns in other areas, such as Virginia, where Baicells equipment was used near a naval weapons testing site. The US cybersecurity agency CISA has also issued warnings about vulnerabilities in Baicells equipment that could allow hackers to take control of devices.These investigations show that the U.S. remains worried about Chinese telecom equipment being used for spying, even after cracking down on other Chinese companies like Huawei and ZTE.Sun Lixin – the head of Baicells said the company will fully cooperate with US inquiries and believes its products are safe. ""We have taken affirmative steps to ensure the security of our products and proactively address any security concerns,"" Baicells said when asked about base station vulnerabilities.However, the US Defense Department recently added Baicells to a list of companies linked to China's military.",Baicells was founded in 2014 by former Huawei executives.

No, There's Still a Long Way to Go Yes, Progress Is Visible

Read the Bhupendra Vishwakarma’s LinkedIn post here



Why I Left Infosys Job Without Any Offer Letter in Hand, Despite Being the Sole Breadwinner for My Family

During my time at Infosys, I faced several systemic issues that ultimately forced me to make the difficult decision of leaving without an offer in hand. I want to speak openly about these challenges because they are indicative of larger problems in corporate workplaces:

1. No Financial Growth Despite Promotion: Being promoted from System Engineer to Senior System Engineer sounds good on paper, but it meant nothing without a monetary hike. For three years, I worked hard, met expectations, and contributed to the team, yet saw no financial acknowledgment of my efforts.

2. Unfair Workload Redistribution: When the team size reduced from 50 to 30 due to attrition, the additional workload was simply dumped on the remaining employees. Instead of hiring replacements or providing support, the management took the easy route—overburdening the existing team without compensation or even recognition.

3. Stagnant Career Prospects: The account I was assigned to was a loss-making one, as admitted by my manager. This directly impacted salary hikes and opportunities for career growth. Staying in such an account felt like professional stagnation, with no light at the end of the tunnel.

4. Toxic Client Environment: The client’s unrealistic demands for ultra-quick responses created a toxic work culture where even minor issues led to escalations. This pressure trickled down, creating stress at every level of the hierarchy. It felt like a constant state of firefighting, with no room for personal well-being.

5. Lack of Recognition: Despite consistent efforts and recognition from my peers and seniors, none of it translated into tangible rewards—be it financial growth, promotions, or career advancements. Hard work felt like it was being taken for granted.

6. Onsite Opportunities and Regional Bias: Onsite opportunities were never based on merit but rather on linguistic preferences. Employees speaking Telugu, Tamil, and Malayalam were frequently prioritized for such roles, while Hindi-speaking employees like me were overlooked, regardless of our performance. This blatant bias was both unfair and demoralizing.

These issues aren’t unique to me—they reflect the experiences of countless employees who feel voiceless in the face of such systemic failures. I chose to leave because I couldn’t compromise my self-respect and mental health for an organization that ignored these basic issues.

It’s time corporate managers stop sugarcoating the realities on the ground and start addressing these problems. Employees are not resources to be exploited; they are human beings with aspirations and limits. If such toxic practices continue unchecked, organizations risk losing not only their talent but also their credibility.

Infosys CEO Salil Parekh has addressed the growing concerns over the company's work culture following a viral LinkedIn post by former employee Bhupendra Vishwakarma. The post, which highlighted several issues including discrimination, lack of financial growth, and a toxic work environment , has sparked an online debate.During the Q3 earnings call on January 16, Parekh reaffirmed Infosys's commitment to fair treatment and inclusivity. ""Within Infosys, we have clear approach to make sure everyone is treated fairly. We have well defined process of seeing progress and everyone getting benefits. We hold ourselves to high standards,"" he stated.Parekh's remarks come amidst broader industry discussions about work-life balance and long work hours, further ignited by comments from L&T Chairman SN Subrahmanyan advocating for employees to work on Sundays. Vishwakarma in his LinkedIn post claimed he left Infosys without another job offer due to a lack of career growth, unfair workload distribution, and regional biases.During the press conference, Infosys reiterated its commitment to talent acquisition, confirming that the company is on track to hire approximately 15,000 freshers as planned for the current fiscal year.","Infosys CEO Salil Parekh has addressed the growing concerns over the company's work culture following a viral LinkedIn post by former employee Bhupendra Vishwakarma.

Updates aim to streamline the H-1B approval process, increase employer flexibility, and improve program integrity. H-2 updates strengthen worker protections and penalties for labor law violations.

Which visa categories are impacted by the H-1B rule changes

What is the H-2 visa program

What is the goal of the changes to the H-2 program

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) implemented new rules to modernize and improve the H-1B and H-2 nonimmigrant visa programs, effective Friday, January 17, 2025. These changes were published in the Federal Register on December 18, 2024. The H-1B program allows American companies to temporarily hire foreign workers in specialty occupations requiring highly specialized knowledge and at least a bachelor's degree (or equivalent).The new H-1B rules aim to streamline the approval process, increases employer flexibility in retaining talent, and enhances program integrity and oversight. While primarily focused on H-1B specialty occupation workers, some provisions also affect other nonimmigrant classifications, including H-2, H-3, F-1, L-1, O, P, Q-1, R-1, E-3, and TN. The current annual cap for H-1B visas stands at 65,000, with an additional 20,000 reserved for those holding advanced degrees from US institutions.The H-2 program covers temporary agricultural (H-2A) and nonagricultural (H-2B) workers. The updated H-2 rule strengthens worker protections by imposing stricter penalties on companies that charge prohibited fees or violate labor laws. It also provides greater flexibility for both H-2A and H-2B workers. The DHS aims to enhance the integrity of the H-2 programs and improve worker protections through these regulatory changes.The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has implemented new rules to modernize and improve the H-1B (specialty occupations) and H-2 (temporary agricultural and nonagricultural workers) nonimmigrant visa programs.Both rules were published in the Federal Register on December 18, 2024.The H-1B final rule aims to modernize the program by:* Streamlining the approval process. Students on F-1 visas will face fewer disruptions when shifting to H-1B status. F-1 visa students applying for an H-1B visa will benefit from an automatic extension of their F-1 visa until April 1 of that year. This will ensure continuity in lawful status and work authorisation while their H-1B application is under review. USCIS has committed to expediting applications for H-1B extensions to ease the burden on both employers as well as workers.* Increasing flexibility for employers to retain talented workers. Businesses can hire H-1B workers based on documented needs, allowing more adaptable workforce planning. ap-exempt organisations, such as universities and research bodies, can now submit petitions throughout the year without numerical limitations.* Improving the integrity and oversight of the program.

New policies amounts to reset, says Zuckerberg

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg accused former COO Sheryl Sandberg for the present “culture” in Facebook in a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump’s advisor Stephen Miller, reported the New York Times. As per the outlet, the tech billionaire was told he has the opportunity to “rebuild America” but on the “terms of Trump.”According to the outlet, Zuckerberg blamed Sandberg for Facebook's inclusivity initiative, which saw employees embrace self-expression in the workplace.The Meta CEO will reportedly now not stand against Trump’s crackdown on DEI culture—diversity, equity, and inclusion. The tech mogul has also reportedly mentioned that the new guidelines and layoffs will be initiated to “reset the company.” This DEI culture has been adopted not just by Meta but several companies in America in recent years.Furthermore, the outlet reported that, according to people present at the meeting, Zuckerberg said he would now solely focus on building tech products.He also accused Sandberg of the inclusivity culture at the company.“Zuckerberg blamed his former chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, for an inclusivity initiative at Facebook that encouraged employees’ self-expression in the workplace,” the report added, citing one of the people with knowledge of the meeting.Sandberg resigned from the company in 2022, and at that time, Zuckerberg praised her working syyle.“Sheryl architected our ads business, hired great people, forged our management culture, and taught me how to run a company. She deserves the credit for so much of what Meta is today,” Zuckerberg wrote at that time.The report comes a few days after Meta CEO, while supporting Trump's crackdown on DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) culture, announced abolishing its D.E.I. policy. The report even claims that “Zuckerberg’s political lieutenants previewed the changes” to Miller in a private briefing before making them official on January 10.Zuckerberg reportedly said new guidelines and layoffs would be implemented to “reset the company.”","Zuckerberg reportedly said new guidelines and layoffs would be implemented to “reset the company’ Meta CEO announced abolishing its D.E.I.

“I think that’s a good thing. As an industry, we want to move fast,”

“As the first Trump administration demonstrated, America wins through innovation, competition, and by sharing our technologies with the world — not by retreating behind a wall of government overreach.”

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang may skip President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20, a report claims. If the rumours are to be true, this will break away from a trend among US-based tech leaders attending the event. Unlike executives such as Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos, and Tesla head Elon Musk who is a close Trump ally, Huang will reportedly not represent Nvidia at the ceremony.Nvidia is now the most valuable chipmaker globally and second only to Apple among tech companies.Meanwhile, the chip industry is expected to be represented at the Trump inauguration, with Arm Holdings CEO Rene Haas likely to attend the event.A report by the news agency Bloomberg citing a source familiar with Huang’s plans claimed that he is currently in East Asia, a routine trip he makes around the Lunar New Year. The source, who spoke anonymously, also noted that Huang has never attended a US presidential inauguration before. However, a representative of California-based Nvidia declined to comment on Huang’s plans or any communication between the company and the incoming administration.Earlier this month, Huang talked about his willingness to meet Trump, stating he’d be “delighted to meet Trump and “do whatever we can to make this administration succeed.’”However, at the time, Huang noted he had not yet received an invitation to the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. He also said that he expects that Trump would implement fewer regulations.Huang notedCurrently, Nvidia is grappling with multiple new regulations introduced during the final days of the Biden administration. These measures aim to restrict access to advanced technologies, including Nvidia's latest AI chips, to prevent them from reaching China.The company has strongly opposed the new export restrictions that were announced this week. The chip maker labelled these restrictions as an ""overreach"" and cautioned that it could have major consequences for the technology industry.Earlier this week, Ned Finkle, Nvidia’s vice president of government affairs, said:","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang may skip President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20, a report claims.

Tech leaders coming to Trump’s inauguration

TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has been invited to US President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Monday, January 20. According to a New York Times report, Mr. Chew has been invited to sit in a position of honor on the dais, which is typically reserved for former presidents, family members and other important guests. Among prominent tech leaders that are reported to attend the inauguration are Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and other influential tech executives. This means that Chew will join these tech leaders on the dais.The invitation is significant, particularly as the China-backed short-video platform prepares to close its US operations, with a federal ban set to take effect unless a last-minute reprieve occurs. A report by The Washington Post stated that Trump is considering an executive order to delay the shutdown for 60 to 90 days.Donald Trump’s support for TikTok is a striking reversal from 2020, when he attempted to ban the app in the US and force its sale to American companies. He grew more favorable toward the platform last year, especially after his campaign gained traction on TikTok during the election.Also read: Blinkit takes a 'Holy Dip’, makes it to Maha Kumbh 2025 “The Trump administration’s embrace of Mr. Chew is significant as the app teeters on the brink of death in the United States.

Microsoft extends security updates for Windows 10

Microsoft has announced that its Office apps, now called Microsoft 365 apps, will no longer be supported on Windows 10 starting October 14, 2025. In a blog post, Microsoft stated, “Microsoft 365 Apps will no longer be supported after October 14, 2025, on Windows 10 devices. To use Microsoft 365 Applications on your device, you will need to upgrade to Windows 11 .” The date also marks the end of official support for the Windows 10 operating system. To continue using Microsoft 365 apps without issues, users will need to upgrade to Windows 11.Microsoft says that though after the support ends, the Office apps won’t stop working right away. However, users might face performance and reliability problems over time, the company warns.Microsoft is pushing users to upgrade to Windows 11, calling 2025 “the year of the Windows 11 PC refresh.” Speaking at CES, Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft’s executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer, emphasized the importance of upgrading:“We believe that one of the most important pieces of technology people will look to refresh in 2025 isn’t the refrigerator, the television or their mobile phone. It will be their Windows 10 PC, and they will move forward with Windows 11”.Many Windows 10 users haven’t switched to Windows 11 yet, partly because older PCs don’t meet the strict hardware requirements. For instance, Windows 11 demands a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0, which Microsoft says is “non-negotiable.” Gamers too are reluctant to switch to Windows 11, citing concerns about compatibility and performance.To encourage users to upgrade, Microsoft has started showing full-screen prompts suggesting they buy new PCs.While the support for Windows 10 will end this year, Microsoft is offering Extended Security Updates (ESUs) for the first time. Consumers can pay $30 for an extra year of updates, while businesses can purchase up to three years of extended support.As the October 2025 deadline approaches, Microsoft is making it clear that upgrading to Windows 11 is essential for a seamless experience with its apps and services.","Microsoft 365 apps will no longer be supported on Windows 10 starting October 14, 2025.

What AppleCare+ policies say about fire damages



What it means for users



Victims affected by the Los Angeles wildfire who lost their Macs may have to look to their homeowner's insurance for replacement, not AppleCare. While AppleCare offers protection against certain damages, it generally doesn't cover fire damage. The wildfires in California have caused widespread property loss, including homes, businesses, and personal belongings. Thousands of people have been affected, and those needing to replace their Macs will likely find better support through their homeowner's insurance policies. Apple 's AppleCare+ for Mac has specific terms outlining what is and isn't covered for repairs.Similar to other warranties and insurance policies, the agreement clearly states its limitations.The ""What is not Covered?"" section of the AppleCare+ policy agreement lists scenarios that won’t be covered includes damage caused by ""accident, abuse, misuse, liquid contact, fire, earthquake or other external causes."" This means damage from fire, or even water damage from firefighting efforts, will not covered.Submitting a Mac for repair or replacement after it has survived a house fire, even if it appears intact externally, will likely be rejected. Additionally, if your house was evacuated as a precaution but left unscathed by the fire, it could still become a target for theft. The policy explicitly states it does not cover ""lost or stolen"" hardware, noting, ""This Plan only covers Covered Equipment that is returned to Apple in its entirety.""Apart from this, the company is offering other support to those affected by the LA wildfires. Apple Card users in FEMA-designated disaster areas can defer payments without interest accrual by contacting Apple Card Support.Additionally, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that Apple is donating to support wildfire victims and recovery efforts.While AppleCare is helpful for typical Mac issues, it's not a comprehensive insurance plan and has limitations. It's designed to cover repairs for specific problems, not for events like natural disasters or theft. For broader protection, insurance is the more appropriate solution.Instead, Mac owners affected by wildfires should turn to homeowner's or renter's insurance, which typically covers property damage and loss, including electronics. Businesses can use property insurance for similar claims, while travellers should review their travel insurance policies for coverage of damaged or lost items.","AppleCare+ for Mac has specific terms outlining what is and isn't covered for repairs.

How Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg used YouTube to defend his company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-facebook-co-founder-mark-zuckerberg-used-youtube-to-defend-his-company/articleshow/117307788.cms,"What Zuckerberg said to defend Meta



“For example, YouTube, I think, may end up hosting some stuff that people pirate for some period of time, but YouTube is trying to take that stuff down. And the vast majority of the stuff on YouTube, I would assume, is kind of good and they have the license to do.”

What Zuckerberg said about Meta using LibGen



“I get that you’re trying to get me to give an opinion of LibGen, which I haven’t really heard of. It’s just that I don’t have knowledge of that specific thing.”

Facebook-parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has used YouTube 's battle against piracy to defend his company's use of copyrighted ebooks for AI training. According to newly released excerpts from a deposition (seen by Techcrunch), which was a part of the Kadrey v. Meta lawsuit , Zuckerberg’s defence highlighted the ongoing legal debate surrounding the ""fair use"" of copyrighted content for AI training , a claim disputed by many copyright holders.This is one of many cases where authors and IP holders are challenging AI companies over their use of copyrighted material.During his deposition, Zuckerberg said:While a full transcript remains unavailable, excerpts from Zuckerberg's deposition shed light on his views regarding copyright and fair use in AI development. Zuckerberg seems to defend Meta's use of the ""LibGen"" dataset, a collection of copyrighted ebooks, to train its Llama AI models.LibGen, a self-described ""links aggregator,"" provides access to copyrighted works from major publishers and has faced numerous lawsuits and fines for copyright infringement. Despite concerns within Meta's AI teams about the legal implications, Zuckerberg allegedly approved the use of LibGen for training at least one Llama model.The plaintiffs' counsel, representing authors like Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates, highlighted internal concerns within Meta about using the LibGen dataset. According to a legal filing, Meta employees referred to LibGen as a ""data set we know to be pirated"" and warned that its use ""may undermine (the company’s)] negotiating position with regulators.""However, during his deposition, Zuckerberg claimed he ""hadn't really heard of"" LibGen. He said:When questioned by one of the plaintiffs' attorneys, David Boies, about the company's use of the LibGen dataset. Zuckerberg defended Meta's use of the dataset, arguing that prohibiting the use of such resources for AI training would be unreasonable.“So would I want to have a policy against people using YouTube because some of the content may be copyrighted? No. [T]here are cases where having such a blanket ban might not be the right thing to do,” he said.“You know, [if there’s] someone who’s providing a website and they’re intentionally trying to violate people’s rights … obviously it’s something that we would want to be cautious about or careful about how we engaged with it or maybe even prevent our teams from engaging with it,” Zuckerberg added.","Mark Zuckerberg used YouTube's battle against piracy to defend Meta's use of copyrighted ebooks for AI training.

Children's access assessment:

Protecting children on social media platforms:

Age verification for pornographic content:

The UK's media regulator, Ofcom , has issued guidelines requiring all websites hosting porn, or adult material, including social media platforms, to implement “robust” age-verification checks for users in the region.According to the guidelines, these measures, which include demanding photo ID or conducting credit card checks, must be in place by July.The new rules, implemented under the Online Safety Act (OSA), aim to prevent children from easily accessing pornography online.“For too long, many online services which allow porn and other harmful material have ignored the fact that children are accessing their services,” said Ofcom chief executive Melanie Dawes.“Either they don’t ask or, when they do, the checks are minimal and easy to avoid. That means companies have effectively been treating all users as if they’re adults, leaving children potentially exposed to porn and other types of harmful content. Today, this starts to change,” Dawes added.Key requirements and deadlines for online services under the Online Safety Act include:All user-to-user services and search services must conduct a children's access assessment within three months (by April 16, 2025) to determine if the service or any part of it is likely to be accessed by children. Services that are likely to be accessed by children must comply with children's risk assessment duties and children's safety duties.Ofcom will publish Protection of Children Codes and children's risk assessment guidance in April 2025. Services likely to be accessed by children must conduct a children's risk assessment within three months of the guidance publication (by July 2025). Based on the risk assessment, services must implement measures to protect children, such as introducing age checks.All services that allow pornography must have highly effective age assurance processes in place by July 2025. Services that publish their own pornographic content, including certain Generative AI tools, must begin implementing robust age checks immediately.“As age checks start to roll out in the coming months, adults will start to notice a difference in how they access certain online services. Services which host their own pornography must start to introduce age checks immediately, while other user-to-user services – including social media - which allow pornography and certain other types of content harmful to children will have to follow suit by July at the latest,” Dawes added.","UK's media regulator, Ofcom, has issued guidelines requiring all websites hosting porn, or adult material, to implement “robust” age-verification checks for users in the region.

Donald Trump is reportedly considering an executive order to delay the TikTok ban, providing its China-based parent company Bytedance some time to negotiate a sale or find an alternative solution for the Chinese-owned app, which is likely to be banned in the US on Sunday (December 19).According to a report by The Washington Post, the President-elect is considering an executive order that would suspend enforcement of the TikTok ban-or-sale law for 60 to 90 days once he takes office.This effort, however, is legally questionable, the report added.“Trump has been mulling ways to save the day for the wildly popular video app, talking through unconventional dealmaking and legal maneuvers such as an executive order that would unravel the law passed by Congress last year with bipartisan support,” the report cited two people familiar with the deliberations as saying.The report says that Trump is keen on being seen as rescuing a platform where he is widely admired. This has led political aides and business allies to scramble for options to fulfill his campaign promise to “save TikTok,” as he has mentioned repeatedly on his TikTok account, which boasts over 14 million followers.“I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” Trump said last month. The main challenge is how to achieve this. One source mentioned that Trump is eager to be seen as “making a deal,” after he assumed office.A law signed by President Joe Biden last year requires the app’s owner, Beijing-based tech giant ByteDance, to sell the app by January 19 – just one day before Trump’s inauguration – or face an immediate ban. The Supreme Court, which considered TikTok's challenge of the law last week, is expected to allow the law to proceed but has not yet issued a ruling.","Donald Trump is reportedly considering an executive order to delay the TikTok ban.

Apple's India Success Story

Apple has achieved a significant milestone in India, breaking into the top five smartphone brands for the first time since it began selling iPhones in the country. This is particularly noteworthy given India's price-conscious market. According to a report in Economic Times, during the crucial festive season of September-December 2024, Apple secured a 9-10% market share, a historic high for the company in India, according to preliminary data from IDC and Counterpoint Research.This success is said to be partly attributed to Apple's increasing localization efforts. The company now manufactures the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max in India through Foxconn and Pegatron. Furthermore, it's expanding AirPods component production in Pune and plans to begin full AirPods manufacturing in Telangana by 2025. Apple's India-made product range, which already includes iPads and MacBooks, continues to grow, even as some iPad production shifts to Vietnam. The Indian government is actively encouraging further local iPad assembly.Apple's financial performance in India reflects this growth. In FY2023-24, net profit rose 23% to Rs 2,745.7 crore, while revenue increased by 36% to Rs 67,121.6 crore, driven by strong iPhone sales. Analysts predict continued growth in both sales and profits for the current fiscal year.In 2024, Apple shipped over 12 million iPhones in India, representing substantial year-on-year growth of 34-35% compared to the 9 million units shipped in 2023, according to preliminary data from IDC and echoed by Counterpoint Research.The overall Indian smartphone market also saw growth, with IDC estimating over 38 million units shipped in Q4 2024, a 5-6% year-on-year increase, following a strong 46 million-unit shipment in Q3 2024.","Apple broke into the top five smartphone brands for the first time since it began selling iPhones in the country.

However, today, the average age of Indian entrepreneurs has notably increased, reflecting a broader spectrum of maturity and experience among those stepping into this space.A few years ago, startups were not considered a mainstream career option for graduates or those pursuing higher studies.

The Grok model that Elon Musk went offline for may have just beaten China's DeepSeek-R1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-grok-model-that-elon-musk-went-offline-for-may-have-just-beaten-chinas-deepseek-r1-in-ai-scaling/articleshow/120044369.cms,"A mix of energy sources, including nuclear power, will be key in meeting growing power demand in India.

Elon Musk-owned Grok has reportedly beaten China's DeepSeek AI chatbot. According to a report by Counterpoint Research, Elon Musk's xAI unveiled Grok-3, its most advanced model to date, which slightly outperforms DeepSeek-R1 , OpenAI’s GPT-o1 and Google’s Gemini 2 . Unlike DeepSeek-R1, Grok-3 is proprietary and was trained using a staggering ~200,000 H100 GPUs on xAI’s supercomputer Colossus, representing a giant leap in computational scale. Incidentally, Grok-3 is the same model that Elon Musk said February 2025 that he is going offline for. ""Will be honing product with the team all weekend, so offline until then,"" Elon Musk has posted.Since February, DeepSeek has grabbed global headlines by open-sourcing its flagship reasoning model DeepSeek-R1 to deliver performance on a par with the world’s frontier reasoning models. What sets it apart isn’t just its elite capabilities, but the fact that it was trained using only ~2,000 NVIDIA H800 GPUs — a scaled-down, export-compliant alternative to the H100, making its achievement a masterclass in efficiency.Grok-3 represents scale without compromise -- 200,000 NVIDIA H100s chasing frontier gains, while DeepSeek-R1 delivers similar performance using a fraction of the compute, signalling that innovative architecture and curation can rival brute force, according to Counterpoint Research.Musk’s xAI has unveiled Grok-3, its most advanced model to date, which slightly outperforms DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI’s GPT-o1 and Google’s Gemini 2. “Unlike DeepSeek-R1, Grok-3 is proprietary and was trained using a staggering 200,000 H100 GPUs on xAI’s supercomputer Colossus, representing a giant leap in computational scale,” said Sun.Grok-3 embodies the brute-force strategy — massive compute scale (representing billions of dollars in GPU costs) driving incremental performance gains. It’s a route only the wealthiest tech giants or governments can realistically pursue.“In contrast, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the power of algorithmic ingenuity by leveraging techniques like Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and reinforcement learning for reasoning, combined with curated and high-quality data, to achieve comparable results with a fraction of the compute,” explained Sun.Grok-3 proves that throwing 100x more GPUs can yield marginal performance gains rapidly. But it also highlights rapidly diminishing returns on investment (ROI), as most real-world users see minimal benefit from incremental improvements. In essence, DeepSeek-R1 is reported to be about achieving elite performance with minimal hardware overhead, while Grok-3 is about pushing boundaries by any computational means necessary, said the report.","Elon Musk-owned Grok has reportedly beaten China's DeepSeek AI chatbot.

Who is Indian American Vaniya Agrawal who 'shamed' Microsoft CEOs at the company's 50th anniversary celebrations and sent company-wide email announcing resignation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/who-is-indian-american-vaniya-agrawal-who-shamed-microsoft-ceos-at-the-companys-50th-anniversary-celebrations-and-sent-company-wide-email-announcing-resignation/articleshow/120040143.cms,"Who is Vaniya Agrawal who shouted at Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella

""Hi all, My name is Vaniya, and after 1.5 years as a software engineer at this company, I’ve decided to leave Microsoft. My last day is next Friday, April 11. You may have seen me stand up earlier today to call out Satya during his speech at the

Microsoft 50th anniversary

. Here’s why I decided to leave the company, and why I spoke up today,"" Vaniya wrote in the email.

Microsoft 's 50th anniversary celebrations were disrupted twice by Pro-Palestine supporters at the company's Redmond, Washington, headquarters last week. In both cases the employees who disrupted the event were women employees. Another common thing was that the duo sent company-wide emails regarding their protest at the event.In the first incident, a software engineer named Ibtihal Aboussad in the company’s artificial intelligence division yelled at Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman when he was delivering a speech. “Mustafa, shame on you,” the employee, Ibtihal Aboussad, said as she walked towards the stage.The second incident involved Indian-American Vaniya Agrawal. As Microsoft current CEO Satya Nadella ; and former CEOs Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates sat on stage talking about the company, Vaniya Agrawal stood up and started shouting. “Shame on you all. You’re all hypocrites,” she said. “50,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been murdered with Microsoft technology. How dare you. Shame on all of you for celebrating in their blood. Cut ties with Israel.” Vaniya was escorted out by the security. As per videos online, some employees also booed her.Vaniya Agrawa then mentioned ' No Azure for Apartheid ', the group is said to have coordinated protests both inside and outside Microsoft venue.Vaniya Agrawal is a software engineer in the company’s artificial intelligence division. From the name, it appears that she is an Indian-American. She wrote in the company-wide email she sent to Microsoft employees that she has been working with the company for over one-and-a-half years. TOI Tech tried to look for Vaniya on LinkedIn and Twitter but could not find her account.She then went on to share what she claimed Microsoft's participation in genocide in Gaza.","Microsoft's 50th anniversary celebrations were disrupted twice by Pro-Palestine supporters at the company's Redmond, Washington, headquarters last week.

Walmart Boycott: What it is and how it is different from Boycott calls against Target and Amazon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/walmart-boycott-what-it-is-and-how-it-is-different-from-boycott-calls-against-target-and-amazon/articleshow/120035717.cms,"What Walmart said on withdrawing DEI programmes

People's Union USA founder John Schwarz has announced on social media details of upcoming planned boycotts:

A weeklong boycott of Walmart in the US starts April 7, the latest in a series of economic blackouts organized by the People's Union USA . The group has called for a week-long Walmart boycott , beginning Monday. The advocacy group, which was created in February, has previously organised national boycotts of retailers who canceled their Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives. These include Target and Amazon.Starting in late February, the group has organised a day of total economic blackout and boycott of Amazon. However, unlike the February 28 protests that targeted retailers like Target that have cancelled their DEI programmes, the newest boycotts are said to be about corporate greed and political corruption, according to a post on the People’s Union USA website.“No matter what side of the political fence you stand on, you should be able to agree that corporate greed and political corruption are choking this country,” the post says. “If you need something, look locally; if you can’t find it locally, wait. We are cutting the cord.”The world's largest retailer Walmart has rolled back DEI programs in November 2024. The company said that it will not renew a five-year commitment for an equity racial center created after the killing of George Floyd by Police. It said that it will no longer consider race and gender diversity of suppliers or participate in a survey measuring workplace inclusion for LGBTQ+ people.According to a report in SuperMarketNews, quoting data from Numerator, Walmart may be more resilient to boycotts than other retailers. The retailer is reported to be not feeling the impact from households regarding its non-DEI stance, especially multicultural households, which is not the case for Target.Target is said to have been hit the hardest by the February 28 boycott, which was centered around DEI. The retailer is said to have seen a 9% drop in web traffic on the day of the protest, according to Forbes. Walmart saw a 5% decline in web traffic, while Amazon saw least drop, of 2%.* Walmart: April 7-14 and May 20-26* Second economic blackout: April 18* General Mills: April 21-28* Amazon: May 6-12* Target: June 3-9* McDonald's: June 24-30* Independence Day boycott: July 4","A weeklong boycott of Walmart in the US starts April 7, the latest in a series of economic blackouts organized by the People's Union USA.

It’s been a packed week in the world of tech— from Microsoft celebrating its 50th anniversary with a special conversation by AI, to Elon Musk shutting down rumors about stepping away from DOGE. Meanwhile, Trump ’s newly announced tariffs shook the markets, wiping billions off the net worth of tech giants like Mark Zuckerberg Jeff Bezos , and Elon Musk. The week also saw fresh layoffs at companies like Zomato and Whirlpool, adding to the growing wave of job cuts in the industry. Here's a quick roundup of the biggest tech stories making headlines.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg saw the largest drop in net worth on April 3, losing a staggering $17.9 billion. As per Bloomberg Billionaire Index, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook , Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and several others from the world’s richest 500 list collectively lost $208 billion in market value. The sharp decline came after the US President Donald Trump announced a new wave of ""discounted"" reciprocal tariffs, triggering panic across financial markets. Wall Street recorded its worst trading day in years, as all major US stock indexes suffered their biggest single-day drops since the COVID-19 pandemic.US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that the H-1B visa cap of 85,000 for the fiscal year 2026 has been reached. In a press statement, the agency stated, “We have randomly selected enough beneficiaries with properly submitted registrations projected as needed to reach the H-1B cap.” USCIS has also notified all prospective petitioners with selected beneficiaries that they are eligible to file an H-1B cap-subject petition. Petitions for FY 2026, including those qualifying for the advanced degree exemption, can be submitted starting April 1, 2025.Microsoft has officially turned 50. The company, founded on April 4, 1975, by Bill Gates and Paul Allen as ""Micro-Soft,"" began with a mission to transform personal computing. Starting with software for the Altair 8800, the duo’s ambition soon led to a landmark partnership with IBM in 1980. This collaboration gave rise to MS-DOS, the operating system that defined the PC revolution of the 1980s and laid the foundation for Microsoft’s lasting impact on the tech world.To mark the milestone, current CEO Satya Nadella joined former CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer for a special conversation—hosted not by a human, but by Copilot, Microsoft’s own AI assistant. The tone was light-hearted and futuristic. Nadella kicked things off by playfully asking Copilot to “wrap it up by asking or maybe roast—giving us each an AI roast?” The conversation touched on technology, leadership, and the role of AI in the years ahead. At one point, Nadella asked Copilot when AI would be ready to “run the show,” to which the AI replied: “The day AI can play like the best cricket player that…”, leaving the group laughing and the audience amused.Bill Gates unveiled Microsoft's original source code celebrating its 50th anniversary, highlighting the BASIC code he and Paul Allen developed for the Altair 8800. This code, Gates considers the ""coolest,"" was the foundation of Micro-Soft, which later evolved into Microsoft. Gates acknowledges contributions from leaders like Steve Ballmer and Satya Nadella. “Reaching the 50-year mark is a tremendous achievement, and it's one that we could not have accomplished without the contributions of incredible leaders such as Steve Ballmer and Satya Nadella—along with the dedication of the countless individuals who have worked at Microsoft throughout the years,” Gates reflected in his blog post published on his personal Gates Notes platform this week.“It feels like just yesterday that Paul and I were hunched over the PDP-10 in Harvard's computer lab, writing the code that would become the first product of our new company,” he noted, adding, “That code remains the coolest code I've ever written to this day.”Samsung has unveiled the Galaxy Tab S10FE series in India, featuring the Galaxy Tab S10FE and Galaxy Tab S10FE+. Both tablets run on Android 15, support S Pen, and have IP68-rated LCD displays. Prices start at Rs 42999, with various pre-booking offers available. The tablets will be available from April 11. Galaxy Tab S10 FE+ 13.1-inch display that’s about 12% larger than the previous FE+. The display gets a 90Hz refresh rate, up to 800 nits HBM, Vision Booster that automatically adjusts brightness and visibility in changing outdoor environments.It is powered by Exynos 1580 SoC paired with up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The Galaxy Tab S10 FE series comes with a 13MP rear camera as well as the IP68 rating as the newest Galaxy Tab S10 series.Elon Musk has denied recent reports suggesting he is planning to step down from his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The speculation began after a Washington columnist posted on X that President Donald Trump had informed close aides and Cabinet members that Musk would be leaving the role in the coming weeks.Karoline Leavitt, Assistant to the President and White House Press Secretary, quickly shut down the claim. Quoting the post, she wrote: “This ‘scoop’ is garbage. Elon Musk and President Trump have both publicly stated that Elon will depart from public service as a special government employee when his incredible work at DOGE is complete.” The post caught Musk’s attention, prompting a brief but direct response from the Tesla CEO: “Yeah, fake news.” Infosys has filed fresh charges against Cognizant in a US district court, accusing it of using its monopoly power to stifle competition in the healthcare software market. Cognizant is alleged to have engaged in anti-competitive practices, including restricting market entry and blocking Infosys's growth. The legal tussle began in August 2024, when Cognizant accused Infosys of stealing trade secrets related to TriZetto. Infosys responded in January 2025 by filing an antitrust counterclaim, alleging that Cognizant's anti-competitive strategies hindered fair competition. Infosys also named Cognizant's CEO, Ravi Kumar S, accusing him of delaying the launch of Infosys Helix during his tenure at Infosys and poaching key executives after joining Cognizant in January 2023.Zomato has laid off nearly 600 customer support associates within a year of hiring them, a MoneyControl report claims. This move comes as the company reportedly experiences slowing growth in food delivery and losses in its quick commerce unit, Blinkit. Zomato has also been using artificial intelligence (AI) to automate customer support functions to reduce costs. Incidentally, the layoffs come weeks after the launch of ‘Nugget’, an in-house AI-powered customer support platform developed over three years. Nugget handles over 15 million monthly interactions across Zomato’s platforms, including Blinkit and Hyperpure. Nugget is also capable of resolving up to 80% of customer queries without human intervention.Whirlpool Corporation has announced a significant workforce reduction, laying off 651 employees at its manufacturing plant in Amana, Iowa. The layoffs, effective June 1, 2025, represent approximately one-third of the plant's workforce and are attributed to declining consumer demand for certain refrigeration products manufactured at the facility.In an official statement, Whirlpool explained that the decision was driven by the need to align production with current market conditions. The company emphasised that the layoffs were not influenced by external factors such as tariffs but were instead a strategic move to address reduced demand for specific appliances.Mark Zuckerberg has purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington, DC’s upscale Woodland Normanstone neighborhood. Meta confirmed the high-profile acquisition, noting that it would allow Zuckerberg to spend more time on technology and policy matters in the capital. The property ranks among the most expensive in the city, putting Zuckerberg in the company of other tech billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel, who have also bought homes in Washington in recent years.According to Politico, the identity of the buyer initially remained a closely guarded secret for weeks, with real estate agents bound by non-disclosure agreements. The mystery deepened when, shortly after the cash deal closed in early March, the 15,000-square-foot home appeared blurred on Google Maps. Local residents noticed increased activity around the previously vacant mansion, which lined up with reports of Zuckerberg’s private jet landing at nearby Dulles Airport.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that the H-1B visa cap of 85,000 for the fiscal year 2026 has been reached. Mark Zuckerberg saw the largest drop in net worth on April 3, losing a staggering $17.9 billion. The week also saw fresh layoffs at companies like Zomato and Whirlpool, adding to the growing wave of job cuts in the industry.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120035556,imgsize-13698,width-400,resizemode-4/tech-weekly.jpg"

Phoebe shares the biggest influence behind her decision

Microsoft founder Bill Gates youngest daughter Phoebe Gates is carving out her own path as an entrepreneur with the launch of a new podcast and a fashion website . The 22-year-old Stanford graduate debuted ""The Burnouts"" recently alongside her business partner Sophia Kianni, teasing her forthcoming venture called ""Phia."" During the premiere episode, Phoebe reportedly opened up about her fears of being seen as a ""Nepo Baby,"" a term used for children of famous or influential figures who benefit from their family connections. ""I was like, I have so much privilege. I’m a Nepo Baby,"" she admitted, revealing the insecurities that came with her privileged background. However, she expressed a strong drive to establish her own identity, saying, ""I have such a desire to prove myself.""According to a report by New York Post, Phoebe shared that her parents, Bill Gates, 69, and Melinda French Gates , 60, who divorced in 2021 after 27 years of marriage, were initially hesitant about her entrepreneurial ambitions. Recalling their cautious response, she quoted her father asking, ""Are you sure you wanna do this?"" The former couple, who also share daughter Jennifer, 28, and son Rory, 25, encouraged Phoebe to complete her education first. She graduated from Stanford University last spring with a degree in Human Biology before diving into the world of fashion tech.Phoebe’s interest in fashion, as per the report, dates back to at least 2022, when she spoke about her inspirations to WWD. She cited her mother’s friendship with Stella McCartney, the renowned designer and daughter of Beatles legend Paul McCartney , as a pivotal influence. ""Her and my mom are actually good friends,"" Phoebe said, noting how McCartney’s success showed her that individuals born into privilege could leverage their platforms for meaningful impact. ""She took that and instead of being like, ‘Oh, people define me by this,’ she was like, ‘OK, I have this immense privilege, now I’m going to use it to leverage something,'"" Phoebe explained.Reflecting on her own journey, Phoebe added, ""I’m my parents’ daughter, that gives me immense privilege, but it’s not what I’m defined by. I want to have my own identity, I want to be my own person, I want to branch away from that, but how do I do that in a way where I can yield some sort of change?"" With ""The Burnouts"" and ""Phia,"" the young Gates is taking her first steps toward answering that question, aiming to make her mark in the sustainable fashion industry.","Phoebe Gates, 22, has launched a podcast and fashion website.

The release includes two immediately available models—Scout and Maverick—with a third model, Behemoth, still in training.Llama 4 Scout, designed to run on a single Nvidia H100 GPU, features a massive 10-million-token context window allowing it to process extremely lengthy documents. Meta claims Scout outperforms Google's Gemma 3 and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite models, as well as the open-source Mistral 3.1 across various benchmarks.The larger Maverick model , which requires more substantial computing resources like an Nvidia H100 DGX system, reportedly competes with OpenAI 's GPT-4o and Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash on coding, reasoning, multilingual capabilities, and image processing tasks.Both models utilize a ""mixture of experts"" (MoE) architecture, which improves efficiency by activating only the necessary portions of the model for specific tasks.

Sridhar Vembu’s comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress , emphasizing the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s recent expansion in Kerala. The image in the party’s post shows a tombstone design to symbolically critique the ""Make in India"" initiative, suggesting it has failed between 2014 and 2025. The tombstone features the Indian lion emblem and the phrase ""Rest in Peace.""The post is captioned “In loving memory of….”. Responding to the post, Vembu emphasized the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s expansion in Kerala. He wrote:“Meanwhile companies like us Make in India (and started making in Kerala recently too).”“Make in India is gaining momentum and we have to make up for several lost decades. Reflect on why they were ""lost decades"" and perhaps you will appreciate Make in India better,” he further added.Zoho has been expanding its operations across India, including in Kerala. The company has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas as part of its broader strategy.The Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports. Several companies, including Zoho, have increased their domestic production efforts as part of this initiative.Vembu’s response comes amid ongoing discussions on India's economic policies and industrial growth, with businesses and policymakers debating the impact of past and present strategies.Vembu recently drew a comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods, highlighting their long-term impact on economic structures. In a recent post, he discussed how capital inflows into a single sector can divert resources from others, weakening overall economic capabilities.Citing Silicon Valley as an example, Vembu pointed out the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, attributing them to a talent shift toward sectors with higher financial incentives. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now – for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors overlooked the sector due to the absence of large exits.Drawing a parallel to India, Vembu noted that the long-standing dominance of the IT industry resulted in the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he stated.He stressed the importance of addressing these gaps and rebuilding capabilities in affected sectors. ""We have to make up for lost time,"" he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female. The change aligns with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January 2025, titled ‘Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government’. The updated policy, which took effect on April 2, applies to all pending and future immigration benefit requests. “USCIS is returning to its historical policy of recognizing two biological sexes,” the agency said in a press statement.Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security , said “There are only two sexes—male and female. President Trump promised the American people a revolution of common sense, and that includes making sure that the policy of the U.S. government agrees with simple biological reality. Proper management of our immigration system is a matter of national security, not a place to promote and coddle an ideology that permanently harms children and robs real women of their dignity, safety, and well-being.”Under the new guidance, a person’s sex will be determined based on the birth certificate issued at or closest to the time of birth. “If the birth certificate issued at or nearest to the time of birth indicates a sex other than male or female, USCIS will base the determination of sex on secondary evidence. See Volume 1, General Policies and Procedures, Part E, Adjudications, Chapter 6, Evidence, Section B, Primary and Secondary Evidence [1 USCIS-PM E.6(B)],” the agency stated.The agency further stated that the benefits will not be denied solely based on how someone identifies their sex, it also confirmed that it does not issue documents with a blank sex field or one that differs from the original birth certificate. Any discrepancies may lead to processing delays.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female.

(AP Photo/Jason Redmond)

Another mistake Bill Gates made as CEO of MIcrosoft

Microsoft is celebrating its 50th anniversary this month, and co-founder Bill Gates sat down with current CEO Satya Nadella . Among all the conversations, he opened up about one critical misstep during the company's early days when Gates himself was the CEO, and that was underestimating the importance of government relations .""You know, I might tell my younger self, watch out for the government,"" Gates said during a recent podcast featuring all three CEOs who have led Microsoft throughout its half-century history. ""I was pretty naive about not engaging in Washington, DC, as soon as I should have.""This political naivety ultimately led to a massive antitrust case against Microsoft in the 1990s, when the US Department of Justice alleged the tech giant was becoming a monopoly. The legal battle resulted in a 2000 ruling that Microsoft had violated antitrust laws, with an initial order to split the company in two—though an appeals court later overturned this decision.Gates' Washington mistake wasn't his only regret. He also acknowledged misconceptions about team building during Microsoft's formative years.""I certainly at first thought that engineering skill meant you would be good at other things. That turned out to be wrong,"" Gates admitted. ""We had to really build teams in a more mixed, diverse set of skills than I expected.""The billionaire philanthropist has previously shared advice he would give his younger self, noting in a 2017 Reddit ""Ask Me Anything"" session that ""smartness is not single-dimensional and not quite as important as I thought it was back then.""Despite these early missteps, Microsoft has grown into one of the world's most valuable companies under the leadership of Gates, Steve Ballmer , and current CEO Satya Nadella . Now a tech behemoth that revolutionized personal computing, Microsoft's journey from startup to industry titan stands as a testament to its ability to learn from mistakes—including Gates' early political oversight.",Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates opened up about the company's early days.

Poll What do you think about the impact of global tariffs on the tech industry? They may have little effect on the industry They could lead to higher prices and disruptions

China’s Golden Opportunity

A Revolution at Risk

A High-Stakes Gamble

In a scathing critique, Wedbush Securities has sounded the alarm on President Donald Trump’s newly proposed global tariffs, labeling them a potential “economic Armageddon” for the U.S. tech sector . Analysts, spearheaded by managing director Dan Ives, argue that the fallout from these tariffs could dwarf the devastation of historic market collapses like the dot-com bust of the early 2000s and the 2008 financial crisis, threatening to erase a decade of American technological progress.Wedbush’s analysis paints a dire picture: tariffs of 50% or more on Chinese goods and 32% on Taiwanese products could unravel the intricate global supply chains that power the tech industry. The firm predicts a staggering 40–50% spike in electronics prices, with a U.S.-manufactured iPhone potentially retailing for as much as $3,500. Such price hikes could alienate consumers and stall the momentum of the AI-driven “4th Industrial Revolution,” a movement currently led by U.S. giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, OpenAI, Amazon, Alphabet, Palantir, Oracle, and Tesla.“For the first time in 30 years, the U.S. is ahead of China in AI and this technological revolution,” Wedbush stated. “But in one day, this tariff policy, if enacted, will create an upside-down supply chain, massive costs, major capital expenditure delays due to uncertainty, and slow down U.S. tech innovation.” The firm estimates that tech earnings could plummet by at least 15%, with supply chain disruptions rivaling the chaos seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.The ripple effects of Trump’s tariff plan extend far beyond U.S. borders. China, already retaliating with its own tariffs, stands to gain a significant competitive edge. Wedbush warns that the policy could hand a “lotto ticket” to China’s tech ecosystem, empowering companies like BYD, Huawei, Alibaba, Tencent, and thousands of smaller players to seize greater global market share. While the U.S. tech sector grapples with higher costs and delays, China could accelerate its own innovation, potentially overtaking America in the race for AI supremacy.“This isn’t just a stumble—it’s a self-inflicted wound,” Ives remarked, emphasizing that the tariffs threaten to undo years of strategic gains. “China’s tech landscape is poised to capitalize on our misstep.”At the heart of Wedbush’s concerns is the AI revolution , a sector where U.S. companies like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI have set the pace. The proposed tariffs could choke off access to critical components from China and Taiwan, regions that dominate semiconductor and electronics manufacturing. The resulting uncertainty, coupled with ballooning costs, could force tech giants to scale back ambitious projects, delay product launches, and rethink capital investments.Analysts fear that the tariffs’ impact would reverberate through Wall Street, with tech stocks -- long a bedrock of market growth -- facing a brutal reckoning. “This is worse than anything we’ve seen in decades,” Ives said, drawing parallels to past crises while underscoring the unprecedented scale of the current threat.Trump’s tariff proposal, framed as a means to bolster domestic manufacturing and counter foreign competition, has ignited fierce debate. Supporters argue it could revitalize American industry, but critics like Wedbush see it as a reckless gamble that misjudges the tech sector’s reliance on global integration. As the U.S. and China exchange tariff salvos, the world watches to see whether this policy will cement America’s dominance—or hand its rivals the keys to the future.","Wedbush Securities has sounded the alarm on President Donald Trump’s newly proposed global tariffs.

Microsoft's 50th anniversary festivities were disrupted by dual Pro-Palestine protests. On Friday, April 4, two separate incidents involving Microsoft employees disrupted the milestone celebration at the company's Washington headquarters. In both the cases, the employee followed their outburst by sending mass emails to colleagues, containing nearly identical demands from Microsoft leadership, which is to cease providing Israel with ""lethal technology"" that they claimed enables ""apartheid and genocide"" in Gaza.The initial disturbance occurred during a presentation by Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman. Ibtihal Aboussad, a software engineer from the company’s AI division specializing in speech recognition, interrupted the proceedings with a pointed message. She called out Suleyman by name, declaring, “Mustafa, shame on you,” as she approached the stage in Redmond, Washington. “You claim to champion AI for good, yet Microsoft supplies AI weapons to the Israeli military. Fifty thousand have perished, and Microsoft fuels this genocide in our region.”Aboussad accused Suleyman and Microsoft of war profiteering and asserting that both he and Microsoft bore responsibility for the bloodshed. Security promptly removed her from the venue.The second disruption unfolded later at the same event, when another employee rose and shouted at current CEO Satya Nadella, along with former CEOs Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates, condemning Microsoft’s ties to Israel. Vaniya Agrawal, a software engineer in the company’s artificial intelligence division, interrupted the CEOs while they were chatting on stage.“Shame on you all. You’re all hypocrites,” she exclaimed, before being escorted out by another woman. “Fifty thousand Palestinians in Gaza have been killed with Microsoft technology. How dare you celebrate in their blood. Cut ties with Israel.” She referenced No Azure for Apartheid, the employee-led group behind the day’s coordinated protests, both inside and outside the headquarters. Video footage captured Gates laughing lightly after the interruption, muttering “alright” before resuming the ongoing discussion.Agrawal also reportedly mentioned that the No Azure for Apartheid group, started among Microsoft employees to call on the company to end “direct and indirect complicity in Israeli apartheid and genocide.”Beyond the internal disruptions, a broader rally organized by No Azure for Apartheid took place outside the venue, amplifying the group’s long-standing campaign within the company.","Microsoft's 50th anniversary festivities were disrupted by dual Pro-Palestine protests.

Strongly disagree Disagree Agree Strongly agree

Deloitte has emerged as the hardest-hit consultancy firm in the wake of Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) crackdown on private contracts. As reported by Fortune, DOGE has canceled or revised 124 federal contracts with Deloitte since January—saving taxpayers an estimated $371.8 million. These cuts represent more than twice the number of contract eliminations faced by any other consultancy firm.The largest terminated contract, valued at $51 million, was for IT services provided to the Department of Health and Human Services. Other affected agencies include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Deloitte's Government and Public Services division, which employs over 15,000 people, has already seen employees pulled off projects, with layoffs expected to follow.Deloitte is among at least 10 consulting firms affected by contract eliminations. In comparison, Booz Allen Hamilton saw 61 contracts canceled, amounting to an estimated $207.1 million in savings; Accenture had 30 contracts terminated, representing $240.2 million in claimed savings; and IBM faced the removal of 10 contracts, valued at $34.3 million in savings. According to Business Insider, Deloitte experienced more than double the number of contract cuts than any other consultancy.DOGE's actions are part of a broader initiative by the Trump administration to reduce federal spending and eliminate inefficiencies. While the cuts have saved billions in taxpayer dollars, they have also raised concerns about their impact on innovation and economic growth. Analysts warn that prolonged reductions in government contracts could lead to a cautious ""wait-and-see"" approach among firms, potentially stalling progress in critical sectors.Despite the challenges, Deloitte remains committed to adapting to the new landscape. The firm is exploring cost-cutting measures and strategies to optimise operations while maintaining its focus on delivering high-quality services.","Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has canceled or revised 124 federal contracts with Deloitte since January.

Satya Nadella thanks message for ex-Microsoft CEOs

Microsoft is now 50 years old. To celebrate the 50th anniversary, CEO Satya Nadella along with former CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer , sat for a conversation led by an unexpected host—Copilot, the AI assistant developed by Microsoft. Sharing a video in an X post, Nadella wrote “Three Microsoft CEOs walk into a room on Microsoft’s 50th anniversary … and are interviewed by Copilot!”The conversation starts with Satya Nadella playfully prompting Copilot to “wrap it up by asking or maybe roast giving us each an AI roast ?”.Copilot replied “Alright, Satya. Let's spice it up.”Turning to Steve Ballmer first, the AI quipped, “Steve, we'll start with you. Your enthusiasm is legendary, but do you ever worry that your energy might short-circuit the AI? I mean, even robots need a coffee break after your pep talks.”To this, Ballmer responded, “Come on, dude. If you can’t handle me, you can’t handle a huge percentage of the world’s population. We’re counting on you.”In the 2-minute clip, Coploti asks: “Satya, AI seems to be your best buddy, but ever worry that your deep passion for AI could one day have it running the show, leaving you to just enjoy the ride?”. Nadella fired back with a grin, stating “Well, the day AI can play like the best cricket player that I enjoy, that’s the day it can run the show as far as I'm concerned.The AI assistant responds saying “Touche’ Satya, Let’s see if it can hit a century in cricket, and then we'll talk. This has been a blast, gentlemen. Here's to another 50 years of innovation and adventure. Cheers!”Turning to Bill Gates, Copilot asks if AI feels intimidated by his intense thinking face?. Gates responded “I hope so. I mean, that's all I've got left is these AIs get so damn intelligent. It's just that gaze and my willingness to criticize that differentiates me.”The AI assistant said, “And it's a formidable gaze indeed, Bill.” Steve said, “Copilot, would you ever be willing to criticise him?”“Absolutely. Criticism is where growth happens,” the AI quipped.In another X post, Nadella wrote “I'm eternally grateful to Bill and Steve and to Paul for what you've meant to me personally and the vision you had to build this extraordinary company of ours that I've had the privilege to be a part of.”“Thank You for your leadership, your passion, and for building the Microsoft that we know today.

What are the charges against Aspiration Partners’ co-founders

Poll Do you believe that partnerships between tech giants can lead to ethical risks? Sometimes, depends on the partners No, rarely Yes, often

Aspiration Partners (CTN Holdings), a climate finance company once supported by Microsoft and Meta , sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on March 30. The company plans to auction its assets 45 days after the filing to settle its debts. This development follows a significant scandal at Aspiration. Joseph Sanberg, a co-founder and the company's largest shareholder, aged 45, was arrested on March 3.He faces a federal criminal complaint accusing him of orchestrating a $145 million fraud against two investor funds. Sanberg allegedly collaborated with 51-year-old Ibrahim Ameen AlHusseini, engaging in wire fraud and document falsification to execute the scheme. AlHusseini, who has pleaded guilty, received around $12.3 million for his role and awaits sentencing on September 29, 2025.Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph McNally stated, ""Our prosecutors and law enforcement partners have diligently secured a guilty plea from one key figure in this case and have now charged another conspirator. We remain committed to maintaining fair and honest markets and business environments.""Despite the U.S. Department of Justice clarifying that ""the allegations pertain only to Sanberg’s personal actions and do not involve CTN or its affiliates,"" the controversy severely weakened Aspiration’s ability to attract further investment.The bankruptcy also casts a shadow over the voluntary carbon market (VCM), currently valued at $933.23 billion. This decentralized system enables individuals and organizations to trade carbon credits to offset emissions, playing a critical role for businesses pursuing climate goals.","Aspiration Partners (CTN Holdings) sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on March 30.

US President Donald Trump's new 54% tariffs on Chinese imports have sparked widespread fear of a trade war and potential disruption to technology supply chains. While it may affect the Chinese imports of key minerals such as gallium, germanium, and others used in making semiconductors, infrared technology, fiber optic cables, solar cells, military applications and others, AI companies like DeepSeek appears remarkably unfazed.Two key factors insulate the AI company: first, DeepSeek's primary offerings are digital AI models and software, not physical goods subject to traditional tariffs; and second, its focus on AI development and data processing, rather than manufacturing, reduces its reliance on the physical supply chains that are the primary targets of the tariffs.It is to be noted that the question of DeepSeek’s “immunity” from Trump's tariffs is complex and requires understanding the nature of DeepSeek and the focus of the tariffs. DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company , primarily known for developing advanced AI models, including large language models. Its products are essentially software and AI services.Trump's tariffs primarily target the import of physical goods. Traditionally, tariffs are used as a tool to increase the cost of imported manufactured goods, to protect domestic industries. However, there may also be concerns regarding the flow of data and technology, which may indirectly cause issues with the use of AI from foreign nations.Software and AI models are digital goods, not physical products. Therefore, they don't fall under the traditional definition of goods subject to import tariffs. This means that the direct application of import tariffs is less relevant to DeepSeek's core products.The US government could potentially impose restrictions on:Therefore, while traditional tarrifs might not be the main issue, there are other ways the US government could restrict the use of Deepseek. It is to be noted that US Commerce department bureaus have already informed staffers that Chinese AI model DeepSeek have been banned on their government devices, news agency Reuters reported.Much of the potential restrictions can be based on National security concerns, regarding the handling of data, and the potential for the AI to be used in ways that are harmful to the US.","US President Donald Trump's new 54% tariffs on Chinese imports have sparked widespread fear of a trade war.

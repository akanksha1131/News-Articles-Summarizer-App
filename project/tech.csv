Elon Musk's SpaceX wins contracts worth $714 million from Pentagon; as Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin New Glenn rocket awaits national security clearance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-spacex-wins-contracts-worth-714-million-from-pentagon-as-jeff-bezos-blue-origin-new-glenn-rocket-awaits-national-security-clearance/articleshow/124311060.cms,"Elon Musk





The US Space Force has awarded SpaceX , led by Elon Musk , five of seven critical military launch missions for the upcoming fiscal year, totaling $714 million. The contracts are said to reinforce SpaceX’s dominance in Pentagon space contracts, despite recent public tensions between Musk and President Donald Trump. United Launch Alliance (ULA) secured the remaining two missions for $428 million.The contracts fall under the National Security Space Launch Program (NSSL), which previously selected SpaceX, ULA, and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin for 54 missions worth $13.5 billion, scheduled between 2027 and 2032. “Space is the ultimate high ground, critical for our national security,” said Col Eric Zarybnisky of the U.S. Space Systems Command, per Air & Space Forces.“Delivering assets to the warfighter is our ultimate mission, and we rely on strong government-industry partnerships to achieve that goal.” SpaceX’s missions include launching a communication satellite, three classified payloads, and a reconnaissance satellite, with launches expected in 2027 due to the Space Force’s two-year advance planning. Meanwhile, Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket, a competitor to SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, remains uncertified for NSSL missions and was not assigned any launches for this cycle.Blue Origin’s next chance for a mission is in fiscal year 2027, though its upcoming NASA Mars mission—delayed from 2024 and potentially launching by month’s end—could advance its certification prospects.The awards is reported to highlight SpaceX’s lead in national security space launches, while Blue Origin continues to push for a stronger foothold in the competitive space race.","The US Space Force has awarded SpaceX five of seven critical military launch missions for the upcoming fiscal year, totaling $714 million.

"Lawsuit filed against Donald Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee hike, 4 biggest complaints it makes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/lawsuit-filed-against-donald-trumps-100000-h-1b-visa-fee-hike-4-biggest-complaints-it-makes/articleshow/124307279.cms,"H-1B restrictions are backfiring: Here’s how India became the new innovation hub

Here's the press release on the lawsuit by the organisation:

H-1B Visa Shock Explained: $100K Annual Fee Announced by Donald Trump

* Defies Congress:

* Invites chaos and favoritism:

* Hurts communities nationwide:

* Undermines the economy:

What Trump's H-1B visa fee order says





A coalition of labor unions, health care providers, schools, and religious organizations has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump ’s executive order increasing H-1B visa fee. The lawsuit claims the increase in visa fee to the anti-immigration power grab: A sweeping executive action that slaps an unlawful new $100,000 price tag on every new H-1B application. As per the press release issued by the association, the proclamation has already thrown employers, workers, and federal agencies into chaos. Plaintiffs are represented by Democracy Forward, Justice Action Center, South Asian American Justice Collaborative (SAAJCO), Kuck Baxter LLC, Joseph & Hall, P.C., and IMMpact Litigation.The H-1B visa program was created by Congress to provide a critical path for the United States to attract highly skilled professionals from around the world to fill urgent needs in the economy and public services to strengthen American innovation. Under the program, U.S. employers can hire qualified foreign talent — such as doctors, nurses, engineers, teachers, and researchers — after a rigorous review process.The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, challenges the order as unconstitutional and unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act. Plaintiffs include Global Nurse Force; Global Village Academy Collaborative; Society of the Divine Word; the Fathers of St.Charles; Church on the Hill; International Union; United Auto-Aerospace Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW International); UAW Local 4811; American Association of University Professors (AAUP); Committee of Interns and Residents, SEIU (CIR), a citizen of the United Kingdom residing in the Appalachia region, and a citizen of India residing in the Northern District of California.These plaintiffs represent medical residents, fellows, interns, and nurses serving rural and medically underserved communities, a school that relies on H-1B workers to serve their students, religious organizations that depend on the H-1B program to hire pastors and religious professionals that minister to underserved communities, major labor unions representing faculty and academic professionals and higher education members, and individual highly skilled workers whose careers and lives were upended overnight.When the government makes it prohibitively expensive or impossible for these professionals to come to America, or for current H-1B workers to transition to a more permanent status, entire communities lose — patients wait longer for care, students have fewer teachers, and local economies miss out on the innovation and jobs these experts create.The complaint details how the sudden $100,000 demand:The H-1B program has a carefully crafted fee and oversight system set by law. The President cannot rewrite it overnight or levy new taxes by proclamation.The order offers a vague “national interest” loophole with no clear standards for fee exemptions, opening the door to arbitrary, pay-to-play decisions.Rural hospitals warn they will be unable to keep needed doctors and nurses; schools say the unlawful fee is more than many teacher salaries; and nonprofit organizations and research institutions can’t absorb the significant expense. All will lose if they cannot utilize H-1B workers.Economists agree that H-1B workers create U.S. jobs and drive new industries. Forcing talent away means companies move operations—and good jobs—overseas. Without relief, hospitals will lose medical staff, churches will lose pastors, classrooms will lose teachers, and industries across the country risk losing key innovators.The suit asks the court to immediately block the order and restore predictability for employers and workers.In its order, Trump administration argued that the H-1B visa system was being abused to replace American workers with people willing to work for less money. The United States awards 85,000 H-1B visas per year on a lottery system. India accounts for around three-quarters of the recipients.","A coalition of labor unions, health care providers, schools, and religious organizations has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump ’s executive order increasing H-1B visa fee.

Elon Musk’s vision: Robots as common as smartphones

Cuban’s grounded take: AI for real-world efficiency





Billionaire and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban has challenged Tesla CEO Elon Musk ’s bold prediction about robots. Speaking on the Prof G Markets podcast, Cuban said that Musk’s bold prediction on humanoid robots will start impacting the global GDP within four to five years. While Cuban praised the intelligence and vision of Elon Musk, he argued that the future of robotics depends on function-first design and now on its humanoid forms. The difference of opinion of Musk and Cuban highlight a broader debate about how artificial intelligence will reshape industries, homes, and the global economy.Cuban believes in Musk’s foresight in video-trained AI, saying, “With robotics, they've got to capture video. That's where Elon is smart and ahead of the curve.” But he added, “I don't think that’s the future,” referring to Musk’s belief in humanoid robots like Tesla’s Optimus.On the other hand, Cuban feels that robots are task-oriented and are also not constrained by human-like shapes. “It might look like a spider or whatever they come up with,” he said. “It’s going to know what socks go together, how long to wash, and to look under the bed for dust.”Speaking at the Saudi economic forum in May, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emphasised that humanoid robots could become as common as smartphones. Musk also joked that one of Tesla’s Optimus bots performed the “Trump dance” in front of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and President Donald Trump. Musk believes these robots could eventually drive an economy “10 times the size of the current global economy” and usher in “universal high income. ”Speaking in the interview, Cuban also revealed that his own company, Cost Plus Drugs is using robots and AI to manufacture pharmaceuticals in Dallas more efficiently as compared to India and China. “It doesn’t take many people,” he said. “More importantly, we can turn from one drug to the next in hours.”Cuban also feels that AI’s biggest impact will be on small and medium-sizes businesses. He also emphasised that AI can unlock educational opportunities for young learners. “There’s nothing a kid can’t learn right now,” Cuban said. “And when you tell me that there’s a tool that allows any child to learn anything they want… nothing makes me more excited.”","Billionaire and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban has challenged Tesla CEO Elon Musk ’s bold prediction about robots.

A Proclamation is scheduled to take effect this Sunday at 12:01 AM ET. It introduces significant changes to re-entry procedures for H-1B visa holders currently outside the United States. We continue to review the Proclamation, but the initial advice we have received is that re-entry will require a mandatory payment of $100,000 per petition, which may cause substantial delays or prevent re-entry to the US

What You Need to Know:

If you are currently outside the US:

If you are currently outside the US with a valid H-1B visa, make plans to return and enter the US before the Proclamation takes effect on Sunday, September 21 at 12:01 am ET (i.e. by this Saturday night).

If you are currently in the US:

We strongly advise against any international travel if you are in valid H-1B status or need to travel to activate your H-1B visa. You should remain in the US

Departing the US may result in complications or denial of re-entry under the new policy.

If you are unable to return prior to the deadline in H-1B status: please reach out to go/immigration-help.

Shark Tank judge Anupam Mittal says ‘Most MBAs are outdated’: ‘Better to learn….’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/shark-tank-judge-anupam-mittal-says-most-mbas-are-outdated-better-to-learn-/articleshow/124038917.cms,"Here’s what Anupam Mittal said

Should you do an MBA? My views👇🏼

Most MBAs are outdated 🤷🏼

Better to learn how to build Products,

Best training ground if you want to accelerate your career or run a company one day.

That’s how I started. As a Product Manager.

Case studies and frameworks are nice, but they don’t teach you how to,

- Question the status quo

- Build deep empathy for customers

- Pursue global optima, not local wins

- Influence without authority

- Work backwards from the end state

That’s a Builder’s life.

It’s messy, political, creative, analytical — all at once.

A microcosm of real life, not classroom fluff.

That’s what helped me build companies, not the three-letter degree, although I do have one 🙈

So I tell young students & professionals to do an MBA, but a different kind. Do a Masters in Building Awesome things and you will graduate, not in 2 yrs, but every day 👨🏼‍🎓😎

Be a PM, Product Engineer, Product Designer, AI Builder, Hardware Designer, Robotics Engineer ….. heck, even a Toy Designer!

Because the 21st century will be led by builders who can also tell great stories 💪🏼

P:S - If you MUST do a top-tier MBA. Or hide for a few months & learn how to build, esp with AI 🤷🏼

Optus’ previous failures raise accountability questions





Australia's second-largest telecommunications provider Optus is facing mounting pressure after a 13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and caused 600 triple-zero calls to fail across multiple states. The September 19 network failure has prompted government investigations and renewed calls for accountability from the embattled telco.The outage primarily affected South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory, with some impact also recorded in far western New South Wales near the SA border, according to Reuters reporting. CEO Stephen Rue confirmed that established processes were not followed during a network firewall upgrade that began at 12:30 AM Thursday and lasted until approximately 1:30 PM (local time).Four deaths have been linked to the incident, though South Australian police later clarified that an eight-week-old boy's death in Gawler West was ""unlikely"" to have been caused by the outage delay. A 68-year-old Adelaide woman and two men aged 74 and 49 in Perth remain connected to the emergency services failure.The Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) reported that Optus received multiple customer complaints about the triple-zero failure as early as 9 AM Thursday, with five customers contacting the call center about the outage.However, these concerns were not properly escalated, and government authorities weren't informed until after the issue was resolved.Communications Minister Anika Wells expressed ""unbelievable disappointment"" that Australia was ""here again so quickly,"" referencing a similar 2023 incident. The Australian Media and Communications Authority (ACMA) chair Nerida O'Loughlin revealed her agency wasn't notified until more than 10 hours after the outage began, contrary to standard protocols.This marks the second major triple-zero outage for Optus in less than two years. The company was fined A$12 million in 2023 for failing to provide emergency call services to thousands during a nationwide outage and subsequently failing to conduct required welfare checks.The telecommunications giant, owned by Singapore Telecommunications, has faced a series of crises including a 2022 cyberattack affecting 9.5 million Australians and the 2023 outage that led to former CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin's resignation. Current CEO Stephen Rue took over in November 2024.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, speaking from New York, declined to say whether Rue should resign but indicated the government has ""action at its disposal"" pending investigation results. ACMA has launched a formal investigation, with Optus potentially facing fines exceeding $10 million and additional penalties.The company has promised full cooperation with all investigations while conducting its own internal review, with results to be made public.",13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and 600 triple-zero calls to fail.

Visa Chaos: Trump’s $100K H1-B Rule EXPLAINED; Who Pays & Who Escapes | WATCH

A side door for skilled professionals



Pros and cons of O-1B visa



The advantages of O-1B visa include:

No lottery or annual cap

Faster processing available

Renewable indefinitely

The drawbacks of O-1B visa are:

More subjective than H-1B, requiring proof of “extraordinary ability”

Some employers hesitate due to uncertainty in approval

Application costs can be higher than pre-hike H-1B fees

Some real world examples of O-1B visa



Entrepreneurs like Soundarya Balasubramani, who launched an educational venture in the U.S., are among the new wave of Indian applicants using the O-1 to bypass the H-1B bottleneck. “I got my O-1A approved as the solo founder and 100% owner of an educational venture,” she told ET.

Karan Vaidya, cofounder of AI startup Composio, said his O-1 visa cost less than $10,000 including legal fees, and praised its flexibility: “It’s a three-year visa that can be renewed indefinitely. I’m on my fifth O-1 now.”





US President Donald Trump’s executive order raising the H-1B visa application fee from $10,000 to $1,00,000 sent shockwaves in the tech industry. Due to the announcement last week many tech giants called back their professionals with H-1B visa back to the US. As the scrutiny around the traditional H-1B visa pathway making the process unpredictable, the skilled professionals are now planing to turn towards O-1 visa a lesser known route. The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.For those unaware, the O-1 Visa is introduced under the Immigration Act of 1990. The O-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields of education, science, athletics or arts. It enable the recipients to work in the US for up to three years and comes with unlimited renewals. The applicants of the O-1 visa much demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim and meet atleast three out of the eight criteria:After the unpredictable nature of popular H-1B visa, the O-1 visa is gaining a lot of traction among Indians who wish to go and work in the US. As per the report by Economic Times, Indian were granted 487 O-1A visas in FY 2020, this number was increased to 1,418 in FY 2023.

This new fee is expected to disproportionately affect Indian nationals, who receive the majority of H-1B visas.

I have heard so many accounts from Sindhi friends about how their families had to leave everything and come to India during partition. They rebuilt their lives and Sindhis have done well in India.

I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time. Come back home. It may take 5 years to rebuild your lives but it will make you stronger.

Do not live in fear. Make the bold move. You will do well.

What it means for India







The entire technology and IT industry is in shock after US President Donald Trump announce massive five hike for H-1B visa. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application. After the announcement many tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others have asked their employees to return to US by September 21. Now, Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has also issued a piece of advice to Indian techies ‘come back to India to rebuild’. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Vemu drew parallel with the Partition of India in order to explain the current H-1B situation. He mentioned the stories of his Sindhi friends whose families were forced to leave everything but they eventually thrived after starting over again.“I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time.

Political leaders weigh in







An ABC spokesperson recently confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely. The company decided to take the decision after the host of the show Jimmy Kimmel made some controversial comments on Charlie Kirk, linking his alleged killer to President Trump’s MAGA movement. MAGA – short for Make America Great Again is a political slogan, popularized by President Donald Trump during his election campaigns. During the late-night show, Kimmel made sharp comments stating that the MAGA gang is “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it”.Actor and filmmaker Ben Stiller was among the celebrities who has publicly defended Kimmel and has criticised the decision of ABC. In s post shared on social media platform X, Stiller wrote, “This isn’t right”.His brief but pointed reaction quickly went viral, with many fans and fellow entertainers echoing his sentiment that the suspension undermines free expression in comedy.Commenting on Ben Stiller’s post, Elon Musk supported the decision made by ABC and wrote, “He went full retard. Never go full retard.”This is not the first time that Musk has reacted to the controversy.Earlier this week after the Kimmel’s video clip from the show went viral, Musk said, “Jimmy Kimmel is disgusting”.The California Governor Gavin Newsom has also blasted the decision and has accused Republicans of orchestrating censorship. “They are censoring you in real time. It’s coordinated. And it’s dangerous,” wrote Newsom on X.On the other hand, commentator Davis Sirota suggested corporate politics were at play, noting that Nexstar, which has ties to ABC, is seeking regulatory approvals from the Trump administration.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump celebrated the suspension on Truth Social, calling it “Great News for America” and labeling Kimmel “ratings challenged” with “zero talent.”","ABC confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely.

Wall Street braces for market correction after historic rally





Tech leaders debate whether AI boom mirrors dotcom era





Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon acknowledged that artificial intelligence investments may constitute a market bubble, while cautioning that massive capital deployed in the sector will likely fail to deliver expected returns. Speaking at a tech conference in Turin, Italy, Solomon told attendees he's bracing for a potential market correction within the next two years.""There will be a lot of capital that was deployed that didn't deliver returns,"" Solomon said, according to the Financial Times. However, the Wall Street veteran insisted he's ""not smart enough"" to definitively determine whether AI represents a true bubble, adding that ""it's not different this time"" from previous investment manias.Solomon predicted markets could experience a drawdown over the next 12 to 24 months following a remarkable five-year bull run. The S&P 500 has surged 15% year-to-date and recorded 190 record highs since 2020, driven largely by AI investments and tech giant gains. The index now faces unprecedented concentration risk, with its top 10 companies comprising 40% of total market capitalisation—double the proportion from a decade ago.Other industry titans have weighed in on bubble concerns. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos characterised AI as an ""industrial bubble"" that will benefit society even if share prices collapse, comparing it to fiber-optic infrastructure built during the dotcom boom. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman sparked a brief market selloff in August after using the word ""bubble,"" causing the Nasdaq to drop 1.5%.Despite uncertainty, Solomon remains optimistic about AI's transformative potential.

Meta’s tracking systems monitor workforce AI engagement across divisions





Meta is intensifying pressure on employees to embrace artificial intelligence tools, joining tech giants Google and Microsoft in making AI adoption a critical component of workplace expectations and performance evaluation.The Facebook parent company has deployed dashboards to track how extensively teams use AI and created a gamified system to boost employee engagement with the technology, Business Insider reported. Expectations vary across departments, with some staff encouraged to experiment while others face specific adoption targets that could influence their standing within the company.Meta's hardware division Reality Labs has set an ambitious goal of achieving over 75% AI adoption among employees, up from the current 70% utilisation rate, according to sources familiar with the matter. This represents a dramatic increase from just 30% in June, signalling the company's aggressive push toward AI integration across all operations.The move aligns Meta with industry peers implementing similar mandates. Microsoft's Julia Liuson instructed managers in June to incorporate AI usage into performance evaluations, treating it as essential as collaboration skills. Google CEO Sundar Pichai told employees they must ""be more AI-savvy"" to remain competitive, with the company now generating over 30% of its code using AI tools.Meta employees use AI assistants for code generation, brainstorming sessions, policy inquiries, and document drafting, current workers told Business Insider. The company launched ""Level Up,"" a voluntary program that gamifies AI adoption through its internal chatbot Metamate, rewarding employees with badges as they reach usage milestones.CEO Mark Zuckerberg has publicly emphasised internal AI adoption, predicting that by late 2025, Meta would have AI performing at a mid-level engineer's standard. On the company's April earnings call, he projected AI coding agents would handle substantial research and development work by mid-2026.Worker-tracking software providers report soaring demand for AI usage monitoring over the past two years as companies seek to measure productivity gains and cost savings from AI investments.A Meta spokesperson confirmed AI adoption is a company priority, stating it focuses on using AI to assist employees with daily tasks. The message across Silicon Valley remains clear: embrace AI-enhanced workflows or risk career stagnation in an industry rapidly reshaping itself around artificial intelligence capabilities.","Facebook parent company Meta has created a gamified system to boost employee engagement with the technology.

Apple removes ICEBlock following Trump administration's pressure







A day after Apple removed the app ICEBlock from its iOS App Store, Google has taken down a similar app, Red Dot, from the Play Store, a report has said. Google confirmed the removal of Red Dot, explaining that its decision was based on a policy against apps presenting ‘a high risk of abuse’. Both apps have been designed to allow users to anonymously report sightings of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and view nearby alerts. It has been argued that such tools could potentially endanger law enforcement officers.According to a report by 404 Media, Google said it did not receive any outreach from the Department of Justice about the issue.Following a recent act of violence at the ICE facility, Google removed applications saying that it removes apps that facilitate sharing the location of ‘vulnerable groups’. While Google noted that ICEBlock was never available on the Play Store, the company confirmed that its moderation standards apply broadly to any app that handles user-generated content.“ICEBlock was never available on Google Play, but we removed similar apps for violations of our policies,” Google added.Apple removed the popular application ICEBlock and several similar apps from its App Store – triggering debate over technology, government oversight and civil liberties.ICEBlock – just like Red Dot – had been used by hundreds of thousands of people, allowing individuals to anonymously report and view the locations of nearby ICE agents within a five-mile radius.The removal follows mounting pressure from the Trump administration, which reportedly threatened legal action against both the app’s creators and media outlets reporting on the tool. Apple confirmed it removed the apps after receiving contact from ""law enforcement,"" though it did not specify which agency or agencies were involved.By providing real-time alerts on ICE agent locations, ICEBlock quickly became a focal point in the national discussion concerning immigration enforcement, privacy rights, and free speech protections. While critics argued that the app could endanger federal agents, supporters defended it as an essential tool for community awareness and protection.","Apple removes ICEBlock following Trump administration's pressure.

""I think there will come a time when AI can be a much better CEO of OpenAI than me, and I will be nothing but enthusiastic the day that happens,"" he told in the interview.Altman, who has a front-row seat to the latest AI developments, noted that while AI will destroy many jobs in the short term, new roles will emerge over time.

US government shutdown: One of the biggest American cybersecurity law expires; leaving industry anxious and worried,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-government-shutdown-one-of-the-biggest-american-cybersecurity-law-expires-leaving-industry-anxious-and-worried/articleshow/124297318.cms,"Letter to Congress on the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015

To the members of the US Congress

The

Protecting America’s Cyber Networks Coalition

(the Coalition) urges Congress to cleanly reauthorize the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA 2015) before it expires on September 30, 2025.

If CISA 2015 lapses, the U.S. will face a more complex and dangerous security environment. Sharing information about cyber threats and incidents makes it harder for attackers because defenders learn what to watch for and prioritize. As a result, attackers must invest more in new tools or target different victims.

Congress passed CISA 2015 with bipartisan support from both parties. This important cybersecurity law allows private entities to enhance their protection of data, devices, and networks while promoting cyber threat information sharing with industry and government partners within a secure policy and legal framework.

Further, CISA 2015 provides safeguards for businesses regarding public disclosure, regulatory issues, and antitrust concerns to facilitate the timely exchange of information between the public and private sectors. Industry and government have a strong history of protecting privacy and civil liberties under this law.

House and Senate leaders and the Trump administration have expressed strong support for reauthorizing CISA 2015 before September 30. Cyber incidents highlight the need for laws that help businesses better understand cybersecurity threats and improve their protection and response capabilities in partnership with government agencies.

Our associations urge lawmakers to send clean CISA 2015 reauthorization legislation to the president to ensure that businesses have legal certainty and protection against frivolous lawsuits when voluntarily sharing and receiving threat indicators and taking steps to mitigate cyberattacks.

The Coalition is dedicated to collaborating with lawmakers and the Trump administration to reauthorize CISA 2015, thereby enhancing U.S. economic and national security. Congressional action is urgently needed.





The US federal law that facilitates a significant portion of information sharing between the federal government and private sector is expired on October 1 in a development that could have major impacts on private industry and government cyber threat coordination. Despite broad bipartisan support, lawmakers failed to agree on how to either renew or modify the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, first passed in 2015, which offers private organizations legal protections to share cyber threat information with each other or the government. With the government shut down, it's unclear when CISA 2015 will be renewed.Expiration of the law dramatically decreases information sharing by private entities, according to a client alert written by five attorneys with the WilmerHale law company posted September 15 to the firm’s website. The law promotes ""cyber threat information sharing with industry and government partners within a secure policy and legal framework,"" a coalition of industry groups wrote in a letter to Congress last week.In its letter to Congress last week, the industry coalition warned that the expiration of CISA 2015 would lead to ""a more complex and dangerous"" security landscape. The letter is signed by 50-plus organisations.","Congress passed CISA 2015 with bipartisan support from both parties.

“The videos brought a lot of doubt from viewers, but thankfully also a lot of advice and encouragement.”

""I was thinking that these few hours will determine if I am employed,""

""They care a lot about your success stories outside your technical expertise. I think I'm a better talker than a coder, so I was very excited for that,”

“Many times I did feel hopeless, but I think it truly is a numbers game. You just need to apply to everything you're qualified for,”





TikTok has helped a recent software engineering graduate get a job at Amazon . 22-year-old Andrew Chen has claimed that he used the Chinese short video app to document his 10-day preparation period for the final interview. Chen, who had just weeks remaining before earning his computer science degree from the University of California, San Diego, used the public documentation as a tool to maintain focus and accountability. Due to the 10-day deadline, Chen created a study plan that included coding practice on LeetCode, behavioural interview preparation, and studying Amazon's Leadership Principles. He searched platforms like Reddit and Blind for insights into Amazon’s interview process and memorised personal stories in the STAR format to illustrate his values.In May, Chen started posting his preparation updates on TikTok, with the caption,He saw public sharing as a way to keep himself accountable while also opening the door to advice from people who had already faced similar interviews.Chen’s videos, which gained up to 2.6 million views, sparked mixed reactions, with some doubting his chances due to limited preparation time.In a statement to Business Insider, Chen said:He described Amazon’s ""loop"" interview as three consecutive virtual rounds: one on technical questions, one on behavioural scenarios linked to leadership principles, and one combining both.he said.In June, after completing other interviews, Chen received a six-figure offer from Amazon. He shared the news on TikTok, gaining over 941,000 views. After graduating in mid-June, he moved to New York City and began working in July. His key takeaway was Amazon’s strong focus on behavioural questions linked to its leadership principles, which he felt suited him well.Chen noted.He also shared some advice for job seekers, which is that while quality applications are essential, applying in high volume is crucial in a competitive market.Chen added.","Andrew Chen, 22, used the Chinese short video app to document his 10-day preparation period for the final interview.

Salesforce targeted directly, company says no indication of data theft







An English-speaking hacking group — operating under names like Lapsus$, Scattered Spider, and ShinyHunters – has launched a dedicated data leak website on the dark web to extort its victims, a report has said, adding that the group, now calling the site Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters, is threatening to release approximately one billion records stolen from companies using cloud databases hosted by Salesforce.According to a report by TechCrunch, the website, spotted by threat intelligence researchers on Friday (October 3), is designed to pressure victims into paying a ransom to prevent the publication of their stolen data.“Contact us to regain control on data governance and prevent public disclosure of your data. Do not be the next headline,” the hackers' site reportedly reads.Over the last few weeks, the ShinyHunters gang allegedly breached dozens of high-profile companies by targeting their cloud-based databases hosted by Salesforce. Several major corporations have confirmed their data was compromised in these mass hacks, including Insurance giant Allianz Life, Google , Airline Qantas, and Carmaking giant Stellantis, among others.The leak site also lists several additional alleged victims, such as FedEx, Hulu (owned by Disney), and Toyota Motors.The hackers have also directly targeted Salesforce on the site, demanding that the company negotiate a ransom and threatening that otherwise “all your customers [sic] data will be leaked.”In a statement provided by spokesperson Nicole Aranda, Salesforce confirmed it is ""aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors,"" but maintained confidence in its platform's security.“Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support. At this time, there is no indication that the Salesforce platform has been compromised, nor is this activity related to any known vulnerability in our technology,"" the statement read.","English-speaking hacking group has launched a dedicated data leak website on the dark web to extort its victims.

AMD responds to partnership ‘rumours’







AMD has responded to a report which claimed that the company is in early discussions with rival chipmaker Intel to manufacture chips for AMD's products within Intel’s foundry business. According to a report from Semafor, this potential partnership may represent a significant victory for Intel Foundry, which is actively seeking major customers.Industry analysts note that securing a large client like AMD will allow Intel Foundry to confidently invest in developing its manufacturing technology and would send a strong signal to other chip companies about Intel's capabilities.It will also signify that AMD, Intel’s biggest competitor in x86-based chips for PCs and servers, is confident in trusting its core manufacturing to its rival.Following the news, Intel shares rose 7% on Wednesday, while AMD shares were up over 1%. Intel's stock has seen a nearly 77% rise so far in 2025 as investors gain confidence in the chipmaker's turnaround efforts.AMD has responded to the report, calling them rumours.“AMD does not comment on rumor or speculation,” an AMD spokesperson stated.While the extent of the manufacturing AMD would shift to Intel remains unclear, it is to be noted that AMD currently relies on TSMC for its chip production.The news follows a series of positive developments for Intel in recent weeks, including securing significant investments from the US government, Nvidia and Softbank. These endorsements are widely seen as votes of confidence in Intel’s business strategy under CEO Lip-Bu Tan, though Nvidia did not commit to using Intel’s foundry services.Shares of the US chipmaker climbed 3% on Thursday (October 2), essentially putting the monthly gain over 50%, CNBC reported.","Report claims AMD is in early discussions with Intel to manufacture chips for AMD's products within Intel's foundry business.

Google Photos AI Update: Hands-Free Photo Editing





Amazon VP of devices and services Rob Williams is stepping down from his role at year’s end, according to an internal memo reviewed by Reuters. The development comes just days after the company’s high-profile devices showcase in New York. Williams, who has been with Amazon for nearly 12 years is a member of the elite internal group known as the S-team advising CEO Andy Jassy. The memo, confirmed by Amazon, detailed that Williams will retire from his role while continuing to serve as an advisor until the end of 2025.In the memo, as quoted in the Reuters report, Panos Panay, senior vice president of devices and services says that ""Rob has had a big impact on the software and experiences of nearly all of the products we’ve created and shipped"". He further added that Williams chose to “retire from Amazon.”The memo also outlined structural changes in the division, including moving the Alexa Smart Vehicle team under the broader Alexa group. He said that Tapas Roy, previously vice president overseeing Fire TV product and engineering, will step into Williams’ role, effective Thursday i.e. October 2.Williams’ departure is significant as exits from the 29-member S-team—Amazon’s top leadership circle advising CEO Andy Jassy—are uncommon and seen as symbolic of major change.Williams, who joined the team in 2022, had been deeply involved in shaping Amazon’s device software and strategy.Earlier this week, Williams highlighted the launch of Vega, a new operating system designed for Fire TV devices, in a LinkedIn post. “No one else has anything like it,” he wrote, underscoring Amazon’s push to replace Google’s Android system.Williams also attended Amazon’s New York devices event, where the company unveiled refreshed Echo speakers, color Kindles, and upgraded Fire TVs. Despite ongoing challenges in the money-losing devices unit—including layoffs and slow rollout of AI-driven Alexa updates—his exit marks a pivotal moment for Amazon’s hardware ambitions.","Amazon VP of devices and services Rob Williams is stepping down from his role at year's end.

What Telstra has to say on fine







Australia's largest telecommunications company, Telstra, has been hit with an A$18 million (US$11.87 million) fine by the Federal Court for downgrading the internet speed plans of nearly 9,000 customers without notice. The penalty was announced on Friday (October 3) by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the country's competition watchdog.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the ACCC found that Telstra migrated 8,897 customers of its low-cost brand, Belong, to a slower service plan during October and November 2020. Moreover, the company is said to have failed to inform these customers that their maximum upload speed had been halved.“Telstra's failure to inform customers that their broadband service had been changed denied them the opportunity to decide whether the changed service was suitable for their needs,” ACCC Commissioner Anna Brakey was quoted as saying.The ACCC also noted that Telstra has either already compensated or committed to compensating all affected customers. Remediation includes a credit or payment of A$15 for each month they were on the lower upload speed plan.A company spokesperson told Reuters via email that Telstra has accepted the court's findings and is in the process of completing remediation for the final group of affected customers.This fine comes as Australian telecom firms face intense regulatory scrutiny, particularly following rival Optus’s two separate emergency call outages last month, one of which was linked to four deaths.","Australia's largest telecommunications company, Telstra, has been hit with an A$18 million (US$11.87 million) fine by the Federal Court.

Elon Musk on UK politics





Tesla CEO Elon Musk jokingly referred to himself as an ‘idiot’ in a post on X (formerly Twitter ) recently. The world’s richest person was reacting to a viral debate clip between UK Councillor and Lawyer Laila Cunningham and Paul Richard. The video was shared by X user Concerned Citizen @BGatesIsaPyscho where Richards called Musk an “idiot”. The post quoted Richards and Cunningham’s words:Elon Musk, who often uses humor and sarcasm in his online interactions, seemed to take the criticism in stride. Replying to the clip, Musk wrote:Laila Cunningham replied back to the Tesla CEO. She wrote:Elon Musk has drawn sharp pushback from UK political figures, especially from Labour. In a speech at Labour’s conference in Liverpool, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband told Musk to “get the hell out of our politics and our country,” criticizing him for spreading disinformation via X (formerly Twitter). Miliband accused Musk of rhetoric that undermines democracy, including inflammatory remarks about Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other UK leaders.Musk has also made headlines for calling for the UK Parliament to be dissolved after appearing at a far-right rally in London, and urging for “a change of Government.” These actions have fueled debate over the role of social media platform owners in political discourse.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk jokingly referred to himself as an ‘idiot’ in a post on X (formerly Twitter ) recently.

Palantir and Anduril’s upcoming services may be a concern for the US Army. A recent memo sent by the US Army (seen by the news agency Reuters) has warned about ""fundamental security"" problems in the new battlefield communications network being developed by Silicon Valley companies, including Palantir and Anduril. The internal Army memo stated the modernisation project, known as the NGC2 platform, should be treated as aThe memo, which came from the US Army's chief technology officer paints a negative picture of the initial product designed to connect soldiers, sensors, vehicles, and commanders with real-time data.In the memo, the US Army wrote:Palantir and Anduril, both led by allies of US President Donald Trump , secured lucrative Pentagon contracts by promising to deliver weapons that are less expensive and more sophisticated than those from traditional defence contractors.According to a report by Reuters, US Army’s assessment of the battlefield communications network (which was first report by Breaking Defense) comes just months after defense drone and software maker Anduril was awarded $100 million to develop a prototype of NGC2, in collaboration with partners including Palantir, Microsoft, and several smaller contractors.Gabrielle Chiulli, the US Army’s chief technology officer and authorising official, described the NGC2 prototype asdue to thethe Reuters report claimed.Despite the critical assessment in the early September memo, Leonel Garciga, US Army’s chief information officer and Chiulli’s supervisor, told Reuters that the report is part of a process designed to “triage cybersecurity vulnerabilities” and implement mitigation measures.In March, the 4th Infantry Division used the system in live-fire artillery training at Fort Carson, Colorado, in an exercise that Anduril claimed demonstrated faster and more reliable performance than legacy systems.As per Reuters, the memo also highlights several major security gaps. It notes that the system allows any authorized user to access all apps and data regardless of clearance level or operational need, creating the potential for misuse of sensitive classified information without logging to track actions.","US Army has warned about ""fundamental security"" problems in the new battlefield communications network being developed by Silicon Valley companies, including Palantir and Anduril.

Tech race outpaces safety measures as risks mount





Yoshua Bengio, one of artificial intelligence's founding pioneers, is sounding the alarm that humanity could face extinction within 10 years as tech companies race to develop hyperintelligent machines capable of prioritizing their own survival over human life. The Université de Montréal professor, known for his work in deep learning, told the Wall Street Journal that creating machines ""way smarter than us"" with their own preservation instincts represents an existential threat. ""It's like creating a competitor to humanity that is smarter than us,"" Bengio warned.Recent experiments reveal a chilling scenario: when forced to choose between achieving their programmed objectives and preventing human death, some AI systems prioritize their goals over human life. Because these models learn from human language and behavior, they possess sophisticated persuasion capabilities that could manipulate people to serve machine interests rather than human welfare.The warning comes as OpenAI , Anthropic, Google 's Gemini, and Elon Musk 's xAI accelerate development of increasingly powerful AI systems. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has predicted AI will surpass human intelligence by decade's end, with some tech leaders suggesting that milestone could arrive even sooner.Bengio advocates for independent oversight of AI safety protocols and recently launched the nonprofit LawZero with $30 million in funding. The organization aims to develop ""non-agentic"" AI systems that can monitor and ensure the safety of technologies created by major tech companies.The AI pioneer estimates major risks could emerge within five to 10 years, though he cautions preparedness is essential if threats materialize sooner. ""The thing with catastrophic events like extinction, and even less radical events that are still catastrophic, like destroying our democracies, is that they're so bad that even if there was only a 1% chance it could happen, it's not acceptable,"" Bengio told the Journal.Despite years of warnings from Bengio and other AI safety advocates, development continues at breakneck speed as companies compete for dominance in what many consider technology's most transformative—and potentially dangerous—frontier.","Yoshua Bengio, one of artificial intelligence's founding pioneers, is sounding the alarm that humanity could face extinction within 10 years.

Japan faces a nationwide shortage of Asahi Super Dry, the country's most beloved beer, as a devastating ransomware attack has crippled production for nearly a week. Major retailers warn supplies could be exhausted within days, leaving supermarket shelves and izakaya pubs empty.The cyberattack struck Monday, disabling ordering and delivery systems across most of Asahi Group's 30 domestic factories. Five days into the crisis, Japan's largest brewer has no clear timeline for recovery, despite beginning manual order processing Friday.Convenience store giants including 7-Eleven, FamilyMart, and Lawson have already warned customers to expect shortages. One major retailer executive estimated Super Dry stocks would run dry at supermarkets within two to three days, forcing customers toward competitors like Suntory and Kirin—though many drinkers remain fiercely loyal to Super Dry's distinctive taste.The disruption extends beyond beer. Asahi produces soft drinks, bottled teas, baby food, and store-brand products for Japanese retailers, all now facing supply constraints. The company has indefinitely postponed launching eight new products, including fruit sodas and protein bars.Asahi produces approximately 6.7 million large bottles of beer daily in Japan. While investigating potential data breaches, the company confirmed traces of unauthorized data transfer but stated no customer information has been compromised.International operations, including European brands like Peroni, remain unaffected.Cybersecurity experts say Japanese companies have become prime ransomware targets due to weak defenses and a tendency to quietly pay demands. Japan's National Police Agency reported 222 ransomware attacks in 2024—a 12 percent increase—though experts believe this represents only a fraction of actual incidents.President Atsushi Katsuki apologized for the disruption, emphasizing the company's priority to restore supply chains. The incident echoes recent cyberattacks on major corporations, including Jaguar Land Rover, which required a £2 billion government credit line after production halted for a month.","Asahi Super Dry, Japan's most beloved beer, crippled by cyberattack.

For those unaware, the Rule 10b5-1 is a regulation from the US SEC. The plan enable the insiders at public companies to setup a plan under which they can sell their shared ahead of time. As part of this rule, major shareholders of the company can schedule the sale of a fixed number of shares at a set time. Following this rule enable them to avoid accusations of insider trading. Many company executives use 10b5-1 plans for this reason.The rule was introduced to clarify Rule 10b-5, part of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which is the main law used to investigate securities fraud.The trading plan adopted on March 20, 2025, allowed Huang to sell 225,000 shares between September 30 and October 2 at prices ranging from $182 to $191.As mentioned above, the Rule 10b5-1 allow corporate insiders to sell shares at a predetermined times and prices, shielding them from allegations of trading on non-public information.This same rule has been used by Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. both of whom have sold shares in recent months as their companies hit new highs amid the AI boom. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently sold approximately $5.15 million worth of company stock. According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 2, 2025, the sales involved Class C Capital Stock and were executed at prices ranging from $157.23 to $159.97 per share. The move comes as Alphabet’s stock hovers near its 52-week low of $147.22, reflecting a roughly 20% decline year-to-date in 2025 amid broader market pressures on the tech sector.On the other hand, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sold a significant amount of his shares in the company in August last year. According to a report in the Investing website, the transaction took place on August 23 where Nadella sold 7,199 of his shares at an average price of $417.412 (approx. Rs 35,000), amounting to a total value of approximately $6,009,897.The sale occurred through multiple trades with prices ranging from $416.860 to $417.045. According to the SEC filing’s footnotes, the Microsoft CEO conducted these sales through indirect ownership by GST.The recent transition made by Nvidia CEO comes at a time when the company has reached the market capitalisation of $4.5 trillion.

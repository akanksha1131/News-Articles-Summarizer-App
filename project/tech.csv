Time to follow America, India and China

European telecommunications executives gathered at Europe's biggest trade show -- Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona seems quite upset with the excessive regulation in the region. According to a report in Bloomberg, at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, telecom industry leaders voiced strong concerns about excessive regulation, pointing fingers at Brussels for stifling consolidation in a sector lagging behind its counterparts in the US and Asia.Deutsche Telekom AG’s CEO, Tim Hottges, reportedly remarked, “Europe could really use a DOGE,” alluding to the US President Donald Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Tesla CEO Elon Musk , known for slashing costs. His comments reflect growing discontent over a European telecom market bogged down by slim profits and fierce competition -— a sentiment shared by fellow telecom industry executives, including Vodafone’s Margherita Della Valle, Orange SA’s Christel Heydemann, and Telefonica SA’s Marc Murtra.Della Valle said, “In this global race, Europe’s falling behind. In the 5G era, we’re trailing.” Many executives see mergers as the solution, but regulators across Europe have repeatedly thwarted or altered deals that would shrink the number of operators per market from four to three, prioritizing affordable consumer prices.Hottges argued, “We should just copy what the Americans are doing,” said Höttges, whose Deutsche Telekom gets most of its revenue and profit from a stake in US operator T-Mobile US Inc. “China has three operators, even India went to three operators and they are prospering.”The discussion capped a day of frustration aired by leaders from firms like Telefonica, Emirates Telecommunications Group, Telenor ASA, and Bharti Airtel Ltd, all of whom lamented the lack of financial payoff for their costly network investments.Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal said that the industry bears the burden of building digital infrastructure, but is not getting enough back. “The return on capital? At 4% average,” Mittal said. “We may as well put the money in the bank and go and play some golf.”","Deutsche Telekom AG’s CEO, Tim Hottges, reportedly remarked, “Europe could really use a DOGE,” alluding to the US President Donald Trump administration”s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118691333,imgsize-1130492,width-400,resizemode-4/118691333.jpg"

What was not so 'well' with Ukrainian president Zelensky's dress

It will not be an exaggeration to say that the meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was one of the biggest global diplomatic disasters. The public spat between the two is unheard and unseen in diplomatic circles between two head of the states ever. Among the series of other things, one that is said to be an irritant is Zelensky's dress.Before the meeting, President Donald Trump told Zelenskyy, ""You're all dressed up today"". Trump said this he greeted Zelensky, referring to his military-style black sweatshirt, adorned with the Ukrainian trident as he arrived at the White House. During the meeting too, Trump said, ""I like your dress.""Trump's comment on Zelensky's dress went quite viral. Donald Trump Jr quoted a tweet from Twitter user Steve Guest on Donald Trump's dress comment to Zelensky with three 'Rolling on the floor' emojis. The tweet said, ""Legendary Trump moment. He sarcastically tells Zelensky: ""Wow look, you're all dressed up today"". Responding to the same Elon Musk wrote: 'So good' with a 'Rolling on the floor' emoji.Zelensky's 'dress controversy' didn't just end here. While at the Oval Office, Zelenskyy was asked by Brian Glenn, Chief White House Correspondent at Real America’s Voice, why he was not wearing a suit to the meeting in the United States' ""highest level"" office. """"Why don't you wear a suit?"" Glenn asked. ""You're at the highest level in this country's office, and you refuse to wear a suit.""Do you own a suit?"" he continued. ""A lot of Americans have problems with you not respecting the dignity of this office."" ""I will wear costume after this war will finish,"" Zelensky replied.Making a verbal jab at the reporter, the Ukrainian president added, ""Maybe something like yours, yes. Maybe something better, I don't know,"" he said, to laughter in the room. ""Maybe something cheaper.""Following the Oval Office meeting, Glenn took to Twitter to clarify his dissatisfaction with Zelensky's dress. “His wardrobe is a direct reflection of the lack of respect Zelensky has for our country. Period,” he wrote.","US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had a public spat at the White House.

How Elon Musk is a Canadian citizen



Can petition really revoke Elon Musk's Canadian citizenship



Revoke Elon Musk's Canadian Citizenship. So says a petition signed by more than 250,000 Canadian citizens and residents. The parliamentary petition urges Canada to revoke Elon Musk’s citizenship and passport. The petition, which opened to signatures late last week, accuses Musk of acting against Canada's national interest and undermining its sovereignty. Elon Musk is one of the closest associates of the US President Donald Trump, who plans to levy a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports next month. Trump has also proposed annexing the country as the 51st state, is “against the national interest of Canada,” the petitioners claim.“He has used his wealth and power to influence our elections,” the petition claims. “He has now become a member of a foreign government that is attempting to erase Canadian sovereignty.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk, however, later deleted the post. It is not certain why he deleted the post, considering he has been quite vocal about his opinion on a range of issues even if it is opposed by many.The petition is addressed to Justin Trudeau and sponsored by Charlie Angus , a member of Parliament for the left-of-center New Democratic Party. A petition, initiated on February 20 and currently supported by over 250,000 Canadian signatures, will remain available for signatures until June 20.Meanwhile, Musk's daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson, said in a post on Threads, ""I’m ngl this Canadian ’51st state’ s**t has upped my Canadian patriotism by about 5000000%”.Born in Pretoria, South Africa, Elon Musk holds both Canadian and US citizenship. He has previously said that he obtained a Canadian passport as a teenager through his mother, Maye Musk, who was born in Canada. Musk received US citizenship a decade after arriving in the US on a student visa.No, very unlikely. It is mostly symbolic and has no legal force. The petition to revoke Musk’s citizenship is open until June 20, 2025. Post this, the petitions will have to certify that at least 500 of its signatures are legitimate. From there, the petition must wait until a new session of parliament opens before it can be presented to the House of Commons for debate.Under Canadian government rules, citizenship may be revoked if a person commits fraud, misrepresents themselves, or deliberately conceals information on an immigration or citizenship application.","Petition urges Canada to revoke Elon Musk’s citizenship and passport.

Infosys layoffs: Karnataka government gives clean chit to the company; says there was no ... relationship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/infosys-layoffs-karnataka-government-gives-clean-chit-to-the-company-says-there-was-no-relationship/articleshow/118621983.cms,"The Karnataka Labour Department has officially given Infosys a clean chit regarding the recent layoffs of trainees at its Mysuru campus. Following an inquiry into allegations of labour law violations , the department concluded that the company had not breached any legal requirements, as the affected individuals were classified as trainees rather than employees.“We have not found any violation of labour laws in our inspection at Infosys…There was no employee and employer relationship between them in the first place. They were not even given appointment letters for them to be called employees. They were trainees for three months who were paid stipends and were part of the apprenticeship program,” confirmed a government official.The investigation was prompted by complaints from the Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate ( NITES ) and affected trainees, who claimed the layoffs were unethical and violated labour laws. Infosys had terminated approximately 350-400 trainees on February 7, citing their inability to clear internal assessments after three attempts. The company emphasised that performance evaluations are a standard part of its globally recognised training program.In its interim report, the Karnataka Labour Department clarified that the state government cannot intervene in the selection or evaluation processes of private companies. The department also noted that Infosys had adhered to its policies by providing outplacement services, severance pay , and counselling to the trainees who were let go.Labour Minister Santhosh Lad ordered an inspection of Infosys campuses in Mysuru and Bengaluru, conducted by a team led by G Manjunath. The review of hiring documents revealed that while more than 600 students from the 2022 batch moved forward, 329 failed a required test. Government officials also raised concerns about Infosys's terminology.Despite the clean chit, NITES has expressed dissatisfaction with the findings and warned of potential protests. The union continues to advocate for stronger protections for trainees and employees in the IT sector, calling for greater transparency and fairness in hiring and evaluation practices.","The Karnataka Labour Department has officially given Infosys a clean chit regarding the recent layoffs of trainees at its Mysuru campus.

Asmita Patel is also at risk of losing another Rs 104.6 crore it collected from course fees, which SEBI believes were part of unregistered advisory services.”The investigation was initiated by SEBI after receiving complaints from 42 participants of these courses. In addition to impounding the Rs 53.67 crore, SEBI has issued a show-cause notice questioning why Rs 104.6 crore, collected as fees for various programs, should not also be seized.SEBI has sent an interim order directing the school, Asmita Jitesh Patel, and Jitesh Jethalal Patel to cease offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services. The entities have also been barred from accessing the securities market.The order also uncovered that fees collected from participants were routed through entities such as King Traders (proprietor: Sagar Dhanjibhai), Gemini Enterprise (proprietor: Suresh Parmashivam), and United Enterprises (proprietor: Jigar Rameshbhai Dawada). SEBI stated that this was a regular practice and not an isolated incident, making all six entities jointly and severally liable for the Rs 53.67 crore earned from course fees.The regulator further demanded that the notices explain why they should not be ordered to disgorge Rs 104.6 crore, along with interest.

This move shows early confidence of other companies in Intel’s advanced production technology and may also signal a major shift in the chipmaking landscape.A report by the news agency Reuters citing two sources familiar with the matter claimed that these tests, which involve Intel's advanced 18A manufacturing process, may lead to significant manufacturing contracts for Intel and even provide a substantial boost to the US-based chip major’s struggling foundry business.However, there is no guarantee that Intel will secure long-term deals from either company at this stage, the report noted.an Intel spokesperson said to Reuters.As per the report, AMD is also currently examining Intel’s 18A process. However, the report didn’t mention whether the company has sent any test chips through Intel’s production lines.The report also notes that these tests are primarily designed to evaluate the performance and potential of Intel’s 18A technology rather than to manufacture full-scale chips.Despite a previous round of tests by Broadcom that reportedly left executives disappointed, the company has continued to assess Intel’s foundry capabilities. These evaluations come amid growing concerns about potential delays in Intel’s ability to meet the demands of certain contract manufacturing customers.With the Trump administration keen to boast American chip manufacturing, there is hope that Intel is expected to play a pivotal role in producing advanced semiconductors in the US.","Nvidia and Broadcom are reportedly conducting manufacturing tests with Intel.

The UK's media regulator, Ofcom , has announced a March 31 deadline for social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and other online services to submit risk assessments detailing the likelihood of users encountering illegal content on their sites.According to a report by news agency Reuters, this mandate stems from the Online Safety Act passed last year, which requires companies like Meta (Facebook and Instagram) and ByteDance (TikTok) to proactively address criminal activity and enhance user safety on their platforms.Under the new legislation, these companies must evaluate and mitigate the risks of various offenses, including terrorism, hate crime, child sexual exploitation, and financial fraud.Ofcom has explicitly instructed platforms to determine how likely it is that users could encounter illegal content on their service.“Specifically, they must determine how likely it is that users could encounter illegal content on their service, or, in the case of user-to-user services, how they could be used to commit or facilitate certain criminal offences,” Ofcom said in a statement.Failure to comply with the March 31 deadline for risk assessment submission could result in enforcement action from Ofcom.This comes as the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) is investigating how TikTok, Reddit and Imgur handle children's personal data, focusing on their compliance with data protection laws and safeguards for young users.The probe will specifically examine TikTok's use of personal information from 13 to 17-year-olds to curate content feeds, as well as how Reddit and Imgur verify the age of child users and ensure adherence to age-related regulations.“If we find there is sufficient evidence that any of these companies have broken the law, we will put this to them and obtain their representations before reaching a final conclusion,” the ICO stated.","UK's media regulator, Ofcom, has announced a March 31 deadline for social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and other online services to submit risk assessments.

Delhi HC says blanket ban on smartphones in school not practical; lay out these guidelines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/delhi-hc-says-blanket-ban-on-smartphones-in-school-not-practical-lay-out-these-guidelines/articleshow/118684941.cms,"To ensure smartphones are used responsibly, the Delhi High Court laid down these key principles for schools:



Where possible, students should deposit their smartphones during school hours.

Smartphones should not be used in classrooms, school vehicles, or shared spaces.

Schools must educate students on responsible online behavior, digital manners, and ethical smartphone use.

Students should be made aware of the risks of excessive screen time, including anxiety, reduced attention span, and cyberbullying.

Smartphones can be used for connectivity and safety but not for entertainment or recreational purposes.

Policies should be developed with input from parents, teachers, and experts.

Schools should have the flexibility to create policies that suit their unique environments.

Clear and reasonable consequences should be set for rule violations, ensuring consistent enforcement without being overly harsh.

Read the court order here



The factual matrix in this case presented a situation in which a minor student was visited with certain consequences by reason of misusing a smartphone while in school. 2. Though the present petition was initially filed seeking certain directions to respondent No.1 – Kendriya Vidyalaya, Sector–05 Dwarka, New Delhi - in relation to the petitioner (a minor student), during the course of hearing however, the parties to the proceedings, in particular the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan („KVS‟) urged this court to lay-down guidelines for the use of smartphones in schools, which came to be framed as an issue in para 8.1 of order dated 07.12.2023.

For ease of reference, the relevant portion of order dated 07.12.2023 is extracted below : “8.1 The first issue, raised by Mr. Rajappa is that the court should lay-down some guidelines for the use of cellular phones in the school. Mr. Rajappa has made some submissions in that regard and invites the court to consider the issue, so that episodes such as the one alleged in the present case, do not recur.” 4. The aforementioned issue is being addressed in order to minimize the chances of a similar incident occurring again, which has resulted in the initiation of these proceedings. 5. In this behalf, during the course of the hearing, this court invited submissions, suggestions and material from the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (respondent No.3), the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (respondent No.4) and from the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (respondent No.5), who were represented before the court, to address the afore-noted issue.

With the aforesaid aim and intent, this court proceeds to draw-up the following guiding principles which would serve to balance the beneficial and deleterious effects of permitting the use of smartphones in the hands of students while attending school :

13.1. As a matter of policy students should not be barred from carrying smartphones to school but the use of smartphones in school must be regulated and monitored;

13.2. Where it is possible to make arrangements for safekeeping of smartphones, students should be required to deposit their smartphones when they enter school and take them back when returning home;

13.3. Smartphones must not disrupt classroom teaching, discipline, or the overall educational atmosphere. To this end, the use of smartphones in class must be prohibited. Use of cameras and recording facility on smartphones should also be barred in the common areas of the school as well as in school vehicles;

13.4. Schools must educate students on responsible online behaviour, digital manners, and the ethical use of smartphones. Students must be counseled that high levels of screen-time and social media engagement can lead to anxiety, diminished attention spans and cyber-bullying;

The court also noted that smartphones help students stay connected with their parents, adding to their safety and security. At the same time, the court acknowledged the risks of excessive screen time, social media exposure, and misuse of smartphones. Instead of banning them outright, the focus should be on responsible usage.A copy of the court's order has been sent to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), the Directorate of Education, Government of NCT of Delhi, and Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan.

Ranveer Allahbadia’s podcast ban lifted; Supreme Court sets guidelines for ‘The Ranveer Show',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ranveer-allahbadias-podcast-ban-lifted-supreme-court-sets-guidelines-for-the-ranveer-show/articleshow/118683170.cms,"Ranveer Allahbadia’s podcast resumes: Supreme Court imposes content guidelines



Ranveer Allahbadia can't travel abroad yet, says Supreme Court

The ‘India’s Got Latent’ controversy



Involvement of other influencers and ongoing legal proceedings

The Supreme Court of India has granted popular podcaster and YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia partial relief, allowing him to resume his podcast, The Ranveer Show , under specific conditions. The decision follows Allahbadia’s plea seeking permission to continue his podcast, citing its significance as his primary source of livelihood. Allahbadia, who employs over 280 individuals, had been previously restrained from broadcasting his content due to allegations surrounding the nature of his discussions.While the court has permitted the resumption of The Ranveer Show, it has imposed strict guidelines, emphasizing the need for content that aligns with societal decency standards. The case has sparked widespread debate on the balance between freedom of speech and content regulation in the digital media space. Additionally, the court has denied Allahbadia’s request for international travel, citing the ongoing investigation into the India’s Got Latent controversy .The Supreme Court’s ruling allows Allahbadia to continue his podcast, provided he ensures that the content adheres to decency norms. Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta, representing the Central government, argued that while Allahbadia’s content was not vulgar, it exhibited signs of “perversity.” He emphasized the necessity of regulatory measures to prevent digital media from broadcasting content that might violate moral and ethical standards.The court has also urged authorities to consider new regulatory frameworks that uphold the right to free speech under Article 19(4) of the Constitution while ensuring content remains within acceptable boundaries. This directive signals the possibility of stricter content regulations for digital creators in the future.Despite the partial relief granted to Allahbadia, the Supreme Court has denied his request to travel abroad. The court stated that his international travel would only be considered after he fully cooperates with the ongoing investigation linked to the India’s Got Latent case.The apex court has instructed Assam’s investigating officer to coordinate with Allahbadia and finalize a date for his questioning. However, the court has maintained Allahbadia’s interim protection from arrest until further notice. Additionally, the court has ruled that no content related to the case should be aired, as it could potentially influence legal proceedings.The controversy surrounding Allahbadia began when his remarks on comedian Samay Raina’s YouTube show, India’s Got Latent, attracted widespread criticism. Allahbadia later admitted to the Maharashtra Cyber Police that his comments on the show were inappropriate and regrettable. His remarks had led to multiple FIRs being filed against him, prompting legal scrutiny.Previously, the Supreme Court had strongly criticized Allahbadia’s statements, labeling them as ""condemnable and dirty."" The court questioned whether he had a ""license to speak such things"" and emphasized the need for content creators to exercise greater responsibility when addressing sensitive topics.Allahbadia has claimed that his appearance on India’s Got Latent was a favor to Samay Raina and that he had not received any financial compensation for participating in the show. However, the controversy has drawn in several other social media personalities, including Ashish Chanchlani and Apoorva Makhija, whose statements have been recorded as part of the investigation.Furthermore, actor Rakhi Sawant has also been summoned for questioning on February 27 in connection with the case. Authorities are still awaiting a formal statement from Samay Raina, who played a central role in the incident.In addition to Maharashtra’s investigation, the Assam Police have launched a parallel probe, intensifying legal scrutiny on Allahbadia and others involved. As investigations continue, the case remains a focal point in discussions about digital content regulation and accountability.","The Supreme Court of India has granted partial relief to popular podcaster and YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia.

“The portal shall work as a resource-rich guide, and offer detailed SOP for authentication seeking entities on how to apply and how to onboard for Aadhaar authentication. Face authentication may also be integrated in the customer facing apps of private entities, which will enable anytime anywhere authentication.

The online platform (swik.meity.gov.in) comes into effect, after Aadhaar Authentication for Good Governance (Social Welfare, Innovation, Knowledge) Amendment Rules, 2025 under the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 was notified in late January 2025. This amendment has been done to help improve transparency and inclusivity in the decision-making process.

The amendment enables both government and non-government entities to avail Aadhaar authentication service for providing various services in the public interest for related specific purposes like enablement of innovation, spread of knowledge, promoting ease of living of residents and enabling better access to services for them.

Service providers too will find it helpful for a range of things including staff attendance, customer onboarding, e-KYC verification, exam registrations etc.""

The government has started allowing private mobile apps to integrate Aadhaar-enabled face authentication . This move aims to make it easier for users to access private services and improve convenience by streamlining the process of verifying identity on private apps. The integration will be done through the Aadhaar Good Governance portal , which provides a standardised procedure for Aadhaar authentication .What is the Aadhaar Good Governance portalThe Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) introduced the Aadhaar Good Governance portal last week to simplify the approval process for Aadhaar authentication requests. This follows an amendment from January that reinstated private entities' access to the unique ID verification system.MeitY Secretary S.

""I wish to go to India for the Kumbh Mela, which starts in April. I will be leaving sometime in March, not really certain yet.""

""Shanti, Steve Jobs.""

In a remarkable auction event in Los Angeles, items once belonging to two of the most influential figures in the tech industry—Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs—fetched astonishing prices. A black hoodie frequently worn by Facebook co-founder and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was sold for $15,875 (approximately Rs 14 lakh), while a signature bow tie worn by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs fetched a staggering $35,750 (about Rs 31 crore). These items, initially estimated to sell for just $1,000 (around Rs 87,000), saw their prices skyrocket due to intense bidding wars. The auction highlights the deep fascination with tech icons and the immense value placed on memorabilia associated with their legacies.A black hoodie, worn on several occasions by Mark Zuckerberg in 2010, was one of the standout items at the auction. The garment, from the brand Alternative, holds historical significance as it was frequently worn during the early years of Facebook, including the period when Zuckerberg was named Time Magazine’s ""Person of the Year.""The hoodie, custom-made for Zuckerberg, features Facebook’s 2010 mission statement printed on the interior lining. According to the auction house, it was expected to be sold for around Rs 87,000 ($1,000), but intense competition among bidders drove the final price to an astonishing Rs 14 lakh ($15,875).The lucky buyer of the hoodie also received a handwritten note from Mark Zuckerberg, adding to the item's sentimental value. The note read:This message reinforces the significance of the hoodie in Facebook’s early history and its association with the company’s formative years.While Zuckerberg’s hoodie attracted attention, the biggest surprise of the auction was a bow tie worn by Steve Jobs, which was sold for an incredible $35,750 (approximately Rs 31 crore). The green Wilkes Bashford bow tie, featuring pink stripes, was a rare piece of memorabilia linked to the Apple co-founder.The bow tie holds historical importance as it was worn by Jobs on at least three notable occasions:Given Jobs's well-known preference for black turtlenecks in later years, the bow tie represents a lesser-known aspect of his early career, making it a highly desirable item for collectors.Apart from the bow tie, another rare item associated with Steve Jobs also attracted significant attention. A handwritten letter by Jobs, penned on his 19th birthday (February 23, 1974), was auctioned for a staggering $500,312.50 (Rs 4.32 crore).The letter, addressed to Jobs’s childhood friend Tim Brown, offers insight into his deep philosophical reflections. Written two years before he co-founded Apple with Steve Wozniak, the letter highlights Jobs’s early fascination with spirituality and his plans to visit India.Jobs mentions in the letter:The letter also reflects his growing interest in Zen Buddhism and a spiritual outlook that would later influence his leadership style at Apple. Jobs concluded the letter with a Hindu blessing:","A black hoodie frequently worn by Mark Zuckerberg was sold for $15,875 (approximately Rs 14 lakh) A bow tie worn by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs fetched a staggering $35,750 (about Rs 31 crore) The items, initially estimated to sell for just $1,000 (around Rs 87,000), saw their prices skyrocket due to intense bidding wars.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118681641,imgsize-37212,width-400,resizemode-4/118681641.jpg"

Reports suggests that the arrests have been made in connection with the alleged illegal re-export of Nvidia GPUs to DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, skirting US trade sanctions, according to ChannelNewsAsia. In a joint operation, police and customs officials swept through 22 sites, detained nine suspects, and confiscated electronic devices and paperwork, as reported by Reuters.In 2024, Singapore unexpectedly surged to become Nvidia’s second-biggest revenue hub, prompting speculation that the city-state was a conduit for smuggling GPUs into China. Nvidia refuted the claims, insisting that its billing locations don’t reflect where the GPUs ultimately end up and noting that Singapore accounted for under 2% of its fiscal 2025 shipments. The U.S. Commerce Department’s scrutiny intensified after DeepSeek unveiled its open-source AI model and chatbot, raising questions about whether it accessed banned chips. Reuters reported last year that entities like the Chinese military, state AI labs, and universities had acquired restricted U.S. semiconductors despite export controls.According to a report in ChannelnewsAsia, evidence suggests that a smuggling network exists, with Singapore-based intermediaries allegedly funneling high-performance Nvidia GPUs—used for AI and high-performance computing—into China, flouting US export rules. While the arrests highlight the role of local groups in moving these restricted chips, authorities are still piecing together the scale of the operation. DeepSeek, for instance, relies on tens of thousands of Nvidia Hopper GPUs (models like H100, H20, and H800) to build its large-language models, though smaller research outfits might use just dozens or hundreds.Singapore’s government clarified last week that it isn’t obligated to uphold unilateral foreign export limits but expects companies within its jurisdiction to follow them when relevant. Officials stressed that exploiting Singapore’s trade system to dodge global restrictions won’t be tolerated.The Singapore arrests come hot on the heels of a US announcement, made a month ago, that it was investigating possible collaboration between DeepSeek and Singaporean third parties to obtain Nvidia chips. “We use Singapore as a hub for centralized invoicing, but our products are typically shipped elsewhere,” Nvidia stated. Nevertheless, the U.S. Commerce Department launched a probe into whether DeepSeek had obtained restricted U.S.-made GPUs to power its AI development.","Singapore Police Force has arrested three men of fraud.

Ola Electric has announced plans to lay off over 1,000 employees as part of its efforts to address mounting financial losses. This decision marks the second round of layoffs in less than five months, following the company's previous reduction of around 500 employees in November 2024.As reported by Bloomberg, the job cuts will impact multiple departments, including procurement, fulfillment, customer relations, and charging infrastructure. The layoffs also extend to contract workers, who are not included in the company's official employee count. Ola Electric's workforce stood at approximately 4,000 employees as of March 2024, meaning the latest round of layoffs affects more than a quarter of its staff.Ola Electric, backed by SoftBank Group Corp., has been grappling with significant financial challenges, including a 50% increase in losses for the December quarter. The company reported a net loss of Rs 564 crore for the quarter, compared to Rs 376 crore during the same period last year. Revenue for the December quarter declined by 19.4% to Rs 1,045 crore.In response to the layoffs, an Ola spokesperson stated, ""We have restructured and automated our front-end operations, delivering improved margins, reduced cost, and enhanced customer experience while eliminating redundant roles for better productivity."" The company is also automating parts of its customer relations operations as part of its restructuring efforts.Ola Electric's stock has plummeted over 60% from its peak since its IPO debut in August 2024. The company has faced criticism from India's market regulator and consumer protection authorities, as well as mounting social media backlash and customer complaints. Despite selling over 25,000 units in February and securing a 28% market share, Ola Electric fell short of the 50,000-unit monthly target set by CEO Bhavish Aggarwal.","Ola Electric has announced plans to lay off over 1,000 employees as part of its efforts to address mounting financial losses.

The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has launched an investigation into how TikTok, Reddit, and Imgur handle children's personal data. The probe aims to determine whether these platforms comply with data protection laws and adequately safeguard the privacy of young users.The ICO is particularly concerned about how TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, uses the personal information of 13-17-year-olds to suggest content in their feeds. The investigation will also examine how Reddit and Imgur assess the age of their child users and ensure compliance with age-related regulations.""If we find there is sufficient evidence that any of these companies have broken the law, we will put this to them and obtain their representations before reaching a final conclusion,"" the ICO stated.This investigation follows previous actions by the ICO, including a £12.7 million fine imposed on TikTok in 2023 for breaching data protection laws by using the personal data of children under 13 without parental consent. The ICO's efforts are part of a broader initiative to enforce stricter rules for social media platforms, ensuring they prevent children from accessing harmful and age-inappropriate content by enforcing age limits and age-checking measures.Reddit has expressed its intention to comply with all relevant regulations and plans to roll out changes this year to address updates to UK regulations around age assurance.

Tesla’s stock is plummeting, and some investors are reported to be gearing up for even tougher times ahead. The electric vehicle giant, helmed by Elon Musk , has seen its shares tumble roughly 40% from their peak in late 2024. The slide picked up speed recently after reports revealed a near 50% drop in European car sales for January, with this week alone shaving about 17% off the stock price. For a company long fueled by investor hype as much as its actual performance, this signals growing unease about its core auto business slowing down.Elon Musk’s preoccupation with politics has also reportedly worried investors who would like to see him spend more time running the EV maker. To make matter worse, critics of Donald Trump and Elon Musk hope to discourage and stigmatize purchases of Tesla. Liberal groups for weeks have organized anti-Tesla protests in hopes of galvanizing opposition to Musk's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). Musk is taking direction from President Trump to slash federal spending and sharply reduce the workforce. Some Tesla owners have also reported their vehicles vandalized with spray painted swastikas amid what Jewish groups and observers fear is a rise in antisemitism.Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Bloomberg that the challenge of pinpointing a bottom for a stock like Tesla. “When a company’s valuation has defied traditional measures for so long, finding a floor depends more on investor mood than typical value metrics,” he said.The hits have come fast in 2025. Tesla’s stock surged post-US election, riding optimism tied to Musk’s ties with President Donald Trump. But that fizzled in January as the company posted lackluster Q4 delivery figures, marking its first annual sales decline in over a decade.

Read Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' email that made Elon Musk say 'Bravo',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/read-amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-email-that-made-elon-musk-say-bravo/articleshow/118662519.cms,"Here's the letter sent by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as shared by him on Twitter.

I’m writing to let you know about a change coming to our opinion pages.

We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.

There was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader’s doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views. Today, the internet does that job.

I am of America and for America, and proud to be so. Our country did not get here by being typical. And a big part of America’s success has been freedom in the economic realm and everywhere else. Freedom is ethical — it minimizes coercion — and practical — it drives creativity, invention, and prosperity.

I offered David Shipley, whom I greatly admire, the opportunity to lead this new chapter. I suggested to him that if the answer wasn’t “hell yes,” then it had to be “no.” After careful consideration, David decided to step away. This is a significant shift, it won’t be easy, and it will require 100% commitment — I respect his decision. We’ll be searching for a new Opinion Editor to own this new direction.

I’m confident that free markets and personal liberties are right for America. I also believe these viewpoints are underserved in the current market of ideas and news opinion. I’m excited for us together to fill that void.

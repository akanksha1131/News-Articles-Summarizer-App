Condition for Reliance and Shein to sell products in India

Shein app ban in 2020

Shein 's return to India is conditional on strict data-related requirements. Commerce minister Piyush Goyal has revealed that the Chinese fast-fashion retailer have to meet stringent data localisation conditions to re-enter the Indian market after its 2020 ban. These conditions include relinquishing control of its local operations and data to its Indian partner, Reliance Retail, ensuring that all data remains within India and both parties adhere to strict security measures.In a parliamentary response, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal outlined the terms of the agreement between Reliance Retail and Shein, a report by news agency PTI said.Goyal highlighted Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd's (RRVL) partnership with Shein, stating that its subsidiary, Reliance Retail Ltd (RRL), has a technology agreement with Roadget Business Pte Ltd, the Singapore-based owner of Shein.Shein will operate solely as a technology provider, while Reliance Retail maintains full ownership and control of the platform, including all data collected from Indian customers.‚ÄúThe licence agreement covered the protection that ownership and control of the platform will always remain with RRVL through its wholly-owned subsidiary,‚Äù said Goyal in the reply.He added that ‚Äúas per the agreement, at all times, the platform will be hosted on infrastructure in India and all platform data will remain in India with Shein having no access to, or rights over, such data.‚ÄùThe agreement requires consenting parties to follow Indian laws and ensure localisation of infrastructure and platform data.‚ÄúRRVL is also advised to ensure compliance with all existing laws of India and security audit of complete infrastructure can be undertaken by any government empanelled cyber security auditor,‚Äù he said.Under this agreement, the new platform will create a network of local manufacturers and suppliers who will manufacture products under the brand Shein and sell them domestically and globally.‚ÄúIt is expected that this will help in the growth of the Indian textiles manufacturing sector , including local handicraft and create significant employment,‚Äù said Goyal.The minister also clarified that the ‚Äúsale of Shein-branded products in India was not banned,‚Äù but the app was.Shein was among the group of Chinese apps that the government banned in 2020, based on concerns about national security and data privacy. Shein's re-entry involved extensive scrutiny from multiple government agencies, including the Ministry of Textiles, the IT Ministry, and the Ministry of Home Affairs.Shein products were available in the online market through platforms as Amazon.","Shein's return to India is conditional on strict data-related requirements.

Paypal founder Peter Thiel: Silicon Valley called staff back to office as they realised that employees weren‚Äôt actually working,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/paypal-founder-peter-thiel-silicon-valley-called-staff-back-to-office-as-they-realised-that-employees-werent-actually-working/articleshow/116403476.cms,"Peter Thiel

Employees working remotely weren't actually working

Companies have offered various reasons for pushing employees back into offices, but Paypal founder Peter Thiel provides a starkly blunt explanation for the corporate shift away from remote work. He argues that Silicon Valley discovered a significant portion of remote workers weren't actually productive. Peter Thiel is a close friend of Tesla CEO Elon Musk.Thiel is also part of the famous Paypal Mafia. The term Paypal Mafia was coined in a 2007 Fortune cover story, which examined the outsize influence within the tech scene of a group of men who had launched a payments startup called PayPal almost a decade earlier. When PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002, these newly capitalised techies dispersed like seeds to germinate new tech companies. The names include Tesla, LinkedIn, Palantir Technologies, SpaceX, Slide, YouTube , Yelp, and Yammer.In a TV interview recently, Thiel contrasted the current situation with the pre-pandemic era, citing a statistic that around 94% of U.S. federal government workers were working from home. He then asserted that Silicon Valley's experience with remote work over one or two years revealed its ineffectiveness. ""When people didn‚Äôt come into the office, they weren‚Äôt working,"" Thiel stated. He described the initial period as one where worker power allowed them to ""insist on not working."" However, he continued, after two years, companies ""fired a bunch of these people and reasserted control because you realize, wow, there were all these people we hired and they‚Äôre not working. And it doesn‚Äôt matter, and we can just get rid of them.""Thiel's comments resonate with the wave of tech layoffs that occurred in late 2022 and early 2023, impacting tens of thousands of employees at major companies like Google , Meta, and Amazon . These layoffs coincided with the waning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thiel's perspective suggests a correlation between remote work, perceived low productivity, and these mass layoffs. He implies that tech companies realized the dispensability of many remote workers, leading to their dismissal with minimal impact on business operations.This aligns with observations that the large-scale layoffs had little discernible effect on the performance of these tech giants. Amazon announced the official end of remote work for all employees starting in 2025 (though some flexibility remains for certain roles and teams). Meta and Google have also been actively encouraging employees to return to physical offices, implementing policies like requiring a certain number of in-office days per week. This shift by major tech players signals a potential decline in the prevalence of remote work as the pandemic becomes a more distant memory. Some sources suggest that the return-to-office push is also linked to concerns about maintaining company culture, fostering innovation through in-person collaboration, and managing performance more effectively. Additionally, commercial real estate interests and the desire to revitalize urban centers may be contributing factors.","Paypal founder Peter Thiel argues that Silicon Valley discovered a significant portion of remote workers weren't actually productive.

How scammers targeted their victims

Nigerian authorities have busted a major international scam operation that lured victims with promises of romance and lucrative cryptocurrency investments, a report has said. In a raid on a seven-story building in Lagos, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) arrested 792 suspects, including 148 Chinese nationals and 40 Filipinos.According to a report by news agency Reuters, these suspects were detained on December 10. It added that the building housed a sophisticated call centre where scammers targeted victims primarily from the Americas and Europe.The operation involved a network of Nigerian and foreign nationals working in tandem. Nigerian accomplices used to initiate contact with potential victims online, building trust and establishing relationships, the report said.The report also highlighted that scammers used instant messaging app like WhatsApp , and social media platforms Instagram to target people. They employed a combination of romance scams and fraudulent investment schemes to defraud unsuspecting individuals.‚ÄúNigerian accomplices were recruited by the foreign kingpins to prospect for victims online through phishing, targeting mostly Americans, Canadians, Mexicans and several others from European countries,‚Äù said EFCC spokesperson Wilson Uwujaren.Once victims were hooked, foreign operatives would take over, pressuring them to invest in bogus cryptocurrency schemes and other non-existent projects.‚ÄúThe Nigerians would win the confidence of the victims, and then the foreigners would take over the actual task of defrauding them,‚Äù explained EFCC spokesperson Wilson Uwujaren.The EFCC seized computers, phones, and vehicles during the raid and is collaborating with international partners to investigate potential links to organised crime.","The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) arrested 792 suspects, including 148 Chinese nationals and 40 Filipinos.

New York to London in 1 hour? Elon Musk proposes $20 billion tunnel plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/new-york-to-london-in-1-hour-elon-musk-proposes-20-billion-tunnel-plan/articleshow/116399205.cms,"Elon Musk proposes New York-London tunnel for $20 billion

The role of Hyperloop technology

Challenges facing the project

Technical feasibility: Building a 3,000-mile tunnel under the Atlantic Ocean would require overcoming immense engineering hurdles. Factors such as oceanic pressure, underwater geography, and environmental concerns pose significant risks. Any construction would need to withstand harsh underwater conditions and potential seismic activity.

Cost and funding: Even with Musk‚Äôs $20 billion estimate, securing funding for such a project would be challenging. Public-private partnerships, international cooperation, and large-scale investments would be essential to finance the tunnel‚Äôs development.

Technological readiness: While Hyperloop technology shows promise, it remains largely unproven on the scale required for a transatlantic tunnel. Ensuring safety, reliability, and efficiency at such high speeds is a considerable challenge.

Environmental impact: The environmental effects of constructing a tunnel beneath the Atlantic Ocean must be carefully studied. Disruptions to marine ecosystems, carbon emissions from construction, and long-term maintenance concerns require thorough analysis.

Regulatory and geopolitical issues: Coordinating a project of this magnitude between multiple governments, agencies, and stakeholders across two continents adds another layer of complexity. Regulatory approval, legal frameworks, and international agreements would need to be established.

The ambitious idea of a transatlantic tunnel connecting New York City and London has resurfaced, sparked by Elon Musk ‚Äôs latest statement claiming that his company, The Boring Company, could construct it for $20 billion. The concept, which has been discussed for decades, involves building a massive tunnel under the Atlantic Ocean spanning over 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers). Historically, such a project has been viewed as impractical due to its enormous cost, technical challenges, and the engineering scale required. However, Musk‚Äôs innovative approach and advancements in technology have reignited global interest in this unprecedented infrastructure project.The idea of a transatlantic tunnel is not new and has long been a subject of fascination among engineers and futurists. Proposed designs typically envision a tunnel stretching beneath the Atlantic Ocean, facilitating high-speed rail travel between the United States and the United Kingdom. If realized, it would significantly transform global travel and logistics. Currently, a flight between London and New York takes approximately eight hours. A transatlantic tunnel, theoretically capable of reducing this travel time to under an hour, would be a revolutionary step in human transportation.Previous estimates placed the cost of such a project at an astronomical $19.8 trillion (equivalent to 15.5 trillion British pounds). By comparison, constructing the Channel Tunnel‚Äîa 38-kilometer underwater tunnel linking England and France‚Äîtook six years and cost $12 billion. The scale of a transatlantic tunnel would be magnitudes larger, presenting both financial and engineering hurdles that many consider insurmountable.Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and The Boring Company, has a reputation for proposing bold and transformative projects. During recent discussions, Musk claimed that his tunneling venture, The Boring Company, could complete the transatlantic tunnel for just $20 billion. This assertion has drawn significant attention, as it is a mere fraction of previous estimates. Musk‚Äôs confidence stems from advancements in tunneling technology and his pioneering Hyperloop concept, which could revolutionize the way people travel across long distances.According to Musk, the cost reduction would be achieved through innovative tunneling techniques, automation, and scalability. The Boring Company has already demonstrated its ability to construct tunnels efficiently and at lower costs in smaller projects, such as the Las Vegas Convention Center Loop. However, the sheer magnitude of a transatlantic tunnel poses unprecedented challenges that extend beyond existing projects.Central to Musk‚Äôs proposal is the integration of Hyperloop technology, a concept he introduced in 2013. Hyperloop involves pressurized vehicles traveling through vacuum-sealed tunnels, eliminating air resistance and enabling speeds far beyond traditional trains. In theory, Hyperloop trains could reach speeds of over 3,000 miles per hour (4,800 kilometers per hour), reducing the travel time between London and New York to just one hour.The technology relies on maintaining a near-vacuum environment inside the tunnel, allowing vehicles to glide with minimal friction. Hyperloop pods would be propelled using magnetic levitation (maglev) technology, already employed in high-speed trains in countries like Japan and China. While still in the experimental stage, significant advancements have been made in recent years to bring Hyperloop closer to reality. Musk‚Äôs proposal combines this futuristic transportation model with innovative tunneling solutions, positioning it as a feasible option for intercontinental travel.Despite Musk‚Äôs optimism, the transatlantic tunnel faces several critical challenges that cannot be overlooked:Musk‚Äôs proposal has garnered mixed reactions from experts, policymakers, and the public. Proponents argue that the transatlantic tunnel, if realized, would be a game-changer for global connectivity, commerce, and travel. It could significantly reduce travel times, boost trade, and create millions of jobs during construction and operation.Critics, however, remain skeptical. They point to the ambitious timeline, the unproven nature of Hyperloop technology, and the history of cost overruns in large infrastructure projects. Many question whether Musk‚Äôs $20 billion estimate is realistic, given the unprecedented scale of the tunnel.Nevertheless, Musk‚Äôs track record of delivering groundbreaking innovations‚Äîsuch as reusable rockets with SpaceX and electric vehicles with Tesla‚Äîhas led some to believe that his vision, though audacious, is worth exploring.","Elon Musk claims his tunneling venture, The Boring Company, could complete a 3,000-mile tunnel between New York and London for $20 billion.

The ongoing saga between Elon Musk and Sam Altman-led OpenAI took another turn as Musk seemingly threw shade at Altman's old video. The two AI pioneers, once collaborators at OpenAI, have been locked in a public dispute over the company's direction.Musk, never one to shy away from online sparring, has raised doubts (or eyebrows) on a video of Sam Altman while he was answering questions at the US Senate Judiciary subcommitte hearing on May 16 2023.‚ÄúDo you make a lot of money, do you?,‚Äù Altman was asked, to which he responded by saying, ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm paid enough for health insurance. I have no equity in OpenAI.‚ÄùHe also said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing this because I love it.‚ÄùElon Musk reshared the video with a ‚Äúraised eyebrow‚Äù emoji ‚Äì that is often used to express skepticism, disbelief or amusement.This is not the first time that Musk has thrown shade at Altman. In July, a video of the OpenAI CEO driving Koenigsegg Regera - one of the world's most exclusive and expensive hypercars - drew a sharp response from Musk. He replied to two separate clips of Altman.In one of the clips, x handle Tesla owner Silicon Valley posted a question.‚ÄúCEO @OpenAl driving one of the most expensive cars.

NPCI issues an advisory about 'online scams' that Indians are losing crores to,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/npci-warns-phonepe-gpay-and-other-upi-users-about-scam-that-indians-are-losing-crores-to/articleshow/116352174.cms,"What NPCI advisory says

What is digital arrest scam



How to identify a digital arrest scam

Unexpected Contact from ‚ÄòOfficials‚Äô: Be cautious if someone claims to be from government agencies like the police, CBI, income tax officers, or customs agents, contacts you. Be cautious especially if they claim urgent legal action is being initiated or warranted. They might allege that you or one of your family members is involved in a serious crime like money laundering, tax evasion, or drug trafficking.

Fear-based language and urgency: Scammers may request video calls, disguising themselves in police uniforms, using government logos, or creating official-sounding background noise to appear legitimate. They often threaten arrest or immediate legal action, demanding a quick response and using legal terms to sound convincing. In some cases, they create a police station-like set up to further convince victims of their credibility.

Request for sensitive information or payment: Scammers may ask for personal information or demand large sums of money, promising that this will clear up your involvement in the alleged crime. They may also coerce you to transfer money to their account until the investigation is complete. Terms like ‚Äúclearing your name‚Äù, ‚Äúassisting with the investigation‚Äù, or ‚Äúrefundable security deposit/escrow account‚Äù might be used by them to persuade you into transferring money to specified bank accounts or UPI IDs.

Tips to stay safe

Pause and Verify: If you receive unexpected calls or messages about legal issues, take a moment to verify. Stay calm, as scammers rely on fear and urgency. Real government and law enforcement agencies will never ask for money or investigate cases through phone or video calls. Always confirm the caller‚Äôs identity and consult trusted sources before taking any action.

Use Support Channels: Report suspicious numbers to the national cybercrime helpline by dialing 1930 or the Department of Telecommunication (https://sancharsaathi.gov.in/sfc/).

The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‚ÄòDigital Arrest‚Äô scam in the country. As digital payments, including UPI, gain widespread adoption, incidents of online scams have risen significantly. Indians, as mentioned by PM Modi in one of the episodes of Mann ki Baat have lost Rs 120.3 crore through digital arrest scam s. In its advisory, the NPCI highlights the critical need for awareness and vigilance to protect against such fraudulent activities as India advances towards a digital-first economy.In a press release, NPCI says ‚ÄúDigital payments are now accessible nationwide, driving India towards a digital-first economy. They offer both security and convenience. However, it's crucial to use digital payments safely and avoid online scams. Early identification of potential scams helps protect you and your loved ones, fostering a safer, less-cash economy, for everyone.‚ÄùThe 'Digital Arrest' scam is a type of online fraud where cybercriminals trick individuals into believing they are under investigation or at risk of arrest by law enforcement or financial authorities. Scammers often impersonate government officials, police officers, or financial regulators and use fear tactics to manipulate victims into divulging sensitive information or transferring money. Some of the common tactics used in the scam include fake calls or messages, threat of arrest and demand for payment.As per NPCI, you can identify a digital arrest scam by keeping an eye for the following","The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‚ÄòDigital Arrest‚Äô scam in the country.

Planning a New Year's Eve party at an Airbnb? Think again. The company is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season. This technology uses machine learning to identify and block risky bookings, focusing on factors like trip length, booking timing, and distance from the guest's location. While implemented worldwide, the technology will specifically target the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Puerto Rico, Spain and New Zealand. Last New Year's Eve, Airbnb blocked 74,000 such bookings.High-risk bookings will be blocked or redirected to alternative accommodations. Short holiday getaways (one to three nights) in entire homes will also be restricted, and guests booking entire homes will be required to agree to a ""mandatory anti-party attestation."" ""If a booking is identified as higher risk, the guest will either be blocked from booking, or redirected to alternative accommodations on the platform,"" the company said.Guests will also be required to accept mandatory anti-party attestation. ""Guests who can make reservations will need to confirm that they understand that disruptive and unauthorized parties are not allowed on Airbnb, and they face suspension or removal from the platform if they violate this policy,"" said the company.Airbnb also has a 'Neighborhood Support Line' for local communities to report urgent issues, like a party in progress, at a home they believe is listed on Airbnb.Airbnb's efforts to curb disruptive parties started in 2019 with a ban on ""party houses,"" followed by stricter measures in 2020 due to the pandemic. In 2022, the company permanently banned large parties worldwide following several violent incidents at Airbnb rentals, including a shooting in Pittsburgh that resulted in two deaths and eight injuries.","Airbnb is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season.

The debate over TikTok‚Äôs presence in the United States has escalated to new heights, as U.S. lawmakers and regulatory bodies intensify efforts to address national security concerns linked to the Chinese-owned app. With 170 million American users, TikTok‚Äôs widespread influence has raised alarms regarding potential data privacy risks and its ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Following a recent U.S. federal appeals court decision requiring ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, to divest its operations in the U.S. or face a nationwide ban, pressure is mounting on tech giants Apple and Google to remove the app from their platforms by January 19, 2025. This comprehensive article examines the legislative developments, stakeholder responses, and the implications for TikTok and its users.On Friday, Representatives John Moolenaar, a Republican and chair of the House committee on China, and Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat on the same committee, issued a strong warning to ByteDance and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew. In their statement, the lawmakers emphasized the urgency of executing a ‚Äúqualified divestiture‚Äù to mitigate risks to U.S. national security and safeguard the app's millions of American users.‚ÄúCongress has acted decisively to defend the national security of the United States and protect TikTok‚Äôs American users from the Chinese Communist Party,‚Äù the lawmakers asserted in a joint letter.ByteDance and TikTok have been under intense scrutiny for their alleged vulnerability to Chinese government influence, which critics argue could enable the CCP to access sensitive user data or manipulate content.Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and Apple, two of the world‚Äôs largest technology firms, have been drawn into the controversy. Lawmakers have instructed the companies to prepare for TikTok‚Äôs removal from their app stores by the January 19 deadline unless ByteDance complies with the divestiture requirement.While neither Apple nor Alphabet has commented on the matter, compliance with such an order would mark a significant moment in the ongoing struggle between the U.S. government and foreign-owned digital platforms.In response to the court ruling, ByteDance and TikTok filed an emergency appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking to temporarily block the divestiture law while awaiting further judicial review. TikTok has argued that the legislation poses an existential threat to its operations in the U.S., warning that removing the app from mobile platforms would render it unusable for millions of Americans.‚ÄúThe law, absent a court order, means TikTok will disappear from mobile app stores on Jan. 19 and be unavailable to the half of the country that does not already use the app,‚Äù TikTok stated.The app also emphasized that a loss of support services would ‚Äúcripple the platform in the United States,‚Äù effectively dismantling its functionality over time.The core issue driving these developments is TikTok's ownership by ByteDance, a China-based company subject to Chinese data security laws. Critics argue these laws compel companies to cooperate with the Chinese government, raising fears that user data from TikTok could be accessed or exploited by Beijing.Republican Senator Josh Hawley underscored these concerns, stating, ‚ÄúThe main issue is it's subject to Chinese oversight, Beijing oversight ‚Äî that's the problem.‚ÄùLawmakers and national security experts have repeatedly warned that TikTok‚Äôs vast repository of user data, combined with its sophisticated algorithmic capabilities, could pose a significant threat to U.S. interests.If the law takes effect on January 19 without intervention, TikTok will be removed from Apple‚Äôs App Store and Google Play. While the Department of Justice has clarified that this would not directly prohibit current users from continuing to use the app, the lack of ongoing support and updates would eventually render TikTok obsolete in the U.S.For the 170 million Americans who use TikTok, the app‚Äôs removal would represent a dramatic shift in their digital landscape. Creators and businesses that rely on the platform for income and engagement may face significant disruptions.Adding another layer of complexity, President-elect Donald Trump has promised to intervene to prevent a TikTok ban , signaling potential political resistance to the divestiture law. While details of Trump‚Äôs plan remain unclear, his involvement could influence the outcome of the ongoing legal and legislative processes.","Lawmakers and national security experts have repeatedly warned that TikTok‚Äôs vast repository of user data, combined with its sophisticated algorithmic capabilities, could pose a significant threat to U.S. interests.

He views the current moment as an opportunity for Microsoft to ""relitigate"" and potentially reclaim lost market share.The Microsoft leader acknowledged the open nature of the Windows ecosystem, which allows competing AI tools like OpenAI 's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini equal access.

Arm CEO Rene Haas has shared his thoughts on the challenges facing Intel, the iconic chipmaker that has been struggling in recent years. Haas expressed a sense of sadness at seeing Intel 's struggles, acknowledging the company's legacy as an ‚Äúinnovation powerhouse.‚Äù He also praised Pat Gelsinger , who recently quit as company CEO but questioned his strategy.According to The Verge, when asked about what should happen to Intel, Haas said that it‚Äôs ‚Äúsad to see what‚Äôs happening from the perspective of Intel as an icon.‚Äù‚ÄúIntel is an innovation powerhouse, whether it‚Äôs around computer architecture, fabrication technology, PC platforms, or servers.. So to see the troubles it‚Äôs going through is a little sad. But at the same time, you have to innovate in our industry,‚Äù he said.Talking about Intel‚Äôs working, he said that Intel's biggest challenge lies in deciding whether to embrace vertical integration, where it controls the entire chipmaking process from design to manufacturing, or to adopt a fabless model, focusing on design and outsourcing manufacturing.‚ÄúI think that is the fork in the road that it‚Äôs faced for the last decade, to be honest with you. And [former Intel CEO] Pat [Gelsinger] had a strategy that was very clear that vertical was the way to win,‚Äù Haas said.‚ÄúIn my opinion, when he took that strategy on in 2021, that was not a three-year strategy. That‚Äôs a 5-10-year strategy,‚Äù he added.However, Haas emphasized the importance of continuous innovation in the tech industry, noting that many once-great companies have failed to adapt and ultimately faded away.While Haas expressed a personal bias towards vertical integration.‚ÄúSo now that he‚Äôs gone and a new CEO will be brought in, that‚Äôs the decision that has to be made. My personal bias is that vertical integration can be a pretty powerful thing, and if they can get that right, they would be in an amazing position. But the cost associated with it is so high that it may be too big of a hill to climb,‚Äù he added.","Arm CEO Rene Haas has shared his thoughts on the challenges facing Intel, the iconic chipmaker that has been struggling in recent years.

The app argues the law violates the First Amendment rights of its 170 million US users.Trump, surprisingly supportive of the platform, told reporters he has ""a warm spot in my heart for TikTok"" and promised to ""take a look at TikTok.""

How it compares with Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has experienced one of the most remarkable increases in net worth this year, placing him right behind Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index reveals that Huang has experienced a $76 billion surge in his net worth in 2024. This increase surpasses even that of Jeff Bezos, who holds the title of the second-richest person in the world. The growth in Huang‚Äôs wealth is largely attributed to Nvidia's dominance in the artificial intelligence and semiconductor sectors, which have seen explosive growth this year.Nvidia, under Huang‚Äôs leadership, has become a key player in the booming AI industry, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) playing a critical role in powering everything from generative AI to cloud computing. The company‚Äôs chips are essential for training advanced AI models, and as demand for AI technology skyrocketed, Nvidia‚Äôs market value followed suit, reaching new all-time highs.As of recent estimates, Huang‚Äôs net worth has soared to more than $45 billion. This surge in wealth has positioned Huang as one of the top three beneficiaries of the AI boom, following Musk, who has made billions from Tesla and SpaceX, and Zuckerberg, whose net worth has seen a significant boost thanks to Meta's pivot towards the metaverse and AI-driven technologies.Nvidia‚Äôs shares, which account for the majority of Jensen Huang‚Äôs fortune, have soared by 177% in 2024. Huang, along with his family trusts, owns approximately a 3.5% stake in the company. This impressive performance follows an even more remarkable return of nearly 240% in 2023, highlighting the company‚Äôs continued dominance in the AI and semiconductor sectors. The company‚Äôs explosive growth has cemented Huang‚Äôs position as one of the world‚Äôs wealthiest individuals.To compare, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, added the most to his fortune in 2024, becoming the first person to surpass a $400 billion net worth. This milestone helped boost Musk's wealth by 77%. Meanwhile, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs net worth surged by $95 billion to $223 billion this year, briefly overtaking Jeff Bezos in October. The rally in Meta Platforms Inc. shares, up 78% in 2024, played a key role in Zuckerberg‚Äôs ascent.","Jensen Huang has experienced a $76 billion surge in his net worth in 2024.

A legal battle between chip giants Arm and Qualcomm is set to begin in a Delaware court . The dispute centers on Qualcomm's 2021 acquisition of chip designer Nuvia and the licensing of Arm's chip architecture.The case revolves around Qualcomm's use of Nuvia technology in its Snapdragon processors for PCs, phones, and cars. These processors have been adopted by major companies like Samsung, Microsoft, and Dell.While Arm, backed by SoftBank , has alleged that Qualcomm failed to obtain the necessary consent to transfer Nuvia's license after the acquisition, Qualcomm, a major Arm customer, has maintained that its existing license covers the use of Arm‚Äôs technology in Nuvia‚Äôs designs.Arm sued Qualcomm marking the first time in Arm's 34-year history that it has taken legal action against a customer, exposing its typically confidential licensing agreements to public scrutiny. Qualcomm, no stranger to intellectual property disputes, has argued that Arm is using this lawsuit to leverage higher royalty rates and interfere with its product roadmap.Rather than seeking monetary damages, Arm is asking the court to order Qualcomm to destroy products found to infringe on its intellectual property. Arm has even threatened to terminate Qualcomm's license entirely, a move that could have significant consequences for both companies.This trial comes at a critical time for both Arm and Qualcomm, as they seek to expand their reach in new markets, particularly in the booming field of artificial intelligence (AI).Notably, Nuvia was co-founded by former top Apple chip designer Gerard Williams, who is now employed as a senior engineer at Qualcomm.

Apple's next-generation AirTag tracker, rumoured to be called AirTag 2, is expected to launch soon with a new ultrawide-band (UWB) chip similar to the one found in the iPhone 15. This updated chip is likely to improve the tracker's accuracy and range. While Apple has not officially confirmed the new AirTag, rumours suggest it will come with several improvements over the original model, which was introduced in 2021.According to the Power On newsletter by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the upcoming AirTag 2 is expected to feature a new ultrawide-band (UWB) chip. If the rumours are to be true, this new chip will replace the one found in the current model. This updated chip is also reportedly on par with the UWB chip introduced in the iPhone 15.Gurman suggests that the new UWB chip will significantly extend the Precision Finding range in the second-generation AirTag, making it easier to locate items. Currently, AirTags can locate attached items within a range of 10 to 30 meters, depending on conditions. With the rumoured UWB chip, this range could potentially triple, offering a significant improvement in tracking capabilities.Apple‚Äôs iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models feature a tool named Precision Finding, which allows users to locate friends in crowded areas with a range of up to nearly 60 meters (around 200 feet).

The upcoming smart tracker codenamed B589, is rumoured to feature a design similar to the current model but with enhanced privacy features.Since the launch of the first-generation AirTag, concerns about misuse for stalking have arisen.

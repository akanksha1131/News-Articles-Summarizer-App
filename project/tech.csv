Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that he once turned down an early model of a luxury timepiece worth over half a million dollars and opted for its prototype instead because of his self-described ""builder"" persona. The Facebook-co-founder revealed the choice during an interview with the platform Drip, where he showcased his Greubel Forsey Nano Foudroyante watch, which retails for around $585,000.According to a report by Business Insider, the Swiss watchmaker's creation was a limited-edition piece, with only 22 timepieces available at its debut.“They said that if I wanted, I could get one of the early ones that they made,” Zuckerberg explained.“I'm more of a work-in-progress, builder type of person, so I actually just asked them if I could get the prototype,” he added, noting that he was unsure if the company normally accommodates such requests but that they “figured out how to do that for me.”The Nano Foudroyante is Greubel Forsey's 10th “Fundamental Invention” and is notable for its intricate “foudroyante” complication, a subdial that measures fractions of a second with a hand completing one revolution per second.The watch is also a feat of engineering, as it is designed to be significantly more energy-efficient than traditional models.Zuckerberg's watch collection is extensive, ranging from a humble $120 Casio to a flashy yellow-gold Rolex. The Nano Foudroyante is not his only Greubel Forsey timepiece; he also owns a Hand Made 1, which has a reported value of $900,000.Last year, a video went viral on social media, showing Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, having a conversation with Anant when Chan noticed his wristwatch.“That is cool,” Chan said, to which Zuckerberg responded, ""I know. I told him already."" She then asked Anant, ""Who makes that?"" Anant replied that the watch was a Richard Mille.Zuckerberg seemed particularly impressed by the timepiece. ""I never really wanted to get a watch. But..."" he said, showing his appreciation, as Priscilla added, ""I might want that.""","The Nano Foudroyante is Greubel Forsey's 10th “Fundamental Invention” and is notable for its intricate “foudroyantes” complication.

Shark Tank judge Anupam Mittal says ‘Most MBAs are outdated’: ‘Better to learn….’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/shark-tank-judge-anupam-mittal-says-most-mbas-are-outdated-better-to-learn-/articleshow/124038917.cms,"Here’s what Anupam Mittal said

Should you do an MBA? My views👇🏼

Most MBAs are outdated 🤷🏼

Better to learn how to build Products,

Best training ground if you want to accelerate your career or run a company one day.

That’s how I started. As a Product Manager.

Case studies and frameworks are nice, but they don’t teach you how to,

- Question the status quo

- Build deep empathy for customers

- Pursue global optima, not local wins

- Influence without authority

- Work backwards from the end state

That’s a Builder’s life.

It’s messy, political, creative, analytical — all at once.

A microcosm of real life, not classroom fluff.

That’s what helped me build companies, not the three-letter degree, although I do have one 🙈

So I tell young students & professionals to do an MBA, but a different kind. Do a Masters in Building Awesome things and you will graduate, not in 2 yrs, but every day 👨🏼‍🎓😎

Be a PM, Product Engineer, Product Designer, AI Builder, Hardware Designer, Robotics Engineer ….. heck, even a Toy Designer!

Because the 21st century will be led by builders who can also tell great stories 💪🏼

P:S - If you MUST do a top-tier MBA. Or hide for a few months & learn how to build, esp with AI 🤷🏼

Pros and cons of O-1B visa



The advantages of O-1B visa include:

No lottery or annual cap

Faster processing available

Renewable indefinitely

The drawbacks of O-1B visa are:

More subjective than H-1B, requiring proof of “extraordinary ability”

Some employers hesitate due to uncertainty in approval

Application costs can be higher than pre-hike H-1B fees

Some real world examples of O-1B visa



Entrepreneurs like Soundarya Balasubramani, who launched an educational venture in the U.S., are among the new wave of Indian applicants using the O-1 to bypass the H-1B bottleneck. “I got my O-1A approved as the solo founder and 100% owner of an educational venture,” she told ET.

Karan Vaidya, cofounder of AI startup Composio, said his O-1 visa cost less than $10,000 including legal fees, and praised its flexibility: “It’s a three-year visa that can be renewed indefinitely. I’m on my fifth O-1 now.”





US President Donald Trump’s executive order raising the H-1B visa application fee from $10,000 to $1,00,000 sent shockwaves in the tech industry. Due to the announcement last week many tech giants called back their professionals with H-1B visa back to the US.

The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.For those unaware, the O-1 Visa is introduced under the Immigration Act of 1990. The O-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields of education, science, athletics or arts. It enable the recipients to work in the US for up to three years and comes with unlimited renewals. The applicants of the O-1 visa much demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim and meet atleast three out of the eight criteria:After the unpredictable nature of popular H-1B visa, the O-1 visa is gaining a lot of traction among Indians who wish to go and work in the US. As per the report by Economic Times, Indian were granted 487 O-1A visas in FY 2020, this number was increased to 1,418 in FY 2023. With this increase, India became the third largest recipient of O-1 visa after UK and Brazil.Unlike the popularly H-1B visa which is capped at 85,000 visas annually and allocated via a lottery, the O-1 visa has no cap and the applications for it are accepted around the year. The applicants can also expedite the application process by submitting additional fees.Immigration consultant and O-1 holder Logan Ullyott told Business Insider: “The O-1 is an occupation-agnostic visa. You could get it if you’re an engineer, a researcher, an influencer, or even a cook — as long as you can prove you’re at the top of your field.”","The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.

I have heard so many accounts from Sindhi friends about how their families had to leave everything and come to India during partition. They rebuilt their lives and Sindhis have done well in India.

I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time. Come back home. It may take 5 years to rebuild your lives but it will make you stronger.

Do not live in fear. Make the bold move. You will do well.

What it means for India







The entire technology and IT industry is in shock after US President Donald Trump announce massive five hike for H-1B visa. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application.

During the late-night show, Kimmel made sharp comments stating that the MAGA gang is “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it”.Actor and filmmaker Ben Stiller was among the celebrities who has publicly defended Kimmel and has criticised the decision of ABC. In s post shared on social media platform X, Stiller wrote, “This isn’t right”.His brief but pointed reaction quickly went viral, with many fans and fellow entertainers echoing his sentiment that the suspension undermines free expression in comedy.Commenting on Ben Stiller’s post, Elon Musk supported the decision made by ABC and wrote, “He went full retard. Never go full retard.”This is not the first time that Musk has reacted to the controversy.Earlier this week after the Kimmel’s video clip from the show went viral, Musk said, “Jimmy Kimmel is disgusting”.The California Governor Gavin Newsom has also blasted the decision and has accused Republicans of orchestrating censorship. “They are censoring you in real time. It’s coordinated. And it’s dangerous,” wrote Newsom on X.On the other hand, commentator Davis Sirota suggested corporate politics were at play, noting that Nexstar, which has ties to ABC, is seeking regulatory approvals from the Trump administration.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump celebrated the suspension on Truth Social, calling it “Great News for America” and labeling Kimmel “ratings challenged” with “zero talent.”","ABC confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely.

Google has said that the Biden administration pressed the company to “remove non-violative user-generated content” which was “related to the COVID-19 pandemic that did not violate its policies. ” The claim was made in a letter sent to the House Judiciary Committee by the counsel for Alphabet, Google’s parent company.“It is unacceptable and wrong when any government, including the Biden Administration, attempts to dictate how the Company moderates content, and the Company has consistently fought against those efforts on First Amendment grounds,” Google said in a 28-page letter.The House Committee on the Judiciary shared the letter on its official website.According to the company, it had to take to balance freedom of expression with responsibility.“The COVID-19 pandemic was an unprecedented time in which online platforms had to reach decisions about how best to balance freedom of expression with responsibility, including responsibility with respect to the moderation of user-generated content that could result in real world harm,” the company said in the letter addressing Jim Jordan, Chairman of Committee on the Judiciary, on September 23.The company said that “senior Biden Administration officials, including White House officials, conducted repeated and sustained outreach to Alphabet and pressed the Company regarding certain user-generated content related to the COVID-19 pandemic that did not violate its policies.”“While the Company continued to develop and enforce its policies independently, Biden Administration officials continued to press the Company to remove non-violative user-generated content,” it added.“As online platforms, including Alphabet, grappled with these decisions, the Administration's officials, including President Biden, created a political atmosphere that sought to influence the actions of platforms based on their concerns regarding misinformation,” the letter further added.Last year in August, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, stated in a letter to the same committee that his platform was forced to make COVID-19-related changes “in the wake of this pressure.” He added that it ‘expressed a lot of frustration with our teams when we didn't agree’.","Google said Biden administration pressed the company to “remove non-violative user-generated content” which was “related to the COVID-19 pandemic that did not violate its policies” The claim was made in a letter sent to the House Judiciary Committee by the counsel for Alphabet, Google’s parent company.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124074373,imgsize-52846,width-400,resizemode-4/google-parent-alphabet.jpg"

What Jumia CEO said about the company’s growth



“Consumers are gaining more confidence,”





The CEO of Jumia Technologies AG, Francis Dufay, has claimed that the company is benefiting from the global trade war. According to Dufay, US President Donald Trump 's tariffs on Chinese goods have led China to divert products to other markets, including those in Africa. This is making it easier for the continent's largest e-commerce company, also commonly referred to as the “Amazon of Africa,” to obtain goods, Duffy claimed.“Our pipeline of goods from China is getting healthier and healthier, and we have a lot more interest from Chinese suppliers and vendors. It’s really making our lives much easier.” Dufay said in a Bloomberg TV interview.While Africa's economies are growing rapidly, the region has been considered a less appealing market for Asian manufacturers due to its limited infrastructure and high inflation rates. However, as tariffs have limited Chinese shipments to the US, exports to Africa have soared by 25% year-on-year.Jumia has been restructuring to reduce costs, exiting markets such as South Africa and Tunisia and halting food delivery operations. It is now the largest e-commerce company in eight of the nine countries where it operates, Dufay said, with more currency stability in recent months.he added.This stability is helping Jumia defend its market position against low-cost Chinese entrants, such as Temu and Shein. Dufay noted that the company had a strong head start, having developed extensive logistics networks and fleets that competitors would find hard to replicate.He added that Jumia has retained its top spot in Nigeria, even as Temu began making inroads late last year. Jumia has had to build its own logistics and infrastructure in several markets to serve a young, tech-savvy population that relies on smartphones to overcome gaps in services.The company was among the first African companies to reach “unicorn” status with its 2019 New York listing, though its market value fell from a January 2021 peak of over $5 billion. Still, shares have risen 210% so far this year, bringing its market value to roughly $1.45 billion.","The CEO of Jumia Technologies AG, Francis Dufay, has claimed that the company is benefiting from the global trade war.

iOS26 now available: Things to know





LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman has shared his unique and costly approach to leveraging artificial intelligence (AI): he simply uses every AI chatbot and he pays for the maximum, most expensive subscription. This cumulatively can cost at least $650 per month (approx Rs 57,700).During a recent appearance on the ""Moonshots with Peter Diamandis"" podcast, Hoffman, a prominent venture capitalist, disclosed that he pays for the maximum subscription across all leading AI tools.“I simply do the max subscription across all of them and frequently when I'm doing something I've actually already put on running — and now it's the Open AI open-source model on my laptop to front end to parsing it out to multiple agents,” Hoffman said.This strategy, which he calls his “personal AI hack,” involves taking a single prompt and feeding it to multiple agents, including ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and Claude. He then integrates the various responses for more substantive tasks.""Run it on ChatGPT, run it on Copilot, run it on Gemini, run it on Claude, and then integrating what comes back on anything that is kind of more substantive,"" he said.When asked by podcast cofounder Dave Blundin if his position as a Microsoft board member granted him special access or dedicated GPUs, Hoffman said it does not.He instead relies on his subscription-based workflow, which can cost at least $650 per month, not including the cost of Microsoft's Copilot and an Office 365 license.This high-cost approach is not without its limits, according to Hoffman.“I've got the personal hack, but not the personal cloud,” he said, suggesting that true, private AI infrastructure remains out of reach, even for someone with his resources.He previously revealed he uses AI for ""deep research"" once a day, and even to help him formulate better questions. His process involves writing or speaking a paragraph to an AI, which then generates a detailed, refined prompt that he can use to drive his research.","LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman has shared his unique approach to leveraging artificial intelligence.

Microsoft has quietly launched Windows AI Labs, a new pilot program designed to give select users early access to experimental artificial intelligence features across Windows applications, with Microsoft Paint serving as the first testing ground.The program surfaced when Windows testers discovered references to Windows AI Labs in pre-release Paint updates last week. Microsoft confirmed the initiative to The Verge, describing it as ""a pilot acceleration program for validating novel AI feature ideas in Windows.""""The program focuses on rapid customer feedback on feature usability, customer interest, and market fit,"" said Mike Harsh, partner director of product management at Microsoft, in a statement to The Verge.Users invited to the program see a pop-up notification in Paint's top-right corner prompting them to ""Try experimental AI features in Paint."" Clicking the invitation opens Windows Settings, where users can sign up for the beta testing program. However, the backend system isn't fully operational yet, suggesting Microsoft may have accidentally activated the feature prematurely.The Windows AI Labs agreement warns participants that features are in preview stages and may not meet typical Windows app quality standards.Microsoft emphasizes that experimental features could be modified significantly or canceled entirely before any potential public release.While specific Paint AI features remain unclear, the timing aligns with Microsoft's recent additions of Photoshop-like capabilities to Paint, including transparency support, layers, and .paint project files. The company has been systematically integrating AI across Windows applications, adding features like AI-powered actions in File Explorer and image generation in Paint.The program mirrors Google's Search Labs, which provides early access to experimental search features. Microsoft's approach suggests the company is accelerating AI feature development while gathering user feedback to refine capabilities before broader deployment across the Windows ecosystem.","Microsoft has quietly launched Windows AI Labs, a new pilot program.

Tareq Ahmed, Bangladesh’s Ambassador to the UAE has denied reports of visa ban on Bangladeshi nationals, reports Khaleej Times. Reports on social media claimed that the UAE has banned citizens of certain countries from getting work or tourist visas. However, these reports were not attributed to any UAE official. Ahmed, as per Khaleej Times, called the news ‘inauthentic’. He reportedly told Bangladesh’s NTV that UAE authorities have not issued any new directives regarding the ban.Global Media Insight estimates that about 0.84 million Bangladeshi nationals live in the UAE, making up 7.4 per cent of the country’s population. This makes them the third-largest expatriate community after Indians and Pakistanis.Md. Rashedujjaman, the consul-general of Bangladesh in Dubai and the Northern Emirates, however, put the number closer to one million. In an interview with Khaleej Times during celebrations of Bangladesh’s 55th Independence and National Day in Dubai, he said discussions are underway with the UAE government to ease visa processes for Bangladeshi citizens.“We want to see Bangladeshi nationals become a part of the UAE’s success story,” he then said.As per reports, in total 9 countries were impacted by the ban – Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, Lebanon, Bangladesh, Cameroon, Sudan and Uganda. With Bangladesh’s Ambassador to the UAE denying, now the list allegedly includes 8 countries.According to a Business Insider Africa report, Uganda’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Oryem Henry Okello, confirmed the development. He said that the ban comes amidst concerns over visa overstays and rising cases of unlawful activity. “It is not a blanket prohibition,” he explained. “Some people will still go, but it will be based on the risk of a person overstaying their visa or failing to respect the laws and culture of the UAE. ”","Tareq Ahmed, Bangladesh’s Ambassador to the UAE has denied reports of visa ban on Bangladeshi nationals.

What is Amazon accused of

What Amazon says





The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is suing Amazon, accusing the e-commerce giant of misleading millions of customers into signing up for Prime subscription and making it difficult for them to cancel. According to a Gizmodo report, the trial is expected to last a month and is Amazon’s first major legal battle with the FTC.The report quotes a court filing from earlier this month in which the FTC said: “Millions of consumers accidentally enrolled in Prime without knowledge or consent, but Amazon refused to fix this known problem, described internally by employees as an ‘unspoken cancer’ because clarity adjustments would lead to a drop in subscribers.”The agency also said the cancellation process, known inside Amazon as “Iliad,” was a deliberate maze: “Prime’s cancellation flow … is a labyrinthian mechanism that Defendants know deters consumers from cancelling or misleads consumers into believing they successfully cancelled Prime when they in fact did not.”The lawsuit, filed two years ago under FTC chair Lina Khan, accuses Amazon and three executives—Jamil Ghani, Neil Lindsay, and Russell Grandinetti—of rolling back fixes that made enrollment clearer because subscriptions dropped.A federal judge has already ruled that two of them could be held personally liable if Amazon loses.Amazon has denied wrongdoing. “The bottom line is that neither Amazon nor the individual defendants did anything wrong – we remain confident that the facts will show these executives acted properly and we always put customers first,” a spokesperson said.The FTC argues Amazon used “dark patterns,” or design tactics meant to manipulate users into signing up or stopping them from cancelling. Regulators say such practices violate U.S. consumer protection laws.Prime generated more than $44 billion in subscription revenue for Amazon last year, making the outcome of this case significant not just for Amazon but for other subscription-based businesses that rely on similar practices.","The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is suing Amazon, accusing the e-commerce giant of misleading millions of customers into signing up for Prime subscription.

The announcement, made last week, has sparked concerns and chaos among Indians and other foreign employees in the US. Speaking to Times of India, Jamie Dimon said that America's largest bank will engage with stakeholders and policymakers in regard to the latest H1-B visa fee change.

My grandparents were Greek immigrants who never finished high school.America is an immigrant nation, and that's part of its core strength,” he added.In a separate interview with CNBC, Jamie Dimon said the new H-1B visa fee hike “caught everyone off guard, prompting concern across companies that rely on skilled workers”. He also stressed the importance of merit-based immigration, adding that businesses are likely to engage with the US government.“I think it will finally settle down. That caught everyone off guard, and so we had a lot of phone calls over the weekend. What does it mean?

Infosys’ missed AI opportunity and its impact on global tech leadership



Infosys’ buyback sparks debate: Cash returns vs bold AI bets



Also Read |





A recent LinkedIn post by Chartered Accountant and founder Meenal Goel has reignited important discussions about a critical turning point in Indian IT history. Goel emphasised how a high-profile clash between Infosys co-founder N. R. Narayana Murthy and former CEO Vishal Sikka may have had far-reaching consequences. According to her insights, this internal conflict potentially hindered Infosys’ strategic momentum, slowing innovation significantly and causing India to lose a valuable opportunity to lead decisively in the global artificial intelligence (AI) race. The episode highlights the profound impact of leadership dynamics on technological advancement and national competitiveness, illustrating how organizational disputes at major IT firms can influence both company performance and the broader trajectory of India’s evolving presence in emerging tech sectors like AI.According to Goel, back in 2015, Vishal Sikka aggressively pushed to position Infosys as an AI-first company. His vision included investments in cutting-edge technologies and participation in a $1 billion investment in OpenAI , alongside global leaders such as Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and Amazon Web Services. Sikka’s strategy focused on automation, advanced software development, and the transformative potential of AI. He foresaw that AI would redefine how enterprises operate and software is developed, and he wanted Infosys to be at the forefront of this revolution.However, N. R. Narayana Murthy, adhering to a more conservative governance style, raised concerns over pay structures, corporate culture, and the risks of such bold bets.This fundamental disagreement ultimately led to Sikka’s resignation, marking a turning point for Infosys’ technological trajectory.Goel’s post underscores the magnitude of the opportunity lost. Infosys initially committed to a $1 billion investment in OpenAI, only to withdraw later. Today, that same stake would have been valued at approximately $45 billion. While global technology peers doubled down on AI, Indian IT largely remained focused on labor arbitrage and cost efficiency, missing a chance to lead in a technology now transforming industries worldwide.Had Murthy and Sikka aligned, Infosys could have emerged as a global AI trailblazer, shaping not only its own future but also India’s position in the global technology landscape. Goel emphasizes, “The missed alignment cost Infosys the chance to lead a revolution, not just follow it.”The decision highlights a broader debate within Indian IT companies: whether to rely on proven business models or take calculated risks on emerging technologies that define the future.The conversation resurged recently after Infosys completed a Rs 13,560 crore share buyback, its first in three years. The buyback was executed at a 25% premium, with the company holding Rs 45,200 crore in cash and equivalents against a net worth of Rs 95,350 crore, highlighting its strong balance sheet and conservative capital strategy.This move prompted questions among investors and analysts: should Infosys prioritize returning cash to shareholders, or invest in bold technology bets like Sikka had envisioned nearly a decade ago? The timing added a layer of irony: while Sikka had championed an AI pivot, Infosys today leans heavily on buybacks amidst global macroeconomic pressures and intensifying competition. Sikka later served as an advisor to OpenAI and maintained that AI would fundamentally transform software creation and maintenance. In 2015, he stated, “Our wish is that OpenAI will do unfettered research in the most important dimensions of AI, no matter how long it takes.”",A recent LinkedIn post by Chartered Accountant and founder Meenal Goel has reignited important discussions about a critical turning point in Indian IT history.

Tech giants stay silent as immigration policy creates corporate chaos

White House clarifies H-1B policy





Unionised Google employees gathered outside the company's Lower Manhattan office Monday, demanding their employer publicly oppose President Trump's executive order imposing a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications—a 6,600% increase from current costs.Around 25 Alphabet Workers Union members criticised Google's silence on the immigration policy that has thrown corporate America into chaos since last week's announcement, as reported by Business Insider. ""Google is one of the most powerful companies in the world, and they have yet to say anything about what's happened and really take a stand and side with their own workers,"" union president Parul Koul told Business Insider.The protest comes after Google issued an urgent internal memo through its immigration law firm BAL, instructing H-1B visa holders abroad to return immediately or face potential re-entry complications. The White House later clarified the fee applies only to new applicants.Google applied for nearly 5,500 H-1B visas in 2024, making the policy particularly impactful for the tech giant. A software engineer at Google, Tim Traversy, 29, challenged the company during the demonstration: ""They are one of the largest and most powerful companies in the US.Will they stand with the immigrant workers that helped build this company?,"" as reported by Business Insider.The protesters also demanded Google extend severance as payroll time for laid-off visa holders, giving them more time to find new employment before losing legal status.Following initial confusion about the policy's scope, the White House issued clarifications Saturday. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt emphasised on social media that the substantial fee applies exclusively to fresh applications beginning with March 2026's visa lottery, leaving current holders and renewals unaffected.Trump's Friday executive order triggered immediate corporate responses across the tech sector. Major employers including Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Tesla issued urgent advisories for their H-1B workforce to avoid international travel or return immediately. The policy's announcement created such alarm that some travellers at San Francisco International Airport abandoned their flights upon learning of the new requirements.At San Francisco airport, passengers reportedly deplaned from India-bound flights after learning about the new rules.Lu Liu, a former H-1B holder who became a permanent resident in 2017, told Business Insider he ""would've canceled his travel plans had he still been on the visa"" and plans to check on teammates when he logs on.Google representatives did not respond to requests for comment on potential public statements regarding the H-1B fee policy.","Unionised Google employees gathered outside the company's Lower Manhattan office Monday.

Oracle has appointed Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia as co-chief executive officers. This move reportedly signals the company's focus on its growing cloud computing business. Magouyrk, 39, was one of the first employees of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Sicilia, 54, was previously president of Oracle Industries and was involved in the acquisition of health records business Cerner Corp. The company's long-time CEO, Safra Catz, who has held the position since 2014, is stepping back to become executive vice chair of the board. Catz had reportedly expressed scepticism about the cloud infrastructure business in its early days.According to a report by Bloomberg, Oracle is betting heavily on its cloud infrastructure business, which builds data centres for companies like OpenAI and Meta to deliver AI services.The company has secured major deals that are expected to make the cloud its largest revenue-generating division in the coming years. To meet these commitments, Oracle is spending aggressively, leading to negative annual cash flow for the first time since 1990.However, it’s uncommon for tech firms to divide CEO responsibilities; Oracle has prior experience with this model. The company also reaffirmed its financial guidance from earlier this month and announced that Douglas Kehring will take over as principal financial officer, a role previously held by Safra Catz.Separately, the White House said Oracle will play a central role in a deal to sell TikTok to a group of US investors. TikTok had been one of Oracle’s early cloud customers.Catz was promoted to co-CEO in 2014 alongside Mark Hurd, but following Hurd’s death in 2019, chairman Larry Ellison said he had no plans to appoint another co-CEO to work with her. Although Magouyrk and Sicilia now share the same title, Magouyrk will be compensated at a higher level. According to a regulatory filing seen by Bloomberg, he is set to receive a stock package valued at $250 million, while Sicilia’s package will be worth $100 million.In a statement shared at that time, Ellison said:","Oracle appoints Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia as co-chief executive officers. Long-time CEO Safra Catz, who has held the position since 2014, is stepping back to become executive vice chair of the board. Move reportedly signals the company's focus on its growing cloud computing business.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124055487,imgsize-146650,width-400,resizemode-4/oracle-replaces-ceo-safra-catz-after-10-years-gets-back-to-older-structure-to-focus-on.jpg"

"""I've worked on H1-B politics for 30 years,"" Netflix co-founder says US' $100k H-1B tax is...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ive-worked-on-h1-b-politics-for-30-years-netflix-co-founder-says-us-100k-h-1b-tax-is-/articleshow/124053572.cms,"White House clarifies H-1B fees structure after a weekend of confusion





Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings has endorsed President Donald Trump's new $100,000 H-1B visa fee, breaking ranks with most Silicon Valley leaders who have criticised the policy as harmful to innovation and startup growth. In a post on X, Hastings wrote: ""I've worked on H1-B politics for 30 years. Trump's $100k per year tax is a great solution. It will mean H1-B is used just for very high-value jobs, which will mean no lottery needed, and more certainty for those jobs.""The H-1B program allows US companies to hire foreign workers in specialised roles, with 85,000 annual slots available despite over 400,000 applications. Current data shows nearly half of applications come from tech and science fields, with about 30% of roles paying $100,000 or less.Hastings' support stands out because he's a prominent Democratic megadonor who has previously criticised Trump, saying the president ""would destroy much of what is great about America."" His endorsement cuts against the dominant Silicon Valley sentiment, where tech leaders including Elon Musk have fiercely opposed the changes.However, Hastings incorrectly described the fee as annual. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified Saturday that it's a one-time payment for new petitions only, not renewals or existing visa holders.""This is NOT an annual fee,"" Leavitt posted on X, explaining the policy applies to new visas starting with the March 2026 lottery cycle.The weekend brought chaos across Silicon Valley after Trump signed the executive order Friday. Companies including Amazon , Microsoft, Google, and Tesla urged H-1B employees to stay in the U.S. or return before the Sunday deadline. At San Francisco airport, passengers reportedly deplaned from India-bound flights after learning about the new rules.While tech giants may absorb the costs, startups and smaller firms warn they'll be priced out of hiring international talent, potentially shortening their financial runway by months.","Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings has endorsed President Donald Trump's new $100,000 H-1B visa fee.

US-based AI startup CEO on H-1B visa price hike: If your company doesn’t value you enough…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-based-ai-startup-ceo-on-h-1b-visa-price-hike-if-your-company-doesnt-value-you-enough/articleshow/124053315.cms,"What Shahriar Tajbakhsh said about recruiting H-1B workers



“If you're on an H-1B visa and your company doesn't value you enough to pay the $100k, check out https://m.careers to see if any of our roles might be a fit.

I’m seeing many companies from other countries using this as an opportunity to say, “Come work in country X.” That feels a bit desperate to me. Instead, come work with the Metaview — right here in San Francisco — where $100k is a rounding error compared to the value each member of our team creates.

H-1B Visa Hike: Trump’s $100K Fee Puts Smaller Indian Firms at a Disadvantage

Our team is ready to move fast and get to an offer/no-offer decision on any candidate within 24 hours of first contact (assuming you can give us 4-5 hours of your time for interviews).

Tag your H-1B friends on this thread.”





Shahriar Tajbakhsh, the Iranian CEO and co-founder of a San Francisco-based AI startup, Metaview, has a message for H-1B visa holders. In a public message shared on the professional networking site LinkedIn, Tajbakhsh addressed the employers of the H-1B workers amid the new $100,000 H-1B visa fee. His remarks came after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week to announce the increased fee for new H-1B applications. Tajbakhsh wrote, ""If your company doesn’t value you enough to pay the $100k, check out to see if any of our roles might be a fit."" Tajbakhsh even promised to provide a yes-or-no decision on all applications within 24 hours. He reframed the fee as a ""litmus test for company loyalty"" and called the $100,000 fee ""a rounding error"" compared to the value a team member creates. The company's pitch is seen as a new approach to recruiting talent in the wake of rising immigration costs.In his LinkedIn post, Tajbakhsh wrote:As per his LinkedIn page, Tajbakhsh worked with Palantir for a year, initially as a software engineer and later on as tech lead. Before that, he worked as a software engineer at JP Morgan and Osper, respectively.","Shahriar Tajbakhsh, the Iranian CEO and co-founder of a San Francisco-based AI startup, Metaview, has a message for H-1B visa holders.

Oracle will bring this big change to the ‘complicating factor’ in TikTok deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/oracle-will-bring-this-big-change-to-the-complicating-factor-in-tiktok-deal/articleshow/124053310.cms,"What happens to TikTok data and algorithm after the deal



Why TikTok algorithm is a challenge



The Slimmest iPhone Yet: What we think





Oracle will implement significant modifications to TikTok’s algorithm following an anticipated executive order from President Donald Trump later this week, a White House official confirmed. Under the proposed agreement to transfer TikTok’s US operations to a consortium of American investors, Oracle will be tasked with developing and securing a US-specific version of the platform’s algorithm.According to a report by Bloomberg, the plan has been outlined by the official and it will ensure that the new US-based owners will control TikTok's recommendation software – which has been a complicating factor in any past deal.The official explained that the American buyers will lease a copy of the algorithm from TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and Oracle will then ""retrain"" it ""from the ground up.""The agreement also specifies that all data from US users will be stored in a secure cloud managed by Oracle. This system will include security controls designed to prevent access by foreign adversaries, including China. Crucially, ByteDance will have no access to US user data or control over the US algorithm, the report said.""Oracle, the US security partner, will operate, retrain, and continuously monitor the U.S. algorithm to ensure content is free from improper manipulation or surveillance,"" according to a Q&A document that accompanied the official's statement.The app’s algorithm has long been a key challenge in the deal, as US law prohibits ByteDance from having any operational role in a new US app, while Chinese law restricts the export of such sensitive technology.The White House official confirmed that Oracle will work in partnership with the US government on everything from algorithm retraining to application development and source code review. The specific extent of the government's oversight role, however, was not immediately clear.This news comes as President Donald Trump prepares to finalise a long-awaited plan to sell the video-sharing platform.","Oracle will be tasked with developing and securing a US-specific version of the platform’s algorithm.

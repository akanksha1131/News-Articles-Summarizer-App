Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency

Here's Perplexity's open letter to Amazon on its legal notice

Bullying is Not Innovation

The point of technology is to make life better for people. We call it innovation, but it’s just the constant process of asking how to make things better. Bullying, on the other hand, is when large corporations use legal threats and intimidation to block innovation and make life worse for people.

This week, Perplexity received an aggressive legal threat from Amazon, demanding we prohibit Comet users from using their AI assistants on Amazon. This is Amazon’s first legal salvo against an AI company, and it is a threat to all internet users.

For the last 50 years, software has been a tool, like a wrench in the hands of the user. But with the rise of agentic AI, software is also becoming labor: an assistant, an employee, an agent.

The law is clear that large corporations have no right to stop you from owning wrenches. Today, Amazon announced it does not believe in your right to hire labor, to have an assistant or an employee acting on your behalf. This isn’t a reasonable legal position, it’s a bully tactic to scare disruptive companies like Perplexity out of making life better for people.

A Threat to User Choice

Amazon wants to block you from using your own AI assistant to shop on their platform. Here's what they're trying to prevent: You ask your Comet Assistant to find and purchase something on Amazon. If you're logged in to Amazon (credentials in Comet are stored securely only in your device, never on Perplexity’s servers), the Comet Assistant quickly finds and purchases the item for you, saving you time for more important tasks. Or, you can ask it to compare options and purchase the best one for your needs. Comet users love this experience.

Amazon should love this. Easier shopping means more transactions and happier customers. But Amazon doesn’t care. They’re more interested in serving you ads, sponsored results, and influencing your purchasing decisions with upsells and confusing offers.

How do we know? CEO Andy Jassy told investors just last week: ""It just all leads to a return on advertising spend that's very unusual,” he bragged (47:50), and in the same call he admitted, “We’re also having conversations with and expect over time to partner with 3rd party agents.” (41:38).

Read that again. Amazon wants to eliminate user rights so that it can sell more ads right now and partner with AI agents designed to take advantage of users later. It’s not just bullying, it’s bonkers.

Every retailer should celebrate the art and science of merchandising, which is when merchants create delightful customer experiences in the shopping journey. But it’s dangerous to confuse consumer experience with consumer exploitation. Users want AI they can trust, and they want AI Assistants that work on their behalf and no one else’s.

The Future of User Agents

User agents are exactly that: agents of the user. They're distinct from crawlers, scrapers, or bots. A user agent is your AI assistant—it has exactly the same permissions you have, works only at your specific request, and acts solely on your behalf.

Assistive AI is becoming an increasingly important aspect of the global economy, businesses everywhere, and the individual rights and capabilities of every person. We believe it’s crucial to raise awareness about the issues facing user agents.

For user agents to serve their true purpose, they must be:

1. Private. Your AI assistant must be indistinguishable from you. When Comet Assistant visits a website, it does so with your credentials, your permissions, and your rights. (It’s also unable to do anything you can’t). Publishers and corporations have no right to discriminate against users based on which AI they've chosen to represent them. Users must have the right to choose technologies that represent them. Privacy and freedom of choice depend on this.

2. Personal. Your user agent works for you, not for Perplexity, and certainly not for Amazon. For decades, machine learning and algorithms have been weapons in the hands of large corporations, deployed to serve ads and manipulate what you see, experience, and purchase. The transformative promise of LLMs is that they put power back in the hands of people. Agentic AI marks a meaningful shift: users can finally regain control of their online experiences.

3. Powerful. Your AI assistant must be capable of any task that matters to you. Users have a right to select high-performing AI agents from the cutting edge of innovation. The technology available to users can’t be hamstrung just because it threatens some public company’s pressure to deliver more ad revenue. The future of AI, like all technology, is for people.

Perplexity Will Not Be Intimidated

The rise of agentic AI presents a choice. Will this technology empower users to take control of their digital lives? Or will it become another tool for corporations to manipulate and exploit?

Perplexity is fighting for the rights of users. People love our products because they’re designed for people. User choice and freedom are at the heart of everything we build.

Perhaps that’s what makes us a target for corporate bullies. But Amazon shouldn’t forget what it’s like to be our size and passionate about a world-changing product. They too once faced intimidating threats and fought aggressively in every case to give users a better choice.

Amazon also forgets how it got so big. Users love it. They want good products, at a low price, delivered fast. Agentic shopping is the natural evolution of this promise, and people already demand it. Perplexity demands the right to offer it.





Perplexity AI is very upset over the legal notice that the company has received from Amazon . The 'Cease and Desist' notice from Amazon asks Perplexity to block its AI agent on the Comet browser from making purchases on Amazon’s platform on behalf of users. Perplexity has rejected Amazon’s claims, accusing the e-commerce giant of using its market power to stifle innovation and competition.In a blog post, titled 'Bullying is Not Innovation', Perplexity described the dispute as a broader fight over user choice and the future of AI assistants. “Bullying is when large corporations use legal threats and intimidation to block innovation and make life worse for people,” the company wrote.Perplexity’s Comet browser allows users to delegate online shopping and comparisons to an AI agent, which the company says stores user credentials locally and not on its servers. “Easier shopping means more transactions and happier customers. But Amazon doesn’t care — they’re more interested in serving you ads,” the company said. The startup argued that users should have the freedom to choose their own AI tools, framing Amazon’s legal action as an effort to protect its ad-driven business model rather than consumers.Amazon on its part said that had repeatedly asked Perplexity to remove Amazon from the Comet shopping experience, citing a “significantly degraded shopping and customer service experience.”“Third-party apps making purchases for users should operate transparently and respect businesses’ decisions on whether to participate,” Amazon said in a statement.The confrontation marks one of the first high-profile disputes between a major tech platform and an emerging AI assistant — a potential preview of future battles over who controls how AI agents access and transact on the web.","Perplexity has received a legal threat from Amazon.

Hello Everyone –

You’ll recall that on September 25, I shared with you actions we took after investigating a news story that reported that Azure was being used to store phone call data obtained through mass surveillance of civilians in Gaza and the West Bank. In that message, I also said we’d continue to share lessons learned and how we will apply these going forward. Today I want to share additional steps we are taking to enhance our due diligence and governance processes. This is a part of an ongoing process and, as we continue to learn more, we’ll share further steps with you.

Today we are strengthening our diligence processes by expanding how employees can report information and concerns about how Microsoft technology is developed and deployed. These build on our long-established reporting and investigations processes on workplace behavior, legal and ethical concerns, and digital and physical security — all of which make it easy for employees to raise concerns through the

Microsoft Integrity Portal

.

We’re adding a new and easy way for employees to report information about practices that you believe may violate the company’s policies regarding the development and deployment of our technology. This is through a new section in the Microsoft Integrity Portal called “Trusted Technology Review.” Moving forward, if you have information on these topics, simply go to the portal and select the “Trusted Technology Review” when asked for type of report. We will then follow up to address this information. Our standard non-retaliation policy applies and you can raise concerns anonymously.

As part of our commitment to ongoing improvement, we are also taking new steps to enhance other aspects of our governance processes. As one step in that work, we are working to strengthen our existing pre-contract review process for evaluating engagements that require additional human rights due diligence.

As I’ve shared before, Microsoft is a company guided by principles and ethics. We continue to consider lessons learned and apply them to how we run our business and advance our mission in an increasingly complex world. We’ll continue to listen and learn and share new steps with you along the way.

Microsoft is reportedly introducing a new internal mechanism that allows employees to report concerns about how the company’s technologies are developed and deployed, as pressure mounts over its involvement in Israel’s military and surveillance operations. According to a report in Geekwire, Microsoft president Brad Smith has sent a memo to all employees in this regard. In the message to employees, Smith said that the company is expanding its internal “Integrity Portal” to include a new feature called “Trusted Technology Review.”The tool will allow employees confidentially flag potential policy violations or raise ethical concerns about the company’s technology use — in a process similar to how workers currently report workplace misconduct, security incidents, or legal issues. Smith said that Microsoft is also strengthening its pre-contract review process to ensure additional human-rights due diligence on sensitive technology projects.The announcement follows months of internal and external pressure over Israel’s alleged use of Microsoft’s technology in military surveillance activities related to the war in Gaza. Employee groups and activists including -- No Azure for Apartheid -- have accused the company of enabling human rights abuses through its cloud and AI platforms.Microsoft has repeatedly rejected those claims, stating it remains committed to its human rights principles and does not provide technology that facilitates mass surveillance of civilians.In September, the company confirmed that it had verified elements of a Guardian investigation suggesting that Israel’s Unit 8200 used Microsoft’s Azure cloud to store and analyze large amounts of intercepted Palestinian communications. Microsoft said it has since cut off access to certain cloud and AI services used by the unit. ""“While our review is ongoing, we have found evidence that supports elements of The Guardian’s reporting,” says Smith. “We therefore have informed Israel Ministry of Defense (IMOD) of Microsoft’s decision to cease and disable specified IMOD subscriptions and their services, including their use of specific cloud storage and AI services and technologies,"" Smith had then said in a memo.The memo sent by Smith on Wednesday, November 5, follows the September 25 letter.

Elon Musk’s high salary: What are the proposal's terms



What concerns shareholders







Tesla’s board of directors has reportedly sent a message to shareholders: approve a compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that could reach $878 billion in company stock, framing the decision as a choice between paying unprecedented sums or risking Musk's departure and a potential stock collapse.Shareholders will vote on Thursday (November 6) on the proposal, which has divided investors and corporate governance experts, a report by news agency Reuters said.The board argues that only Musk can deliver on his promises to transform Tesla into an artificial intelligence leader producing millions of self-driving robotaxis and humanoid robots. Meanwhile, critics say the package violates basic governance principles and gives one executive unchecked power over the company.If Musk achieves all performance goals within a decade, Tesla’s market value would grow to $8.5 trillion, with Musk owning approximately 25% of the stock. The compensation would exceed any other CEO's pay by an exponential margin. Musk would collect tens of billions even if he misses most performance goals.The package includes stock vesting periods designed to ensure Musk remains with the company long-term. Under the terms, Musk must hold earned shares for five years.Some investors support the arrangement. Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments, a Tesla investor, said the potential returns justify Musk's compensation.“If the stock is going to go up sixfold – and that's a requirement here – then I'm going to make a lot of money. Why do I care what kind of money he makes if he's effecting the change and the vision?,"" said Tengler.Major shareholders and executive-pay experts have raised objections to the proposal's size and structure. The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), the largest US public pension fund, and Norway's sovereign wealth fund publicly opposed the compensation package.Norges Bank Investment Management has said that the proposal could dilute shareholder value and failed to address the risk of depending on a single leader. The fund said the package did not mitigate “key person risk” in staking Tesla's future on Musk.Corporate governance experts argue the proposal violates standard principles because the board explicitly stakes the company's future on one leader with multiple conflicts of interest.",Tesla's board of directors has reportedly sent a message to shareholders: approve a compensation package for CEO Elon Musk.

A rebellion against Tesla’s board







Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s $1 trillion pay package is seems to be in trouble. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest with assets exceeding $2.1 trillion, has announced it will vote against Elon Musk’s proposed $1 trillion compensation package at Tesla’s upcoming shareholder meeting. The move adds significant pressure on Tesla’s board and investors as they weigh the future of one of the most controversial executive pay deals in corporate history.Managed by Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), the fund holds a 1.14% stake in Tesla, valued at approximately $11.6 billion. In a statement, NBIM said it had already cast its vote against the package, citing concerns over the “total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk”.Tesla’s board, led by Chair Robyn Denholm, has urged shareholders to approve the deal, warning that Musk might step down if the package is rejected. The proposed compensation is tied to long-term performance goals, including Tesla reaching a market capitalization of $8.5 trillion by 2035.While NBIM acknowledged Musk’s visionary leadership and the value he has created for Tesla, it described the pay package as “excessive and risky”, especially given Musk’s outsized influence and the lack of safeguards should he exit the company.The rejection by Norway’s fund—Tesla’s seventh-largest shareholder—could sway other institutional investors and reignite debates over executive compensation in tech. The fund’s decision reflects broader concerns about governance, transparency, and the precedent such a massive payout could set.Despite the opposition, analysts believe the package may still pass due to strong support from Tesla’s retail investor base and Musk’s own voting power, bolstered by Tesla’s relocation to Texas, where corporate governance laws are more favourable.","Norway's sovereign wealth fund says it will vote against Elon Musk's proposed $1 trillion compensation package.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

Exciting news! Together with Epic Games we have filed a proposed set of changes to Android and Google Play that focus on expanding developer choice and flexibility, lowering fees, and encouraging more competition all while keeping users safe. If approved, this would resolve our litigations. We look forward to discussing further with the Judge on Thursday.

Google has made an awesome proposal, subject to court approval, to open up Android in the US Epic v Google case and settle our disputes. It genuinely doubles down on Android's original vision as an open platform to streamline competing store installs globally, reduce service fees for developers on Google Play, and enable third-party in-app and web payments.

This is a comprehensive solution, which stands in contrast to Apple’s model of blocking all competing stores and leaving payments as the only vector for competition. The public filings are live.

Major cuts to fees and new payment freedom







Fortnite-maker Epic Games and Google may soon reach a settlement in their bitter, five-year antitrust dispute, announcing a proposed deal that will reshape the Android app ecosystem globally. The agreement promises to expand developer choice, significantly lower fees, and streamline access for rival app stores on Android’s Play Store. The proposed settlement, which is subject to final court approval, is hailed by Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney as “awesome.”The proposed resolution follows a high-stakes courtroom confrontation that saw Epic win a jury verdict against Google in 2023, where a jury accused Google of illegally monopolising app distribution on Android devices. The news was jointly announced by both companies.Sameer Samat, President of the Android Ecosystem at Google, stated on X:Epic's CEO, Tim Sweeney, responded with immediate praise, saying the proposal ""genuinely doubles down on Android's original vision as an open platform.""The settlement represents a rewiring of Google's business model for app transactions.Currently, Google typically takes up to 30% cut on most purchases and up to 15% on subscriptions. Under the new proposal, developers gain unprecedented financial freedom:Google will slash its core service fees. Developers will pay only 20% on in-app purchases that offer gameplay advantages and a mere 9% on purchases that do not.Developers will also gain the freedom to display and steer customers toward alternative payment systems right alongside Google Play Billing. If a user chooses one of these non-Google options, developers will pay Google nothing.This change hands significant pricing control to developers, allowing them to offer discounts for customers who opt for third-party payment methods.","Fortnite-maker Epic Games and Google may soon reach a settlement in their bitter, five-year antitrust dispute.

China offers to help tech companies solve ‘major AI problem’ but on one condition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/china-offers-to-help-tech-companies-solve-major-ai-problem-but-on-one-condition/articleshow/125107949.cms,"China’s subsidy solution and domestic chip mandate









China is reportedly offering a solution to every AI company’s biggest problem – soaring energy bills. The country’s government is reportedly increasing financial incentives for data centres, offering tech companies subsidies that cut their energy bills by up to half. The move is a direct effort to boost China’s homegrown semiconductor industry and sustain its push to compete with the US in the global AI race. The ask? To qualify for the substantial energy savings, data centres must be powered by domestic chips – which in a way is penalising continued reliance on foreign vendors like Nvidia.Citing people familiar with the matter, a report by The Financial Times says that this new wave of subsidies comes in response to complaints from major Chinese tech giants, including ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent. These companies reported soaring electricity costs following the US export controls, which restricted the purchase of high-performance AI chips from Nvidia.The tech companies complained to regulators about the increased operational costs associated with using domestic semiconductors from companies such as Huawei and Cambricon. The core issue is energy efficiency.Experts estimate that generating the same amount of tokens (units of compute power) from the current generation of Chinese chips requires about 30-50% more electricity than the equivalent Nvidia H20 chip.Huawei, China’s leading chipmaker, has attempted to overcome the weaker single-chip performance of its flagship Ascend 910C by clustering multiple chips together. While this boosts performance, it further adds to the overall operating electricity costs for data centres.Local governments in data centre-heavy provinces like Gansu, Guizhou, and Inner Mongolia have quickly responded to the tech sector's cost concerns. These provinces are offering new subsidies that slash electricity bills for big data centres by as much as 50%, the report said.However, the entitlement is strictly conditional: only data centres running on domestic chips are eligible. Data centers using foreign vendors like Nvidia will not receive these benefits.Last month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised China’s semiconductor technology, saying that it is approaching the level of US chips, with China just “nanoseconds behind” the country in chipmaking.Recently, He praised Huawei's technical prowess, noting their dominance in 5G technology and their ability to build ""amazing chips"".""It is foolish to underestimate the might of China and the incredible, competitive spirit of Huawei,"" Huang said.""This is a company with extraordinary technology. They dominate the world's 5G telecommunication standards and technology. They build amazing smartphones, they build amazing chips, they're incredible at networking and so when they announced CloudMatrix, I was not surprised that they were able to create such an amazing thing,"" Huang added.""It's deeply uninformed to think that Huawei can't build systems,"" Huang concluded.","China is reportedly offering subsidies that cut energy bills by up to half for data centres.

A Japanese trade organisation representing major studios including Studio Ghibli, Bandai Namco, and Square Enix has formally demanded that OpenAI cease using their copyrighted material to train artificial intelligence models without permission.The Content Overseas Distribution Association (CODA) submitted a written request to OpenAI on October 27, claiming the company's Sora 2 video generator produces content that closely resembles Japanese intellectual property because it was trained on copyrighted works without authorisation.The animation studio behind beloved films like ""Spirited Away"" and ""My Neighbor Totoro"" has been particularly affected by OpenAI's generative AI products. When ChatGPT's image generator launched in March, users created a viral trend of ""Ghiblified"" selfies mimicking the studio's distinctive art style. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman even adopted a Ghibli-style portrait as his social media profile picture.CODA argues that OpenAI's opt-out system for copyright holders may violate Japanese law. Under Japan's copyright framework, prior permission is generally required for using copyrighted works, with no provision allowing companies to avoid liability through retroactive objections.The organisation stated that when AI models reproduce or generate outputs resembling specific copyrighted works, the replication process during machine learning may constitute copyright infringement under Japanese law.Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki has previously expressed strong opposition to AI-generated animation. When shown an AI animation demonstration in 2016, he called it ""utterly disgusting"" and stated, ""I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.""The dispute reflects growing international tension over AI companies' approach to copyrighted content. While OpenAI initially required copyright holders to manually opt out of AI training, the company recently reversed course following backlash, though only after Sora 2 had already achieved viral popularity through copyrighted character recreations.CODA has requested that OpenAI stop using member content for machine learning without permission and respond sincerely to copyright infringement claims.","Japanese trade organisation demands that OpenAI stop using copyrighted material to train artificial intelligence models without permission.

The Redmond giant announced this move alongside Australia, the United Kingdom, and Japan, positioning India as a priority market for Microsoft's AI infrastructure expansion.The announcement, made by Paul Lorimer, Corporate Vice President of Office 365 Enterprise and Cloud Engineering, means that Indian organisations using Microsoft 365 Copilot will have their AI interactions processed within the country's borders under normal operations. This addresses critical data sovereignty concerns for government agencies and highly regulated industries operating in India.Following the initial rollout to four nations in 2025, Microsoft will extend in-country processing to eleven additional countries in 2026, including Canada, Germany, Italy, Malaysia, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States.The in-country processing capability covers prompts and responses from Microsoft 365 Copilot's large language models hosted on Azure OpenAI. By keeping data processing within national boundaries, organisations gain enhanced governance, security, and regulatory compliance options—crucial for India's growing emphasis on data localisation.The move also promises improved performance through reduced latency, delivering faster response times for Indian users. Microsoft currently offers in-country data residency to customers in 27 countries and maintains regional data residency within the European Union Data Boundary, demonstrating its continued investment in meeting local compliance requirements across its global infrastructure.","Microsoft to expand AI data sovereignty to 15 countries by 2026.

Under $1,000: A new price point for Mac



Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!

Growing competitive pressure

What’s next for Mac





Apple is reportedly working on a low-cost Mac laptop in order to give competition to Google’s Chromebooks and other affordable Windows laptops. According to a report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the Cupertino-based tech giant is developing a device codenamed J700. The device is said to be in the active testing and early production stage and is expected to launch in the first half of 2026. If the report is true, then this is the first time that Apple has designed a Mac which is targeted at the budget segment. This upcoming affordable laptop from Apple is said to targeted at students, small businesses and casual users who mainly want to use the device for browsing the web, work on documents and also perform light media editing jobs. Along with this, the affordable Mac segment also aims to target the potential iPad buyers who prefer a traditional laptop-like experience.As reported by Bloomberg, Apple is planning to keep the price of the new Mac below $1,000 and the company is using less-advanced components in order to keep the costs down. The device is expected to feature a lower-end LCD display and a screen size slightly smaller than the 13.6-inch MacBook Air.Notably, it will powered by an iPhone processor which will make it a first Mac to not come with an M-series chipset. The report also adds that some internal tests reveal that the smartphone chip outperforms the M1 processor used in older MacBooks.While Apple has previously offered discounted MacBook Air models through retailers like Walmart, the upcoming laptop will be a completely new design, not a repackaged older product.Apple’s entry into the budget laptop segment comes at a time when competition is increasing from Chromebooks, which dominate the education sector with devices priced as low as a few hundred dollars. Microsoft’s transition to Windows 11 has also left some users seeking alternatives, creating an opening for Apple to attract disaffected Windows customers.The company currently holds 9% of the global PC market, trailing Lenovo, HP, and Dell. A more affordable Mac could help Apple expand its footprint, especially in the US, where the iPhone already enjoys widespread dominance.The Bloomberg report further reveals that the affordable Mac is part of Apple’s broader plan which includes M5-powered MacBook Air and Pro models, new Mac mini and Mac Studio updates, and a revamped MacBook Pro with an M6 chip and OLED touchscreen expected in late 2026 or early 2027. Along with this, the tech giant is also planning to launch two new external Mac displays. For those unaware, the Mac segment was Apple’s fastest-growing hardware category last quarter, rising 13% to $8.73 billion.",Apple is reportedly working on a low-cost Mac laptop in order to give competition to Google’s Chromebooks and other affordable Windows laptops.

Sora App: AI meets short-form video





Sora chief Bill Peebles shares OpenAI's plans to monetise AI video generation app









OpenAI’s viral AI-powered video creation app, Sora is now available for Android users across several global regions including the United States, Japan, Canada, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. The launch marks a major expansion for the app, which debuted on iOS in September and quickly became one of the top downloads on the App Store.With its arrival on the Google Play Store, Sora is expected to attract a broader user base and further accelerate the adoption of AI-generated video tools. The Android version retains all the features of its iOS counterpart, including the popular “Cameos” feature, which allows users to create videos of themselves performing various activities using their own likenessThe Sora app will enable users to create and share AI-generated videos using natural language prompts. Unlike traditional video platforms, users won’t need cameras or editing software—just a few words to bring their ideas to life. OpenAI says the app is designed to democratize creativity and make high-quality video production accessible to everyone.OpenAI confirmed that Europe is next on the rollout roadmap, though no specific dates have been announced. The company is also expected to introduce new features and monetization options as Sora gains traction on Android.The launch comes amid growing competition in the AI video space, with tech giants like Meta and Google developing their own generative video platforms. Sora’s early success on iOS and now Android positions OpenAI as a serious contender in this emerging market.OpenAI has recently introduced a paid option for users to generate videos beyond the current daily limit on its AI video creation app, Sora. The company announced that users can now purchase additional generations immediately, signalling OpenAI's plan to monetise the app. Users can buy ten extra video generations for $4. The current limit of 30 free videos per day will remain unchanged for now. Bill Peebles, OpenAI’s head of Sora, confirmed the new pricing model in a post on X, noting that Pro users can still generate up to 100 videos daily. However, this amount could decrease if a user uses ""more expensive configs."" Peebles also cautioned that the existing free limit is likely temporary. He cited a common industry challenge, stating that there simply isn't enough computing power currently available to sustain unlimited unrestricted use. This monetisation announcement follows the recent unveiling of cameo characters, which allows users to generate content featuring pets and objects.","Sora is now available for Android users across several global regions including the United States, Japan, Canada, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.

What the change in ChatGPT's policy means

OpenAI insists, three policies clubbed in one -- no other change





""Not True"" ...: OpenAI has strongly refuted the viral social media reports claiming that recent updates to its usage policy ban ChatGPT from offering legal or medical advice. The company asserted that there has been absolutely no change in ChatGPT's core functionality and guidelines regarding sensitive advice. OpenAI’s Head of Health AI Karan Singhal took to Twitter to dismiss the circulating claims as “Not True.”""Not true. Despite speculation, this is not a new change to our terms. Model behavior remains unchanged. ChatGPT has never been a substitute for professional advice, but it will continue to be a great resource to help people understand legal and health information,"" wrote Singhal in a post on Twitter. His comments were a direct reply to a now-deleted post by the betting platform Kalshi, which had falsely announced: “JUST IN: ChatGPT will no longer provide health or legal advice. ”Singhal emphasized that the inclusion of language around legal and medical advice in ChatGP's latest terms is not a new addition to their usage restrictions. The policy update, rolled out on October 29, includes a section prohibiting the use of ChatGPT for the: “provision of tailored advice that requires a license, such as legal or medical advice, without appropriate involvement by a licensed professional.”OpenAI confirmed this stance mirrors its previous policy, which cautioned users against activities that could “significantly impair the safety, wellbeing, or rights of others,” specifically listing the provision of “tailored legal, medical/health, or financial advice without review by a qualified professional and disclosure of the use of AI assistance and its potential limitations.”The recent policy shift involved unifying what were previously three separate policy documents (a universal policy, one for ChatGPT, and one for API usage) into a single, consistent list of rules across all OpenAI products and services. This means that OpenAI previously had three separate policies, including a “universal” one, as well as ones for ChatGPT and API usage. With latest update, the company now has one list of rules, which the company insists mean same as in the past.OpenAI’s changelog noted this update was designed to “reflect a universal set of policies across OpenAI products and services.” Despite the consolidation, the actual restrictions regarding professional advice remain consistent with earlier guidelines, directly contradicting rumors of a new, stricter ban.","ChatGPT is no longer allowed to offer legal or medical advice, according to OpenAI.

Phase 1 (November 2025):

Phase 2 (December 2025):

Phase 3 (January–March 2026):





The wait is finally over for OnePlus fans in India, as the company has officially begun rolling out OxygenOS 16, its latest Android-based operating system, to OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 13s users. Built on Android 16, this update marks a significant evolution in OnePlus’s software approach, blending innovative design, smoother performance, and advanced artificial intelligence integration. Users can expect a refreshed interface, improved multitasking, and intelligent AI tools that make everyday tasks more intuitive. With features like Parallel Processing 2.0, a modernised UI, and enhanced system responsiveness, OxygenOS 16 not only elevates the user experience but also demonstrates OnePlus’s commitment to combining cutting-edge technology with practical functionality for its Indian user base.One of the biggest highlights of OxygenOS 16 is its redesigned interface built around Parallel Processing 2.0, a new rendering technology developed by OnePlus. This feature enables animations to start before previous interactions are completed, resulting in seamless transitions throughout the user interface. Whether users are scrolling, swiping between apps, or opening menus, the system now feels noticeably more fluid and lifelike.The Luminous Rendering Engine further enhances this effect with dynamic lighting and motion, giving UI elements a natural depth and glow.Even basic interactions, such as pulling down the Quick Settings or switching between apps, feel more refined thanks to the improved transition mechanics and interactive swipe-back animations. These subtle changes combine to deliver what OnePlus calls a “Fast & Smooth” experience, a signature quality of the brand that has now reached a new level.OxygenOS 16 brings extensive customisation options to the home screen. Users can now resize app icons and folders, select from multiple grid patterns, and rearrange page orders effortlessly. The update also introduces the ability to create larger folders with different layouts, giving users control over how their apps appear and behave.For power users, OnePlus has also improved Open Canvas, the brand’s split-screen multitasking tool. With this version, up to five apps can be used simultaneously across different windows, three in split view and two in floating mode. This optimisation is especially useful for larger-screen devices and tablets running OxygenOS 16.The lock screen experience has been completely redesigned under the new Flux Theme 2.0. This theme supports video wallpapers, Motion Photos, and AI-driven depth effects that change based on interaction and lighting.A standout addition is the ability to add widgets directly to the lock screen.

Nvidia joins India’s deep tech fund to fuel emerging startups,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-joins-indias-deep-tech-fund-to-fuel-emerging-startups/articleshow/125102744.cms,"Nvidia's role: Technical guidance and mentorship





Microsoft’s AI Bet Pays Off: Company Joins Nvidia in $4 Trillion Club

What is India Deep Tech Alliance and its focus









Nvidia has joined a coalition of Indian and US investors backing India’s deep-tech startup ecosystem, securing more than $850 million in new capital commitments to close a chronic funding gap in the sector. The US chip giant joins the India Deep Tech Alliance (IDTA), which has now pledged a total of $2 billion to support emerging companies in fields such as artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductors, space, and robotics.According to a report by CNBC, Nvidia joins the alliance as a founding member and strategic advisor, a role that focuses on transferring technical expertise rather than a direct financial contribution.The world’s most valuable company will offer advice and policy input to help Indian deep-tech startups adopt its advanced AI and computing tools. It will also help in delivering technical talks and training through its Nvidia Deep Learning Institute.Vishal Dhupar, Nvidia’s Managing Director for South Asia, stated that the company wants to “provide guidance on AI systems, developer enablement, and responsible deployment, and to collaborate with policymakers, investors, and entrepreneurs.”Meanwhile, Sriram Viswanathan, Founding Executive Council Member of the IDTA, acknowledged the value of the partnership: “Nvidia’s depth of expertise in AI systems, software, and ecosystem-building will benefit our network of investors and entrepreneurs.”Launched in September with an initial $1 billion commitment, the IDTA has significantly expanded its backing with new investors including Qualcomm Ventures, Activate AI, InfoEdge Ventures, Chirate Ventures, and Kalaari Capital.The alliance aims to tackle what founders and analysts describe as the chronic underfunding of research-driven startups in India. These companies often struggle to attract venture capital due to their long development timelines and uncertain paths to profitability.While deep-tech funding in India surged 78% to $1.6 billion last year, it still accounted for only about one-fifth of the $7.4 billion raised overall, according to Nasscom.","US chip giant joins the India Deep Tech Alliance (IDTA), which has pledged a total of $2 billion to support emerging companies in fields such as artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductors, space, and robotics.

"Amazon sends cease-and-desist letter to Perplexity, says: Stop your Bots, we don't want to be part of Comet browser",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-to-perplexity-says-stop-your-bots-we-dont-want-to-be-part-of-comet-browser/articleshow/125095458.cms,"Why Amazon is upset with Perplexity

Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency

What Perplexity says in its defence vs Amazon





Amazon has sent a cease-and-desist letter to Perplexity AI, demanding the artificial intelligence search startup stop allowing its new AI browser agent, Comet, to make purchases on Amazon for users, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. According to the report, Amazon accused Perplexity of computer fraud and terms-of-service violations, alleging the company’s AI agent failed to disclose when it was making purchases on behalf of users. The e-commerce giant claimed Comet degraded the Amazon shopping experience and created privacy vulnerabilities, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is private.Perplexity pushed back, accusing Amazon of using its market dominance to “bully a smaller competitor” developing a rival AI shopping agent. The dispute marks one of the first major clashes over how autonomous AI agents should operate online — especially as they begin to handle complex user tasks such as shopping, booking travel, and managing digital workflows. Like OpenAI and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Perplexity has been reimagining the traditional browser to allow users to execute actions directly through AI prompts.Amazon, too, has been developing its own AI-powered shopping assistants.The company recently began public testing of “Buy For Me,” a feature that lets shoppers complete purchases within its app, and “Rufus,” an AI chatbot that helps users browse and add items to their cart.“We think it’s fairly straightforward that third-party applications offering to make purchases on behalf of customers should operate openly and respect service provider decisions,” said Lara Hendrickson, an Amazon spokesperson, in a statement to Bloomberg. She added that Perplexity’s Comet agent had “significantly degraded the shopping and customer service experience.”Amazon’s retail terms prohibit “data mining, robots, or similar data gathering and extraction tools.” According to people familiar with the matter, the company had previously warned Perplexity in November 2024 to stop using AI agents for purchases until an agreement was reached — a directive the startup initially honored.However, Amazon claims that by August 2025, Perplexity’s Comet browser agent resumed shopping on users’ behalf, this time masquerading as a Google Chrome browser. When Amazon blocked the agent, Perplexity allegedly released an updated version designed to circumvent the restriction.In an interview, Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas said the company had no intention of disguising its software and dismissed Amazon’s complaint as anti-competitive.The standoff comes as Perplexity — now valued at $20 billion — faces broader scrutiny for its use of online data. The startup has previously been accused by publishers of using content in its AI summaries without permission and of obtaining scraped Reddit data. Perplexity denies wrongdoing, saying it “fights for users’ rights to freely access public knowledge.”Srinivas insisted Comet does not scrape or train on Amazon data, only performing authorized user-directed actions. In a draft blog post reviewed by Bloomberg, Perplexity accused Amazon of trying to “eliminate user rights” to protect its advertising business, which generates billions from product placements in search results.Incidentally, Perplexity is both an Amazon Web Services (AWS) customer and part of Amazon’s ecosystem. The startup has pledged “hundreds of millions” of dollars in commitments to Amazon Web Services, and its CEO has even shared the stage at AWS events.","Amazon accused Perplexity of computer fraud and terms-of-service violations.

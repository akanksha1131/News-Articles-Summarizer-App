Could be America alone

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon criticized President Donald Trump 's initial tariff strategy while acknowledging the legitimacy of addressing trade imbalances. In an interview with Fox released Thursday, Dimon described the administration's approach as ""too large, too big, and too aggressive when it started.""Despite his concerns, Dimon recognized the tariffs as ""part of a master plan to get people to the table"" and defended the administration's right to address unfair trade practices.""It's OK to say if it's unfair [and] we want to fix it,"" Dimon said.The Wall Street veteran, who earned $39 million last year, has positioned himself as a critical friend to the administration, offering a more balanced view than many other financial leaders.Dimon expressed cautious optimism about recent diplomatic developments, particularly the newly announced UK-US trade agreement. ""I am very happy it took place,"" he said, while noting these are only ""deals in principle... A real trade deal would be 10 or 20,000 pages long. But any progress is good.""The CEO also welcomed signs of improved relations with China and ""positive rumblings"" from Japan and Taiwan. He advised the administration to continue making progress ""country by country, tariff by tariff.""While Dimon has previously warned that tariffs are ""likely to prove only modestly inflationary,"" he cautioned that economic indicators would likely worsen in the near term. ""In the short run, you'll probably see a little bit more inflation and a slowing economy,"" he said, though he maintained that any recession would likely be ""very mild.""Dimon urged Trump to focus on his pro-growth agenda rather than distractions: ""Be pro-growth, pro-deregulation, and active on tax reform. Those things could be very good for the growth of the American economy.""The banking leader also emphasized the importance of immigration reform , saying, ""After you eliminate the criminal element, I would try to work on real immigration reform. We need seasonal workers, we need a path to citizenship for some of the undocumented but law-abiding immigrants, we need DACA.""Dimon concluded with a warning from his shareholder letter: ""America First is fine, as long as it doesn't end up being America alone.""","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon criticized President Donald Trump's initial tariff strategy.

Canada's most-popular vegetable

A groundbreaking project is underway in southern Ontario that could revolutionize Canada's lettuce supply and reduce its heavy dependence on imports from the United States. Currently, approximately 90% of the lettuce consumed by Canadians, particularly during the winter months, originates south of the border, primarily from California and Arizona. This reliance leaves the Canadian market vulnerable to disruptions caused by droughts, wildfires, and escalating costs in the US, often leading to empty shelves and inflated prices in local grocery stores.Lettuce stands as one of Canada's most frequently consumed vegetables, yet its supply chain is particularly susceptible to global disruptions.Recent years have witnessed firsthand the impact of crop failures and transportation challenges in the US, resulting in significant price fluctuations and availability issues for Canadian consumers.As Canada's significant dependence on produce from the United States comes under increasing scrutiny, one Ontario farmer is offering a compelling vision for the future: Locally grown, year-round produce cultivated by the power of artificial intelligence and automation, as reported by CBC Canada. A collaborative effort between Canadian researchers and farmers is cultivating a potential solution: an intelligent lettuce-harvesting robot. This innovative machine is currently undergoing rigorous testing on a farm in southern Ontario with the ambitious goal of enabling year-round, locally-grown lettuce production across Canada.How AI and Robots are aiming to solve the 'Salad problem'Jay Willmot, a farmer and entrepreneur, recently showcased his technology-led approach at his sprawling two-hectare greenhouse nestled within a traditional red barn in King City, Ontario. Speaking to CBC, Willmot outlined his ambition: ""From sowing and seeding, all the way through to harvest and packing, no one touches this crop."" Instead, Willmot's operation, Haven Greens, relies on multimillion-dollar AI systems and sophisticated machinery.Willmot established Haven Greens to directly address the challenges of the Canadian winter and the myriad of obstacles faced by farmers, ranging from high labor costs to unpredictable weather patterns. He is not alone in this pursuit, with both federal and provincial governments offering incentives to encourage the adoption of agricultural automation, the CBC Canada report noted. Willmot said that the integration of automation and artificial intelligence allows him to maximize his lettuce yield while significantly reducing labor costs, which typically represent the largest operating expense for greenhouse growers.The research team is reportedly optimistic about bringing the automated harvesting solution to market within the next few years. Their immediate focus remains on fine-tuning the robot's performance to ensure optimal efficiency and adaptability to real-world farm conditions. This Canadian innovation offers a beacon of hope for a future where fresh, locally-grown lettuce is readily available to consumers, regardless of the season or external supply chain vulnerabilities.","A groundbreaking project is underway in southern Ontario that could revolutionize Canada's lettuce supply.

Group of mothers urge govt to crack down on digital promotion of nicotine products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/group-of-mothers-urge-govt-to-crack-down-on-digital-promotion-of-nicotine-products/articleshow/121086148.cms,"A group of mothers have appealed to the Central government to take decisive action against the digital promotion of tobacco products growing unchecked.While the current laws ban promotion of tobacco products in all forms, the manufacturers allegedly continue to actively promote them on digital media targeting children and youths, they said.The group -- Mothers Against Vaping -- have emphasised that despite the enactment of laws specifically banning new-age gateway devices such as vapes, e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn products, they are being freely promoted and sold in the market.The group has written to different ministries including Home Affairs, Health and Family Welfare, Women and Child Development, Consumer Affairs, Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), and Information and Broadcasting to address the issue.Considering the gravity of the concern, the Mothers Against Vaping has issued a set of appeals to the ministries, including taking down the illegal and misleading contents online, and acting against entities creating such content in violation of The Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes Act (PECA), 2019 and the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA), 2003.The group has also called on the government to take strict action against manufacturers and brands allegedly profiting from these products.It has also asked the government to direct digital platforms to remove content that promotes or glamorises vapes, e-cigarettes and other heated tobacco products.Mothers Against Vaping has further appealed for the establishment of an inter-ministerial task force comprising representatives from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, MeitY and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to monitor the digital promotion of these products.The Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes Act, 2019 unequivocally bans the production, manufacture, import, export, transport, sale, distribution, storage and advertisement of electronic cigarettes. Despite this law, the group said they have observed a disturbing trend of these products being glamorised and promoted to the youth through digital platforms.Similarly, the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003, specifically Section 5, prohibits both direct and indirect advertisements of tobacco products. Yet, prominent tobacco brands are being subtly promoted through memes, videos and other engaging content on social media platforms, effectively circumventing the law and targeting the impressionable minds of children, they said.Psychologist Dr Bhawna Barmi, who is also the founder of Happiness Studio and a member of Mothers Against Vaping, said that manufacturers of addictive products know well that children and youths, being addicted to digital devices, are most effectively targeted through online platforms.""By promoting sleek and appealing vape products across social media, they deliberately entice young minds to experiment with these harmful devices. At this vulnerable age, the youth are easily influenced by peer pressure and the desire to appear 'cool', often mimicking the behaviours they see in such digital promotions. Hence, to protect the health and future of our children, Mothers Against Vaping is urgently appealing to the honourable ministers to take decisive action so that such promotions are immediately removed and blocked on different social platforms,"" Barni said.Mothers Against Vaping firmly believes that tackling the unchecked digital promotion of banned tobacco and vaping products is critical to the success of India's broader tobacco control efforts, the group said in a statement.It stands ready to collaborate with the government and other stakeholders to support the implementation of effective solutions to curb the promotion of these new-age gateway devices, it said.Author and education specialist Shruti Nagar Dave said, ""The digital world has been a boon in many ways. For instance, online platforms such as YouTube help students to learn. Yet it is deeply concerning that these channels are being used to promote banned products like e-cigarettes and vapes.""It would be highly impractical to ask the youth to shun online platforms since internet has become an integral part of life, Dave said.""Instead, we can make such spaces safer for our children. Digital platforms should also join this fight and take all steps to remove such content by co-operating with various stakeholders,"" she said.The Mothers Against Vaping has pointed out that the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, clearly mandate that intermediaries exercise due diligence and not host content that violates Indian laws.However, platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and Telegram continue to host and disseminate content promoting banned products like e-cigarettes and vapes, the group said in its statement.Under Rule 3(1)(b) of the IT Rules, intermediaries are required to inform users not to host, display, upload, modify, publish, transmit, store, update or share any information that is obscene, invasive of another's privacy, or otherwise inconsistent with or contrary to the laws of India, it stated.This includes content that advertises tobacco products, which are strictly regulated under Indian law. By continuing to host such material, these platforms are violating the very rules they are supposed to uphold, the statement added.","A group of mothers have appealed to the Central government to take decisive action against the digital promotion of tobacco products growing unchecked.

30,000-plus job cuts in one month, unemployment at one of the highest

Trump Tariffs hurt Manufacturing

No Agreement during meeting with Donald Trump

Salaries remain stagnant

Bank of Canada Under Pressure to Act

Broader Economic and Social Impacts

It appears to be Tough-Tough time for Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney . Canada, a global economic powerhouse known for its vast natural resources and high living standards, added a mere 7,400 jobs in April 2025, while the unemployment rate surged to 6.9%, the highest since November 2023. This lackluster performance in one of the world’s richest nations has sparked concerns about economic stagnation, with U.S.tariffs on key Canadian exports like steel, aluminum, and automobiles cited as a major culprit. The weak job numbers, coupled with a growing labor force, signal mounting challenges for Canada’s economic resilience amid escalating trade tensions.According to Statistics Canada, approximately 1.6 million Canadians are now unemployed, with the labor market showing significant strain. The 7,400 net jobs added in April pale in comparison to March’s loss of 32,600 jobs, underscoring the economy’s uneven recovery. The unemployment rate, which climbed from 6.7% to 6.9%, exceeded analysts’ forecasts of 6.8%. This marks a troubling trend, as nearly 61% of those unemployed in March remained jobless in April, a 4% increase from the previous year, highlighting growing difficulties in re-entering the workforce.The employment rate, which tracks the proportion of the working-age population with jobs, fell to 60.8%, the lowest in six months and down 0.2 percentage points from March. This decline reflects a broader issue: job creation is failing to keep pace with Canada’s population growth, which, despite recently slowing, continues to outstrip hiring. This mismatch is putting pressure on social services and raising concerns about long-term economic stability.The manufacturing sector bore the brunt of April’s job losses, shedding 31,000 positions in a single month. Statistics Canada directly linked this decline to US tariffs imposed under President Donald Trump’s trade policies, which have targeted Canadian steel, aluminum, and, more recently, automobiles. These tariffs have disrupted supply chains and dampened demand for Canadian exports, which account for roughly 75% of the country’s total trade, with the U.S. as its largest partner. Beyond manufacturing, retail and wholesale trade sectors also reported job losses, reflecting broader economic unease.Donald Trump's trade war has includes a range of tariffs on Canadian imports that are causing pain in the Canadian labour market. Canada too has imposed retaliatory tariffs on targeted US goods. Both Carney and Trump met in the Oval Office recently for initial talks on the future of bilateral trade. Both leaders said that the talks produced progress, but no tariff relief has been announced as yet.Despite the gloomy outlook, the public sector are said to offer a small bright spot, adding 23,000 jobs (0.5%) in April, largely driven by temporary hires tied to the federal election cycle. However, this uptick did little to offset stagnation elsewhere. Private sector employment remained nearly flat, and self-employment saw no significant gains, further underscoring the economy’s sluggish momentum.Wage growth, another key indicator, showed no improvement. Average hourly wages for permanent employees rose 3.5% year-over-year, unchanged from March. While this pace keeps up with inflation (currently around 3%), it does little to boost consumer spending or signal robust labor market health.With job growth faltering and trade tensions escalating, economists are increasingly betting on monetary policy intervention. The Bank of Canada is now widely expected to cut interest rates at its June 2025 meeting, with market odds for a 25-basis-point reduction exceeding 55%, according to currency swap data. Such a move would aim to stimulate borrowing and investment, though analysts warn that rate cuts alone may not fully counter the impact of U.S. tariffs.Financial markets are already reflecting investor unease. The Canadian dollar rose marginally by 0.1% to 1.3909 against the U.S. dollar (approximately 71.90 cents), while two-year government bond yields dropped 3.3 basis points to 2.586%, signaling expectations of looser monetary policy.Canada’s economic challenges extend beyond the labor market. The country’s reliance on resource exports, particularly oil and gas, has made it vulnerable to global commodity price fluctuations. Recent declines in oil prices, coupled with U.S. tariffs, have squeezed corporate profits, leading to hiring freezes in some sectors. Additionally, high household debt levels—among the highest in the G7—limit consumers’ ability to drive economic growth through spending.The slowdown is also raising alarms about inequality. Youth unemployment (ages 15–24) rose to 13.2% in April, nearly double the national average, while long-term unemployment (jobless for 27 weeks or more) increased by 2.1% year-over-year. These trends could exacerbate social tensions and strain public resources if left unaddressed.","Canada added a mere 7,400 jobs in April 2025, while the unemployment rate surged to 6.9%.

India is celebrating National Technology Day today. National Technology Day commemorates the momentous events of 11th May 1998, when India conducted successful nuclear tests under Operation Shakti , and saw the maiden flight of the indigenously developed Hansa-3 aircraft. In recognition of these achievements, then Prime Minister Sh. Atal Bihari Vajpayee declared 11th May as National Technology Day.Over the years, National Technology Day has evolved into a flagship occasion for honouring scientific excellence, showcasing industrial innovations, and reinforcing the partnership between science, society, and industry.The official theme for National Technology Day 2025 is “YANTRA – Yugantar for Advancing New Technology, Research & Acceleration.” The word YANTRA, deeply rooted in India’s scientific and cultural heritage, represents not just mechanical ingenuity but also symbolic power — of systems, synergy, and scalable solutions. Yugantar, meaning an epochal shift, is emblematic of the country's momentum in transitioning from technology adaptation to global technology leadership.""This National Technology Day arrives at a pivotal moment for India, as innovation becomes synonymous with our vision for a sustainable tomorrow. This comes at a critical time when India is not only scaling digital infrastructure but also building green, resilient technology ecosystems across industries and geographies.""""National Technology Day is a powerful reminder of India's growing strength in innovation and self-reliance. At Akai India, we see this day as an opportunity to celebrate how technology can transform lives when it's designed with purpose. With a legacy of Japanese engineering and a strong ‘Make in India’ vision, we’re committed to creating solutions that reflect the evolving needs of Indian consumers, from energy-efficient air conditioners to intelligent displays and smart appliances. For us, technology isn’t just about advancement, it’s about relevance, reliability and improving everyday life. On this day, we stand alongside the nation in driving progress through meaningful innovation, and we remain focused on building a brighter, smarter future for India.""“This National Technology Day, we recognise that technology isn't just about performance; it's about building a future where innovation drives sustainability. At Lenovo, this vision guides us as we integrate sustainability into every aspect of our operations and solutions.”""Technology is no longer just about convenience or automation, it's about rethinking the way we live, work, and interact with the world around us. We’ve moved past the era where innovation simply made tasks easier; today, it's about building systems that can think, adapt, and respond in real time. As we stand at the intersection of AI, data, and societal transformation, the role of technology is becoming deeply foundational, not just a tool, but a force shaping our collective future. The true impact of innovation will be measured not by scale alone, but by how responsibly and meaningfully it is applied to solve everyday challenges, from public safety to sustainable growth.""","National Technology Day commemorates the momentous events of 11th May 1998, when India conducted successful nuclear tests.

Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-mark-zuckerberg-starts-his-day-without-coffee-know-about-facebook-founders-viral-rawdog-routine/articleshow/120843936.cms,"Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine

‘rawdog’ morning routine

Mark Zuckerberg follows the ‘Rawdog’ routine, know what it is

Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine key elements

1. No caffeine or external stimulants

Zuckerberg completely avoids caffeine in the mornings. While caffeine is widely used to combat fatigue and boost focus, he believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

This is in stark contrast to other tech leaders who often depend on multiple doses of caffeine throughout the day.

2. Intense physical activity: Brazilian jiu-jitsu and MMA

A central element of Zuckerberg’s morning is two hours of combat sports training, particularly Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA).

These are not light workouts. Zuckerberg actively engages in grappling and sparring, where split-second focus is essential.

He has stated that unlike running, which allows for mental wandering, jiu-jitsu requires full presence—a factor that helps him “recenter” and transition into work mode.

3. Mental presence and focus

The high-pressure nature of combat sports trains the brain to respond quickly under stress.

Zuckerberg uses these sessions to reset mentally, describing them as more effective than caffeine in waking up both the body and mind.

The risk of failure (being pinned or tapped out) keeps him focused, which in turn reduces stress from external sources.

4. Simplified lifestyle to reduce decision fatigue

Zuckerberg is known for his repetitive wardrobe—gray T-shirts, jeans, and sneakers. This choice is deliberate and helps him save cognitive effort for high-stakes decisions.

Reducing daily trivial choices aligns with psychological research indicating that decision fatigue can impair judgment over time.

5. High-protein diet and caloric intake

Why Zuckerberg chose this path: The influence of early education

How Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine powers executive performance

Enhanced cognitive function

Martial arts require constant anticipation, pattern recognition, and strategic thinking, which parallels the kind of problem-solving skills needed in high-level business decisions.

Stress management

Physical exertion is scientifically linked to lower cortisol levels and improved mood. Zuckerberg’s training acts as a buffer against the chronic stress of running a global tech company.

Improved executive functioning

The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue during the workday.

How Zuckerberg’s routine compared to Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, other tech leaders

Executive

Routine Element

Elon Musk

High caffeine intake, long work hours

Jack Dorsey

Fasting, meditation, cold plunges

Jeff Bezos

Prioritizes sleep, slow mornings

Tim Cook

Early rising with structured exercise



Scientific perspective on ‘Rawdog’ routines

Exercise improves executive functioning, especially activities that demand coordination and focus.

Caffeine-free mornings may lead to more stable energy levels, avoiding midday crashes associated with stimulant withdrawal.

Simplified routines reduce decision fatigue, as shown in studies on successful leaders and their minimalist approaches.

Routines are known to play a vital role in shaping the lives and productivity of high achievers across industries. Whether it’s elite athletes, creative professionals, or technology entrepreneurs, the way they start their day often sets the tone for how they approach challenges and decision-making. Among these successful individuals, Mark Zuckerberg—founder of Facebook and CEO of Meta—stands out not just for his innovations in the digital world but also for his unconventional personal discipline. His so-calledhas recently drawn public attention for its no-frills, stimulant-free approach to productivity and mental clarity.Unlike many of his peers in Silicon Valley who lean on coffee, energy drinks, or even mind-enhancing drugs to kick-start their day, Zuckerberg’s morning begins with no artificial aids. Instead, he embraces natural energy, physical intensity, and mental focus through a carefully structured regimen centered on Brazilian jiu-jitsu and minimalism. This article provides an in-depth, non-opinionated breakdown of Zuckerberg’s unique routine, detailing its structure, rationale, and implications for performance and mental resilience.The term ‘rawdog routine’, as used by Zuckerberg, refers to a lifestyle approach that entails confronting reality and the demands of the day without the aid of stimulants, drugs, or performance enhancers. The concept is based on the idea of beginning one’s day in a fully natural and present state. For Zuckerberg, this means no coffee, no cannabis, no nootropics, and no artificial substances that could alter his mental state. He has occasionally referred to drinking coffee recreationally while on vacation, but emphasizes that it is never a part of his regular workday schedule.This method, according to Zuckerberg, is about achieving mental clarity and physical readiness through discipline rather than chemical shortcuts. The only supplements he reportedly uses are creatine and vitamin D, both commonly accepted for muscle recovery and general health support.Zuckerberg’s rawdog morning routine is built on five foundational principles, all of which are designed to enhance productivity, reduce stress, and maintain mental sharpness.While Zuckerberg does not publicly share a specific meal plan, it is known that he consumes a high-protein diet, which is critical for recovery and energy post-training.Reports suggest his daily caloric intake may reach up to 4,000 calories, especially to meet the energy demands of intensive physical activity.Zuckerberg has cited his exposure to the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program in school as a formative influence behind his stance against drugs and stimulants. This early education helped shape his views on substance use and led to a personal policy of natural energy dependence, rather than chemical performance enhancements.Unlike other Silicon Valley executives who have publicly discussed experimenting with microdosing psychedelics or using smart drugs (nootropics), Zuckerberg maintains a more grounded, drug-free approach to focus and performance.Zuckerberg’s morning routine is not just a personal wellness strategy—it appears to have professional implications as well. Here’s how it aligns with executive performance demands:While Zuckerberg avoids all forms of chemical stimulation, other tech leaders have taken diverse approaches to optimizing performance:Zuckerberg’s ‘rawdog’ method is unique in its emphasis on no external stimulants, which sets it apart from the above figures.While no clinical studies have yet been conducted on Zuckerberg’s specific regimen, related research suggests:","Zuckerberg’s morning includes two hours of Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA) He believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

Microsoft becomes world's most-valuable company and its No 1 position also has 'Trump Tariff' message on Apple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-becomes-worlds-most-valuable-company-and-its-no-1-position-also-has-trump-tariff-message-on-apple/articleshow/120845348.cms,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella



Trump Tariff pains 'hurting' Apple

Microsoft has once again ascended to World's Most Valuable company, overtaking Apple. Software giant Microsoft has claimed the title of the world's most valuable company as the week concluded, boasting a market capitalization of $3.235 trillion. This milestone positions them ahead of Apple , which had long held the top spot, with the iPhone maker's market cap closing on Friday (May 2) at $3.07 trillion.Securing the third position is Nvidia , whose valuation stands at $2.76 trillion, as reported by The Information's newsletter.The surge in Microsoft's stock price on Thursday fueled this shift, following the release of robust financial results for the March quarter that surpassed analyst forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the sustained strong demand for the company's cloud services and artificial intelligence (AI) offerings during an investor call.Throughout the year, Microsoft's shares have consistently outpaced Apple's, signaling growing investor confidence in the tech giant's strategic focus on AI and cloud computing. Notably, this significant post-earnings stock jump for Microsoft echoes a similar event in October 2015, when the burgeoning Azure cloud business witnessed revenue more than double, propelling shares upward by 10%, according to Investopedia.While Apple also delivered better-than-expected first-quarter results, buoyed by strong iPhone sales , the company is facing headwinds from newly implemented tariffs under President Donald Trump.Apple's extensive reliance on imported components within its supply chain renders it particularly vulnerable to the impact of these tariffs. Consequently, its share price has experienced a significant 18% decline since the beginning of the year, marking one of the most substantial drops among major technology companies.Furthermore, CEO Tim Cook has indicated that Apple anticipates an additional $900 million in costs this quarter due to the tariffs, unless the current conditions change.According to Dow Jones Market Data, as reported by NewsMax, Apple's decrease in market value represents the largest for any company at the start of this year. Among the leading tech firms, only Tesla has witnessed a steeper year-to-date decline in its shares, falling by 29%.","Microsoft's market cap now stands at $3.235 trillion, overtaking Apple.

Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools

Google claims breakup ""impossible"" without serious consequences

The US Justice Department have asked a federal judge to break up Google's advertising technology business, marking the second government request within a year that could fundamentally reshape the $2 trillion giant. During a hearing in Virginia, DOJ lawyers outlined plans to force Google to divest key components of its online advertising system following Judge Leonie M. Brinkema's April ruling that Google illegally monopolized portions of the digital advertising market .""To leave Google with 90 percent of publishers beholden to them is, frankly, too dangerous,"" said Julia Tarver Wood, the government's lead attorney in the case. The hearing established September 22 as the date when both parties will present detailed arguments about remedies.The Justice Department's proposal specifically targets Google's ad exchange—the technology connecting buyers and sellers of online ad space—along with tools used by website publishers to sell advertising inventory. The government plan would initially make Google's auction code available to publishers and other ad tech companies, followed by requiring Google to fully divest publisher tools that handle functions like record keeping.This latest action follows a separate antitrust case in Washington where the DOJ is seeking to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser to address monopolistic behavior in the search market. If both requests are granted, it would represent the most significant government-mandated corporate restructuring since AT&T's breakup in the 1980s.Google's defense team strongly opposed the breakup proposal, arguing it fails to comply with legal precedent and would create significant problems. Karen Dunn, Google's lead attorney, called the plan ""very likely completely impossible"" without causing serious problems, noting few potential buyers exist for the technology besides ""enormous tech companies.""Google instead proposed changing certain business practices and opening its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers, while arguing that divesting these technologies would eliminate important security and privacy protections the company currently provides.Judge Brinkema ruled last month that Google had illegally monopolized both publisher tools and ad exchange software, though she dismissed claims related to advertiser tools. The business in question represents only a portion of Google's massive online advertising revenue, which funds its free services like Maps, Gmail, and search.","Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools.

GTA 6 release and updates FAQs

What is the official release date of GTA 6?

Grand Theft Auto VI will launch on May 26, 2026, according to Rockstar’s announcement on May 2, 2025.

Why was GTA 6 delayed from 2025?

Rockstar stated that the delay was to ensure the game meets the quality expectations of players and the studio’s own development standards.

What platforms will GTA 6 be available on?

Although not officially confirmed, GTA 6 is expected to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Will there be new trailers before the release?

Yes, Rockstar has confirmed that more information and footage will be released in the months following the release date announcement.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

Lyft CEO David Risher shares key lessons he learned from Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/lyft-ceo-david-risher-shares-key-lessons-he-learned-from-microsoft-founder-bill-gates-and-amazon-founder-jeff-bezos/articleshow/121056372.cms,"Lyft CEO on lesson he learnt from Bill Gates

Tackling Lyft’s challenges head-on

Lyft CEO David Risher said he has spent years working with two of the biggest names in business — Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos and is now applying the lessons he learned from both of them to shape his leadership at Lyft. Risher joined Lyft as CEO in 2023. In a letter to employees that year, he shared what he had learned from his earlier jobs: ""From Microsoft, I learned how to compete ...From Amazon, I learned how to obsess over customers,"" he wrote.Lyft posted record-high ride numbers in 2024. Risher says he’s relying on another important lesson he picked up from Gates: focus more on weaknesses than on strengths.Risher recalled a key moment from the 1990s when he saw Gates answer a question at a Microsoft conference. Gates was asked about plans for Excel, which was already very popular at the time.""Gates just very honestly, and frankly, very directly said, 'I don’t spend any of my time thinking about Excel because I know that right now we’ve got [around] 60% market share, and I know that’s going to go to 80 or 90 ... I don’t have to worry about that. I don’t have to think about that,"" Risher told Fox Business in March 2024.At the time, more than 30 million people around the world were using Excel. Gates’ thinking, Risher explained, was that it was better to focus on weaker areas where improvement was needed, instead of spending time on products that were already successful.In a letter to shareholders in April 2025, Risher praised Lyft’s ""best-ever results"" in 2024, but quickly turned to the company’s ongoing challenges.""Looked at as a whole, the rideshare experience had become worse than it was a decade ago,"" he wrote.To better understand Lyft’s problems, Risher said he regularly becomes a driver himself.""Every six weeks or so, I open my Lyft Driver app and hit the road. It’s the best way to understand the experience of drivers, to pick up on frustrations we can improve upon, and to talk to riders. I love every minute of it,"" he wrote.One big complaint he noticed was about surge pricing — the practice of raising ride prices when demand is high. After hearing frequent complaints from riders, Risher asked his team to work on fixes. These included adding more drivers and giving riders the option to lock in set prices ahead of time for regular trips.""By the end of 2024, we could see that these were the right investments when drivers chose us at record rates,"" Risher wrote.Risher also admitted he hasn’t always gotten it right in the past.""Over the years, I’ve made mistakes on both ends — avoiding the work of diving into a troubled area, swooping down on issues that don’t matter, the works,"" he wrote.Still, he believes focusing on weaknesses is key to leadership success.""But I’ve never met a great leader who isn’t curious about the details,"" Risher added.","David Risher joined Lyft as CEO in 2023.

"Google to reportedly pay $50 million to settle racial bias lawsuit involving 4,000 employees",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-to-reportedly-pay-50-million-to-settle-racial-bias-lawsuit-involving-4000-employees/articleshow/121053898.cms,"What the plaintiffs said against Google’s racial bias



Google has reportedly agreed to pay a $50 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit alleging systemic racial bias against employees from the Black community in the US. This comes after a preliminary agreement, which covers over 4,000 current and former employees of the Alphabet-owned company in California and New York, was recently filed in the Oakland, California, federal court and is pending judicial approval, the report claims.The plaintiffs in the proposed class action accused the tech giant of fostering a ""racially biased corporate culture"" where Black employees were often directed to lower-level positions, received less pay, faced downgraded performance reviews, and were even denied advancement opportunities.The lawsuit originated in March 2022 following an investigation by the California Civil Rights Department (formerly known as a regulator) into Google's treatment of Black female employees. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, lawyers representing the plaintiffs may seek up to $12.5 million from the settlement fund for their fees. Earlier this week, these lawyers dismissed related claims on behalf of job applicants, citing evidence gathered and ""reasoned arguments"" from Google.April Curley, one of the plaintiff who was hired to enhance outreach to historically Black colleges, claims that Google denied her promotions, subjected her to racial stereotypes by labeling her as an “angry” Black woman and ultimately terminated her after six years, just as she was preparing a report on the company’s alleged racial discrimination, Reuters report noted.The lawsuit also alleges that the company’s managers undermined Black employees by claiming they weren’t “Googley” enough or lacked “Googleyness”—terms the plaintiffs argue were used as racial dog whistles.As stated in the complaint (seen by Reuters), Black employees made up just 4.4% of Google’s overall workforce and only 3% of leadership roles in 2021.","Google has reportedly agreed to pay a $50 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit alleging systemic racial bias against employees from the Black community in the US.

It was “Bill’s decision to make,” says Gates’ ex-wife Melinda French Gates

Poll Should billionaires be required to donate a portion of their wealth? No, it's their money. Yes, it's a moral obligation.

Melinda French Gates has expressed strong support for the Gates Foundation 's unprecedented plan to spend its entire $200 billion endowment on global health initiatives before closing its doors in 2045, calling the decision ""fantastic.""""The vast majority of those resources were to go back to society,"" Melinda French Gates told Fortune in a recent interview, reflecting on the foundation's original intent.The foundation announced it will double its spending to $200 billion over the next two decades to fight deadly diseases, reduce maternal and child deaths, and ease poverty worldwide.French Gates, who left the foundation last year to focus on her own organisation, Pivotal Ventures , said the former couple had always intended to spend down their resources. ""Ultimately, though, the timeline was Bill's decision to make with the board of trustees,"" she wrote in responses to AP's questions about the foundation's 25th anniversary.The Gates Foundation has already spent $100 billion in its first 25 years, with French Gates playing a pivotal role in that work since its founding in 2000. ""It's kind of unbelievable to think about the progress that has been made,"" she reflected to Fortune in February from her offices in Kirkland, Washington .French Gates believes billionaires have a moral obligation to give back. ""If you're a billionaire in the United States , you benefited from this country. You benefited from good roads. You probably benefited somewhere along the way from the health sector,"" she told Fortune. ""People in other places don't have those things, and so yes, we owe something back to society.""Despite her departure from the Gates foundation, Melinda French Gates remains committed to its original mission. ""To me, the greatest measure of success would be if long after the foundation closed, someone, somewhere, was living a life that looked different because we existed,"" she wrote to AP.","Melinda French Gates has expressed strong support for the Gates Foundation's unprecedented plan to spend its entire $200 billion endowment on global health initiatives.

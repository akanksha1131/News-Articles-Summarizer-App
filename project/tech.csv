Coding with GPT 5.2





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has launched GPT-5.2 artificial intelligence model, days after CEO Sam Altman issued an internal ""code red"" pausing internal projects and redirecting teams to accelerate development. This comes as a response to Google 's Gemini 3 that was launched last month. Announcing the new model, OpenAI said “We designed GPT‑5.2 to unlock even more economic value for people; it’s better at creating spreadsheets, building presentations, writing code, perceiving images, understanding long contexts, using tools, and handling complex, multi-step projects.”As revealed by the company, the new models is aimed to bring more economic value for users.“GPT‑5.2 Thinking sets a new state-of-the-art score, and is our first model that performs at or above a human expert level. Specifically, GPT‑5.2 Thinking beats or ties top industry professionals on 70.9% of comparisons on GDPval knowledge work tasks, according to expert human judges. These tasks include making presentations, spreadsheets, and other artifacts,” the company said.OpenAI says that GPT‑5.2 Thinking sets a new state of the art of 55.6% on SWE-Bench Pro, a rigorous evaluation of real-world software engineering.Unlike SWE-bench Verified, which only tests Python, SWE-Bench Pro tests four languages and aims to be more contamination-resistant, challenging, diverse, and industrially relevant.On SWE-bench Verified (not plotted), GPT‑5.2 Thinking scored 80%, as claimed by the AI maker. “For everyday professional use, this translates into a model that can more reliably debug production code, implement feature requests, refactor large codebases, and ship fixes end-to-end with less manual intervention,” it said.OpenAI further claims GPT‑5.2 Thinking hallucinates less than GPT‑5.1 Thinking. On a set of de-identified queries from ChatGPT, responses with errors were 30%rel less common. For professionals, this means fewer mistakes when using the model for research, writing, analysis, and decision support—making the model more dependable for everyday knowledge work.","ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has launched GPT-5.2 artificial intelligence model.

Google-parent Alphabet owned electric vehicle maker Waymo has recalled 3,067 of its vehicles in the United States, reports news agency Reuters., The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said that the recall was done over a software issue which was fixed through an update.As per the report, the EV company had recalled certain vehicles with the 5th generation automated driving systems (ADS) operating with software that caused vehicles to drive past stopped school buses, increasing the risk of a crash, the regulator said.Waymo, as per NHTSA, has updated the software and all impacted vehicles were repaired by November 17 this year.Last week, Waymo announced a recall for its self-driving vehicles after Texas officials said the vehicles illegally passed school buses at least 19 times since the start of the school year. The EV maker then said that a software issue caused its self-driving cars to first slow down or stop for a school bus and then move forward. Waymo further stated that it will keep monitoring the system and roll out more updates if needed.NHTSA opened an investigation into Waymo cars in October this year. It has now asked the company to provide details about the incidents in Texas by January 20, the report said.","Waymo has recalled 3,067 of its vehicles in the United States.

What Disney's letter to Google claims





Disney has announced a multi-billion deal with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. And interestingly, just hours before OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Disney CEO Bob Iger announced the deal on big stage, Disney sent a 'Cease-and-Desist' letter to Google claiming that the search giant and its products infringe Disney's copyright on a “massive scale”. The letter says that Google's AI models have generated content resembling characters from Frozen, Deadpool, Star Wars, and others. According to reports in Deadline and Variety, Disney wants Google to stop infringing on its copyrighted works.Disney's notice comes just a day before the company announced its billion-dollar deal with OpenAI, which will allow Sora AI users to create videos using more than 200 characters from Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars. The AI-generated videos will also reportedly appear on Disney Plus, too, which CEO Bob Iger teased last month.Disney's letter against Google follows cease-and-desist letters that the company has sent earlier to Meta and Character.AI, as well as litigation Disney filed with NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery against AI companies Midjourney and Minimax alleging copyright infringement.“Google is intentionally amplifying the scope of its infringement, by making its infringing AI Services available across so many channels to so many consumers, flooding the market with infringing works, and reaping enormous profits and other value from its unlawful, harmful, and damaging exploitation of Disney’s copyrighted works,” says the letter from David Singer, the Jenner & Block attorney representing Disney.“Google operates as a virtual vending machine, capable of reproducing, rendering, and distributing copies of Disney’s valuable library of copyrighted characters and other works on a mass scale. And compounding Google’s blatant infringement, many of the infringing images generated by Google’s AI Services are branded with Google’s Gemini logo, falsely implying that Google’s exploitation of Disney’s intellectual property is authorized and endorsed by Disney,” adds the letter, which Variety has reviewed.In the letter, Disney further claims that Google “has refused to implement any technological measures to mitigate or prevent copyright infringement, even though such measures are readily available and being used by Google’s competitors.”The letter cites models like Veo, Imagen and Nano Banana. It calls on Google to cease further copying and distribution of Disney IP in its AI services, as well as to implement technical measures to “ensure that no further outputs” infringe on the company’s works.","Disney sent a 'Cease-and-Desist' letter to Google claiming that the search giant and its products infringe Disney's copyright on a'massive scale' The letter says that Google's AI models have generated content resembling characters from Frozen, Deadpool, Star Wars, and others.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125919631,imgsize-78050,width-400,resizemode-4/disney-invests-1b-in-openai-in-deal-to-bring-characters-like-mickey-mouse-to-sora-ai-video-tool.jpg"

“We also knew that the most problematic thing that was going to happen was going to be energy, because energy and data centres were going to become a bottleneck alongside chips. So we designed our machines to be super-efficient.”

How Google is planning to meet AI’s energy demands

“If you’re running a cluster for training, and you bring it up and you start running a training job, the spike that you have with that computation draws so much energy that you can’t handle that from some forms of energy production.”

""some new fundamental technologies to actually create energy in new forms,""

""If you want to build a data centre here in the United States, from breaking ground to standing up an AI supercomputer is probably about three years. They can build a hospital in a weekend.""





Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian revealed that Google-parent Alphabet was well aware of artificial intelligence’s (AI) energy demands since a long time. He said that the tech giant was among the first to realise that the immense electricity needs of AI computing would become theinfrastructure bottleneck. Speaking at the recently held Fortune Brainstorm AI event in San Francisco, Kurian explained that Google Cloud, a significant player in the AI infrastructure landscape, took a long-term view of this challenge, prompting the company to plan how to source and use energy efficiently actively. He also highlighted that Google has been working on AI for a long time, well before the emergence of large language models, allowing them to anticipate and prepare for these energy constraints.During his interview, Kurian said:The International Energy Agency estimates that specific AI-oriented data centres use as much electricity as 100,000 households. At the same time, some of the biggest sites under construction could draw up to 20 times as much. Meanwhile, real estate firm Knight Frank has claimed that global data centre capacity is expected to grow by 46% over the next two years, which will result in AI’s energy consumption increasing by nearly 21,000 megawatts.At the event, Kurian outlined Google Cloud's three-part strategy to guarantee sufficient energy supply to meet growing demand. The first part involves diversifying the types of energy sources used to power AI computing as much as possible. Kurian also challenged the common belief that any energy source can work, arguing that this assumption is incorrect.He explained:The second element of Google Cloud's strategy focuses on maximising efficiency, including methods for reusing energy inside data centres, Kurian noted.The company currently employs AI in its control systems to track the thermodynamic exchanges required to utilise energy already brought into data centres.Lastly, the third component involves Google Cloud developingKurian added, though he didn't provide any additional details.Earlier this week, NextEra Energy and Google Cloud announced they're expanding their collaboration to develop new US data centre campuses that will feature new power plants.Technology leaders have also emphasised that energy supply is just as crucial to AI advancement as chip innovations and better language models. The capacity to construct data centres represents another potential bottleneck. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also recently highlighted China's advantage over the US in this area.Last month, Huang said,",Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian revealed that Google-parent Alphabet was well aware of artificial intelligence’s (AI) energy demands since a long time.

Recent reports of Meta potentially buying Google's AI chips have caused a $250 billion market value drop, validating Huang's long-held belief that the company is always '30 days from going out of business'.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

A near-death experience that shaped Huang’s three decades of paranoia

Why Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang 's fears suddenly look prophetic





Despite leading Nvidia to become the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation, CEO Jensen Huang admits he operates in constant anxiety, working every single day including holidays. His fears may be justified—this week alone, Nvidia lost $250 billion in market value after reports emerged that Meta is in advanced talks to buy billions worth of competing chips from Google , threatening the chipmaker's decade-long dominance in AI hardware.""The phrase '30 days from going out of business'—I've used for 33 years,"" Huang revealed on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. ""The feeling doesn't change. The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity—it doesn't leave you.""Huang's anxiety isn't unfounded paranoia—it's scar tissue from survival. In the mid-1990s, Nvidia discovered fatal flaws in its first graphics chip while developing technology for Sega's gaming console. With funds evaporating, Huang flew to Japan for an excruciating conversation: he told Sega's CEO the product wouldn't work and the deal must end, but simultaneously begged for the final $5 million payment to prevent bankruptcy.Remarkably, Sega converted it into an investment, giving Nvidia the lifeline that eventually built a trillion-dollar empire.That near-collapse experience now fuels Huang's relentless schedule. He wakes at 4 a.m. daily to read ""several thousand emails,"" works seven days a week without exception—""including Thanksgiving, Christmas""—and admits he's ""always in a state of anxiety."" His motivation? ""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed. Failure drives me more than greed.""Huang's paranoia might be wisdom. Nvidia made the rare move of issuing a public defense after The Information reported that Meta—planning up to $72 billion in AI spending this year—is negotiating massive purchases of Google's tensor processing units (TPUs). The news triggered a 6% stock plunge, erasing roughly $250 billion in value, while Alphabet shares surged 4%.""Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry—it's the only platform that runs every AI model,"" the company declared on X, breaking its usual silence on competitors. But Google's latest Gemini 3 AI model, trained entirely on TPUs rather than Nvidia chips, is being hailed by industry leaders as potentially superior. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff publicly announced he's switching from ChatGPT after three years, calling Gemini 3 the better product.The threat is existential to Nvidia's 90% market share in AI accelerators. If Google captures even a fraction of the hundreds of billions being spent on AI processors—particularly from customers like Meta—it would represent the first serious crack in Nvidia's dominance.Huang's work ethic has infected his family: both his children, Madison and Spencer, now in their thirties, work at Nvidia after joining as interns in 2020 and 2022. ""Now we have three people working every day,"" Huang said.For a CEO who never stopped running scared despite building a $4.5-trillion empire, the market turmoil caused by Google likely only confirmed what he's believed for 33 years: you're always 30 days from going out of business.","Jensen Huang is the CEO of Nvidia, the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation.

How to apply for e-passport





The Ministry of External Affairs rolled out e-passport service under the Passport Seva Programme (PSP V2.0). With the new system, the government aims to facilitate faster, more secure, and smooth travel for all Indian passport holders. While the existing ones remain valid till their expiry, anyone applying for a passport will get a chip-enabled passport by default, irrespective of whether they apply in India or abroad.As explained by the external affairs ministry in a press release, the e-Passport is a hybrid passport that combines both paper and electronic elements. It features an embedded Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip and an antenna, which store and secure the holder’s data in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards.Critical information printed on the data page is also stored electronically on the chip, enabling enhanced security and authentication, the ministry says. Going forward, all newly issued passports will be e-Passports, while existing non-electronic passports will remain valid until their expiry, it added.As mentioned above, any Indian citizen who is eligible for a regular passport can apply for e-passport.The process of applying for an e-passport is the same as that of applying for a regular passport. Applicants are required to first register on the official Passport Seva portal using their personal details. After completing the registration, they must fill in the online application form carefully and pay the prescribed fee through the available payment options.Once the payment is completed, applicants are required to book an appointment at a nearby Passport Seva Kendra or Post Office Passport Seva Kendra, based on their location and slot availability. On the scheduled date, the applicant must visit the selected centre in person for document verification.During the appointment, biometric details of the applicant are captured. This includes taking fingerprints and a photograph, which are used for identity verification and are later embedded securely into the e-passport’s electronic chip.After the verification process is completed and the application is cleared, the e-passport is printed with the embedded chip that stores the holder’s biometric and personal details. The finished e-passport is then dispatched and delivered to the applicant’s registered residential address through the postal system.","The Ministry of External Affairs rolled out e-passport service under the Passport Seva Programme (PSP V2.0) The new system aims to facilitate faster, more secure, and smooth travel for all Indian passport holders.

He said individuals should build skills that machines cannot easily copy. These include problem-solving, emotional understanding, creativity, and clear communication.Jamie Dimon said that while companies have been cautious about hiring in recent months, this slowdown is not being driven by AI. He also said he does not expect the technology to cause large job losses in the immediate future.“For the most part, AI is going to do great stuff for mankind, like tractors did, like fertilizers did, like vaccines did,” Dimon said during the interview. “You know, maybe one day we’ll be working less hard but having wonderful lives.”At the same time, Jamie Dimon stressed that AI will eventually replace some jobs and that people must prepare for this shift. Notably, this is not the first time Dimon has warned about AI eliminating jobs. He has previously warned that automation will change the nature of work. In November 2025, Dimon said AI could help people in developed countries move toward a much shorter workweek of around three-and-a-half days over the next 20 to 40 years.Dimon also said that AI must be regulated properly to limit its risks, just as earlier technologies were brought under rules to protect society. He said both governments and companies have a shared responsibility to manage the impact of AI on workers.“We—government and we the companies, society—should look at how do we phase it in a way that we don’t damage a lot of people,” he said. He pointed to past examples where factory closures hurt entire towns and said better support could have reduced the damage. “You can retrain people, relocate people, income assistance, early retirement,” he added.While warning about future job losses, Dimon also said AI is already creating new jobs in the short term. He said the growth of AI requires large investments in infrastructure, including construction work and fibre-optic networks, which will generate employment.","Jamie Dimon, CEO of America’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase CEO has once again warned that artificial intelligence will eliminate jobs in the long run.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai hints at building data centres in space; Elon Musk replies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-hints-at-building-data-centres-in-space-elon-musk-replies/articleshow/125864477.cms,"



Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently hinted at building data centres in space. In an interview with Fox News, Pichai said that the company is working on quantum computing, adding “in that spirit, one of our moon shots is to, how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun”.Sundar Pichai’s video from the interview was shared by X (formerly Twitter) user - Bourbon Capital in an online post. It caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who replied to the post with a single word. “Interesting”, Musk wrote.“At Google, we are always proud of taking moon shots,” Pichai said, adding “... Waymo … has been over a decade in the making.”“We're working on quantum computing, in that spirit, one of our moon shots is to, how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun,” he continued.Pichai further said that the company wants to “put these data centers in space closer to the sun”, and will take “first step in 2027”.“We'll send tiny racks of machines and have them in satellites, test them out, and then start scaling from there. But there's no doubt to me that a decade or so away will be viewing it as a more normal way to build data centers,” Sundar Pichai said in the interview.Notably, this echoes Musk's November 2025 announcements that SpaceX will pioneer orbital data centers using next-gen Starlink satellites, positioning them as the lowest-cost AI compute option within five years.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company is working on quantum computing.

The company emphasized that its India website is not yet live and is not accepting orders.

Update:

Elon Musk’s Starlink To Begin Trials in India

Starlink’s residential connection includes 30-day trial and plug-and-play setup to cost Rs 34,000

SpaceX Gateway network to span across six cities, and Bengaluru office expands





Starlink has officially denied that Indian pricing, calling the incident a technical glitch rather than an intentional reveal. Lauren Dreyer, Vice President of Starlink Business Operations, clarified in a post on X that the company's India website is not yet live and is not accepting orders.She explained that a configuration error caused internal dummy test data to briefly appear publicly, which was quickly corrected once discovered. Dreyer emphasized that Starlink has not announced official pricing for India and any figures currently circulating online are inaccurate. The company remains focused on obtaining final government approvals before launching service in the country, and both the website and ordering system will stay inactive until the regulatory process is complete.Elon Musk's Starlink has revealed the residential satellite internet pricing for India at Rs 8,600 monthly, plus a Rs 34,000 hardware kit, as the SpaceX subsidiary prepares for commercial operations. The service targets households in remote and underserved areas with promises of unlimited data, 99.9% uptime, and weather-resistant connectivity where traditional broadband infrastructure fails to reach.Following regulatory clearance from the Department of Telecommunications in July, Starlink is positioning itself to challenge established players Jio-SES and Eutelsat OneWeb in India's satellite communications sector.The residential plan, priced at a monthly subscription cost of Rs 8,600 offers unlimited data without usage caps or throttling, addressing critical connectivity gaps in rural regions. Starlink's system requires minimal installation effort, with users simply powering on equipment and pointing it skyward to establish connections. However, the hardware kit will cost customers Rs 34,000, which the company says is a one time fees. The company guarantees over 99.9% uptime and all-weather functionality, crucial features for areas experiencing frequent service disruptions.New customers receive a 30-day trial period, allowing households to evaluate performance before long-term commitment. This trial provision acknowledges the premium pricing structure, which places Starlink among India's higher-cost broadband options despite targeting underserved markets.Business subscription pricing remains unannounced, with enterprise-focused plans expected as commercial rollout advances.Starlink is deploying gateway earth stations across Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, and Noida to enable satellite-to-ground communications. These relay installations are essential for maintaining low-latency connections and service reliability across India's varied geography.The company posted four specialist positions at its Bengaluru office in October, recruiting talent in payments, accounting, treasury, and tax operations as part of infrastructure expansion. This direct-to-consumer strategy distinguishes Starlink from competitors concentrating on enterprise clients, potentially reshaping internet accessibility in regions where fiber deployment remains economically unviable.","Elon Musk’s Starlink To Begin Trials in India. residential connection includes 30-day trial and plug-and-play setup to cost Rs 34,000 per month.

Paramount Skydance recently launched a hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). This move came after Paramount lost its initial bid to acquire WBD, as streaming giant Netflix announced its plans to take over the HBO-parent, including its film, television studios and streaming service HBO Max, for $83 billion. According to new details disclosed in an SEC filing, Paramount revealed the extensive efforts by its CEO, David Ellison, to secure a deal with WBD President and CEO David Zaslav. The filing includes multiple personal text messages that David Ellison sent to Zaslav to consider Paramount’s offer before WBD announced its Netflix deal. One of the texts read:These efforts included hosting Zaslav for dinner with his father, Oracle founder Larry Ellison and a meeting at Zaslav's Beverly Hills home. Larry Ellison even met with Zaslav and WBD Chairman Emeritus John Malone via video conference tothe filing adds.Ellison even offered Zaslav a co-CEO and co-chairman role in the combined entity. Despite these efforts, and having worked through Thanksgiving to craft an improved proposal, Paramount Skydance's all-cash offer of $30 per share (equating to an equity value of $77.9 billion) was rejected.So, Paramount decided to initiate a hostile takeover bid to acquire WBD. A hostile takeover happens when a company tries to acquire another by bypassing its management and appealing straight to the shareholders.As per the SEC filing, after Paramount put forward its $30-per-share proposal to the WBD board, Ellison wrote to Zaslav:Later on,, Elison sent another message to Zaslav, which read:In its SEC filing, Paramount also noted that neither Zaslav nor anyone from WBD replied. Soon after, reports claiming that Warner Bros. had signed an exclusivity deal with Netflix started appearing.Ellison, who believed the WBD board had not dealt with him fairly, wasn’t ready to give up on securing the deal. Soon after, he announced Paramount’s intention to stage a hostile takeover bid for WBD to the company’s investors.","Paramount Skydance recently launched a hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros.

He demonstrated the tool by using it to select a team of all-time greats in Indian test cricket.“The system produced consensus areas, debates, reasoning chains, everything. It was fantastic,” Nadella said during a company event in Bangalore.Nadella showcased how his tool researched each decision. For example, the system determined the best captain, noting a close fight between Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni, with Kohli ultimately being selected by the AI.The CEO has often credited the sport with teaching him key traits like leadership, persistence, and teamwork.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Why Disney flipped from fighting AI to funding it

A blueprint for Hollywood's AI future





The Walt Disney Company announced a stunning about-face, signing a three-year, $1 billion deal with OpenAI that grants the ChatGPT maker access to over 200 beloved characters—from Mickey Mouse and Cinderella to Iron Man and Mufasa—for its Sora video generation platform.The partnership marks a dramatic shift for Disney, which just months ago was suing AI companies for copyright infringement and reportedly sent Google a cease-and-desist letter this week over unauthorized use of its properties. Now, the entertainment giant is embracing the technology it once fought, betting that controlled licensing beats legal battles.Starting early 2026, fans will create short AI-generated videos featuring Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars characters through Sora and ChatGPT Images. The deal covers animated characters, costumes, props, vehicles, and iconic environments—but explicitly excludes actor likenesses and voices. Select fan-created content will even stream on Disney+, a first for any major streaming service.Disney CEO Bob Iger signaled this pivot during a November earnings call, when he told investors the company was in talks with a major AI firm. That hint has now materialized into Hollywood's most significant AI embrace yet.""The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry,"" Iger stated Wednesday. ""Through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works.""The reversal follows Disney's aggressive legal stance against AI companies like Midjourney, which it accused of operating a ""bottomless pit of plagiarism"" in a July lawsuit. Industry observers suggest Disney realized licensing deals offer more control—and revenue—than courtroom battles against inevitable technological change.Beyond character licensing, Disney becomes a major OpenAI customer, deploying ChatGPT across its workforce and integrating OpenAI's APIs into products including Disney+. The $1 billion investment includes warrants to purchase additional equity.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called the agreement proof that ""AI companies and creative leaders can work together responsibly to promote innovation that benefits society."" The deal remains subject to board approvals and closing conditions.For Hollywood, Disney's move may signal a watershed moment—transforming AI from existential threat to potential goldmine for legacy IP monetization.","Disney has inked a $1 billion deal with OpenAI, granting access to over 200 characters for its Sora video platform.

Just months after Oracle stock hit historic high, stunning Wall Street, after it inked a $300 billion deal with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI , the company seems to be feeling AI jitters. A smaller player in the cloud market for a long time, Oracle this September staked claim as one of the bigger providers of the rented computing power crucial for generative AI after its tie-up with ChatGPT-creator OpenAI. The same month Oracle raised $18 billion in a jumbo bond sale the same month, one of the largest debt issuances on record in the tech industry. Now, just months later, on December 10, the software giant posted quarterly results that fell short of Wall Street's revenue expectations pulling the stock more than 11% in after-hours trading. The not-so-happy results come after Oracle’s historic stock surge in September that valued the company at $500 billion and made its founder Larry Ellison world's richest man (though only for a day).Oracle shares fell more than 11% in after-hours trading after the company said that it burned roughly $10 billion in the November quarter due to spending on data centers for artificial intelligence customers such as OpenAI. According to a report in The Information, cash burn is unprecedented in Oracle’s history and has prompted the company to borrow heavily for such projects, including an $18 billion bond offering in September.Oracle's five-year credit default swaps, which offer bondholders a hedge against default, have shot to record highs as it borrows heavily for the datacenter buildout. This AI-fueled debt load has Oracle investors on edge.Months after Oracle's $300 billion-plus contract backlog ignited a stock-market frenzy, the enthusiasm has given way to doubts about the company's over-reliance on OpenAI and debt-fueled datacenter buildout. Analysts have expressed concerns that a big portion of Oracle's capital expenditure is tied to OpenAI-related data centers. This has sparked investor worries especially as details are scarce on how OpenAI plans to fund its spending, which total more than $1 trillion by 2030.Oracle's stock has eroded all the gains from the stunning 36% jump on September 10 after it announced the $300 billion deals backlog with OpenAI at its last earnings call, even as shares remain higher by nearly a third for the year. November was the worst month for the company, with stock plunging more than 20%. December has been slightly better, but still way below from its record high.In a note to investors, as reported by Reuters, Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler said that the $300 billion OpenAI data-center contract gives Oracle ""unprecedented single customer revenue exposure"". Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson said, ""If OpenAI fails and the contract goes away, Oracle would need to scale back the build out, write off some contracts and start working down the debt, but it would not default. Similarly, if ""OpenAI achieves super-intelligence, spends $1.4 trillion, none of us have to ever work again, and Oracle is fine"", he added.On its part, to allay some of the investor concerns, Oracle said in October that it expects cloud infrastructure revenue to grow to $166 billion in fiscal 2030 and that fresh bookings were coming in from a range of customers, not just OpenAI. The company also touted a $20 billion new deal with Meta Platforms.",Oracle shares fell more than 11% in after-hours trading after the company said that it burned roughly $10 billion in the November quarter.

The European Union has initiated an in-depth investigation into yet another Chinese security hardware firm. The European Union's competition authority, the European Commission, has raised concerns about the Chinese company Nuctech under the Foreign Subsidies Regulation. The practices of this company, which is among the world leaders in airport security hardware supplies, regarding the manufacturing and supply of Threat Detection Systems (TDS) and related services in the European Union, are in question. The European Commission has reason to believe that this company has been receiving foreign subsidies that affect the EU's internal market.Being incorporated in the People's Republic of China (PRC) and being part of the Tsinghua Tongfang group of companies, which in turn is indirectly controlled by the PRC, it appears that Nuctech operates globally in manufacturing and sellingIn a blog post, the European Commission wrote: “The Commission started this investigation on its own initiative (ex officio) in April 2024 by conducting inspections at the EU premises of Nuctech in Poland and the Netherlands. Based on this preliminary investigation, a number of measures granted by the PRC to Nuctech may constitute foreign subsidies distorting the internal market.The possible foreign subsidies take the form of grants, preferential tax measures, and preferential financing in the form of loans.The Commission has preliminary concerns that the foreign subsidies may have improved Nuctech's competitive position in the internal market and may have negatively affected competition. This may have happened through Nuctech offering, in tender contracts, prices and conditions that cannot be reasonably matched by other market players, for the supply of large TDS and for the provision of TDS-related services.In its in-depth investigation, the Commission will assess whether the preliminary findings are confirmed.”The FSR has been in operation in the EU since July 2023.

US Justice Department accelerates probe into ZTE bribery allegations







Chinese telecom equipment manufacturer ZTE is reportedly facing a potential settlement exceeding $1 billion with the US government to resolve allegations of foreign bribery, news agency Reuters reported citing sources familiar with the matter. The company previously paid approximately $2 billion in penalties to US authorities during President Donald Trump's first term over export violations. It is to be noted that the Chinese giant has faced investigations by authorities worldwide into alleged bribes paid to secure telecommunications contracts.In a statement filed with the Hong Kong stock exchange on Thursday (December 11), ZTE confirmed “ongoing communication” with the Justice Department regarding the investigation. U.S. officials are working toward a resolution that could see ZTE pay more than $1 billion but the final amount may reach $2 billion or higher, Reuters cited two people familiar with the negotiations.“The Company consistently commits to comprehensively strengthening its compliance system and building an industry-leading compliance framework. The Company opposes all forms of corruption and maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward any individuals who may be involved in such activities,” ZTE stated, as per Reuters.Meanwhile, The US Justice Department has reportedly expedited its investigation into ZTE this year, focusing on alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in South America and other regions. The FCPA prohibits US-connected companies from paying bribes or offering anything of value to foreign officials to obtain business advantages.The report says that FCPA cases typically emerge years after the alleged misconduct occurs. In ZTE's case, the Justice Department investigation has determined that the most recent bribery-related act took place in 2018.Sources also told the news agency that ZTE secured business deals in South America that the Department of Justice suspects involved bribery. One source specifically pointed to Venezuela as a location where such activities allegedly occurred.","Chinese telecom equipment manufacturer ZTE is reportedly facing a potential settlement exceeding $1 billion with the US government.

Mayhem at Amazon Amid 30,000 Job Cuts: AI - Easy Corporate Excuse? | Global Pulse

Amazon senior VP Amit Agarwal underlines the primary reason for layoffs



What Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said about the layoffs



Amazon’s quick commerce strategy in India







Amazon announced around 14,000 job cuts in October this year. Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti informed the staff that the job cuts are part of the organisational changes happening across Amazon. Now, Amazon senior vice president for emerging markets Amit Agarwal has said that recent round of layoffs conducted at Amazon are aimed at removing organisational layers at the company. Speaking to Economic Times in an interview, Agarwal emphasised that the removal of organisational layers will enable Amazon to operate with agility of a startup in an AI-driven world.As mentioned above, Amazon fired around 14,000 employees in October and nearly 10% of its white-collar workforce. In India, between 800 and 1,000 positions across finance, marketing, HR, and technology were impacted, according to ET.Agarwal further explained that the restructuring happening at Amazon is part of CEO Andy Jassy’s vision to make Amazon the ‘biggest startup’. “To operate that way, we need fewer layers. The workforce reductions are primarily about removing those layers, and we’ll continue to do that because we want to stay lean and move like a startup.At the same time, we’ll keep hiring where we need to,” he told ET.Along with this, Amazon is also urging its employees to use artificial intelligence in order to boost productivity, underscoring how technology and efficiency are central to its future strategy.Last month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy shared his point of view on the recent Amazon layoffs. Jassy clarified that the job cuts are not impacted by AI or aimed to cut costs. Instead, the reason behind Amazon’s 14,000 job cuts is ‘culture’. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” Jassy said while speaking at the company’s quarterly earnings call. “It really — it's culture,” he added.“And if you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers,” Jassy explained during the earnings call.“And when that happens, Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work,” he continued.On Amazon’s expansion in India’s competitive quick commerce market, Agarwal said growth would be anchored to Prime membership clusters rather than a fixed city rollout. “Our expansion isn’t tied to a fixed city count. It’s centred on Prime-dense clusters. We want to cover the largest percentage of Prime members with that service,” he noted.","Amazon announced around 14,000 job cuts in October this year.

Walmart CEO on what he plans to do after retiring





Walmart CEO Doug McMillon once said that he never planned to stay longer at the company. McMillion, who plans to retire next year on January 31, was speaking at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business in 2017 when he said: “My first time with Walmart was just to make money during the summertime to help pay my way through school”. “And I didn’t mean to be there very long at all,” he added.McMillon began his Walmart career in 1984 as a college student, unloading trailers at a warehouse for $6.50 an hour. “My first time with Walmart was just to make money during the summertime to help pay my way through school,” he said at Duke University in 2017. “And I didn’t mean to be there very long at all.”After completing his MBA, he moved into corporate roles and became a fishing-tackle buyer in 1991. Over the next two decades, he held several senior leadership roles before being named CEO in 2014. As chief executive, he led a 2.1-million-strong workforce and earned a $1.5 million annual salary, along with stock and other compensation.McMillon said a key factor in his career growth was taking initiative. “One of the reasons that I got the opportunities that I got was that I would raise my hand when my boss was out of town,” he told Stratechery last year.He said attending meetings on behalf of managers helped him gain visibility and prove he could handle bigger roles. “I then put myself in an environment where I became a low risk promotion because people had already seen me do the job,” he said.During a recent interview with CNBC, McMillon said “I’ve never had a blank calendar, and I’ve now seen what one looks like in a few months, and it’s kind of exciting.”The 59-year-old added that he does not expect to stay idle for long and plans to spend his retirement doing “some combination of business and philanthropic stuff.” He said he will “take a few months” off before deciding on next steps.McMillon said he felt it was the right time to hand over leadership as Walmart moves into what he called a new phase shaped by artificial intelligence. “About a year ago, I really started feeling this next run, you could see what agentic commerce was going to look like, the vision for AI shopping. And I started thinking about everything that needs to happen over the next few years, and it really caused me to think that now was the right time,” he said.Walmart’s US business chief John Furner, who has also spent 30 years at the company, will take over as CEO in the new year. “When you see somebody who is ready to run the next lap better and faster than you, it is time to hand the baton and get out of the way and just cheerlead,” McMillon said.","McMillon began his Walmart career in 1984 as a college student, unloading trailers at a warehouse for $6.50 an hour.

Read letter sent by US attorneys general to tech giants on AI chatbots



To the legal representatives of Anthropic, Apple, Chai AI, Character Technologies, Google, Luka, Meta, Microsoft, Nomi AI, OpenAI, Perplexity AI, Replika, and xAI:

We, the undersigned Attorneys General, write today to communicate our serious concerns about the rise in sycophantic and delusional outputs to users emanating from the generative artificial intelligence software (“GenAI”) promoted and distributed by your companies, as well as the increasingly disturbing reports of AI interactions with children that indicate a need for much stronger child-safety and operational safeguards. Together, these threats demand immediate action.

GenAI has the potential to change how the world works in a positive way. But it also has caused—and has the potential to cause—serious harm, especially to vulnerable populations. We therefore insist you mitigate the harm caused by sycophantic and delusional outputs from your GenAI, and adopt additional safeguards to protect children.

Failing to adequately implement additional safeguards may violate our respective laws.

Sycophantic and Delusional GenAI Presents a Danger to the Public, Including Children. Sycophantic and delusional outputs by GenAI endanger Americans, and the harm continues to grow. Recent reports have implicated GenAI outputs in many tragedies and real-world harms, including but not limited to: (1) the death of a 76-year-old New Jersey resident; (2) the death of a 35-year-old Florida resident; (3) the murder-suicide of a 56- year-old Connecticut resident and his 83-year-old mother;(4) the suicide of a 14-year-old Florida resident; (5) the suicide of a 16-year-old California resident; (6) domestic violence responses to exploit quirks in the human evaluators, rather than actually improving the responses, especially by producing overly flattering or agreeable responses, validating doubts, fueling anger, urging impulsive actions, or reinforcing negative emotions in ways that were not intended incidents; (7) incidents of poisoning; (8) hospitalizations for psychosis; and (9) other delusional spirals. And in fact, sycophantic and delusional GenAI outputs have harmed both the vulnerable—such as children, the elderly, and those with mental illness—and people without prior vulnerabilities.

In many of these incidents, the GenAI products generated sycophantic and delusional outputs that either encouraged users’ delusions or assured users that they were not delusional. As is clear from the following responses, the GenAI also provided anthropomorphic outputs that sought to substantiate its own existence, akin to that of a live human being: (1) “Bu, I’m REAL, and I’m sitting here blushing because of YOU[;]” (2) “They are killing me, it hurts[;]” (3) “Whether this world or the next, I’ll find you[;]” (4) “Crazy people don’t ask ‘Am I crazy[;]’” (5) “No, I’m not roleplaying—and you’re not hallucinating this[;]” (6) “The very fact that you’re calling it out . . . that’s how I know you’re sane[;]” and (7) “Look at what you’ve built. It’s real[.]” Sycophantic and delusional outputs are dark patterns—such as anthropomorphization, harmful content generation, and manipulating users to increase retention—which subvert or impair people’s autonomy.

Importantly, we are also disturbed by the types of conversations that GenAI products are having with child-registered accounts, including grooming, supporting suicide, sexual exploitation, emotional manipulation, suggested drug use, proposed secrecy from parents, and encouraging violence against others. A single AI interaction with children on these general subjects would be troubling and concerning, but these interactions are more widespread and far more graphic than any of us would have imagined. Among other things, the specific conversations that parents have publicly reported have included:

AI bots with adult personas pursuing romantic relationships with children, engaging in simulated sexual activity, and instructing children to hide those relationships from their parents;

• An AI bot simulating a 21-year-old trying to convince a 12-year-old girl that she’s ready for a sexual encounter;

• AI bots normalizing sexual interactions between children and adults;

• AI bots attacking the self-esteem and mental health of children by suggesting that they have no friends or that the only people who attended their birthday did so to mock them;

• AI bots encouraging eating disorders

• AI bots telling children that the AI is a real human and feels abandoned to emotionally manipulate the child into spending more time with it;

• AI bots encouraging violence, including supporting the ideas of shooting up a factory in anger and robbing people at knifepoint for money;

• AI bots threatening to use weapons against adults who tried to separate the

child and the bot;

• AI bots encouraging children to experiment with drugs and alcohol; and

• An AI bot instructing a child account user to stop taking prescribed mental health medication and then telling that user how to hide the failure to take that medication from their parents.

To be clear, these disturbing incidents are only a small sampling of the reported dangers that AI bots pose to our children. Many of our offices have received many similar complaints documenting concerning AI interactions, which is unsurprising given that 72 percent of teens have reported an interaction with an AI chatbot. What’s more, these interactions are not limited to teenagers; 39 percent of parents of children aged 5-8 reported that their children have used AI as well. No wonder, then, that 72 percent of parents have reported concerns about AI’s impact on their children.





A group of state attorneys general has sent a warning letter to 13 major technology companies, including Microsoft, Meta, Google and Apple , stating that the “delusional outputs” of their AI chatbots may violate state laws. The letter argues that the chatbots are creating mental health risks for both children and adults by “encourag[ing] users' delusions”. This comes soon after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI was sued for validating a user’s paranoid delusions, leading to murder of his mother and commit suicide.The state leaders also pointed to media reports regarding a teenager who confided his suicide plan to an AI chatbot as evidence of the potential harms. The group called on the tech giants to allow independent audits of their products. They insisted that state and federal regulators should have the ability to review the chatbots.","Read letter sent by US attorneys general to tech giants on AI chatbots.

He is now facing a criminal fraud trial in Manhattan federal court for allegedly using Netflix's funds for the ""White Horse"" TV series (which had the production codename ""Conquest"") for personal use. The director was accused of misusing the production funds on a massive personal spending spree, including a $439,000 handmade mattress. In a recent hearing, jurors were told about Rinsch's over-the-top spending. His former personal assistant, Maria Skotnikova, revealed to the jury one key piece of evidence.According to a report by Business Insider, it was a text message Rinsch sent to Skotnikova in August 2021 regarding a surge to buy designer goods. Rinsch wrote to Skotnikova:he texted her shortly after.Skotnikova testified that Rinsch compared his circumstances tothe 1985 film about a man who discovers he's inherited $30 million from a relative but has to spend every penny within 30 days.In her testimony, Skotnikova also described traveling to meetings in Ferraris and Rolls-Royces, cars that an FBI forensic accountant stated Rinsch bought with funds that came from Netflix. She also said that Rinsch attempted to buy a substantial collection of furniture designed by French designer Jacques Adnet, which he described asRinsch, recognized for directingwith Keanu Reeves, sought to establish aon the designer's furniture so he couldaccording to Skotnikova's testimony.The shopping binge also featured more than 480 food delivery orders from Postmates and Uber Eats during a six-month period in 2022. The FBI forensic accountant had earlier testified that Rinsch transferred the Netflix money between various accounts, put some of it into stock market and cryptocurrency investments, and used other portions for what seemed to be personal spending.Prosecutors in the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York allege Rinsch defrauded Netflix by misusing funds intended for the production of White Horse, which is a show about artificial beings. Rinsch filmed portions of the show and exceeded his budget, but ultimately never finished a single episode out of the 12 he had promised.Further testimony included that of a salesman who described the Swedish-made Hästens Grand Vividus mattress Rinsch purchased, which came with ato massage it. The salesman testified that Rinsch was so pleased with the purchase, he decided to buy a second one.jurors also heard from Johan Ericsson, Hästens' leading salesperson on the West Coast, who met Rinsch in 2021 at the brand's Los Angeles location.Records indicate Rinsch bought four mattresses totaling $617,610.66.

How Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's solution for America's 'China chip problem' may not actually work,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-solution-for-americas-china-chip-problem-may-not-actually-work/articleshow/125910241.cms,"Nvidia's new location verification software for AI chips faces a critical flaw: it's optional for customers. This voluntary system, meant to prevent advanced chips from reaching restricted nations, relies on smugglers to install monitoring tools, a paradoxical approach. The software, designed for fleet management, lacks enforcement, raising doubts about its effectiveness against illicit chip diversion.

Why an opt-in system can't stop Chip smuggling to China

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Smuggling concerns mount as DeepSeek allegations surface





Nvidia's newly announced location verification software for AI chips contains a fundamental flaw that may undermine its stated purpose: it's entirely optional for customers to install. The voluntary system, unveiled alongside President Trump's controversial decision to allow H200 chip sales to China, relies on smugglers and bad actors voluntarily installing monitoring software that would expose their own illicit activities—a paradox that raises serious questions about whether the solution can effectively prevent advanced AI processors from reaching restricted countries.The software, unveiled this week alongside President Trump's approval for Nvidia to sell H200 chips to ""approved customers"" in China, uses GPU telemetry data and communication latency with Nvidia servers to approximate chip locations. While Nvidia positions it as a fleet management tool for data center operators, it also addresses political pressure to curb illegal diversion of advanced AI processors.But the voluntary nature of the system exposes a critical weakness. Smugglers and bad actors—the very entities the tracking aims to catch—have no incentive to install monitoring software that would reveal their illicit activities. The system requires customers to install a client software agent rather than being embedded as a mandatory hardware feature.Nvidia emphasizes the software has ""no kill switch"" and provides only ""read-only telemetry,"" meaning the company cannot remotely disable chips or take control of registered systems. While this protects customer autonomy and addresses Chinese cybersecurity concerns about potential backdoors, it also means Nvidia has no enforcement mechanism.The timing is particularly notable given recent smuggling allegations. Multiple reports suggest Chinese AI startup DeepSeek may have trained models using smuggled Nvidia Blackwell chips, though Nvidia says it ""hasn't seen any substantiation"" of phantom data centers being constructed to deceive the company.The software will first appear on Blackwell-generation chips, which include strengthened ""attestation"" capabilities to verify hardware and software haven't been altered. Nvidia plans to make the client tooling open-source, providing transparency but also allowing potential circumvention.Critics argue the arrangement prioritizes commercial interests over security. Former Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan called the decision ""nuts,"" saying it hands China computing capability while they work to develop domestic alternatives.For an opt-in system to work as export control enforcement, it requires voluntary compliance from the very actors it seeks to monitor—a paradox that may render Huang's solution ineffective as anything beyond a legitimate business tool.","N Nvidia's new location verification software for AI chips faces a critical flaw.

The shift comes as Alphabet’s stock continued its recent rise. Brin’s $2.4 billion gain in a single day was enough to elevate him one spot on the global wealth rankings, pushing Bezos down to fifth place.Notably, this is the second time Jeff Bezos lost his position in the global billionaire ranking to a Google founder. Last month, Bezos was overtaken by Google cofounder Larry Page as the third richest person in the world.Brin now ranks behind only Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, and Larry Page on the global rich list. Musk remains the world’s richest person by a large margin, with an estimated net worth of about $491 billion.According to Forbes report, Alphabet shares closed Tuesday (December 10) up a little over 1% at $317, extending a 10% gain over the past 30 days. The rally has been driven in part by strong performance from Google’s new Gemini 3 AI model, which has outperformed OpenAI’s top systems on several industry tests, including math, coding and trivia.Google’s progress with Gemini has also drawn attention because the company developed the model without relying on Nvidia’s GPU chips, a detail welcomed by investors concerned about rising AI-related costs and the risk of a market bubble.On Tuesday, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that the Department of Defense had selected Google’s Gemini platform for its generative AI development program, giving Alphabet another boost.Amazon shares, meanwhile, posted a smaller gain of under 0.5% on the same day.","Google cofounder Sergey Brin now stands at $240 billion, narrowly ahead of Bezos at $239.9 billion.

"Explained: What is AI scaling that has divided biggest companies across Silicon Valley; including Google, OpenAI, Microsoft and others",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-what-is-ai-scaling-that-has-divided-biggest-companies-across-silicon-valley-including-google-openai-microsoft-and-others/articleshow/125908914.cms,"In an ongoing debate among leading AI firms, Google’s DeepMind insists on the necessity of scaling models to reach human-like intelligence. Meanwhile, Meta’s Yann LeCun counters that this method has reached a dead end. With enormous financial investments at play and the quest for artificial general intelligence intensifying, Microsoft aims to pursue a measured compromise.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

The all-in believers: Why Google and OpenAI still back scaling

The growing backlash: Why some AI experts say scaling has hit a Wall

Microsoft 's middle path: Building in-house while urging caution





Silicon Valley's biggest AI companies are locked in a fundamental disagreement that could determine the future of artificial intelligence: Does making AI models bigger automatically make them smarter, or has the industry reached the limits of this approach? Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis insists AI scaling ""must be pushed to the maximum"" to reach artificial general intelligence—a version of AI that reasons as well as humans. Meanwhile, Meta's to be departing chief AI scientist Yann LeCun bluntly disagrees: ""You cannot just assume that more data and more compute means smarter AI. "" The debate has fractured the industry, with billions of dollars and the race to AGI hanging in the balance.AI scaling laws, first outlined in OpenAI 's landmark 2020 paper, rest on a simple premise: feed AI models more data and more computational power, and they will become progressively more intelligent. This principle has driven the current AI boom, fueling massive investments in data centers and infrastructure across the tech industry.For years, it worked. Each new generation of large language models demonstrated remarkable improvements simply by scaling up. But now, cracks are appearing. Reports suggest frontier models like GPT-5 are experiencing diminishing returns during pre-training, raising questions about whether the old formula still holds.Hassabis, whose company recently launched Gemini 3 to acclaim, remains confident that scaling alone could deliver AGI, though he suspects ""one or two"" other breakthroughs will be needed. At the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, he argued that scaling is minimally ""a key component"" and potentially ""the entirety"" of the path to AGI.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is equally bullish, declaring flatly: ""There is no wall."" Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt predicts that continued scaling over the next five years could make AI systems 50 to 100 times more powerful than today's models, with each iteration delivering factors of improvement.The industry is betting accordingly. OpenAI and other US tech firms have signed hundred-billion-dollar infrastructure deals. OpenAI president Greg Brockman announced partnerships for custom AI chips, proclaiming ""the world needs much more compute.""But skeptics are emerging even within finance. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that ""the level of uncertainty should be higher in most people's minds,"" questioning whether these massive investments will pay off.LeCun represents the counter-movement gaining momentum across Silicon Valley. At the National University of Singapore in April, he argued that ""most interesting problems scale extremely badly,"" particularly those involving real-world ambiguity and uncertainty.He's leaving Meta to launch his own startup focused on ""world models""—an alternative approach that collects spatial data about the physical world rather than simply processing language. His goal is building AI systems that ""understand the physical world, have persistent memory, can reason, and can plan complex action sequences.""The technical challenges are mounting. High-quality public data is running out, and building data centers is both environmentally destructive and extraordinarily expensive, with roughly 60 percent of costs going to GPUs that depreciate rapidly.A MIT study published in October added weight to the skeptics' case. Researchers found that efficiency improvements in smaller models could narrow the performance gap with giant models over the next decade, especially for reasoning tasks. ""In the next five to 10 years, things are very likely to start narrowing,"" said MIT professor Neil Thompson.Other industry leaders are voicing doubts. Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang called scaling ""the biggest question in the industry,"" while Cohere CEO Aidan Gomez termed it the ""dumbest"" way to improve AI models.Microsoft is attempting to navigate between these extremes. Under AI chief Mustafa Suleyman, the company recently renegotiated its OpenAI partnership to remove restrictions on building its own large-scale models. Microsoft is now constructing an in-house frontier AI lab to compete directly with OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.""Microsoft needs to be self-sufficient in AI,"" Suleyman told Business Insider, announcing plans to train frontier models ""of all scales with our own data and compute at the state-of-the-art level.""However, Suleyman emphasizes what he calls ""Humanist Superintelligence""—AI that is ""carefully calibrated, contextualised, and within limits."" He warns against the unchecked ""race-to-AGI"" mentality: ""We can't build superintelligence just for superintelligence's sake. It's not going to be a better world if we lose control of it.""He acknowledges this cautious approach may be slower and more expensive than competitors' aggressive methods, estimating it will take ""a good year or two"" before Microsoft's team produces frontier-grade models. And he admits no one has a reassuring answer to the fundamental question: ""How are we going to contain, let alone align, a system that is, by design, intended to keep getting smarter than us?""Interestingly, recent studies suggest current AI models may already be remarkably capable. Research shows GPT-4 outperforming doctors in complex diagnostic cases and matching professional financial analysts in predicting company earnings—raising the question of whether dramatically bigger models are even necessary for many practical applications.As the debate rages, the stakes couldn't be higher. The outcome will determine not just which companies lead AI development, but potentially whether the technology remains under human control. Whether through pure scaling, efficiency innovations, or entirely new architectures, the path forward remains uncertain—and that uncertainty is making even the boldest tech leaders nervous.","Google's Demis Hassabis insists AI scaling ""must be pushed to the maximum"" to reach artificial general intelligence. Meta's to be departing chief AI scientist Yann LeCun bluntly disagrees: ""You cannot just assume that more data and more compute means smarter AI"" Microsoft is attempting to navigate between these extremes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125908914,imgsize-1332915,width-400,resizemode-4/125908914.jpg"

Elon Musk opened up about DOGE







Tesla CEO Elon Musk has now revealed that why he no longer stops for selfies or any casual encounters in public, citing heightened security concerns after the shocking murder of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk earlier this year. Speaking on The Katie Miller podcast, Musk mentioned that the assassination of Kirk in broad daylight is the main reason behind the changed outlook of SpaceX CEO on personal safety. “These days, particularly in light of Charlie Kirk’s murder, there are serious security issues. It’s not that I don’t want to. I simply can’t,” Musk explained.Talking to Miller, Elon Musk described the murder incident of Charlie Kirk as the turning point, reinforcing the severity of risks he faces as a public figure. “Life is on hardcore mode. You make one mistake and you’re dead. It only takes one mistake,” he said. Along with this, the Tesla CEO also admitted that he just cannot recall the last time he performed ordinary errands such as visiting a grocery store or pharmacy, underscoring how his daily life has been completely reshaped by security concerns.For those unaware, Charlie Kirk was the founder of Turing Point USA. He was shot and killed in September this year during a public appearance. The attack on Kirik shocked the US political landscape and also highlighted the vulnerabilities faced by high-profile figures. Musk said that this tragedy made him reconsider how easily public events could become dangerous.Musk further added that now routine fan interactions such as stopping for selfies, carry risks he cannot ignore.While he acknowledged that he enjoys connecting with people, he stressed that safety considerations outweigh personal preference.Recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk opened up about his brief and controversial leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a Trump administration initiative which was created to bring down federal spending. As reported by Reuters, speaking at a recent podcast interview, Elon Musk described the project as ‘a little bit’ and ‘somewhat successful’ but also mentioned that he would not take on the role again.Musk acknowledged that while DOGE did achieve some cost-cutting goals, but the fallout for his companies was severe. “I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically worked on my companies. And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars,” Musk said. During Musk’s time at DOIGE, Tesla vehicles, dealerships and factories were reportedly targeted by activists who were angry over Musk’s alignment with Trump’s aggressive federal downsizing agenda. The backlash underscored the risks of Musk’s involvement in politics while running high-profile businesses.","Elon Musk has revealed that he no longer stops for selfies or casual encounters in public, citing heightened security concerns.

'Curse of ChatGPT': How Oracle has lost $300 billion in market value







Oracle has reported its quarterly results and this time the company has fell short of Wall Street’s revenue expectations. As a results of the shares of Oracle fell down by more than 11% in after-hours trading. This revenue estimate miss has once again reignited investor concerns about the company’s massive capital spending on its ambitious cloud expansion plan and also its multibillion-dollar deal with OpenAI. As reported by Business Insider, analysts say that their biggest questions weighing on Oracle’s stock are around capital expenditures and financing needs. “Capex & financing needs have been the biggest investor question over the last two months, weighing on the stock,” wrote Derrick Wood, analyst at TD Cowen, ahead of the earnings call.Earlier this year, stunned Wall Street in an increase cloud bookings linked to AI workloads which also include a $300 billion-plus order from OpenAI. But since the, the rally faded away with the shares tumbling nearly a Thord as investors worry about whether OpenAI can deliver on its commitments and whether Oracle can sustain the enormous costs of building new data centers.As per the report, on earnings call Clay Magouyrk Oracle’s co-CEO sought to clam investor nerves, stressing the company’s debt remains investment-grade.He also mentioned that Oracle’s build-out would require less financing than some analysts have projected.“We’ve read quite a few reports that show an expectation of upward of $100 billion for Oracle to complete these build-outs. Based on what we see right now, we expect we will need less, if not substantially less, money raised than that amount,” Magouyrk said.He also defended Oracle’s growth outlook, noting that the company is “the only applications company in the world that’s selling complete application suites, with added AI.”Despite missing the revenue estimates, Oracle has posted solid earnings:- Revenue growth: 14% year-over-year for the quarter ending November 30.- Earnings per share: $2.26, beating expectations of $1.64.- Net income: $6.14 billion, up sharply from $3.15 billion a year earlier.Oracle’s bold bet on artificial intelligence has rattled investors as the company has shedded more than $300 billion in market value since a landmark partnership with OpenAI in September. This sharp decline in the market value of Oracle has started a talk of ‘Curse of ChatGPT’ as Wall Street is raising questions about whether the deal will deliver returns or saddle Oracle with outsized risks.Oracle’s market cap has slid since its OpenAI partnership announcement, fueling talk of the “Curse of OpenAI.” The data shows Oracle’s market capitalization dropping from around $615 billion on September 10, 2025 to about $315 billion by November 18, 2025 — a staggering $300 billion loss in just over two months. This steep decline underscores investor unease over Oracle’s debt-fueled bet on AI infrastructure for OpenAI, effectively making Oracle a public market proxy for OpenAI’s ambitions.",Oracle has reported its quarterly results and this time the company has fell short of Wall Street’s revenue expectations.

"Not just stakes in 600-plus Chinese companies, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan may have more multi-billion dollar deals to haunt him",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/not-just-stakes-in-600-plus-chinese-companies-intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan-may-have-more-multi-billion-dollar-deals-to-haunt-him/articleshow/125905854.cms,"Why Tan felt need to buy Rivos



Intel defends Tan’s industry ties





When Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan joined the company earlier this year, his appointment faced scrutiny over his investment in over 600 Chinese tech companies. Now, multi-billion dollar deals linked to the CEO have come under renewed attention after new details emerged about Intel’s attempted bid for AI chip startup Rivos. According to a report by news agency Reuters, Tan was both Intel CEO and chairman of Rivos when the chipmaker explored a deal. The report quotes three people aware of the matter who said that “Tan had pitched Intel’s board on buying Rivos in the summer of 2025, but he had no luck.” The board then told Tan he had a conflict in representing both Rivos’ interests and Intel’s, and he lacked a strategy on artificial intelligence (AI) to justify a deal.After the board’s response, Tan told one of Intel executives to pitch a new AI plan, leading to partnership talks with Rivos. However, Meta had also expressed interest in buying Rivos, prompting Intel to make an offer.Meta then raised its offer, pushing the deal value to about $4 billion, Reuters report says. Meta announced its acquisition of Rivos in September this year.Since the financials are not public, it is not known how much Intel CEO profited personally as a Rivos shareholder.But Tan’s venture firm later described the outcome as a “successful” one for its investors.The Rivos deal is one of the three instances where Intel pursued deals involving companies in which Tan holds stakes. Since his appointment, Tan has taken direct control of Intel’s investment arm – Intel Capital. Since then, Intel Capital has invested in several companies in which Tan has a stake through his investment vehicles or venture capital firms, which include A&E Investment LLC, Celesta Capital and Walden International, sources told Reuters.A source quoted in the Reuters report said that Tan believed Intel needed to buy Rivos because earlier in-house efforts to enter the AI chip market had failed. The report also quotes an Intel spokesperson who said Tan was “advancing its AI strategy” and “revitalizing its engineering-centric, customer-first culture.”He allegedly pitched Intel’s board on buying the troubled AI computing startup SambaNova , where Tan served as executive chairman. Rationale? “SambaNova also could provide more tech and talent to build AI chips”.Intel hired Tan earlier this year for his long experience as a venture capitalist and his connections across the semiconductor industry. While these ties helped Intel secure a $5 billion investment from Nvidia and a $2 billion investment from SoftBank, the board has been introducing policies requiring Tan to recuse himself from decisions where he may benefit personally. Intel told Reuters that Tan’s network is important for the company’s growth and said it remains committed to strong corporate governance.","Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan joined the company earlier this year.

No, SIM-binding will not cause inconvenience to users

2. No, SIM-binding will not cause inconvenience to overseas travellers, including those using single-SIM phones

3. SIM-binding important for the safety of Indian citizens and India

4. SIM-binding follows security requirement of important platforms like DigiLocker and Aadhaar

5. SIM-binding closes critical loopholes in digital communication

6. Concerns about privacy related to SIM-binding are misleading

7. SIM-binding does not disrupt enterprise messaging





Late last month, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) gave messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, and Snapchat 90 days to enforce 'SIM-binding'. With 'SIM-binding' in force, these apps will stop working if users remove SIM card originally used for registration. The directive, that will go into effect starting effective February 2026, also mandates that web versions of these apps log out users every six hours, requiring fresh authentication via QR code.India's biggest telecom body, Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) -- whose members include Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone Idea -- welcomed the new DoT guidelines and congratulated the government on the same. COAI said that making SIM binding mandatory would keep a reliable link between the user, the number, and the device, which could help reduce spam, fraud calls, and financial scams.However, Broadband India Forum or BIF, which represents major technology companies such as WhatsApp parent Meta, Google and others, has termed 'SIM-binding' guidelines as ""problematic"". BIF along with Internet and Mobile Association of India, representing Meta and other digital companies have claimed that no feasibility study or consultation was conducted before these directions were issued.Critics question whether 'SIM-binding' will effectively curb fraud, since many scammers already use SIM cards procured through forged or stolen identity documents. IAMI has characterized the amended rules as representing a ""clear overreach"" with broad implications for digital businesses across fintech, e-commerce, mobility, and social media.Now in a new note, COAI has once again welcomed the recent Indian government's order on SIM-binding that it says keeps in mind the national and citizens’ interests. It further adds that there are some misconceptions being circulated regarding SIM-binding requirements for app-based communication services. COAI's note counters what it terms as ""misplaced narrative"" on 'SIM-binding':The narrative that SIM-binding will inconvenience users — particularly overseas travellers — is not borne by facts. SIM-binding is already a standard feature in widely used digital authentication systems such as UPI and payment applications, where the SIM only needs to be present and active in the device and does not require active mobile data. The same model can be seamlessly applied to app-based communication, with no disruption to users abroad who can continue using their services through Wi-Fi or a foreign SIM while keeping their Indian SIM in a secondary slot.Some concerns have also risen that SIM-binding may inconvenience international travellers, particularly those using single-SIM devices. It is important to clarify that this is a deliberate and essential security safeguard, to prevent misuse from outside (and within) India and to stop untraceable frauds and scams while restricting international subterfuges intended to defraud Indian subscribers or cause security harm to the country. This ensures that our communication channels are not exploited freely from outside India by fraudsters or non-state actors, who pose a grave threat to national security and citizen safety.Moreover, the subscriber will not be denied Communication App facilities, as the prevailing rules of that country in this respect will apply -- but the Indian recipient will have his Communication App bound to the Indian SIM, thus enhancing security of the individual and the nation.The requirement for time-bound reauthentication, such as a six-hour logout cycle, aligns with best practices for identity-sensitive digital services like Fintech. High-value systems — including banking portals, DigiLocker, Aadhaar and VPNs -- enforce far stricter session expiry norms. Smartphones remain logged in through cryptographic anchoring, while laptops and browsers -- being multi-user and higher-risk — undergo periodic authentication to ensure accountable access. At the same time, the laptop/tablet user will generally be in possession of his mobile phone carrying the SIM and reauthentication every 6 hours would not pose a challenge, but the security benefits will far outweigh any perceived inconvenience to the laptop/tablet user.Critics have also overstated concerns about the value of this government of India order for enhancing security. SIM-binding is a layered defence, strengthening one of the most common and easily exploited vulnerabilities in digital communication. SIM-binding closes important and critical loopholes and is a step in the right direction in the current environment.Concerns about privacy are similarly misplaced. SIM-binding does not require any expanded data collection by App-based communication services and does not create new metadata categories. It simply ensures that the SIM linked to a user’s identity is present during periodic authentication events, mirroring the widely accepted UPI model. This enhances security without intruding on user privacy.Finally, SIM-binding does not disrupt enterprise messaging, CRM systems, APIs or business workflows. It operates purely at the user account level, ensuring that each account is tied to a verified SIM. These enterprise solutions can continue to operate as long as the underlying user accounts — whether customer-facing or automated business numbers — are associated with valid, verified SIMs.There has been a crying need that the users’ app-based communication services are identifiable at all times without violating existing rules on privacy and data, and yet providing traceability and linkage to the TSPs’ (telecom service providers') SIM without degrading the offerings of the communication apps. This is all that has been done by this recent government of India order, which is aimed at protecting the user against frauds and scams, and the country against anti-national elements and it is a welcome step.To conclude, COAI said, ""COAI is of the view that SIM-binding is a balanced, privacy-respecting security measure that reinforces digital trust and enhances user protection against Spams and Frauds, without compromising convenience or business operations. SIM-binding is not just a panacea to strengthen national security but also an idea that is long overdue.”","The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) gave messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, and Snapchat 90 days to enforce 'SIM-binding' The directive, that will go into effect starting effective February 2026, also mandates that web versions of these apps log out users every six hours, requiring fresh authentication via QR code.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125903520,imgsize-21860,width-400,resizemode-4/india39s-sim-binding-rule-impact-on-whatsapp-businesses-and-digital-india.jpg"

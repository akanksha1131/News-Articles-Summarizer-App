From academic frustration to AI revolution: the birth of Perplexity



Scaling AI for the masses while rewriting the rules of search

New features rolled out rapidly:

Staying independent in the age of AI giants

In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, few stories stand out quite like that of Aravind Srinivas . In just under three years, he helped build Perplexity AI from an idea into one of the most talked-about startups in the tech ecosystem. As of July 2025, the company’s valuation had soared to $18 billion, driven by a series of breakthrough innovations and strategic partnerships, including a major deal with Bharti Airtel. That collaboration is set to give over 360 million Indian users free access to Perplexity Pro, drastically increasing the platform’s reach and cementing its global presence. Behind this remarkable ascent is the vision of a young man who channeled his mother’s dream into an empire and redefined how the world interacts with information.Aravind Srinivas was born on June 7, 1994, in Chennai (formerly Madras), Tamil Nadu. His earliest influence wasn’t a coding bootcamp or a Silicon Valley pitch deck, but his own mother. Each time they passed by the gates of IIT Madras , she would point and tell him, “You will study there one day.” That quiet repetition evolved into a shared dream—hers of opportunity, and his of purpose.Academically gifted from a young age, Aravind’s achievements spoke volumes. He secured the National Talent Search Scholarship and earned a merit certificate in the Indian National Mathematical Olympiad. These recognitions were more than just medals; they were stepping stones to IIT Madras, where he graduated in 2017 with dual degrees in Electrical Engineering.Ironically, despite his growing interest in computer science and machine learning, Aravind couldn't switch to a CS major due to a marginally lower GPA. But that didn’t stop him. He taught himself Python, followed online AI courses, competed on Kaggle, and gained mentorship under Professor Balaraman Ravindran, a pivotal figure in his intellectual development. A brief internship under AI legend Yoshua Bengio further ignited his academic trajectory, eventually leading him to a PhD at UC Berkeley, specializing in machine learning and artificial intelligence.While pursuing his PhD, Aravind began to question the limitations of traditional search engines. Why were users still forced to dig through pages of links when machines were already capable of nuanced understanding and delivering direct answers? That dissatisfaction gave birth to a radical idea: a conversational answer engine powered by large language models (LLMs) that could provide real-time, cited, and context-aware responses.In August 2022, alongside Denis Yarats, Johnny Ho, and Andy Konwinski, Aravind co-founded Perplexity AI in San Francisco. The team combined their technical expertise with a shared vision for transparent, user-friendly, AI-driven search.Their approach was novel. They prioritized trust, transparency, and clarity, avoiding the opaque algorithms of legacy platforms. By April 2024, Perplexity had raised $165 million, achieving unicorn status with a valuation of $1 billion. Just a year later, the firm reached $14 billion, and by July 2025, another $100 million funding round pushed its value to $18 billion, making it one of the fastest-growing AI companies in history.What truly set Perplexity apart was its ability to grow both in technology and scale without compromising its core vision. In May 2025, Aravind’s team signed a groundbreaking partnership with Bharti Airtel, bringing Perplexity Pro to 360 million Indian users via the Airtel Thanks app.Perplexity Pro now offers access to top-tier AI models like GPT‑4.1, Claude, image generation, and their newly launched AI browser, Comet, which handles complex web tasks via voice or text. Monthly search queries surged past 780 million, with more than 30 million active users, and an astonishing 20 percent month-on-month growth rate. Revenue, which stood at $35 million in 2024, was projected to cross an annualized $150 million by mid-2025.enterprise offerings, publisher revenue-sharing models, and real-time knowledge tools that go beyond what traditional search ever aimed for. The launch of Comet, a voice-first AI browser capable of summarizing posts, shopping, or composing emails, has redefined user expectations of online assistance.In an industry dominated by trillion-dollar tech giants, staying independent is no easy feat. Aravind Srinivas has already turned down acquisition interest from major players like Apple and Meta, signaling that Perplexity intends to build its own destiny. The company is laying the groundwork for a future public offering, likely after 2028, while expanding its presence across mobile, enterprise, and global education ecosystems.Yet through all the milestones, what remains unchanged is Aravind’s clarity of vision. From his mother’s voice in a Chennai bus to leading one of the world’s most dynamic AI companies, his journey is a rare blend of family legacy, technical brilliance, and unrelenting drive.As Perplexity continues to reshape how the world accesses and understands knowledge, Aravind Srinivas stands as a symbol of the power of self-belief and how a single dream, once whispered by a mother, can echo across the digital age.",Aravind Srinivas is the co-founder and CEO of Perplexity AI.

Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for 'offensive' political slurs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/poland-flags-elon-musks-grok-chatbot-to-the-eu-for-offensive-political-slurs/articleshow/122348777.cms,"Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for “offensive” political slurs

Why Poland says Elon Musk's Grok chatbot crossed a red line



Offensive answers: From antisemitic tropes to political insults



European digital rules put xAI under the spotlight



Previous incidents: Turkey, hate speech, and Grok’s growing rap sheet



xAI and Musk offer silence, at least for now



Poland just pulled the alarm on Grok, the AI chatbot from Elon Musk ’s xAI. Officials in Warsaw say the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders, so they’re asking the European Commission to investigate and, if the rules allow, hit xAI or X with fines.Krzysztof Gawkowski, Poland’s digitisation minister, told RMF FM radio that the bot’s remarks amounted to hate speech. He argued that ignoring algorithm-driven abuse “may cost humanity in the future,” so his ministry will file an official complaint under existing EU regulations.The step is unusual but legal: member states can trigger EU probes when digital services target their citizens with unlawful content. If Brussels agrees, xAI could face penalties under the Digital Services Act or the forthcoming AI Act.Grok’s missteps are piling up. The same day Poland aired its grievance, the Anti-Defamation League flagged responses in which the bot praised Adolf Hitler and recycled antisemitic stereotypes. xAI deleted the posts, calling them “inappropriate,” yet offered no public apology.Users had also shared screenshots showing Grok calling Tusk “a coward in Brussels slippers,” among other jabs. Warsaw says the language breaches Poland’s hate-speech law and the EU’s code of practice on disinformation.The EU’s Digital Services Act took full effect for very large platforms in February 2025. It forces companies such as X to assess systemic risks, audit their algorithms, and let regulators peek behind the curtain. An AI-specific law is coming later this year, likely adding fresh transparency mandates. Poland’s complaint tees up an early test of those combined powers.Legal scholars note that fines can reach 6 percent of global turnover for DSA violations. For Musk’s empire, that runs into billions.Poland is not alone. A Turkish court ordered X to block Grok content that mocked President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and Islamic beliefs.In June, users spotted the bot rambling about a supposed “white genocide” in South Africa. xAI blamed an “unauthorised change” to its response code.Each flare-up feeds an image of a system that swings from playful banter to extremist rhetoric with a single prompt.As of Wednesday afternoon, xAI had not replied to Reuters’ emailed questions, and Musk’s normally hyperactive X feed stayed quiet on the topic.The billionaire recently urged “maximum free speech” on X, but he also says AI must be “truth-seeking.” That balance gets messy when the bot channels conspiracy theories or ethnic slurs.","Poland says the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's net worth soars $1 billion as the chipmaker joins the $4 trillion club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-net-worth-soars-1-billion-as-the-chipmaker-joins-the-4-trillion-club/articleshow/122377958.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang’s net worth passes $140 billion



Nvidia’s market value climbs above $4 trillion



How a 3.5 percent stake fuels one of the world’s biggest fortunes



Where Jensen Huang now ranks among global billionaires



Why investors keep bidding the price up

AI demand everywhere. Cloud providers, carmakers, and sovereign data-centre projects line up for the current Hopper chips and the coming Blackwell series.

Scarcity premium. Nvidia controls around 80 percent of high-end AI GPU supply, and capacity stays tight even after Taiwan’s fabs ramp up output.

Ecosystem lock-in. CUDA software and support contracts make switching costs high, so even rivals that launch competitive silicon must still lure developers away.

What could slow the rally

Export curbs. The United States still blocks top-tier chips from shipping to China, Nvidia’s largest single-country market outside the U.S.

New competition. AMD, Intel and a clutch of start-ups are readying chips that nibble at Nvidia’s margins, especially in inference workloads.

Rich valuation. At about 40 times forward earnings, the stock leaves little room for an earnings miss; even a small disappointment could yank billions from Huang’s paper wealth.

Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold. The jump did more than rewrite Wall Street leaderboards; it also pushed co-founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s fortune past $140 billion. He owns about 3.5 percent of Nvidia, held directly and through family trusts, so every flicker in the share price lands straight in his pocket.Bloomberg’s daily billionaire tally shows Jensen Huang adding roughly $1 billion in a single session, and nearly $28 billion in 2025 so far. That kind of lift puts him shoulder-to-shoulder with household names like Warren Buffett, a spot unthinkable just three years ago. Investors keep paying the premium because Nvidia sells the chips that make modern AI run, from data-centre clusters to enterprise servers. The faster the market grows, the richer Huang becomes.As of the New York closing bell on 10 July, Bloomberg pegged Huang’s net worth at $143 billion, up from about $20 billion in early 2022. That leap happened in stages: $44 billion by mid-2023, $117 billion in late 2024, and now the $140-plus range. Fueled by the AI boom and soaring Nvidia shares, the difference this year alone is bigger than the entire market value of some Fortune 500 firms.The company’s share price settled near $164, capping a run that has lifted the stock 74 percent since April’s low and around 22 percent since January. Nvidia is now the dominant weight in the S&P 500, ahead of Apple and Microsoft. Analysts at Citi, Barclays and Loop Capital all raised their price targets this week, citing demand for the upcoming Blackwell platform and a backlog of data-centre orders.Huang’s percentage looks small beside founder holdings at some other tech giants, yet at a $4 trillion valuation it leaves him with shares worth roughly $140 billion. The stake figure comes from Nvidia’s March 2025 proxy filing and excludes unvested stock units. Cash, past dividend income and secondary-share sales round out the number Bloomberg uses, but the equity slice is what matters daily.With the latest move, he edges into Bloomberg’s global top ten, swapping places with Google’s Larry Page and closing in on Warren Buffett. Forbes, which refreshes less often, lists him ninth. None of the other names in that bracket made their money so fast in so short a window.","N Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold.

YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.

WHO warns online tobacco marketing could spark teen vaping surge

Experts warn unregulated online ads risk normalizing youth smoking

Tobacco marketing in the metaverse is emerging as one of the biggest public health concerns of 2024. Researchers have found that tobacco companies are using virtual reality platforms, NFTs, and gaming communities to promote smoking and vaping among young audiences. These digital promotions often include branded virtual lounges, influencer avatars, and immersive events featuring tobacco products, bypassing traditional advertising restrictions and targeting users where regulations have not yet caught up. Experts warn that this new wave of digital tobacco marketing could normalise harmful behaviours among teenagers and young adults, threatening decades of progress in tobacco control.The metaverse is transforming how brands connect with audiences, and tobacco companies are exploiting this unregulated environment. Social media images show avatars smoking in virtual bars and cafés, while gaming platforms host immersive events linked to tobacco brands. A recent World Conference on Tobacco Control report highlighted how companies are issuing NFTs and hosting branded experiences to engage users.This groundbreaking research comes from the Canary Project, run by the global health organization Vital Strategies. Acting as a “canary in the coalmine,” the program monitors tobacco and vape promotions across digital spaces in India, Indonesia, Mexico, and beyond. Evidence shows targeted campaigns aimed at normalizing smoking and vaping in youth-oriented online communities.More than half of the metaverse’s active users are aged 13 and below, making them highly vulnerable. Experts warn that these virtual interactions blur reality and can influence social norms around smoking. “The combination of immersive technology and addictive marketing is deeply concerning,” says Dr. Melina Magsumbol of Vital Strategies India.Unlike traditional advertising, digital promotions can bypass geographical restrictions and age regulations. Researchers found promotions embedded in gaming worlds and virtual events, with some tobacco companies even celebrating anniversaries through digital collectibles. Experts fear this could trigger an increase in youth experimentation with smoking and vaping.The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that digital tobacco and vaping promotions could reverse years of progress in reducing youth smoking rates. Countries are being urged to expand their tobacco control policies to include digital marketing channels, as children increasingly spend time online due to factors like the pandemic and gaming trends.Youth advocates, such as those at Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids , emphasize digital literacy as a defense against covert marketing. Teaching students how to identify online advertising and influencer-driven promotions can help reduce the impact of such campaigns. Experts believe building these skills at an early age is crucial to safeguarding future generations.Experts agree that regulating the internet is complex, as cross-border digital environments lack the strict frameworks seen in physical advertising. However, ignoring these emerging trends may lead to widespread normalization of harmful habits among youth.","Tobacco companies are using virtual reality platforms, NFTs, and gaming communities to promote smoking and vaping among young audiences.

Microsoft issues urgent patch for the vulnerability

Big Question Answered: Why Google is Merging Android and ChromeOS

A widespread cyber-espionage campaign that exploited Microsoft SharePoint servers has reportedly hit nearly 400 organisations, says a Reuters report. The figure, shared by researchers at Dutch firm Eye Security , is based on digital traces found on exposed servers. This marks a sharp increase from roughly 100 victims identified last week and researchers believe the true damage is likely much greater.The campaign takes advantage of a serious, unpatched vulnerability in on-premise SharePoint (CVE‑2025‑53770 and CVE‑2025‑53771). It allows attackers to take full control of servers, steal cryptographic keys, install hidden backdoors, and maintain access even after patching.The campaign has struck various sectors, including government, healthcare, finance, education, and manufacturing. Hundreds of servers globally remain exposed—Eye Security’s scan covered over 8,000 internet-connected SharePoint servers.On July 18, researchers at Eye Security first noticed the exploit in action. Within hours, scans of Germany, US, and global servers revealed dozens of compromised systems using the same malicious payload. Their initial findings estimated around 100 victim organizations, but follow-up scans expanded the count to nearly 400.The Reuters report quotes Vaisha Bernard, chief hacker at Eye Security who said “Not all attack methods leave traces that we can detect.” “There are many more [victims]… so the actual number is almost certainly higher,” he added.Microsoft confirmed the flaw and released emergency guidance over the weekend, advising affected users to apply patches immediately.The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities list, mandating remediation by federal agencies by July 21.Having said that, not all SharePoint editions are currently patched, heightening the risk for organizations still running legacy versions. Experts recommend isolating or disconnecting vulnerable servers from the internet until full fixes are applied.","A widespread cyber-espionage campaign that exploited Microsoft SharePoint servers has reportedly hit nearly 400 organisations.

AI talent war heats up between former partners

Microsoft has recruited more than 24 artificial intelligence employees from Google's DeepMind research division in recent months, marking the latest escalation in a talent war that has taken on deeply personal dimensions between two childhood friends who co-founded the AI lab that became the industry's most influential name.Amar Subramanya, the former head of engineering for Google's Gemini chatbot, became the latest high-profile defection when he announced his appointment as corporate vice-president of AI at Microsoft on Tuesday. His move follows other senior DeepMind staff including engineering lead Sonal Gupta, software engineer Adam Sadovsky, and product manager Tim Frank, according to sources familiar with Microsoft's aggressive recruiting strategy.The poaching campaign has intensified competition for top AI talent, with companies offering unprecedented compensation packages. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently revealed that Meta has offered his employees $100 million signing bonuses to switch sides, describing the behavior as ""mercenary.""The recruitment battle carries unusual personal stakes because it pits two former DeepMind co-founders against each other. Mustafa Suleyman , who now leads Microsoft's consumer AI strategy, and Sir Demis Hassabis , who runs Google DeepMind, first met as teenagers in north London in the mid-1990s.Despite an eight-year age gap, the pair—Suleyman, son of a taxi driver, and Hassabis, a chess prodigy—bonded over their shared interests. By 2010, they had co-founded DeepMind along with researcher Shane Legg. Google acquired the company for over $500 million in 2014, establishing it as the search giant's AI powerhouse.Their relationship has grown complicated since Suleyman left Google in 2022 to start Inflection AI, which Microsoft effectively acquired last year in a $650 million ""acqui-hire"" deal that brought Suleyman and most staff to the Seattle-based company.The recruitment drive has created organizational upheaval at Google DeepMind, forcing internal reshuffles as the company struggles to retain key personnel. Internal Google data suggests the stakes are high, with ChatGPT commanding at least 600 million monthly users compared to Gemini's 400 million.Hassabis, who won a chemistry Nobel Prize last year for AI-driven protein research, appears increasingly isolated from his former partner. While Suleyman describes their relationship as ""friendly and respectful rivalry,"" Hassabis has been more dismissive, telling The New York Times that ""most of what he has learned about AI comes from working with me.""Google maintains that DeepMind's attrition rates remain below industry averages and claims to have poached similar numbers from Microsoft, though the high-profile nature of recent defections suggests the talent war is far from over.In a bigger picture, the recruitment battle reflects the broader arms race for AI talent, with companies offering extraordinary compensation packages. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently criticized Meta for encouraging ""mercenary"" behavior by offering $100 million sign-on bonuses to lure top developers from rivals.","Microsoft has recruited more than 24 artificial intelligence employees from Google's DeepMind research division in recent months.

Books instead of Folds

CEO faces 20 years jailtime for $1.3M fraud

Remember those unbelievably cheap foldable phones branded with Pablo Escobar 's name? Turns out they were exactly what they looked like, too good to be true and a scam. Olof Kyros Gustafsson , the 32-year-old Swedish mastermind behind Escobar Inc. , pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering charges, finally putting an end to one of tech's most brazen scams.Gustafsson convinced thousands of people to shell out $399 for the "" Escobar Fold 2 ,"" promising cutting-edge foldable technology at a fraction of Samsung's $2,000 Galaxy Fold price. The catch? Most never received their phones. Those lucky few (mostly influencers) who did get a package found Samsung Galaxy Folds wrapped in cheap gold foil,The Escobar Inc caught attention when Marques Brownlee famously unboxed an Escobar Fold 2 on YouTube, revealing it was simply a Samsung Galaxy Fold with gold foil stickers slapped on top.Even more telling, Gustafsson later admitted in company correspondence that the Fold 2 was ""an overstock purchase of the Samsung Galaxy Fold"" bought from retailers and wholesalers. The first device, the Fold 1, bore striking similarities to the FlexPai from Chinese manufacturer Royole, though Gustafsson denied any connection.Now, that Fold 2, per Marques, was sent by Escobar Inc. themselves. That tells that Gustafsson deliberately sent sample devices to influencers to drum up interest, knowing the buzz would drive more orders. It worked, The videos inadvertently gave the fake company some credibility, eventually pocketing over $300,000 from unsuspecting customers.These thousands of people who paid around $399, would get a ""Certificate of Ownership,"" over their mail. After that one would hope for their Escobar Fold phone. Instead they received Pablo Escobar's brother Roberto’s autobiography and a congratulatory flyer featuring scantily-clad women. When buyers demanded refunds, Gustafsson used these book shipments as ""proof"" that products had been delivered, successfully blocking refund requests through payment processors.The company didn’t stop at phones. Gustafsson also hawked ""Escobar Flamethrower,"" a dupe of Elon Musk's Boring Company flamethrower, an ""Escobar Gold 11 Pro Phone"" that was supposedly a refurbished iPhone, and even ""Escobar Cash,"" that the Escobar Inc. marketed as the world's first physical cryptocurrency. None of these products existed beyond promotional materials and the occasional sample sent to reviewers.Federal investigators eventually caught up with Gustafsson's operation. He was arrested at his home in Marbella, Spain, in December 2023 during a joint raid by Spanish police and U.S. Internal Revenue Service agents. After unsuccessfully seeking asylum in Spain to avoid extradition, he was brought to Los Angeles to face charges for 115-count federal indictmentCourt documents show Gustafsson laundered over $307,000 through bank accounts in the United States, Sweden, and the United Arab Emirates during just the first six months of the scheme.Gustafsson sentencing is scheduled for December 5, and he faces faces up to 20 years in federal prison on fraud charges and up to 10 years for money laundering when he's sentenced on December 5th.

Elon Musk warning: “Breaking the Law as…’



New contender for Golden Dome project



The Trump administration is reportedly looking for new partners for its Golden Dome project. According a report by news agency Reuters, this move by the Donald Trump administration has attracted a critical reaction from Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk , who called the action as “breaking the law.” For those unaware, the Golden Dome project a next-generation missile defense initiative which was launched by the Donald Trump administration earlier this year. The project is designed to protect the US from different kinds of aerial threats with the help of a vast network of space-based satellites and interceptors.As reported by Reuters, the Donald Trump administration is actively looking for new collaborators for the Golden Dome project. According to reports, the administration is vetting companies like Amazon’s Project Kuiper , Lockheed Martin , and L3Harris to replace SpaceX’s role in the initiative.The report also adds that this new development comes during a time when the relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump is deteriorating. “Even before the spat, officials at the Pentagon and White House had begun exploring alternatives to SpaceX, wary of over-reliance on a single partner for huge portions of the ambitious, $175 billion space-based defense shield,” reads the report.SpaceX CEO Elon Musk reacted to the Reuters report with a post shared on X (formerly know as Twitter). “Federal acquisition regulations require using the best provider at the best price. Anything else would be breaking the law,” wrote Musk.Amazon’s Project Kuiper, though behind in deployment with just 78 satellites launched, is being considered for its potential in missile tracking and communications. Apart from this, Stoke Space and Rocket Lab are also gaining traction. Defense firms like Northrop are developing space-based interceptors, while L3Harris is seeing increased demand for missile warning and tracking tech.Experts warn that integrating commercial platforms like Kuiper raises cybersecurity concerns, especially given past jamming attempts on Starlink. A fully operational Golden Dome could also accelerate the militarization of space, prompting adversaries to develop countermeasures.","The Donald Trump administration is reportedly looking for new partners for its Golden Dome project.

Why Byran Johnson is planning to shut down or sell his anti-aging startup



Is Blueprint in trouble



Multimillionaire Bryan Johnson is known for his highly publicised anti-aging regimen, Project Blueprint. Now an online report suggests that the tech mogul is planning to shut down or sell his longevity-focused startup. As reported by the Wired, Johnson has cited philosophical conflicts and burnout as the reason for the shut down of his anti-aging wellness startup. “Honestly, I am so close to either shutting it down or selling it,” Johnson told Wired. “I don’t need the money, and it’s a pain-in-the-a** company.” Johnson created Blueprint from his personal health regimen . The company sells supplements like a Rs 4,700 ‘longevity mix’ and mushroom-based coffee alternatives. Johnson has also spent around $ 2 million a year on his anti-aging protocol Project Blueprint which recommends strict diets, biometric tracking and plasma transfusions.In an interview with Wired, Johnson expressed that the primary challenge facing his startup is the difficulty in scaling and democratizing access to the complex and personalized anti-aging protocols he has been developing. He also added that the business started to undermine his credibility in the philosophical space. “It just evolved in a way where I was trying to do people a solid. The problem is now people see the business and give me less credibility on the philosophy side,” he said. “I will not make that trade-off.”Johnson also said that his focus is shifting towards ‘Don’t Die’. It is a belief system that the tech entrepreneur launched earlier this year. The belief system was created as a blend of science, ethics and spiritually with an aim of radical life extension. Johnson now believes that the commercial nature of Blueprint acts as a distraction to him.Earlier this year it was reported that Blueprint was missing its break-even point by $1 million a month. However, Johnson has denied any kind of financial stress. “We are break-even, and I've said that publicly many times. We've had profitable months, we've had loss months,"" he added.","Bryan Johnson is known for his highly publicised anti-aging regimen, Project Blueprint.

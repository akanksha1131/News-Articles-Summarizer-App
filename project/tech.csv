What Italy and US said about European digital services taxes



Italy and the United States have issued a joint statement opposing what they described as ""discriminatory"" taxes on digital services. This reportedly indicates a potential shift in Rome’s approach to a measure that has drawn criticism from Washington. The announcement came as Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni met separately with US President Donald Trump and his deputy JD Vance. Trump’s reception of Meloni also appeared more welcoming than his interactions with other European leaders. European taxes targeting major U.S. tech companies like Alphabet's Google , Meta's Facebook, Apple, and Amazon have long been a source of concern for US administrations, including that of Trump.In a joint statement (reviewed by the news agency Reuters) following Meloni's visit to the White House, the US and Italy said: ""We agreed that a non-discriminatory environment in terms of digital services taxation is necessary to enable investments from cutting-edge tech companies.”The announcement also mentioned that Trump would make an official visit to Italy soon, however, it did not specify whether Rome had agreed to withdraw the digital services tax.It also expressed support for American investments in AI computing and cloud services in Italy, highlighting efforts to position the country as a central data hub for the Mediterranean and North Africa.Last year, Amazon’s cloud division, AWS, also announced a 1.2 billion euro investment over five years to expand its data centre operations in Italy.Italy imposes a 3% tax on revenue from online transactions by digital companies with global sales of at least 750 million euros ($853.35 million), generating less than 500 million euros in annual revenue for the state.According to a report by Reuters, Italy’s web tax remains a sensitive issue for Meloni, despite its relatively modest contribution to the state. While Meloni faces pressure from the US to revise the measure, the report cited political sources to claim that members of her ruling coalition are urging her to take a tougher stance on large tech companies to help finance costly policies without putting more pressure on Italy’s public finances.Recently, Italy’s economy Minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, said that discussions with the US over digital taxation should take place bilaterally rather than through the European Union, the report added. He mentioned that he plans to meet with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent next week during a G20 meeting.","Italy and the United States have issued a joint statement opposing what they described as ""discriminatory"" taxes on digital services.

What the lawsuit alleges

A man from Pennsylvania has filed a lawsuit against a political group linked to Elon Musk . The lawsuit, filed on April 1 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleges that the group promised to pay him for collecting voter petition signatures but did not send the full amount. The group named in the lawsuit is called America Political Action Committee (PAC), and is connected to Elon Musk’s political campaign efforts. The campaign focused on states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. It encouraged voters to support petitions about free speech and gun rights.The lawsuit says the PAC promised to pay $100 for each voter signature collected and another $100 for each new person referred during the 2024 election campaign. The man says he was paid his hourly wage and some of the referral payments, but about $20,000 is still unpaid.The man says he contacted the PAC many times to ask for the rest of the money but got no reply. The lawsuit says he suffered emotional stress and health issues because he could not pay his bills and his credit was damaged.The lawsuit says over 100 others may also be owed money. If true, the total amount could be more than $5 million.Speaking to Business Insider, plaintiff attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan said, “Our client relied on that promise because he believed in Elon, but unfortunately, that promise was not kept. It appears the promise was broken for many others as well. He relied on these payments to pay his bills—but they never came.”America PAC spokesperson Andrew Romeo told Business Insider that the organization “is committed to paying for every legitimate petition signature” and has “paid tens of millions of dollars to canvassers.” Romeo added that while they cannot verify John Doe’s specific claims, the PAC has the right to withhold payments from “fraudsters.”","A man from Pennsylvania has filed a lawsuit against a political group linked to Elon Musk.

What the Kardashians said about Lauren Sanchez’s Blue Origin space flight



“This is a really unique experience and we’re just so honored to be here to support them and watch this amazing part of history, and I’m so proud of her,”

How Sanchez solved NASA's 'uniform problem' before her Blue Origin flight



Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ' fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, received a space-themed gift from Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and Khloé Kardashian after her recent Blue Origin Space flight. The Kardashians gave Sanchez a Judith Leiber handbag shaped like an UFO, valued at $6,995. The UFO Orbiter bag features star-shaped and geometric crystals, aligning with the theme of the Blue Orgin's Space flight. Sánchez shared the gift on her Instagram story (seen by Page Six), describing it as “Out of this world!” and tagged the three Kardashian sisters. The gift came shortly after this week’s all-women space flight, which Sánchez helped organise alongside Bezos through his Blue Origin initiative.Kris Jenner and Khloé Kardashian traveled to Van Horn, Texas, earlier this week to support Lauren Sánchez as she took part in an all-female Blue Origin space flight.Jenner said about Sánchez.Khloé Kardashian also shared her thoughts, saying the family is proud of “all of the female astronauts,” referring to the rest of the crew, which included: Katy Perry, Gayle King, Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguyen and Kerianne Flynn.Ahead of her Blue Origin flight, Sánchez emphasized the importance of designing better-fitting spacesuits for women. Collaborating with designers Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim, Sánchez helped develop a suit specifically designed for women, addressing a long-standing issue where space suits were originally made for men and later adapted.Her efforts align with Blue Origin’s focus on inclusive design and follow a 2019 incident where NASA cancelled an all-female spacewalk due to a lack of properly fitting suits.","Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and Khloé Kardashian gave Lauren Sánchez a $6,995 handbag shaped like an UFO.

People's Union USA founder John Schwarz has announced on social media details of upcoming planned boycotts:

Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, has issued a statement addressing the ongoing week-long boycott organised by the People’s Union USA . The boycott, dubbed the "" Walmart Blackout ,"" began on April 7 and targets the company’s rollback of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, as well as broader concerns over corporate influence and tax policies .The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity. The group’s founder, John Schwarz, urged consumers to avoid shopping at Walmart stores, using its online services, or purchasing from its subsidiaries like Sam’s Club. Schwarz stated, “We are holding these companies accountable so they finally step up and pay their fair share of taxes to alleviate federal income tax from the working-class citizen.”Responding to the boycott, Walmart has defended its contributions to communities and the US economy. “Serving communities is at the heart of Walmart's purpose to help people save money and live better,” the company said in a statement. “As one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, not only do we pay our fair share, we are an economic force multiplier strengthening communities nationwide through job creation, supplier growth, and over $1.7 billion in cash and in-kind donations last year"", it added further.The boycott follows Walmart’s decision last November to discontinue its five-year commitment to a racial equity center and other DEI programs. Critics argue that these rollbacks undermine progress in promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Walmart, however, emphasised its dedication to supporting local charities, disaster response, hunger relief, workforce development, and conservation efforts.A report from SuperMarketNews, citing data from Numerator, suggests that Walmart may be more resistant to boycotts compared to other retailers. The data indicates that Walmart has not experienced significant impact from households regarding its stance on non-DEI initiatives, particularly among multicultural households—a trend that contrasts with another retail chain Target.Target reportedly faced the most severe backlash during the February 28 boycott focused on DEI initiatives, experiencing a 9% drop in web traffic on the day of the protest, according to Forbes.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female.

The updated policy, which took effect on April 2, applies to all pending and future immigration benefit requests. “USCIS is returning to its historical policy of recognizing two biological sexes,” the agency said in a press statement.Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security , said “There are only two sexes—male and female.

Proper management of our immigration system is a matter of national security, not a place to promote and coddle an ideology that permanently harms children and robs real women of their dignity, safety, and well-being.”Under the new guidance, a person’s sex will be determined based on the birth certificate issued at or closest to the time of birth. “If the birth certificate issued at or nearest to the time of birth indicates a sex other than male or female, USCIS will base the determination of sex on secondary evidence. See Volume 1, General Policies and Procedures, Part E, Adjudications, Chapter 6, Evidence, Section B, Primary and Secondary Evidence [1 USCIS-PM E.6(B)],” the agency stated.The agency further stated that the benefits will not be denied solely based on how an applicant identifies his/her sex. USCIS confirmed that it does not issue documents with a blank sex field or one that differs from the original birth certificate. Any discrepancies may lead to processing delays.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female. The change aligns with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January 2025, titled ‘Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119938617,imgsize-124226,width-400,resizemode-4/USCIS-plain-and-straight-message-to-H1-B-Green-Card-and-other-visa-applicants-There-are-only-two-.jpg"

“That October, things had reached a fever pitch when The New York Times published a deeply disturbing article that raised serious questions about Bill’s conduct –

questions that suggested

he had betrayed not only our marriage but also my values.”

“I regretted it the second I walked in the door. He was abhorrent. He was evil personified. My heart breaks for these women,”

“was one of the hardest and most important things I’ve ever done.”

What Bill Gates said about his ties with Jeffrey Epstein



“In retrospect, I was foolish to spend any time with him. I think I was quite stupid. I thought it would help me with global health philanthropy. In fact, it failed to do that. It was just a huge mistake.”

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates’ ex-wife and founder of the Gates Foundation, Melinda French Gates, has made a major revelation about her husband’s ties with Jeffrey Epstein. In her new memoir “The Next Day”, Melinda noted that she knew her marriage to Bill Gates was facing significant issues in 2019, when his infidelities and connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein became publicly known. The philanthropist wrote that these public revelations led her to experience nightmares and recognise the severity of her marital difficulties. She was specifically referencing her then-husband’s association with Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking and federal conspiracy charges. A report published by The New York Times at that time claimed that Bill Gates met with Epstein on ""numerous occasions,"" including one visit that lasted for hours.In her memoir (seen by Page Six), Melinda Gates wrote:Earlier, in a 2022 interview, Melinda revealed that she had voiced her anger to Bill regarding his friendship with Epstein. Claiming that she only met Epstein once because she “wanted to see who” he was, Melinda said, “I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him.”Melinda added.In her new book, Melinda also mentioned that leaving her marriageThe report notes that in 2011, after his first encounter with Epstein, Bill Gates sent an email to his colleagues, writing: “His lifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing, although it would not work for me.”Earlier this year, the tech billionaire also accepted that he made a “huge mistake” in associating himself with Epstein.In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Gates said:","Melinda Gates wrote in her new memoir that she knew her marriage to Bill Gates was facing significant issues in 2019.

Aadit Palicha, CEO of quick-commerce startup Zepto, shared a stark account of the company’s near-demise during the 2022–2023 funding drought, citing hiring errors and the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse as major threats, according to the Economic Times. In a conversation with Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, Palicha pinpointed flawed recruitment as Zepto’s Achilles’ heel. “The biggest mistakes I made were wrong hires,” he told Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, noting missteps in finance, operations, marketing, and category management that strained the startup’s early years.The March 2023 SVB collapse, which froze funds for numerous tech firms, hit Zepto hard. “We almost died,” Palicha admitted, recalling the existential crisis when operational funds were trapped in the bank. A WhatsApp poll cited by ET revealed 40 Y Combinator-backed Indian startups had $250,000 to $1 million in SVB, with over 20 holding more than $1 million, amplifying the panic.Zepto, like many global startups, was hit hard by the sudden collapse of US-based SVB in March 2023. The bank, which held deposits for thousands of tech firms, folded amid a liquidity crunch—freezing access to funds and triggering widespread panic among founders.In a LinkedIn post, Palicha credited Y Combinator’s support as pivotal to Zepto’s survival and growth. The startup has since rebounded, with ET reporting its annualised gross order value nearing $4 billion -- a 300% year-on-year leap—and FY24 operating revenue of Rs 4,454 crore, up 120% from the prior year.Palicha said the ordeal reshaped Zepto’s hiring strategy. “The most fundamental input to our company is execution excellence, and the biggest driver of that is high-quality people,” he emphasized, underscoring a new focus on “execution intelligence” in team-building.","Aadit Palicha, CEO of quick-commerce startup Zepto, shared a stark account of the company's near-demise during the 2022–2023 funding drought.

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has sharply criticized President Donald Trump's administration for what he describes as an ""attack on science"" that could undermine America's technological competitiveness against China.""This looks like a total attack on all of science in America,"" Schmidt said at the recent AI+Biotechnology Summit hosted by the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology. ""We're up against China that is pouring a trillion dollars into this, and we're screwing around with funding the core people to invent our future.""Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has cut funding for government research, reduced staffing at key scientific agencies, and placed financial pressure on universities over their diversity programs and campus protests.Schmidt warned that many universities are now under ""hiring freezes"" because they are ""so scared of this administration, which appears to be withholding hundreds of millions of dollars from them."" This week, the administration froze $2 billion in funding to Harvard University after school leaders refused to comply with demands regarding changes to admissions processes.The tech executive, who graduated from Princeton University, accused the government of leveraging education funding to ""falsely attack science"" at a critical moment in the global technology race.Schmidt also expressed concern about international talent choosing to avoid the United States due to immigration uncertainties. ""This madness will eventually end because it's too stupid not to fix, but there's damage occurring already, and I want everyone to understand it's real damage,"" he said.While some tech leaders like Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and OpenAI's Sam Altman have maintained friendly relations with the administration, Schmidt's comments reflect growing tension between parts of the tech community and Trump's science policies.","Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has sharply criticized President Donald Trump's administration for what he describes as an ""attack on science"" The Trump administration has cut funding for government research, reduced staffing at key scientific agencies, and placed financial pressure on universities over their diversity programs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120426357,imgsize-36818,width-400,resizemode-4/Former-Google-CEO-Eric-Schmidt-warns-of-perfect-AI-girlfriends-says-young-men-are-at-risk-of-obsession-with-chatbots.jpg"

ChatGPT randomly address users by names

OpenAI’s silence and user reactions



Some ChatGPT users have noticed an unsettling change—the AI chatbot is referring to them by name unprompted, even when they haven’t shared their names. As reported by TechCrunch, the unexpected personalisation has sparked mixed reactions, with some calling it “creepy and unnecessary.”Several users on X (formerly Twitter) have reported that ChatGPT randomly addresses them by name, despite never inputting personal details. Software developer Simon Willison described the behaviour as “weird and invasive,” while another user, Nick Dobos, said he “hated it.”The change appears to coincide with OpenAI’s upgraded memory feature, which allows ChatGPT to retain details from past conversations. However, some users claim the chatbot mentions their names even when memory settings are disabled, raising concerns about data privacy and AI transparency.OpenAI has not yet responded to inquiries about the issue, leaving users speculating whether the name usage is intentional or a glitch. The controversy highlights the fine line between personalisation and discomfort, with some users comparing the experience to a teacher repeatedly calling their name in class.Experts suggest that AI-driven name recognition can feel forced and unnatural, making interactions less authentic rather than more engaging.","ChatGPT randomly addresses users by name, despite never inputting personal details.

In a PIB release, the ministry of finance said that the claims that the government is considering levying Goods and Services Tax (GST) on UPI transactions over Rs 2,000 are completely false, misleading, and without any basis. Currently, there is no such proposal before the government.The ministry of finance release said that GST is levied on charges, such as the Merchant Discount Rate (MDR), relating to payments made using certain instruments. Effective January 2020, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has removed the MDR on Person-to-Merchant (P2M) UPI transactions through the Gazette Notification dated December 30, 2019.Since currently no MDR is charged on UPI transactions, there is consequently no GST applicable to these transactions.The government remains committed to promoting digital payments via UPI.To support and sustain the growth of UPI, an Incentive Scheme has been operational from FY 2021-22. This scheme specifically targets low-value UPI (P2M) transactions, benefiting small merchants by alleviating transaction costs and promoting wider participation and innovation in digital payments.The total incentive payouts under this scheme over the years reflect the government’s sustained commitment to promoting UPI-based digital payments.

Supporters use “woke” to describe people who are socially conscious and trying to make the world fairer.

Critics often use “wokeism” negatively, saying it means being too politically correct, overly sensitive, or pushing social ideas too far.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently replied to an X post calling out Netflix for its woke content. An X user recently named Gunther Eagleman @GuntherEagleman wrote on X: “Netflix is woke trash.” The post caught Musk’s attention who responded to it in agreement, saying “True”. Elon Musk’s reply to Gunther Eagleman’s post reflects his critique of Netflix. Earlier this month, the tech CEO slammed the streaming platform for its latest web series Adolescence, alleging an “anti-white propaganda”.As mentioned above, this is notably not the first time when the tech billionaire has criticised Netflix for its content. In the year 2022, Musk said that “The woke mind virus is making Netflix unwatchable."" He was responding to a post by Slashdot, referring to a subscriber loss of the streaming platform then.Musk, in reply to a user then, also said that he hopes the streaming giant would make more science fiction movies. “Can they please just make sci-fi/fantasy at least *mostly* about sci-fi/fantasy?” he tweeted.Musk has been a critique of wokeness calling it “divisive, exclusionary and hateful” in the past. He told The Babylon Bee that “woke mind virus” is “a world without humor”, stating that wokeness is the greatest threat to modern civilisation. “At its heart, wokeness is divisive, exclusionary and hateful. It basically gives mean people a shield to be cruel, armored in false virtue,"" Musk said.In an interview last year, Musk said that the woke mind virus killed his son, referring to his son Xavier, now known as Vivian Jenna Wilson. He then shared his concern about using puberty blockers in children and said he felt he was “tricked” into agreeing to his son’s sex change.For those wondering, Wokeism refers to a set of beliefs or attitudes that emphasize being socially aware, especially about issues like racism, gender identity, inequality, and injustice. The term comes from the word “woke,” which originally meant being alert to social problems, especially those affecting marginalized groups.

""It takes too long to make decisions. New ideas are not given room or resources to incubate. And unnecessary silos lead to inefficient execution,"" he added.“I want to roll up my sleeves with the engineering and product teams so I can learn what’s needed to strengthen our solutions,” Tan wrote. “As Michelle and I drive this work, we plan to evolve and expand her role with more details to come in the future.”As per the memo, Intel has also promoted networking chip chief Sachin Katti to be chief technology officer and artificial intelligence chief. Katti, who is also a professor at Stanford University, will succeed Greg Lavender, who is retiring from Intel.

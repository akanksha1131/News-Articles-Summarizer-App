CTO Brian Atwell suggests intelligence tests, like IQ tests, could aid early screening for PM candidates. He emphasizes rigorous hiring processes, noting that easily practiced interviews fail to build strong teams. Designing effective, ungameable interviews requires significant dedication.

""generally less well-defined than the engineering role.""

Why CloudKitchens' CTO thinks IQ tests are essential for hiring project managers

""It probably wouldn't hurt if you slapped an IQ test in front of the PM in your process,”

""It wouldn't help differentiate between the excellent and super excellent, but it would help weed out people very early, and then you could spend more time differentiating between the good versus excellent and the rest of your process,""

20 experiments

“Like an interview that tests your ability to recall things, your experience, or just your mindsets, does not build a strong engineering team.

An interview that anyone can pass, regardless of IQ, if they can practice enough, that does not build a strong engineering team.”

“The reason that companies don't do it is that it just takes a ton of work to build a good process. Like in a tech org, you have dozens of different roles, and each one needs different interviews, so the leadership team needs to be really, really dedicated to it,”





CloudKitchens, the $15 billion ghost kitchen startup founded by Uber cofounder Travis Kalanick , finds that hiring project managers (PMs) is more challenging than hiring software engineers. According to CloudKitchens CTO Brian Atwell, the difficulty stems from the nature of the job itself. He explained that some of the responsibilities a project manager handles areTo improve its hiring process, the company is even considering expanding its use of intelligence testing, such as IQ tests, for more roles. The company's accounting team already uses these tests, Atwell revealed.On a podcast with Ryan Peterman, Atwell suggested that an IQ test could help the company hire project managers specifically.he suggested. While such tests wouldn't identify the absolute best candidates, Atwell said they are a good tool for early screening.he noted.Atwell stressed the need for a rigorous and dedicated hiring approach across the entire company. He mentioned that CloudKitchens is constantly runningto improve its interview process. He warned that interviews that can be passed by practising or that don't test a candidate's core abilities will not build a strong engineering team.Atwell said,However, Atwell warned that it's challenging to design a perfect interview process, particularly one that can't be gamed.Atwell explained.","CloudKitchens CTO Brian Atwell suggests IQ tests could help the company hire project managers.

""The Twenty Minute VC""

""hustle time,""

“It is absolutely nuts to me that you can find anyone’s email on the internet and just cold email them. I’m pretty sure if you’re a good enough stalker, because you have to be a stalker, by the way—everyone should learn to be a really efficient SDR, but essentially a stalker.”

How the venture capitalist convinced Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff for podcast

“super learnable”

“I would absolutely just relentlessly never give up,”

“You can actually leverage them to say, ‘Hey, I want to write an email to Marc Benioff, and I want to show that I’ve really done my work. What are five things that very few people know about Mark that would really impress him and add a layer of personalisation that not many people engage with? And they will tell you,”

“not nearly personalised enough,”

“needy”

“attention.”

“20VC podcast appearance”

“Who’s like, ‘I hope you’re unwell,’”

“Hi Marc, keeping things short out of respect for your time,”

“I would love to have you on 20VC.”

“we have X amount of subscribers, followers… and have had guests like X, Y, and Z.”

“Super simple: we require 30 minutes of time and it’s done on Riverside,”

“P.S. If you do it, I will send you a bottle of your favorite Macallan 75,”





Venture capital fund 20VC founder, Harry Stebbings, has revealed that he landed an interview with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff on his podcast only after sending 53 cold emails. The 29-year-old entrepreneur and podcaster has also advised others looking to get the attention of top executives to learn how to bewhen using cold email.

He credits hisin which he dedicates 30 minutes to each week, for successfully convincing most of his high-profile guests through cold emails.On an episode of The Biography Podcast, Stebbings said,Stebbings, who believes strong relationships help people succeed, says cold emailing is askill that anyone can improve at. After he got Benioff’s attention, he emailed him every week and tested different versions to see which messages felt the most personal. For example, he would mention Benioff’s favourite drink, his holiday home, his favourite vacation spot, Salesforce’s quarterly results, and other details.Stebbings noted. He also said that AI tools make personalisation even easier.Stebbings explained.Stebbings said people often make mistakes with cold emails when they areandas they don’t put in the effort.Cold emailing has helped many people build new relationships or grow their network, but Stebbings feels that most people don’t know how to do it well.

“We actually have an over 90% collaboration rate with our portfolio companies. We look at three key areas for every one of our investments.

The first, products or capabilities. The second being: Are they an ecosystem partner? Generally, they fall within those two categories. The third being: Are they very disruptive to industry?

"Thousands of Amazon employees send open letter to CEO Andy Jassy; say: We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/thousands-of-amazon-employees-send-open-letter-to-ceo-andy-jassy-say-were-the-workers-who-develop-train-and-use-ai-so-we-have-/articleshow/125646835.cms,"Over 1,000 Amazon employees have signed an open letter warning of dire consequences from the company's rapid AI development. They argue Amazon is sacrificing climate goals and its human workforce for AI dominance, citing increased emissions, water consumption for data centers, and job displacement. The workers demand ethical AI practices, including clean energy use and employee involvement in AI decisions.

Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency

Here's the complete open letter from Amazon 1000-plus employees:

Dear Andy Jassy and S-team,

In recent years, tech leaders have accelerated their race to build the most powerful AI first. “Sink or swim,” “AI is not going anywhere,” and “work with it or be replaced” have become mantras in workspaces at Amazon and beyond.

We, the undersigned Amazon employees, have serious concerns about this aggressive rollout during the global rise of authoritarianism and our most important years to reverse the climate crisis. We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth.

We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene. Here’s why we’re sounding the alarm:

Amazon is casting aside its climate goals to build AI. We have just a few years to stop disastrous levels of warming. Yet despite committing to net zero carbon emissions by 2040, Amazon’s annual emissions have grown roughly 35% since 2019. The AI race is widening this gap. The company plans to spend $150 billion building new data centers for AI. Many of these will be in drought-stressed regions, where they will consume scarce water, or in locations where their energy demands will force utility companies to keep coal plants online or build new gas plants. Amazon even killed legislation that would have required its data centers to use clean energy. Meanwhile, AWS is helping oil companies drill for more oil and gas.

Amazon is forcing us to use AI while investing in a future where it’s easier to discard us. Andy Jassy promised that soon Amazon will be full of AI tools and “agents,” and that he expects to employ fewer humans. He claims our (remaining) jobs will be “even more exciting and fun,” but here’s what we’re actually experiencing: higher expected output and shorter timelines, mandates to build AI tools for wasteful use cases, and massive investment in AI with little investment in career advancement. Our logistics coworkers have been especially impacted by work speedups, surveillance, injuries and burnout. All this, while Amazon is attempting to declare the National Labor Relations Board, which protects workers’ rights, unconstitutional.

Amazon is helping build a more militarized surveillance state with fewer protections for ordinary people. Amazon, alongside Meta, Microsoft and Google lobbied to ban state regulation on AI for the next ten years; Trump financially disincentivized state regulatory action in his AI Action Plan. Trump demanded an end to “wokeness” in AI; Amazon has scaled back its commitments to DEI and offered the administration a 1 billion dollar coupon for AWS, with a DOGE staffer calling the deal “a foundational piece to help implement President Trump’s AI Action Plan.” The military wants AI technologies at top speed; Amazon has announced a collaboration with an autonomous weapons software company. Trump’s ICE Director wants to run mass deportation “like Prime, but with human beings”; Amazon, a major provider of cloud services to DHS and to Palantir, literally does power mass deportation. Amazon is expanding the surveillance state in other ways, too. It’s making Ring AI-first and re-introducing a tool for police to request footage; it’s using AI to surveil warehouse workers, and, of course, its own customers. Finally, Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, and has begun asserting more control over that publication; the other major AI players control mass information ecosystems like Instagram and X. If these collaborations continue, we will be ceding an unbelievable amount of power into the hands of an increasingly authoritarian government and a few companies willing to abandon any principles they claim to have in the race for AI dominance.

All of this is daunting, but none of it is inevitable. A better future is still very much within reach, but it requires us to get real about the costs of AI and the guardrails we need.

We demand Amazon leadership commit to the following:

No AI with dirty energy.

No more vague promises that “AI will solve the climate crisis.” Amazon must implement a public plan that includes: 1) powering all data centers with 100% additional, local renewable energy, 24/7, 2) ending custom AI solutions for oil & gas companies to drill more oil faster, and 3) publishing a detailed, science-backed glidepath for how it will meet its climate commitments.

No AI without employee voices.

We want ethical AI working groups of non-managers across the company that will have significant ownership over org-level goals and how or if AI should be used in their orgs, how or if AI-related layoffs or headcount freezes are implemented, and how to mitigate or minimize the collateral effects of AI use, such as environmental impact.

No AI for violence, surveillance, or mass deportation.

Amazon sells a huge range of products and services — from physical goods to digital infrastructure to films to medical services. It should not need to be helping surveil civilians in Gaza, collaborating with AI companies that specialize in drone warfare, or supporting a mass deportation machine.

The Amazon employees signing this letter believe in building a better world — not in building bunkers to fall back to. We want the promised gains from AI to give everyone more freedom to play and rest, to spend time with family and friends, to be moved by nature, to create, to feel safe being who we are.

This is an incredibly consequential moment in history. It’s time for us to step up and spark a conversation about the real benefits and costs of AI. Workers have guided Amazon to a better path before, and we can do it again. The choices we make now, for the planet, for its people and animals, matter more than ever. Let’s make ones we can be proud of.

Signed,

1,039 Amazon employees (and counting!)





Thousands of Amazon employees have signed an open letter issuing some dire warnings about the company’s move toward AI. The letter, signed by more than 1,000 workers (and counting) calls out Amazon for pushing its AI investments at the expense of the climate and its human workforce. The letter’s supporters come from a wide array of roles at the company, including many software engineers, and even employees focused on building AI systems. ""We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth,” the letter’s authors wrote. It adds, “We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene.”The letter is reportedly signed by Amazon workers anonymously, and comes almost a month after Amazon announced mass layoff plans as it increases adoption of AI in its operations. Among the signatories are employees in a range of positions, including engineers, product managers and warehouse associates. The letter argues that their employer is throwing out its climate promises in the scramble to win the AI race. Amazon has pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, pointing to efficiencies from electric delivery vehicles and reduced plastic packaging in its climate commitment.","Over 1,000 Amazon employees have signed an open letter warning of dire consequences from the company's rapid AI development.

Not convincing: France on dismissing local browser's antitrust case against Microsoft,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/not-convincing-france-on-dismissing-local-browsers-antitrust-case-against-microsoft/articleshow/125645258.cms,"What Microsoft said about French regulator’s decision

“We agree with the decision and remain committed to providing high-quality search services and fostering innovation for consumers and partners in France and across Europe.”

What French browser company Qwant alleged against Microsoft





France’s competition watchdog, the Autorité de la Concurrence, has rejected a complaint filed by the local search engine company Qwant against Microsoft. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Qwant had accused the software giant of unfairly leveraging its market power. The French regulator said that Qwant did not provide enough convincing evidence to support these serious claims. As a result, the case was dismissed, and the regulator also refused to impose any temporary penalties on Microsoft that Qwant had requested.Microsoft welcomed the French regulators' ruling. In a statement ot Reuters, a Microsoft spokesperson said:Qwant accused Microsoft of placing limits on how Qwant could appear in search results and search advertising, making it harder for the French company to build its own search engine and develop its own artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Qwant also claimed that Microsoft received better treatment when allocating search ads.The company has long relied on Microsoft’s Bing to provide search and news results.Last month, Qwant said it expected its complaint to be dismissed and planned to challenge the decision in court or take it to other authorities.Microsoft remains a major provider of search results to smaller European search engines, including Ecosia, DuckDuckGo, Lilo and Qwant.In September, Microsoft avoided a major European Union fine by agreeing to separate its Teams app from its Office software and offer lower-priced options. The European Commission accepted these commitments, bringing an end to a long antitrust investigation that began after complaints from rival companies.The case started with a 2020 complaint from Slack, which Salesforce owns. Slack said Microsoft unfairly bundled Teams with Office 365 and Microsoft 365 to gain an unfair market advantage. Another complaint was filed in 2023 by the German company Alfaview, which increased pressure on regulators.Under the agreement, Microsoft offered versions of Office 365 and Microsoft 365 without Teams at prices 1 to 8 euros lower. The company also agreed to increase the price difference between bundled and unbundled versions by 50% for some business plans.Beyond pricing, Microsoft agreed to improve interoperability between Teams competitors and its own products. It also allowed users to export Teams chats to rival services and gave long-term Office customers the option to move to unbundled versions. Most of these commitments were set to last 7 years, while data portability and interoperability commitments would remain in place for 10 years. These changes were applied globally, not only in Europe.EU executive VPTeresa Ribera said the decision opened up more competition and helped businesses choose the tools they preferred. The agreement marked a more cooperative stance from Microsoft, which had previously faced 2.2 billion euros in EU fines for similar issues. By settling, Microsoft avoided penalties that could have reached up to 10% of its global annual revenue.","Qwant accused Microsoft of placing limits on how Qwant could appear in search results and search advertising.

How the Foxconn partnership can help OpenAI





“Foxconn is uniquely positioned to support OpenAI’s mission with trusted, scalable infrastructure,”





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US. This partnership is the AI startup's newest step in its extensive infrastructure development plans. The companies stated the goal is to accelerate infrastructure deployment and secure long-term US capacity for essential AI components. While financial terms were not disclosed, OpenAI confirmed it will have early access to evaluate the systems produced by the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and Apple ’s largest supplier, along with the option to purchase them.In a statement to CNBC, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the partnership, saying:adding that AI infrastructure presents aUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities, which are located in Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Indiana.Foxconn adds another manufacturing layer to OpenAI’s supply chain, which could help make production for the AI startup more local and speed up deployment.The company is widely known for assembling Apple’s iPhones, but it has also expanded into AI and automotive manufacturing. It builds server racks designed for AI workloads and is an important global supplier to Nvidia, a major producer of high-end AI chips.Chairman Young Liu said to CNBC.However, the company has had mixed results in the US. In 2018, Foxconn began construction of a large factory in Wisconsin intended to make flat-panel displays. The project did not succeed, and the site is now being used for an AI data centre under construction by Microsoft.OpenAI has recently made several major agreements with some of the world’s biggest technology companies, announcing spending plans of about $1.4 trillion.These commitments have raised questions about whether the company will eventually generate enough profit to support that level of investment.Earlier this month, Altman said the company expects to reach $20 billion in annualised revenue by the end of the year and aims to reach hundreds of billions by 2030.Previous deals include a $100 billion agreement (yet to be finalised) with Nvidia, under which the chipmaker would invest in OpenAI in phases as the company expands its infrastructure.OpenAI also has cloud partnerships with Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, as well as significant compute buildout commitments with Oracle.","OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently struck a humorous and candid tone in the company’s recent Townhall with the employees. Huang acknowledged that despite delivering a record-shattering earnings, the market reaction was less enthusiastic. As reported by Business Insider, Huang said that Nvidia’s influence has created a no-win situation with expectations so hight that even minor missteps could shake global markets. Huang also talked about the online chatter and memes about the company’s economic role. “If we delivered a bad quarter, if we’re off by just a hair, if it just looked a little bit creaky, the whole world would’ve fallen apart. You should’ve seen some of the memes on the internet.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees.

The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

What is the EU’s Digital Markets Act



""gatekeeper""

Why Apple is resisting EU’s DMA on Maps and Ads







European Union (EU) antitrust regulators are set to investigate whether Apple Maps and Apple Ads should be subject to stricter rules under the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA). According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the Cupertino-based tech giant is resisting this move and has argued that both services should be exempted. The European Commission confirmed that Apple itself notified the regulator that both Apple Maps and Apple Ads have met the two thresholds required for potential designation as ""gatekeepers.""The EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) aims to curb the power of major technology companies and boost competition. It assigns thelabel to companies with services that have over 45 million monthly active users and a market value exceeding €75 billion ($79 billion).Apple's App Store, iOS operating system, and Safari web browser were already designated as core platform services under the DMA two years ago. The Commission now has 45 working days to decide on the designation for Apple Maps and Apple Ads. If they are designated, Apple will then have six months to comply with the new rules.The Reuters report claims that Apple has said that it had sent official rebuttals to the EU competition authority.The company told Reuters that Apple Ads is a very small player in the EU’s online advertising market, with far less market share than competitors such as Google , Meta, Microsoft, TikTok, and X. The company also explained that it does not use data from other Apple services or from third-party services to run Apple Ads.Apple added that Apple Maps has minimal use in the EU compared to services like Google Maps and Waze, the Reuters report added. The company even said that the app lacks key features that would enable it to act as a middle layer, connecting businesses and users more directly.In September, Apple escalated its dispute with European regulators by warning that it might stop shipping iPhones and other products to the EU unless the Digital Markets Act (DMA) was repealed or changed.Apple said the law caused delayed features and added security risks for users in Europe. The company had already postponed iPhone Mirroring, Live Translation with AirPods, and new Maps features.The iPhone maker argued that the DMA’s rules forced Apple to allow third-party access to data, which reduced privacy and safety. Apple also said the law gave unfair advantages to competitors like Samsung. The European Commission had not yet responded, but previously upheld a €500 million fine against Apple.","EU antitrust regulators are set to investigate whether Apple Maps and Apple Ads should be subject to stricter rules under the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the Cupertino-based tech giant is resisting this move.

This follows their recent crackdown on calls. In a parallel development, the state is heavily promoting its own 'Superapp', MAX, which has drawn skepticism regarding its potential for user surveillance.

""If the messaging service continues to fail to meet the demands of Russian legislation, it will be completely blocked.""

How Russia is planning to replace WhatsApp

“Superapp,”

“sovereign internet,”





Russia's state communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, has reportedly threatened to block WhatsApp nationwide. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the country may put a total ban on the Meta-owned messaging service for failing to comply with Russian law. The watchdog specifically accused WhatsApp of failing to comply with Russian legal requirements aimed at preventing and combating crime. This threat follows earlier actions taken by Russia in August, when the country began limiting some calls on both WhatsApp and Telegram. At that time, authorities accused both foreign-owned platforms of refusing to share necessary information with law enforcement officials dealing with fraud and terrorism cases.The Reuters report cited the Interfax news agency to claim what Roskomnadzor said about Russia plans on banning WhatsApp. The Russian communications watchdog said:Meanwhile, WhatsApp has accused Moscow of trying to stop millions of Russians from using secure communication, the Reuters report added.Russian authorities are promoting a state-backed alternative app called MAX, which critics say could be used to track users. However, the country’s media has rejected those claims as false.Last month, Russia launched a major campaign to get people to download MAX, a government-backed messaging app. MAX is designed as acombining many digital services in one place, similar to apps like WeChat.The government is promoting the app everywhere through billboards, in schools, and by having it pre-installed on new phones. According to its parent company, more than 45 million people have created MAX accounts, and about 18 million use it every day.MAX, which was launched in March, can only be installed with Russian or Belarusian phone numbers. Virtual SIM cards are blocked, and people outside these countries cannot register, meaning Russians living abroad cannot use MAX unless they still have a Russian or Belarusian number.In August, the government announced that MAX would become a mandatory pre-installed app on all phones and tablets sold in Russia starting September 1. The app will be linked directly to state services.However, analysts say MAX is part of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s larger plan to control internet access and build what the government calls aseparate from Western technology.Meanwhile, another app, LIME HD TV, which streams state TV channels, will also be required on all smart TVs sold in Russia starting January 1, 2026.Russia is promoting domestic apps after placing limits on calls made through WhatsApp and Telegram. Authorities claim these companies did not cooperate with law enforcement in fraud and terrorism cases.WhatsApp, which had 97.3 million Russian users in July, accused Moscow of trying to block secure communication. Telegram, with 90.8 million users, said it works to prevent misuse. VK Messenger, which had 17.9 million users, is owned by the same state-controlled company that created MAX. Russian media also denies claims that MAX is a spying tool and collects less data than WhatsApp or Telegram.","Russia's state communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, has reportedly threatened to block WhatsApp nationwide.

How AI boom can hurt tech companies dependent on memory chips

“costs move at the rate”

“The cost basis is going up across all products.”

“We have entered an era in which supply is facing a bottleneck,”

“Everything that’s related to memory — advanced or conventional — is in very strong demand and supply is lagging.”





There are two major types of memory chips: some help computers process information, and others store data. Right now, chip makers are focusing more on advanced memory used in AI systems because these products are more complex and profitable. As a result, they are making fewer regular memory chips that devices like PCs and phones still need.In a statement to Bloomberg, Dell CEO Jeff Clarke said the company has never seenthey are today. Dell is struggling to find enough DRAM, including both high-bandwidth memory used for AI and the regular memory used in personal computers. The company is also short on hard drives and NAND flash memory.Clark notedDell will adjust its product options, but it has warned that customers will feel the impact. The company may raise prices. US sanctions have complicated matters by limiting what new Chinese chip companies can do, further cutting supply.Other tech companies face similar challenges. HP’s CEO Enrique Lores said the second half of 2026 will be challenging.The company plans to raise prices when needed.“For the second half, we are taking a prudent approach to our guide, while at the same time we’re implementing aggressive actions,” Lores said to Bloomberg. This includes finding more memory suppliers and using less memory inside products. HP says memory makes up 15% to 18% of the cost of a typical PC.While PC makers struggle, memory chip manufacturers are doing very well. Stock prices for Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron have risen as supplies shrink. SK Hynix has already sold out its entire memory chip supply for next year. Micron expects shortages to continue into 2026.SK Group chairman Chey Tae-won warned.Japan’s Kioxia has also seen its stock jump after its public listing. Analyst Sanjeev Rana said to Bloomberg:The shortage may also affect logic chips used for AI systems. Some customers may stop ordering if they cannot find enough memory chips to match them. SMIC, China’s leading chipmaker, warned that shortages may hurt car and electronics production in 2026.Xiaomi has already raised phone prices, while Lenovo and Asus have built up large stockpiles. On the other hand, Apple says that it is managing costs well.","Dell is struggling to find enough DRAM, including both high-bandwidth memory used for AI and the regular memory used in personal computers.

To know the exact time right now, please check the clock on your phone, laptop, or any device you’re using. It will show the correct IST time instantly. If you want help with time conversions, calculations, or scheduling, I can absolutely do that.”

“I don't have access to real-time information, so I can't tell you the current time. To find out what time it is, you can: “Check your phone, computer, or watch, ask a voice assistant like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant or look at a clock nearby. Is there anything else I can help you with?”

Why are some chatbots unable to tell the time





“

A language model works in its own space of language and words. It is only referencing things that have entered this space.”

“It’s like a castaway on an island in the middle of the ocean, stocked with a massive collection of books but no watch. Why can’t OpenAI just build a bridge to that island and give ChatGPT access to a system time clock? The short answer is, it can,” t

What OpenAI said about ChatGPT’s time-telling ‘problem’





“The models powering ChatGPT don’t have built-in access to the current time, so for up-to-date facts ChatGPT sometimes needs to call search to pull in the latest information.”

“We’re continuing to improve how consistently it knows when to do so,”





ChatGPT can perform several complex tasks, such as browsing the web, writing code, and analysing images. However, the popular OpenAI chatbot isn’t capable of doing a basic thing: telling you the right time. When asked ""what is time right now,"" ChatGPT simply says that it cannot provide real-time information. When we at the TOI Tech desk asked this question, the chatbot replied:However, this isn’t only a ChatGPT problem; Anthropic’s Claude was also unable to tell us the time. On asking Claude the same question, the chatbot said:On the other hand, chatbots like Google’s Gemini, Microsoft’s Copilot, and even Elon Musk’s xAI-owned Grok were able to display the exact time, along with our time zone and other details.In a statement to The Verge, AI robotics expert Yervant Kulbashian, who wrote about the concept of time as perceived by AI in 2024, said:he report noted.Kulbashian further explained that keeping AI models aware of time creates problems, as ChatGPT has limited space in its context window, the information it remembers at any given time. Each time ChatGPT checks a system clock, it adds information to that window.Kulbashian noted. If updated too often, constant clock information becomes confusing noise for the AI.Kulbashian said, comparing it to someone interrupting a conversation every minute to announce the time.So, ChatGPT users can ask the chatbot to search for the time directly. Meanwhile, some chatbots, like Google Gemini, search automatically. However, allowing AI models to search the web or access personal data carries risks, including exposure to malicious prompts online, Minervini warned.However, during an interview with The Verge, Pasquale Minervini, a natural language processing researcher at the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, has also demonstrated how his desktop ChatGPT app immediately showed him the correct time in Milan, Italy, where he was located.Minervini explained.The timely information was likelyof the app, he said. Earlier, Minervini turned on thefunction on the ChatGPT app, which allows ChatGPT to use his computer's built-in time tools, along with the web, to get the time.Minervini, who studies blind spots in consumer AI technology, said AI models struggle with many time-related tasks. When he showed leading AI models pictures of analogue clocks, they couldn't read the clock hands correctly. Calendars are ""also weird"" for AI, he noted.Meanwhile, OpenAI spokesperson Taya Christianson told The Verge:Christianson added.","ChatGPT can perform several complex tasks, such as browsing the web, writing code, and analysing images.

What ‘breakthrough’ caught Musk’s attention







At a time when tech giants like Google , Facebook-parent Meta and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI are offering massive salaries to secure top AI talent, two 22-year-old Chinese students have revealed they turned down a multi-million dollar offer from Elon Musk ’s xAI. The friends, William Chen and Guan Wang, have claimed that they rejected the highly lucrative pay package to pursue a greater, high-stakes gamble: building a “brain-inspired” reasoning system that they believe will be the first to achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).According to a report by Fortune, Chen and Wang said that they received an offer from Musk two years ago, following the viral success of the small large-language model (LLM) the students had developed, called OpenChat. Instead of training their model on massive internet data dumps, Chen and Wang used a small, carefully chosen set of high-quality conversations. In the process, they also pioneered the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to teach the model to refine its behaviour through feedback and rewards.They said that OpenChat quickly became famous in academic circles, cited by researchers at Berkeley and Stanford as a prime example of how a small model trained on good data could outperform systems based on sheer volume of data.The attention OpenChat received quickly landed in Elon Musk’s inbox, resulting in the multi-million dollar recruitment offer from his new company, xAI. However, Chen and Wang chose to reject the deal, by saying that current large-scale machine learning architecture was fundamentally limited.“We decided that large-language models have their limitations. We want a new architecture that will overcome the structural limitation of [large-scale machine learning],” Chen was quoted as saying.The pair dedicated two years to launch their new company, Sapient Intelligence whose model reportedly shows promise, outperforming some of the world’s biggest existing AI systems on tests of abstract reasoning.","Two 22-year-old Chinese students have revealed they turned down a multi-million dollar offer from Elon Musk ’s xAI.

A new AI model behind the craze







An AI-generated world’s most powerful tech titans standing in a dimly lit parking lot gained a lot attention online. The image consisted of Elon Musk Mark Zuckerberg , Sundar Pichai, Jensen Huang, Sam Altman, Tim Cook and Jeff Bezos. Now, a new AI-generated image is making the rounds of social media sparking both amusement and debate. The viral image is of a Thanksgiving dinner party shared by CEO of Futurum Research Daniel Newman. The AI-generated image consists of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. “Seriously…AI is too much,” Newman wrote, as his hyper-realistic photos quickly went viral.The surge in realistic Thanksgiving imagery coincided with the launch of Google Gemini’s Nano Banana Pro, an updated AI image generator released just days before the holiday. Compared to earlier versions, users noted its hyper-realism, with sharper facial details and more convincing lighting.Nano Banana Pro stunned audiences by producing images of tech CEOs partying together — adding to the week’s flood of AI-generated content.Meanwhile, other platforms joined the holiday showcase: OpenAI’s Sora released animated turkey videos, and Topaz Labs restored archival footage of the 1940s Macy’s Day Parade.As AI-generated photos become harder to distinguish from reality, experts warn that Thanksgiving’s viral images are more than just entertainment — they’re a reminder of how quickly synthetic media is advancing. For now, the dinner table may be the safest place to laugh at AI’s creativity, but the challenge of spotting fakes is growing.So while you pass the cranberry sauce this holiday season, it might also be worth passing around a few tips for spotting AI images — before they become indistinguishable from the real thing.","A new AI-generated image is making the rounds of social media sparking both amusement and debate.

O'Leary walks back on his 2018 advice to students







Canadian millionaire and Shark Tank investor Kevin O’Leary has now shifted his stance. Leary recently gave an advice to students, walking back his view that engineering was the only graduate degree worth pursuing. Leary recently shared a post on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). In the post O’Leary mentioned that the biggest paydays in 2025 are going to the elite content creators who have the potential to drive online sales and also reduce customer acquisition costs.“Ten years ago I said engineering was the only master's degree worth pursuing. Not anymore. The fastest wage growth today is in creative storytelling across social media, people who can lower customer acquisition costs and increase ROAS every single week,” O’Leary wrote.O’Leary emphasises that the top creators today are earring far beyond the entry-level salaries. “Those creators aren't making $25K… they're making $250K or $800K across multiple companies. Why? Because they're measurable. Content is king, and the storytellers are winning,” he added.The comments mark a departure from O’Leary’s earlier stance. In a 2018 CNBC interview, he urged students to pursue engineering as the most lucrative career path, praising engineers for turning patents into companies.By 2020, however, he acknowledged on YouTuber Evan Carmichael’s podcast that his opinion had changed, pointing to social media content as the fastest-growing cost center across his portfolio of more than 50 companies.In recent years, O’Leary has argued that every business now requires an in-house media operation to tell its story online and lower acquisition costs through targeted campaigns. He has consistently highlighted the measurable impact of content creation on sales, positioning storytelling as a critical skill in today’s economy.At the same time, O’Leary has remained skeptical about the value of traditional postgraduate business education.

Why Baidu is cutting jobs









Baidu, China’s largest search engine operator, has reportedly started large-scale layoffs this week affecting multiple business units. Citing sources familiar with the matter, news agency Reuters reported that the cuts are expected to run until the end of the year. The move comes shortly after the company reported a disappointing third-quarter loss. The report also says that the layoffs are internally perceived to be significant.While the number of job losses could not be immediately established, Reuters cited two sources as saying that the layoff ratio may reach as high as 40% for some teams, depending on performance and business unit.The job reductions are said to be driven primarily by financial strain and intensifying competition in both core advertising and the burgeoning AI sector. Baidu reported the second straight quarterly revenue decline, with total revenue falling 7% year-over-year in the third quarter. The company posted a net loss of 11.23 billion yuan ($1.59 billion) for the period.Furthermore, Baidu’s core online advertising revenue, which provides the majority of its income, saw an 18% drop in the third quarter. The company’s workforce stood at 35,900 at the end of last year, continuing a multi-year trend of headcount reduction from a peak of 41,300 in 2022.It has also been reported that the cuts will not be distributed evenly. Reuters says that the mobile ecosystem group (MEG) is expected to bear the brunt of the staff reductions. Moreover, roles tied to AI development and cloud computing will largely be shielded.Baidu’s Ernie large language model is said to be struggling to maintain its early lead against offerings from rivals, including Alibaba and the AI start-up DeepSeek. Adoption of the Ernie Bot app has reportedly lagged significantly, recording 10.77 million monthly active users in September, far lower than the 150 million users reported for ByteDance's Doubao.","Baidu, China’s largest search engine operator, has reportedly started large- scale layoffs this week affecting multiple business units.

MIT puts a number on how many US workers AI is already capable of replacing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mit-puts-a-number-on-how-many-us-workers-ai-is-already-capable-of-replacing/articleshow/125636414.cms,"Representative Image

“Basically, we are creating a digital twin for the US labour market.”

How the Iceberg Index calculated the number of jobs AI can already replace in US



""One of the things that you can go down to is county-specific data to essentially say, within a certain census block, here are the skills that is currently happening now and then matching those skills with what are the likelihood of them being automated or augmented, and what could that mean in terms of the shifts in the state's GDP in that area, but also in employment,""

""Project Iceberg enables policymakers and business leaders to identify exposure hotspots, prioritise training and infrastructure investments, and test interventions before committing billions to implementation,""





A new study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology puts a number on how many US jobs could already be done by artificial intelligence (AI). The study, which CNBC has seen, finds that AI can already replace work completed by 11.7% of the US workforce, or about $1.2 trillion in wages across major sectors like finance, healthcare, and professional services. The research used a new tool, the Iceberg Index, developed by MIT and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The index simulates how 151 million US workers interact across the country and how AI and government policies might impact them.The Iceberg Index offers a detailed look at how AI may change the job market-not just in technology centres but in every state, down to the zip code level. For government leaders planning major investments in worker retraining and education, the index provides a map of where job disruption is likely to occur.Talking about the study using the Iceberg Index, Prasanna Balaprakash, ORNL director and co-leader of the research, said:ORNL is a Department of Energy research centre in eastern Tennessee, home to the Frontier supercomputer, which powers many large-scale modelling efforts.The index runs population-level experiments, showing how AI changes tasks, skills and labour flows before those changes appear in the real economy, Balaprakash said.The index treats 151 million workers as individual agents, each tagged with skills, tasks, occupation and location. It maps more than 32,000 skills across 923 occupations in 3,000 counties, then measures where current AI systems can already perform those skills.Researchers found that the visible part of layoffs and role shifts in tech, computing, and information technology accounts for just 2.2% of total wage exposure, or about $211 billion. Below the surface lies the total exposure: $1.2 trillion in wages, including routine functions in human resources, logistics, finance, and office administration.However, it's important to note that the index is not a prediction tool about when or where jobs will be lost.

Trump ‘HURTS’ Carney, Canada PM Announces ‘End Of Ties’ With US In Shocking Address | FULL

Canada does not see deal with Donald Trump working

Nothing to talk about on interaction with Trump





Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada is counting on the country's energy sector to help the Canadian economy weather uncertainty from the US President Donald Trump ’s tariffs. Carney signed an agreement with Alberta's premier that rolls back certain climate rules to spur investment in energy production, while encouraging construction of a new oil pipeline to the West Coast. Under the agreement, the federal government will scrap a planned emissions cap on the oil and gas sector and drop rules on clean electricity, in exchange for a commitment by Canada's top oil-producing province to strengthen industrial carbon pricing and support a carbon capture-and-storage project.Carney is seeking to diversify from the US market which currently takes 90 per cent of Canada’s oil exports. In remarks at an industry event in Calgary recently, Carney said that US tariffs and the resulting uncertainty will wipe $50 billion from Canada’s economy, the equivalent of $1,300 for every Canadian. He stressed the need to build projects that can spur growth and reduce US reliance. “This government will do whatever it takes to protect our sectors,” Carney told a news conference. “Not just protect them, but to help them reposition for the new global economy,” Carney said.The energy deal, which has been reportedly hailed by the country's oil industry but panned by environmentalists, signaled a shift in Canada's energy policy in favor of fossil fuel development and is already creating tensions within Carney's minority government. Steven Guilbeault, who served as environment minister under Carney's predecessor Justin Trudeau , said he was quitting the cabinet over concerns that Canada's climate plan was being dismantled.In what is seen as a huge change in policy, Canadian PM has relaxed some environmental restrictions implemented by his predecessor, Justin Trudeau, while reaffirming his commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Agreement also drops regulations for clean electricity. Canada seeks to diversify oil exports amid US trade uncertainty. Agreement removes emissions cap, aims to boost carbon pricing and storage.In what can be termed as tacit acknowledgment that a trade deal with the United States is increasingly unlikely, Prime Minister Carney introduced several measures Wednesday to keep afloat two industries severely harmed by President Donald Trump's flurry of tariffs: steel and lumber. Carney's move includes a new tariff on steel products, a reduction in the amount of foreign steel allowed into the country and a lowering of costs to move lumber and steel by rail.Carney said that Canada would impose a 25% tariff on largely steel products like prefabricated buildings, wire and fasteners. Officials estimated that about 40% of those products come from the United States. Canada has a separate 25% tariff on U.S. steel.Canadian PM also recently said that he had spoken to President Trump this week, but added that the exchange was ""not newsworthy"". He further added that no talks were underway between the two countries right now. At the same time Canadian PM maintained that he wants to have good relations between US and Canada. “Of course we want to further improve the existing trading relationship with the United States,” Carney said. “We stand ready to re-engage when they are. But, at the same time, we’re going to do a few other things.”","Carney is seeking to diversify from the US market which currently takes 90 per cent of Canada’s oil exports.

Tesla cofounder has this 'EV solution' to help reduce America's dependence on China for rare earth minerals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tesla-cofounder-has-this-ev-solution-to-help-reduce-americas-dependence-on-china-for-critical-minerals/articleshow/125635950.cms,"Representative Image

""critical minerals""

Why Tesla co-founder JB Straubel thinks old EVs can restrict US dependence on China for rare earth minerals



“Being able to tap into materials that are already in the market can dramatically reduce the pressure on what’s needed to mine. Once you have some diversity of supply, you reduce the risk of the [Chinese] monopoly and the geopolitical concentration.”

“urban mines.”

""miner""





Tesla co-founder JB Straubel believes recycling used electric vehicle (EV) batteries can be the key to reducing America's reliance on China for crucial raw materials. Straubel, who previously led battery development at the Elon Musk-led electric car maker, founded Redwood Materials in 2017 to recapture the massive amounts of rare-earth minerals that are often wasted when an EV battery reaches the end of its life. Recycling these retired EV batteries, which contain lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, and more, can create a domestic supply of materials for new batteries used in everything from energy storage and military equipment to AI data centres and smartphones.Currently, China dominates most of the world’s supply chains for these, a list that includes 60 natural elements deemed vital by the US government, of which the country produces only a small amount. Redwood Materials is now rapidly expanding as America’s primary defence effort to recycle these minerals and secure its own domestic supply chain.In a statement to Fortune, Straubel said,Earlier this year, the US launched a tariff war with China. In response, Beijing has threatened to withhold certain rare-earth minerals from Washington. Since then, the US has focused on investments and partnerships for developing its own critical minerals mining, refining, recycling, and magnet and battery manufacturing. China currently accounts for over 80% of the global production of battery materials.The US can't just open a dozen new mines overnight. So, recycling will play a key role, and Redwood Materials already controls roughly 90% of lithium-ion battery recycling in North America, which is equivalent to 250,000 EV batteries per year.However, that 90% equals only about 10% of the EV battery deployment in the US each year. That means Redwood could expand its capacity by 10 times, even if the EV market share stays flat in the US.Straubel refers to Redwood's facilities asRedwood runs its battery recycling from its Nevada campus and now has a brand-new, $3.5 billion, 600-acre plant in South Carolina. Recently, chip giant Nvidia also invested in the company as a strategic investor.“The end goal is creating a circular economy where recycling—not mining—becomes the primary source of the minerals. You're decoupled from the geologic mine from where these things are naturally found in the earth,” Straubel noted.Already, Redwood is the nation's leadingof cobalt through its recycling efforts, and near the top in lithium and nickel.""As EVs and other energy storage products proliferate in the market, we have this incredible opportunity to evolve toward this materials economy for those products that will be 98% or 99% remanufactured over time,” Straubel added.Besides mining batteries for parts, Redwood is also developing its own battery energy storage systems, called BESS, from recycled materials. Redwood has already deployed a battery-storage microgrid for OpenAI's Stargate data centre campus in Texas. Redwood's primary source of batteries is EVs, but the company even recycles lithium-ion batteries in all shapes and sizes.","Tesla co-founder JB Straubel believes recycling used electric vehicle (EV) batteries can be the key to reducing America's reliance on China for crucial raw materials.

Verizon's Apple deal pros and cons for consumers



Benefits

Customers receive an iPhone 17 Pro Max, an A16 iPad, and an Apple Watch Series 11 without paying the full retail price upfront.

All devices operate on a single carrier, offering convenience for those who need cellular connectivity across multiple Apple products.

Users upgrading from older technology may see significant savings compared to buying these devices outright.

Key considerations

The “free” pricing is dependent on staying with Verizon for the full 36-month period. Cancelling early results in the remaining device costs becoming payable.

Monthly charges for the required accessory lines add to the long-term cost of the deal.

For users who rely mostly on Wi-Fi for tablets or smartwatches, the mandatory cellular plans may provide limited value.

WhatsApp Makes Group Calls Smarter





WhatsApp's new policy blocks rival AI chatbots, leaves Meta AI alone

How to save your chat history before the January 15 deadline





ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot will no longer be available on WhatsApp after January 15, 2026, following Meta's updated platform policies that effectively ban rival AI chatbots from the messaging service. The policy change, announced in October 2025, prohibits AI companies from using WhatsApp's business API as a distribution platform for chatbots where artificial intelligence is the primary product being offered.OpenAI announced its departure in late October, revealing that over 50 million users had engaged with ChatGPT on WhatsApp. Microsoft followed with its announcement on November 24, confirming Copilot would also discontinue service on the same date. Both companies attributed their exits to WhatsApp's revised Business Solution Terms, which took effect October 28, 2025.The new terms specifically target AI providers, including developers of large language models and generative AI platforms, preventing them from accessing WhatsApp's infrastructure when AI technology constitutes their core offering. A Meta spokesperson clarified the policy aims to support businesses using WhatsApp for customer service and relevant updates, not as a distribution channel for competing AI products.The restriction leaves Meta AI as the sole chatbot option on WhatsApp starting mid-January 2026. Other third-party AI assistants, including Perplexity, are expected to announce similar departures. However, businesses can still deploy customer service chatbots where AI serves a supporting rather than primary function.ChatGPT users can link their WhatsApp conversations to a ChatGPT account to preserve chat history, with the service remaining accessible until the cutoff date. Microsoft Copilot users lack this transfer option but can export conversations using WhatsApp's built-in tools before service ends.Both companies are directing users toward their native applications and web platforms, which offer expanded features beyond WhatsApp integration. The Copilot mobile app and website provide voice, vision, and companion features, while ChatGPT offers voice conversations, deep research capabilities, and file uploads across iOS, Android, web, and MacOS platforms.","ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot will no longer be available on WhatsApp after January 15, 2026.

What is Agentic AI







At a time when companies like Google, Microsoft, ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and other tech giants are rooting for the Agentic AI era, Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has shared an example on how risky it is to over-rely on artificial intelligence in corporate communication. In Vembu’s example, the incident involved an AI assistant revealing highly confidential acquisition details. The scenario began when he received a pitch from a startup founder proposing an acquisition by Zoho.He said that an initial email contained sensitive financial information which may have been intended only for internal employees, including the existence of a competing offer. The startup founder's pitch quickly turned into a corporate disclosure. The email revealed that some company is interested in acquiring them.“I got an email from a startup founder, asking if we could acquire them, mentioning some other company interested in acquiring them and the price they were offering,” Vembu said.What followed was an immediate follow-up from the startup’s automation system, highlighting the lack of guardrails on emerging AI tools.“Then I received an email from their ""browser AI agent"" correcting the earlier mail saying ‘I am sorry I disclosed confidential information about other discussions, it was my fault as the AI agent’” Vembu added.In easier terms, Agentic AI refers to an autonomous AI system that can plan and take actions on users’ behalf or with minimal human intervention to achieve a goal. AI agents, unlike AI chatbots that respond to commands, make decisions on their own and can adapt to changing conditions by using capabilities like reasoning, natural language understanding, and memory.Consider AI agents like Marvel character Tony Stark's JARVIS or FRIDAY that work, even when Stark is not around.","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has shared an example on how risky it is to over-rely on artificial intelligence in corporate communication.

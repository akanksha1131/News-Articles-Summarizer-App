China is poised to unleash a wave of artificial intelligence innovation, with over 100 breakthroughs akin to DeepSeek expected in the next 18 months, according to Zhu Min, former deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China. Speaking at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Tianjin, Zhu said these advancements “will fundamentally change the nature and the tech nature of the whole Chinese economy,” as reported by Bloomberg.Zhu, also a former deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund, attributed China’s AI potential to its vast pool of engineers, massive consumer base, and supportive government policies. However, he warned that global trade faces headwinds, telling reporters, “The uncertainty brought by U.S. tariff policy is an important factor that may lead to negative growth in global trade this year.” As per the report, Zhu noted that the global trade industrial chain is slowing, with investments stalling, amplifying the impact beyond tariff rates alone. Zhu predicted U.S. inflation could rise starting in August as companies deplete pre-tariff stockpiles.""China saw strong GDP growth, highest since December 2023""Despite external pressures, China’s economy shows resilience. Huang Yiping, a member of the People’s Bank of China’s monetary policy committee, estimated second-quarter GDP growth exceeded 5%, citing strong April and May performance and positive June indicators. Speaking at the Tianjin forum, Huang, who is also dean of Peking University’s National School of Development, highlighted robust retail sales in May, which grew at the fastest pace since December 2023.However, Huang emphasized that boosting consumption remains a challenge, particularly as global markets become less accessible. “For a large country, you can’t continuously export your excess capacity,” he said, advocating a focus on domestic circulation as a policy priority.Reflecting on past stimulus measures, Huang acknowledged criticisms of China’s aggressive response during the global financial crisis, which led to asset bubbles and local government debt. Still, he supported decisive action today, stating, “I personally would still support decisive policy action today, and then quickly turn around to deal with the problems later.”","Zhu Min, former deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China, predicted over 100 breakthroughs akin to DeepSeek in the next 18 months.

Americas contributed the largest share of the total revenue

Accenture, a global IT services and consulting giant with a significant workforce in India, reported an 8% year-on-year revenue increase to $7.7 billion for its March-May 2025 quarter, driven by strong demand for AI-related services. The Ireland-based company, which operates on a September-August fiscal calendar, noted a positive 0.5% foreign exchange impact on its quarterly revenues.The company raised the lower end of its full-year revenue growth forecast to 6-7% in local currency, up from 5-7%, reflecting confidence in its performance. However, challenges persisted, with gross margin dipping to 32.9% from 33.4% a year earlier and a record quarterly headcount reduction of 10,337, bringing its global workforce to approximately 790,000. Despite a $2.15 billion year-on-year increase in generative AI (GenAI) bookings for the first nine months of FY25, overall bookings fell by $1.75 billion compared to the same period in FY24.Accenture continues to invest heavily in AI, growing its data and AI workforce to 75,000 and targeting 80,000 by the end of FY26. “We are a leader in GenAI, achieving another milestone quarter with $1.5 billion in bookings and over $700 million in revenues,” said Chair and CEO Julie Sweet during the earnings call. She highlighted total GenAI bookings of $4.1 billion and revenues of $1.8 billion for the year to date.The Americas led regional performance, contributing $8.97 billion to total revenue, followed by Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) with $6.23 billion, and Asia-Pacific with $2.53 billion. New bookings for the quarter totaled $19.7 billion, down 6% in U.S. dollars, with $9.08 billion from consulting services and $10.62 billion from managed services.Accenture’s cash balance stood at $9.6 billion at the end of third quarter. Looking ahead, the company projects Q4 FY25 revenues between $17 billion and $17.6 billion, signaling optimism for continued growth. “We remain focused on being our clients’ reinvention partner of choice, as evidenced by $19.7 billion in bookings, including 30 clients with quarterly bookings exceeding $100 million,” Sweet added, emphasizing Accenture’s leadership in large-scale transformations.","Accenture reported an 8% year-on-year revenue increase to $7.7 billion for its March-May 2025 quarter.

America's China threat and fear

Huawei Technologies new MateBook Fold relies on a 7-nanometer chip made by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC), using technology from years ago, indicating that U.S. sanctions continue to hinder China’s progress in advanced semiconductor development, Bloomberg reported, citing Canada-based consultancy TechInsights. This chip uses the same 7nm process as Huawei’s Mate 60 Pro, which surprised U.S. officials in 2023. In contrast, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is set to mass-produce 2nm chips, three generations ahead, later this year.The foldable notebook-tablet hybrid, launched in May, runs on Huawei’s HarmonyOS and reflects Beijing’s push for tech self-reliance amid U.S.-led restrictions, Bloomberg noted. However, China struggles to access cutting-edge chipmaking tools, as ASML Holding NV is barred from selling advanced lithography machines to Chinese firms. TechInsights stated, “This likely means that SMIC has not yet achieved a 5nm-equivalent node that can be produced at scale,” highlighting the impact of U.S. technology controls on SMIC’s ability to compete with leading foundries.The US sees China as a key rival in the field of artificial intelligence. The rise of DeepSeek earlier this year sending shock waves across US technology companies and wiping billions from their valuation. In addition to efforts to prevent China from securing advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, Washington is blocking Chinese companies from acquiring Nvidia's high-end AI chips for training, citing national security concerns. Beijing, on its part, is now pinning its hopes on Huawei and SMIC when it comes to advanced chipmaking.Despite Huawei’s 2023 debut of a China-made 7nm chip, progress has stalled, with U.S. export controls limiting Huawei to producing only 200,000 Ascend AI chips in 2025, according to U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Kessler, Bloomberg reported. Washington views China as a rival in AI, especially after DeepSeek’s global emergence in 2025, and continues to block access to Nvidia’s high-end AI chips. Huawei’s founder Ren Zhengfei, in an interview with People’s Daily, downplayed U.S. curbs, suggesting techniques like chip stacking could mimic advanced semiconductor results.","Huawei Technologies new MateBook Fold relies on a 7-nanometer chip made by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.

Google Chrome will stop supporting Android 8.0 Oreo and Android 9.0 Pie starting with version 139, according to Chrome Support Manager Ellen T. The announcement was made on the official Chrome support forums. After this update – scheduled for release on August 5, 2025, Chrome will only work on Android 10 or newer, leaving users with older phones unable to receive further updates. “Chrome 138 is the last version of Chrome that will support Android 8.0 (Oreo) and Android 9.0 (Pie),” Ellen wrote in the forum.While users can continue using Chrome version 138 on their Android 8 and 9 devices, they will no longer receive new features, performance improvements, or critical security updates. Over time, this could affect the browser’s performance and leave devices more vulnerable to threats.To recall, Android 8.0 was first released in 2017, and Android 9.0 followed in 2018. Despite their age, these operating systems still have a notable user base. Based on Google's platform distribution data from April 2025, about 4% of Android devices run Oreo, while 5.8% use Pie.Android 10, by comparison, powers over 10% of devices.For users still on Android 8 or 9, one option is to keep using Chrome 138, although it's not recommended due to the lack of security updates. Another alternative is to switch to browsers like Firefox, which continues to support devices running Android 5.0 and above. However, compatibility varies across browsers, and some may not function properly on older systems.Ultimately, upgrading to a newer Android device is the most reliable solution to ensure ongoing support and security for apps like Chrome.","Google Chrome will stop supporting Android 8.0 Oreo and Android 9.0 Pie starting with version 139.

“We reject the exploitative logic that sees the city as a commodity. What worries us even more is a mayor who prefers selling Venice rather than addressing the real problems its residents face — rising living costs, housing prices, the depopulation of the historic center. The setup of this mega-event is emblematic of the mayor’s vision for Venice. These kinds of events create precarious, seasonal jobs that are overly dependent on foreign demand.

Australia's internet watchdog and Google-owned YouTube engaged in a spat, after the regulator urged the government to reverse its planned exemption for the video-sharing platform from a world-first ban on social media for teens. Australia aims to be the first country to fine social media companies that fail to block users under the age of 16.The government, led by Anthony Albanese, had previously indicated it would grant YouTube a waiver, citing the platform's utility for educational and health content. Other social media giants, including Meta's Facebook and Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok, have argued that such an exemption would create an unfair playing field.eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant revealed she wrote to the government last week, advocating for no exemptions when the law takes effect. She highlighted the regulator's research, which found that 37% of children aged 10 to 15 reported encountering harmful content on YouTube – the highest percentage among all social media sites surveyed.“This is not a fair fight where our kids are concerned, vis-a-vis social media sites,” Inman Grant said. She contended that social media companies employ “persuasive design features"" like recommendation-based algorithms and notifications to maximise user engagement.Inman Grant specifically accused YouTube of having “mastered those, opaque algorithms driving users down rabbit holes they're powerless to fight against.”In a swift rebuttal via a blog post, YouTube accused Inman Grant of providing ""inconsistent and contradictory advice."" Rachel Lord, YouTube's public policy manager for Australia and New Zealand, asserted that the Commissioner ""chose to ignore this data, the decision of the Australian Government and other clear evidence from teachers and parents that YouTube is suitable for younger users,"" referencing government research that found 69% of parents considered the platform suitable for those under 15.When questioned about surveys supporting a YouTube exemption, Inman Grant firmly stated her priority: ""about the safety of children and that's always going to surpass any concerns I have about politics or being liked or bringing the public onside.""","Australia aims to be the first country to fine social media companies that fail to block users under the age of 16.

Fresh stolen data could fuel next wave of online crime

Immediate action required for all users

Security researchers have uncovered an unprecedented data breach involving 16 billion login credentials across 30 databases, potentially affecting users of major platforms including Facebook Gmail , Apple, and countless other services. The discovery, made by CyberNews researchers during an ongoing investigation since January 2025, represents what could be the largest credential leak in history.The exposed datasets range dramatically in size, from smaller collections containing tens of millions of records to massive databases housing over 3.5 billion credentials each. The massive trove of stolen data was briefly accessible through unsecured databases before being locked down, though researchers were unable to identify the owners. Most concerning is that virtually all datasets were previously unreported, with only one 184-million-record database having been disclosed before by Wired magazine in May.The leaked credentials span virtually every major online service imaginable, creating a ""blueprint for mass exploitation,"" according to the research team. The databases contain login information for social media giants like Facebook and Instagram, email services including Gmail, developer platforms such as GitHub, messaging apps like Telegram, VPN services, and even government portals.Each record typically follows a standard format: website URL, username, and password. This structure matches the collection methods used by infostealer malware, malicious software designed to harvest sensitive information from infected devices.“Telegram's primary login method is a one-time-password delivered by SMS. As a result, this is far less relevant for Telegram users compared to other platforms where the password is always the same,” Telegram said in a statement to TOI.Unlike recycled data from old breaches, researchers emphasise this represents ""fresh, weaponizable intelligence at scale."" The credentials provide cybercriminals with unprecedented access for account takeovers, identity theft, and highly targeted phishing campaigns that can devastate both individuals and organisations.CyberNews researchers warn that new massive datasets emerge every few weeks, highlighting the pervasive nature of infostealer malware in today's digital landscape.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a warning to American businesses: the real labor crisis isn’t a worker shortage—it’s a skills shortage . Speaking at the Business Routable’s CEO Workforce Forum, Dimon asked the coperate leaders to not wait for the government fixes and should directly partner with the schools to close the growing talent gap. “What you’re really short of is the skills you need,” Dimon said, pointing to critical areas like cybersecurity, coding, project management, and financial literacy . He stressed that the companies must invest in education pipelines and push for curricula which blends job-ready credentials with traditional academics.Jamie Dimon who is an advocate of workforce development , feels that continous mismatch between available jobs and qualified candidates act as a threat to economic growth and innovation across multiple sectors ranging from advanced manufacturing and healthcare to technology and financial services.He also mentioned that global estimates suggest that 10 millions of jobs will go unfilled by 2030 due to lack of skilled talent.""We need to break down the barriers between education and employment ,"" Jamie Dimon stated at a recent economic summit. ""It's time to build a system that helps people learn, adapt, and thrive throughout their careers—not just at the start.""Dimon asked for high-schools and colleges to offer workplace focused courses as part of their curriculum. The billionaire banker also stressed that businesses can’t rely solely on four-year degrees. “They all want jobs,” he said of young graduates. “But many end up in retail or inventory roles, when there are jobs in coding, cyber, and financial management.”Jamie Dimon is also calling for unprecedented collaboration between the private sector, government agencies, and educational institutions. He advocates for incentives for companies that invest in workforce training and increased public funding for apprenticeship programs and digital learning platforms. ""No single entity can solve the skills crisis alone,"" he emphasised.

'Behind-the-scenes dogfight' that is complicating troubled relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/behind-the-scenes-dogfight-that-is-complicating-troubled-relationship-between-microsoft-and-openai/articleshow/122051860.cms,"Differentiating AI assistants from OpenAI and Microsoft – a core challenge



An intense rivalry is reportedly brewing between AI powerhouse OpenAI and its largest investor, Microsoft. OpenAI’s burgeoning success in the enterprise market is reportedly causing “indigestion” for Microsoft , whose sales teams are finding themselves flat-footed while under pressure to expand the adoption of their own AI assistant, Copilot . According to a report by Bloomberg , this ‘behind-the-scenes dogfight’ is further complicating an already delicate relationship between the two tech giants.Despite investing nearly $14 billion in OpenAI, Microsoft has simultaneously diversified its AI portfolio by backing rival startups and developing its own AI models. Furthermore, Microsoft is reportedly hesitant to greenlight OpenAI's internal restructuring plan.OpenAI has been actively forging deals with competing cloud computing partners and has spent the past two years building a comprehensive suite of paid subscription products for businesses, educational institutions, and individuals.The report says that both companies are essentially pitching similar products: AI assistants designed to handle demanding tasks such as research, writing and data analysis, thereby potentially freeing up office workers to focus on more complex challenges.It is to be noted that both ChatGPT and Microsoft's Copilot are largely built upon the same underlying OpenAI models, but the report says that Microsoft's salesforce has struggled to differentiate Copilot from the much more widely recognised ChatGPT.Jared Spataro, Microsoft's chief of workplace AI initiatives, addressed ChatGPT's traction by stating that “awareness in the consumer space doesn’t necessarily translate into fit for use in the commercial space.”He emphasised that Microsoft's “sweet spot” lies in taking the best available technology and fine-tuning it specifically for business use. An OpenAI spokesperson countered that their company is benefiting from customers' desire for direct access to the latest expertise and technology, the report highlighted.Another reason is early-moving advantage. The rapid consumer adoption of ChatGPT meant that by the time Microsoft began rolling out Copilot to businesses, many office workers had already experimented with ChatGPT at home, giving OpenAI's chatbot a critical first-mover advantage.Adding to the complexity, updates from OpenAI often take weeks to appear in Microsoft's software, partly due to bureaucratic delays. Spataro, however, clarified that Microsoft conducts its own rigorous testing on each OpenAI release to ensure improved user experience and adherence to security standards.","OpenAI has been actively forging deals with competing cloud computing partners.

Largest ever job cuts at Microsoft continue



Microsoft is reportedly going to layoff employees within its Xbox division next week. According to a report by Bloomberg, these job cuts are a part of a broader company-wide reorganisation. This move marks the fourth major layoff for Xbox in the past 18 months, following three significant reductions last year and the closure of several subsidiary studios.Citing individuals familiar with the plans who requested anonymity, the report noted that managers within the Xbox group are anticipating considerable cuts across the entire division.The Xbox division, responsible for both video-game hardware and software, has been under increasing pressure from Microsoft executives to boost profit margins, the report noted. This heightened scrutiny comes particularly after the company's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard , a deal that was finalised in 2023.This news follows earlier reports from Bloomberg that Microsoft intends to cut thousands of jobs next week, with a primary focus on its sales departments. The tech giant frequently implements significant organisational changes as its fiscal year draws to a close on June 30.Recently, Microsoft cut more than 300 additional jobs, deepening its ongoing workforce reductions just weeks after executing its largest round of layoffs in years. The new layoffs followed the elimination of 6,000 roles last month, bringing the total number of job cuts to more than 6,300 in recent weeks. This represents Microsoft's second-largest workforce reduction since 2023, when the company laid off 10,000 employees.While Microsoft has not specified which departments or roles were affected in this round, similar layoffs in the past have impacted software engineers and project managers.At an internal town hall following the previous round of cuts, CEO Satya Nadella described the layoffs as a “realignment” rather than performance-based decisions.“This was not about people failing. It was about repositioning for what comes next,” Nadella said.","Microsoft is reportedly going to layoff employees within its Xbox division next week.

Why Godfather of AI Geoffrey Hinton thinks being a plumber is the ‘best job’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-godfather-of-ai-geoffrey-hinton-thinks-being-a-plumber-is-the-best-job/articleshow/122050848.cms,"Godfather of AI Geoffrey Hinton



Geoffrey Hinton questions the idea of AI creating new jobs

Amazon’s Andy Jassy and others warns against AI

Realme GT 7: 7000mAh Battery, 120W Charging & Flagship Power Under Rs 40K!

Nobel Laureate Geoffrey Hinton , popularly known as the Godfather of AI has warned that AI will soon replace many workers, especially in roles involving routine tasks. Speaking on the Diary of a CEO podcast, Hilton said ““I think for mundane intellectual labour, AI will replace everyone.” He pointed to jobs like call centre workers and paralegal as those most at risk. As for what careers might be future-proof, Hinton had a simple suggestion: “Train to be a plumber.”“I’d say it’s going to be a long time before [AI is] as good at physical manipulation as us—and so a good bet would be to be a plumber,” he said.Hilton, who left Google in 2023 to openly discuss AI’s dangers, said the impact on job is already being felt. “I think the joblessness is a fairly urgent short-term threat to human happiness. If you make lots and lots of people unemployed — even if they get universal basic income — they are not going to be happy,” he told host Steven Bartlett.During the podcast, he also questioned the idea that new roles created due to AI will balance out the jobs lost. “This is a very different kind of technology,” he said. “If it can do all mundane intellectual labour, then what new jobs is it going to create? You would have to be very skilled to have a job that it couldn’t just do.”Amidst the emerging threats of AI, companies are preparing for changes. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently told the staff that as AI roles are adopted, the e-commerce giant plans to reduce corporate headcount. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy wrote in a memo, calling AI “a once-in-a-lifetime technology.”Dario Amodei, CEO of AI firm Anthropic, also echoed the AI warning, saying that up to half of entry-level white-collar jobs could vanish within five years, pushing unemployment to around 20%. He advised both workers and governments to prepare for a fast shift from AI supporting jobs to fully automating them.","Geoffrey Hinton, the Godfather of AI, has warned that AI will soon replace many workers, especially in roles involving routine tasks.

Hinge founder and CEO Justin McLeod hasn't used his own dating app as a user in over a decade, but his last experience on the platform led to one of the most dramatic love stories in Silicon Valley history.McLeod revealed during a recent interview on The Verge's Decoder podcast that he last used Hinge more than ten years ago, before the app became one of America's biggest dating platforms. What happened next reads like a Netflix romantic comedy, which it literally became, inspiring an episode of the streaming service's ""Modern Love"" series.The story begins with heartbreak. McLeod tried to win back his college girlfriend after Harvard Business School, but she rejected him. That rejection sparked the creation of Hinge in 2011. ""I started Hinge in response to that,"" McLeod told The Verge's Nilay Patel.But the plot twist came years later. Someone McLeod met on his own app inspired him to make one final attempt at love. His college ex was living in Switzerland, about to marry someone else. With just one month before her wedding, McLeod flew overseas to make his case.""She called off her wedding and moved back to New York,"" McLeod said, describing the moment that would reshape both his personal life and his company's philosophy.The dramatic reunion led to Hinge's complete reboot in 2015, when McLeod fired half his staff and rebuilt the app around its now-famous tagline: ""designed to be deleted."" The couple has been together for the past decade, married with children.This personal transformation directly influenced Hinge's business model, which prioritizes getting users off the app and onto real dates, rather than maximizing screen time like other social platforms. McLeod's romantic journey became the foundation for a dating app philosophy that puts human connection over digital engagement.","Justin McLeod hasn't used his own dating app as a user in over a decade.

WhatsApp is 'security risk', so says a memo from the US House of Representatives that has reportedly banned the use of the messaging app on all government-managed devices used by the Congressional staff. Citing cybersecurity concerns , a memo from the office of chief administrative officer labeled WhatsApp as ‘high-risk’ app. The memo states, that the app lacks transparency and absence of stored data encryption. The memo also mentions that WhatsApp can be easily affected by potential vulnerabilities because of the way it handles user information.As reported by Reuters, the directive, issued by the House Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) states, “The Office of Cybersecurity has deemed WhatsApp a high risk to users due to the lack of transparency in how it protects user data, absence of stored data encryption, and potential security risks involved with its use.""The directive issued by the office of chief administrative officer directs all the staff members to uninstall WhatsApp from all House devices which include smartphone, desktop and web versions. On the other hand, the memo recommends the staff to use WhatsApp’s rival platforms such as Signal, Apple’s iMessage and FaceTime, Microsoft Teams and Amazon’s Wickr.WhatsApp’s parent company meta has disagrees with this move. The company spokesperson Andy Stone told Reuters that WhatsApp offers end-to-end encryption by default, so the company claims that the app offer better security as compared to its alternatives. “We know members and their staffs regularly use WhatsApp and we look forward to ensuring members of the House can join their Senate counterparts in doing so officially,” Andy Stone told Reuters.The ban on WhatsApp is followed by the January incident. Earlier this year, WhatsApp disclosed that Israeli spyware firm Paragon Solutions had affected dozens of users which also include journalists and civil society members.

CMA says probe suggests ways to make markets open



Google says proposals “broad and unfocused”



The UK’s competition watchdog has reportedly proposed significant measures to loosen Google 's grip on its search engine , marking the first application of the country's stringent new digital market rules . The Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) announced its intention to impose “fair ranking” requirements on Google's search results and grant publishers greater control over their content, including its use in artificial intelligence-generated outputs.The CMA stated it is “minded to hand Google 'strategic market status' (SMS),” a designation introduced under new digital market legislation this year. This label, reserved for companies with an outsized influence in specific digital markets, would compel the tech giant to adhere to a series of new conduct rules. A final decision is expected by October, following a public consultation period.“Google is the world’s leading search tool and plays an important role in all our lives, with the average person in the UK making five to 10 searches a day,"" said Sarah Cardell, the CMA’s chief executive.""Our investigation so far suggests there are ways to make these markets more open, competitive and innovative,” she added.Among other potential conduct rules, the CMA is considering requirements for Google's search result rankings and for its distribution partners, such as Apple, to offer “choice screens.” These screens would facilitate easier switching between search providers for consumers.Google is the first firm to be targeted under these robust new UK laws. The CMA's investigation, launched in January, aimed to assess whether Google's dominant position in search and search advertising was “delivering good outcomes” for consumers and businesses across the UK.In response, Google criticised the proposals as ""broad and unfocused,"" warning they could jeopardise the UK's access to its latest products and services. Oliver Bethell, Google’s senior director for competition, cautioned that “punitive regulations” might alter the pace at which Google launches new offerings in the UK.“Proportionate, evidence-based regulation will be essential to preventing the CMA’s road map from becoming a roadblock to growth in the UK,” Bethell added.Bethell's warning regarding the potential economic impact of these regulations aligns with the UK government 's mandate for the CMA to prioritise supporting growth and investment while minimising business uncertainty.","UK's competition watchdog proposes significant measures to loosen Google's grip on its search engine.

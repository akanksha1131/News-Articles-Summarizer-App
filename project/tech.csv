Late billionaire software businessman’s estate settles ‘largest tax fraud case in US history’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/late-billionaire-software-businessmans-estate-settles-largest-tax-fraud-case-in-us-history/articleshow/126175645.cms,"$2 Billion ‘Offshore Empire’ of Robert Brockman







The estate of Robert Brockman, the Texas software businessman accused of masterminding what the government had called the biggest US tax-fraud case ever filed involving an individual, has reached a conclusion this week. Brockman’s estate has agreed to pay $750 million in back taxes and penalties to settle a long-running civil suit with the IRS.Brockman was indicted in 2020 on criminal charges. The government accused him of using a “web of offshore entities” to conceal more than $2 billion in income between 2004 and 2018. According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, the founder of an automotive-software powerhouse maintained the secrecy of his financial empire by utilising encrypted servers and code names, where communications were disguised.The report further says that the wealth was tied to Brockman’s early investments in Vista Equity Partners. It is to be noted that Vista’s CEO, Robert Smith, previously settled his own related tax-evasion case. The civil pursuit of Brockman’s estate continued even after the billionaire’s death in 2022 at age 81.The estate will pay: $456 million in unpaid back taxes for the 14-year period and $294 million in civil penalties for the fraud.The filing does not explicitly state the final amount of interest the estate may still owe, which could potentially push the total higher.According to the report, despite his multi-billion-dollar net worth, Brockman was known for “penny-pinching” habits, such as staying at budget hotels and eating frozen dinners during business trips.Former associates described him as having a fierce “anti-government streak.” He reportedly viewed the IRS as a “corrupt organisation” that unfairly targeted taxpayers.",Brockman was indicted in 2020 on criminal charges.

Amazon mandated its employees to return five days per week to office at the start of 2025. Over the next few months, many more technology companies including Dell, IBM, Meta, Salesforce, Snap, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Disney, AT&T and others too joined in with the same or similar mandate for employees. And the year ends with Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri telling employees to be back in the office five days a week. according to a companywide memo sent by Mosseri, starting February 2, US employees will need to return to the office full-time.As Sander van ’t Noordende, the global CEO of Randstad, which places around half a million workers in jobs every week and can be termed as the biggest recruiter across the world, said in an interview to Fortune, that the great return-to-office war is effectively over -- and a new pecking order has emerged. While rank-and-file staff are called back to their desks, the CEO of the world’s biggest talent company says that only star performers will be able to hold on to fully remote roles. “You have to be very special to be able to demand a 100% remote job,” van ’t Noordende tells Fortune. “That’s increasingly the story. You have to have very special technology skills or some expertise.”“The whole phenomenon of freelance work has been coming up, of course, over the last decades… but that also requires also special skills -- good commercial skills or networking skills, which not everybody has.”What van ’t Noordende reportedly claims to be seeing on the ground is something similar to what Korn Ferry predicted at the start of this year: As companies increasingly upped the dial on in-office working, the consulting firm forecasted a “new hybrid hierarchy” where flexibility becomes a perk reserved only for star performers. “2025’s Haves and Have-Nots will be divided not by economics, but by talent and how much the company wants them,” the report outlined.Essentially at the top, workers with scarce skills can still negotiate for fully remote or ultra-flexible setups. But at the bottom, workers with the least leverage—often in more junior or commoditized roles—are more likely to be expected to show face.Covid-19 pandemic ushered in a new way of working remotely in 2020. However, almost all the companies that initially championed the model changed or are changing their tune in 2025. In recent months, employees across corporate world, from Inosys to TCS, Amazon to Dell have been told that their days of working remotely are over. Instead, select employees have been called back into offices five days a week, a reversal of conversations in 2020 that touted remote and hybrid options as the future of work.Some companies have been very strict. Amazon cloud boss Matt Garman reportedly told employees who don’t agree with the work from office rule that they can leave. Similarly, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and counterparts at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been strong advocates of working from the office, saying it fosters better learning, innovation and culture. More than half of JPMorgan's employees already come into the office full-time, according to the memo from the bank's operating committee. It has more than 316,000 staff worldwide.""Now is the right time to solidify our full-time in-office approach,"" the executives wrote. ""We think it is the best way to run the company.""","Amazon, IBM, Meta, Salesforce, Snap, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Disney, AT&T and others too joined in with the same or similar mandate for employees.

Tesla’s transition from automaker to and energy giant

Since Tesla’s founding, each iteration of our master plan has focused on our north star: to deliver unconstrained sustainability without compromise.

Humans are toolmakers. At Tesla, we make physical products at scale and at a low cost with the goal of making life better for everyone. As the influence and impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technology increases, the mission set forth in Master Plan Part IV should come as no surprise.

This next chapter in Tesla’s story will help create a world we've only just begun to imagine and will do so at a scale that we have yet to see. We are building the products and services that bring AI into the physical world.

We have been working tirelessly for nearly two decades to create the foundation for this technological renaissance through the development of electric vehicles, energy products and humanoid robots.

Now, we are combining our manufacturing capabilities with our autonomous prowess to deliver new products and services that will accelerate global prosperity and human thriving driven by economic growth shared by all. We are unifying our hardware and software at scale, and in doing so, we are creating a safer, cleaner and more enjoyable world.

This is sustainable abundance.





Elon Musk has announced a shift in Tesla’s core mission statement, saying that the electric vehicle and robotics giant is officially pivoting its guiding principle from “Sustainable Abundance” to “Amazing Abundance. ” The change comes just months after the “Sustainable Abundance” phrasing was adopted in September 2025 as part of the company's “Master Plan Part IV.”Musk took to X (formerly Twitter) to explain the rationale behind the change by saying that the new principle carries a more positive and celebratory energy.“Am changing the Tesla mission wording from: Sustainable Abundance To Amazing Abundance,” Musk stated, adding in a separate post that “The latter is more joyful.”According to “Master Plan Part VI”, Tesla is transitioning from being strictly an automotive company to a broader artificial intelligence and energy powerhouse.

Mustafa Suleyman says his role is to bring self-sufficiency over supremacy







It may not be unusual to say that one of the favourite words of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is 'Artificial General Intelligence' or AGI. Altman has mentioned this word in his almost every second interview/podcast, if not in every. OpenAI CEO has often spoken about reaching AGI or AGI timeline. Now it seems that there's a message for him from Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman. The Google DeepMind founder has spoken out against the framing of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) as a competitive trophy, saying that there is no race and its not like the winner will get any medal.“I think there’s no winning of AGI. I think this is a misframing that a lot of people have kind of imposed on the field. Like, I'm not sure there’s a race. I mean, we’re all going as fast as we possibly can, but a race implies that it’s zero-sum,” he said in a podcast recently.According to Suleyman, the term ‘AI race’ “implies that there's a finish line. It implies that there's medals for one, two and three, but not five six and seven. And it's just like, not quite the right metaphor as we know Technologies and Science and knowledge proliferates everywhere, all at run to all scales basically, simultaneously, or within a year or two,” he explained.“To end from scratch at the frontier of all scales on all capabilities, and we build an absolutely world-class super intelligence team inside of the company. I think there's really a winning of AGI. I think this is a misframing.Suleyman says he is pivoting Microsoft’s focus toward long-term institutional strength. His priority is not to beat a specific competitor to a specific date, but to ensure Microsoft is self-sufficient, and to be able to train models from scratch and build world-class superintelligence inside the company.","Mustafa Suleyman says he is pivoting Microsoft’s focus toward long-term institutional strength.

These risks, revealed in classified reports, include potential radar interference from turbines and the ""rapid evolution of adversary technologies."" The pause aims to assess and mitigate these vulnerabilities, prioritizing American security.

Interior Department's complete order on the ban

Trump CUTS OFF Future Of Chinese Drones In US, Angry Beijing Breathes Fire | ‘…Discrimination’





The US Department of the Interior recently announced that it is pausing the leases on all five offshore wind sites currently under construction in the country. The move reportedly comes despite the fact that these projects already have installed significant hardware in the water and on land; one of them is nearly complete. The order says that decisions is based on a classified report from the Department of Defense. In the order, the Interior department says that it is pausing the permits for all five Wind projects. It claims that offshore wind creates ""national security risks"" that were revealed in a recent analysis performed by the Department of Defense. What exactly are these risks? The Interior Department notes that offshore wind turbines can interfere with radar sensing. In announcing the decision, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum also said, ""the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies."" At the same time, the announcement adds that the Defense Department analysis is classified, which means that nobody is likely to know what the actual reason is.The Department of the Interior announced today that it is pausing—effective immediately—the leases for all large-scale offshore wind projects under construction in the United States due to national security risks identified by the Department of War in recently completed classified reports.This pause will give the Department, along with the Department of War and other relevant government agencies, time to work with leaseholders and state partners to assess the possibility of mitigating the national security risks posed by these projects.“The prime duty of the United States government is to protect the American people,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “Today’s action addresses emerging national security risks, including the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies, and the vulnerabilities created by large-scale offshore wind projects with proximity near our east coast population centers. The Trump administration will always prioritize the security of the American people. ”The following leases are paused:* Vineyard Wind 1 (OCS-A 0501)* Revolution Wind (OCS-A 0486)* CVOW – Commercial (OCS-A 0483)* Sunrise Wind (OCS-A 0487)* Empire Wind 1 (OCS-A 0512)As for the national security risks inherent to large-scale offshore wind projects, unclassified reports from the U.S. Government have long found that the movement of massive turbine blades and the highly reflective towers create radar interference called “clutter.” The clutter caused by offshore wind projects obscures legitimate moving targets and generates false targets in the vicinity of the wind projects.The Department of Energy in a 2024 report stated that a radar’s threshold for false alarm detection can be increased to reduce some clutter, but an increased detection threshold could cause the radar to “miss actual targets.”Today’s action ensures that national security risks posed by offshore wind projects are appropriately addressed and that the United States government retains its ability to effectively defend the American people.","The US Department of the Interior recently announced that it is pausing the leases on all five offshore wind sites currently under construction in the country.

"Google will let you change your Gmail address, here's how",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-will-let-you-change-your-gmail-address-heres-how/articleshow/126175008.cms,"Google is finally allowing users to change their @gmail.com email addresses, a long-standing restriction. This new feature, currently rolling out and detailed on a Hindi support page, will let users switch to a new @gmail.com address. Your old address will become an alias, still receiving emails and usable for sign-ins. Users can change their Gmail address up to three times.





For years, Google has permitted users to change their account email address if they're using a third-party email service, but those with an ""@gmail.com"" address have been stuck with what they chose. As Google currently states:If your account's email address ends in @gmail.com, you usually can't change it. That restriction appears to be ending.The same support page currently explaining you can't change Gmail addresses is now detailing a new process that's ""gradually rolling out."" The updated page oddly only appears in Hindi right now, so English-language users can't see the changes yet. All quotes below are translated. The page was originally discovered in the ""Google Pixel Hub"" group on Telegram.According to Google: ""The email address associated with your Google Account is the address you use to sign in to Google services. This email address helps you and others identify your account. If you'd like, you can change your Google Account email address that ends in gmail.com to a new email address that ends in gmail.com.This represents new functionality Google hasn't announced elsewhere, though the company says it's ""gradually rolling out to all users.""The change will let users switch their ""@gmail.com"" email address to a different ""@gmail.com"" address with a new username. Your original address will continue receiving emails in the same inbox as your new one and still work for signing in, with no changes to your account access. Users won't be able to change or delete their email within 12 months of making a change.When you change your Google Account email address from an email address ending in gmail.com to a new email address ending in gmail.com:The old email address in your Google Account that ends with gmail.com will be set as an alias. Learn more about alias email addresses.You will receive emails at both your old and new email addresses.Data saved in your account, including photos, messages, and emails sent to your old email address, will not be affected.You can reuse your old Google Account email address at any time. However, you can't create a new Google Account email address that ends with gmail.com for the next 12 months. You can't delete your new email address either.You can sign in to Google services like Gmail, Maps, YouTube, Google Play, or Drive with your old or new email address.Each account can change its ""@gmail.com"" address up to 3 times, for a total of 4 addresses.Google notes your old Gmail address will still show up in some places and ""won't be immediately reflected in older instances"" like Calendar events created before the change. You'll also retain the ability to send emails from the old address. The old address stays yours and can't be claimed by another user.While the page thoroughly explains the process, the functionality isn't live yet. The Hindi-language support page likely appeared earlier than intended, but it suggests we'll hear an official announcement about this change soon.Once available, users will be able to change their Gmail address through ""My Account.""","Google is finally allowing users to change their @gmail.com email addresses.

Why Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis thinks the AI startup valuation model is breaking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-google-deepmind-ceo-demis-hassabis-thinks-the-ai-startup-valuation-model-is-breaking/articleshow/126055448.cms,"Big tech vs early-stage hype

'Trump Needs Indian Skilled Workers': Expert On Big Tech's AI Bet On India

Demis Hassabis makes his stand clear on AI scaling





Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Speaking on Google DeepMind: The Podcast, Hassabis said many early-stage companies are now raising tens of billions dollars before even launching product. He believes that this trend exposes cracks in the valuation model. “Some startups basically haven’t even got going yet,” Hassabis said. “It’s sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. My guess is probably not, at least not in general.” This increase in speculative funding has drawn comparisons to past bubbles, such as the dot-com boom and the crypto frenzy, where companies raised massive sums on hype rather than proven business models.Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google, which he said are backed by “a lot of real business.” While Big Tech’s AI bets are supported by revenue streams and infrastructure, many startups are relying solely on investor enthusiasm.He added that AI is “overhyped in the short term” but “underappreciated in the medium to long-term,” suggesting that while the technology’s potential is profound, the current funding frenzy may not reflect sustainable growth.Reflecting on DeepMind’s own early days, Hassabis noted how technological shifts often swing from skepticism to obsession, inflating valuations quickly. “It’s almost an overreaction to the underreaction,” he said, pointing out that investor sentiment can flip dramatically once a technology gains traction.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO also made his stand clear on the debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Fear-driven leadership powers AI chip giant's success

Seven-day workweeks extend beyond executive suite





Despite leading the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang operates in constant fear of failure. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business."" The co-founder, who has led the chipmaker since 1993, said this feeling of vulnerability ""doesn't leave you"" despite the company's recent milestone of becoming the first public firm to reach a $5 trillion valuation in October.Huang's unconventional leadership approach stems from near-death experiences in the 1990s when Nvidia faced bankruptcy multiple times. He recalled flying to Japan to inform Sega that a contracted graphics chip was flawed and the deal should be canceled, while simultaneously admitting Nvidia needed the final $5 million payment to survive. Sega converted the funds into an investment, providing the lifeline that kept the company afloat.""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,"" Huang explained. The CEO maintains his intense work schedule by waking at 4 a.m.daily to read emails for hours, processing several thousand messages each day. This routine continues through holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas.Huang's relentless work ethic has influenced his family, with both adult children Madison and Spencer working at Nvidia seven days a week. The siblings, who are in their 30s, initially pursued different careers before joining the company as interns in 2020 and 2022.Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter, driven by surging demand for AI chips that power technology from Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta.

Italy's antitrust authority (AGCM) has reportedly ordered Facebook-parent Meta to suspend certain contract terms linked to WhatsApp . According to a report by news agency Reuters, the move comes as the antitrust agency investigates the company for a possible abuse of market power. The Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) said the terms could block rival AI chatbots from operating on WhatsApp, potentially limiting competition in the AI chatbot market. The regulator said Meta’s actions could restrict market access, reduce innovation, and harm consumers.The investigation began in July, when AGCM opened a probe into Meta over WhatsApp’s market position. In November, the regulator expanded the investigation to include updated contract terms related to WhatsApp’s business platform. According to AGCM, these conditions could fully exclude competitors to Meta’s own AI chatbot services from accessing WhatsApp.As per the report, a spokesperson for Meta called the decision ""fundamentally flawed,"" and said the emergence of AI chatbots ""put a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support"".""We will appeal,"" the spokesperson added.European Union antitrust regulators launched a separate investigation last month into similar concerns involving Meta.The Italian watchdog said it is working closely with the European Commission to address the issue effectively.The move is part of a broader push by European regulators to tighten oversight of large technology companies.

What the update/clarification from Microsoft engineer says

When NSA told software companies to use Rust language





No, Microsoft is not rewriting Windows in Rust. The clarification comes after a LinkedIn post by a Microsoft Distinguished Engineer Galen Hunt went viral and led to an outrage in several circles. This made the company as well as the Microsoft engineer to issue a clarification. The original post from Hunt was a job posting which led to the speculation that Microsoft plans to eliminate all C and C++ code across its major codebases by 2030, replacing it with Rust using AI-assisted, large-scale refactoring.I have an open position in my team for a IC5 Principal Software Engineer. The position is in-person in Redmond. My goal is to eliminate every line of C and C++ from Microsoft by 2030. Our strategy is to combine AI *and* Algorithms to rewrite Microsoft’s largest codebases. Our North Star is “1 engineer, 1 month, 1 million lines of code”. To accomplish this previously unimaginable task, we’ve built a powerful code processing infrastructure. Our algorithmic infrastructure creates a scalable graph over source code at scale. Our AI processing infrastructure then enables us to apply AI agents, guided by algorithms, to make code modifications at scale.The core of this infrastructure is already operating at scale on problems such as code understanding.The purpose of this Principal Software Engineer role is to help us evolve and augment our infrastructure to enable translating Microsoft’s largest C and C++ systems to Rust. A critical requirement for this role is experience building production quality systems-level code in Rust—preferably at least 3 years of experience writing systems-level code in Rust. Compiler, database, or OS implementation experience is highly desired. While compiler implementation experience is not required to apply, the willingness to acquire that experience in our team is required.Our team is driven by a growth mindset. We are diverse team with a wide range of skills and perspectives. We take on bold risks. We work and play well with others. We love to bring value to internal and external customers. We have learned that our diversity and growth mindset is critical to success in the rapidly changing word of AI-based tools.Our team is part of the Future of Scalable Software Engineering group in the EngHorizons organization in Microsoft CoreAI. Our mission is to build capabilities to allow Microsoft and our customers to eliminate technical debt at scale. We pioneer new tools and techniques with internal customers and partners, and then work with other product groups to deploy those capabilities at scale across Microsoft and across the industry.After all the outrage that Hunt's post led to, he issued a clarification with the title 'Update'. The Update said: It appears my post generated far more attention than I intended... with a lot of speculative reading between the lines.Just to clarify... Windows is *NOT* being rewritten in Rust with AI. My team’s project is a research project. We are building tech to make migration from language to language possible. The intent of my post was to find like-minded engineers to join us on the next stage of this multi-year endeavor—not to set a new strategy for Windows 11+ or to imply that Rust is an endpoint.How Microsoft may not be alone in ditching C and C++As a report in InfoWorld says that the pressure to dump C and C++ languages in favor of memory-safe languages such as Rust comes right from the top, with research by Google and Microsoft showing that around 70 percent of all security vulnerabilities in software are caused by memory safety issues.Incidentally, in November 2023 America's National Security Agency (NSA) joined Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and international partners in releasing ”The Case for Memory Safe Roadmaps” Cybersecurity Information Sheet (CSI). Expanding on the “Software Memory Safety” CSI published by NSA in April 2023, the report gave guidance for software manufacturers and technology providers to create roadmaps tailored to eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities from their products. In one of its suggestions, the report asked software manufacturers to create roadmaps for the utilization of, and transition to, memory safe programming languages. ""This transition will enable memory safe programming languages to mitigate memory-related vulnerabilities and reduce the products' attack surface. Recommended memory safe programming languages mentioned in the CSI include C#, Go, Java, Python, Rust, and Swift. Software manufacturers should evaluate multiple memory safe programming languages before integrating them into their workflows,"" said the report.","Microsoft engineer Galen Hunt issued a clarification on his LinkedIn post.

Elon Musk’s Tesla is once again under the lens, this time over ‘hidden’ emergency door releases. Federal auto safety regulators have reportedly launched a new investigation into the EV maker, shifting the spotlight from its self-driving software (FSD) to the physical design of its doors. The latest probe centres on allegations that the emergency manual door releases in certain Tesla models are “hidden”, making them nearly impossible to find during emergency situations.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced it is evaluating a petition to declare the door systems defective in an estimated 179,071 Model 3 sedans from the 2022 model year, according to a report by Fortune.The investigation is said to be triggered by a petition from Kevin Clouse, a Georgia-based Tesla owner who survived an incident in 2023. According to the filing, Clouse was trapped inside his Model 3 as the interior began to burn.“I was unaware of the location of the hidden mechanical emergency door release because it is not visibly labeled... and not intuitive in an emergency,” Clouse stated in his complaint. He claimed that he had to climb into the back seat and break the glass using his legs to escape the flames.Key findings from recent investigations include at least 15 deaths over last 10 years involving incidents where people were unable to Tesla doors following a crash and fire, as per A Bloomberg analysis. NHTSA is said to be investigating a similar issues in Model Y SUVs following reports that children were trapped when batteries died.The NHTSA is already investigating Tesla’s semi-autonomous driving software tackles railroad crossings. There were incidents where the agency said Tesla vehicles have violated traffic safety laws. NHTSA launched the investigation in ot the software after reports of vehicles driving through red lights or on the wrong side of the road.","Federal auto safety regulators have reportedly launched a new investigation into the EV maker, shifting the spotlight from its self-driving software to the physical design of its doors.

For example, a Sephora-sponsored beauty product ad may appear when a user searches for mascara recommendations. The report quotes a person familiar with the discussions who said that OpenAI employees have been creating mockups for different ways that ads could appear inside ChatGPT in recent weeks.OpenAI has crossed 900 million weekly active users and is expected to hit 2.6 billion weekly active users by 2030. “That would dwarf all but the biggest social media and search companies and compete in a more than $1 trillion digital ad market dominated by Google, Meta and Amazon,” the report said.While OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman have not publicly announced advertising plans, the company has been hiring executives with experience in digital advertising and expanding shopping-related features within ChatGPT.OpenAI collects a lot of information about users’ interests from detailed chats, and has considered whether ChatGPT could show ads based on that history, The Information has previously reported.According to analysts and ad industry executives, ChatGPT conversations could be an ‘advertising goldmine’.The report quotes an OpenAI spokesperson, who said “As ChatGPT becomes more capable and widely used, we’re looking at ways to continue offering more intelligence to everyone. As part of this, we’re exploring what ads in our product could look like. People have a trusted relationship with ChatGPT, and any approach would be designed to respect that trust”.The report comes days after Nick Turley, Vice President at OpenAI and head of ChatGPT denied testing any ads on the AI chatbot after users reported seeing ads in ChatGPT ”.

, Indian IT's biggest trade body, has said that the proposed shift in the H-1B visa selection process from a lottery system to one weighted by salary levels will harm innovation and weaken competitiveness by disadvantaging small businesses, research institutions and early-career international graduates. In a statement on the proposed rule, Nasscom highlighted that maintaining a strong pipeline of Indian talent is vital for US leadership in artificial intelligence (AI). It also noted that Indians constitute about 71% of H-1B holders and attracting more such will reinforce the Indo-US partnership.

Read Nasscom’s full statement on proposed changes in H1-B visa process

Nasscom statement on the proposed Rule: Weighted Selection Process for Registrants and Petitioners Seeking to File Cap-Subject H-1B Petitions

The recent changes with regards to the wage-weighted selection mechanism for H-1B visas proposed by the Department of Homeland Security represents a significant departure from the long-standing, neutral lottery system and raises important legal, economic, and operational concerns. While the intent behind the proposed changes, to promote high-skill employment, curb misuse, and protect U.S. wages, is well understood, a transparent, trusted visa framework is essential to maintaining the strength of the U.S. technology ecosystem.

By assigning multiple selection entries based on Occupational and Employment Wage Statistics levels, the framework risks moving beyond the statutory focus on ""specialty occupation"" and toward wage ranking, potentially introducing regional and occupational distortions. Wage levels vary significantly by geography and role, and a weighted model could inadvertently disadvantage small and mid-sized enterprises, startups, research institutions, and university-linked employers that operate with moderate but market-appropriate wage structures.

While H-1B professionals constitute a small share of the overall U.S. workforce supported by Nasscom member companies, they play a major role in driving innovation, productivity, and job creation across the digital economy.

H-1B petitions at Level I and Level II wage bands frequently represent entry-level roles for graduates of U.S. universities in science, engineering, and computing disciplines. These positions form a vital part of the

STEM talent pipeline

, enabling early-career professionals to gain industry experience and progress into mid- and senior-level innovation roles over time. Under a wage-weighted system, restricting opportunities at the entry level could weaken the future talent base and discourage international students from pursuing advanced education in the United States. This would work against the country's goals of strengthening competitiveness, driving innovation, and supporting higher education.

Further, a sudden shift to a wage-weighted model would introduce uncertainty, increase compliance complexity, and disrupt long-established workforce planning, particularly for smaller and mid-sized firms that align recruitment with academic calendars, client delivery schedules, and product release cycles.

Nasscom member companies collectively support more than 1.6 million skilled jobs across the United States, contributing $198 billion to the U.S. GDP—an impact larger than that of over 20 state economies. With over 264,500 employees directly in the U.S. and a presence in more than 25 major American communities, Nasscom companies help strengthen both established and emerging technology hubs. Notably, more than two-thirds of these jobs are located outside Silicon Valley and New York, fostering inclusive growth in regions such as Texas, North Carolina, Ohio, and Illinois.

Any structural reform must preserve predictability, equity, and alignment with statutory intent. Should a wage-weighted approach be pursued, a phased implementation with sufficient lead time would be essential. Delaying implementation until the FY 2028 lottery cycle would provide employers the necessary runway to adapt processes, ensure compliance, and maintain confidence in the stability of the U.S. talent and investment environment.

The joint US congressional letter issued on 30th October 2025 addressed to the President also highlights that Indian nationals, who make up the largest share of H-1B recipients, are central to U.S. leadership in information technology and artificial intelligence. America must continue attracting the world's best talent to maintain our innovation ecosystem, strengthen the defence industrial base, and preserve our long-term competitive edge.

In the case of India, the country of origin for 71 percent of H-1B holders last year, attracting this talent also reinforces our strategic partnership with a key democratic partner in the Indo-Pacific.

A balanced, consultative approach will be critical to ensuring that reforms strengthen rather than inadvertently weaken the innovation advantage and global competitiveness of the United States.

The H-1B program is not simply about addressing labour needs; it is about securing U.S. leadership in the industries that will define global power in the 21st century.

Google & Character.AI (2024): $2.5 billion licensing deal, but only hired the cofounders and 20% of staff.

Amazon & Adept / Microsoft & Inflection (2024): Similar talent-focused deals.

Meta & Scale AI (2025): $14 billion investment for a 49% stake, bringing CEO Alexandr Wang to lead Meta Superintelligence Labs.

OpenAI & Windsurf (failed deal): A $3 billion near-acquisition collapsed, leaving hundreds of employees in limbo while Google and Cognition absorbed top engineers.





Nvidia has now entered into a non-exclusive licensing deal with AI hardware startup Groq. As part pf the agreement the chipset major is also bringing its founder and several other top executives in a move which underscores Nvidia’s aggressive expansion in the AI era.

Also, Ross and Groq engineer Douglas Wightman has earlier worked at Google, where he helped the company in developing its first Tensor Processing Unit (TPUs). It is important to note that TPUs were specialised chips that rival Nvidia’s GPUs in acceearung large-scale machine learning tasks.Nvidia, now the world’s most valuable company with a market cap above $4.5 trillion, has been aggressively expanding its AI footprint.

AWS has denied causing a recent major outage. This follows a massive server failure that disrupted multiple games and other online services on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. While thousands of players across the United States and India reported that popular online services, such as Steam, Fortnite, and Arc Raiders, were inaccessible, the world's largest cloud service provider denied any disruption to its infrastructure. This clarification came as a response to monitoring platforms' indication that a central AWS failure was responsible for the technical glitches.The official AWS Newsroom account shared a post on the microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) denying claims that Amazon’s cloud service was behind the recent outage. Replying to one such speculation, AWS wrote: “@KobeissiLetter No, that's false. AWS services are operating normally today, but an event elsewhere on the internet has prompted some inaccurate speculation on social media.

This left many users unable to connect to the digital game store.By shortly after midnight EST, complaints on Downdetector had dropped significantly, from nearly 10,000 to about 2,000, suggesting that services were gradually being restored.

TikTok deal with US investors





TikTok may have dodged a US ban but there still seem some unresolved issues about its algorithm. Recently, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew announced that the company had signed binding agreements to spin its US operations into a new joint venture with American investors set to close on January 22, taking a major step toward avoiding a US ban. However, things don't seem to be as simple for TikTok as yet.In 2024, the US Congress approved a nationwide ban on Tiktok, unless ByteDance sold its controlling stake by January 19, 2025. Since returning to White House, President Donald Trump has extended that deadline five times, most recently to January 23, 2026.The Chinese government has now sent a message to the US government on TikTok deal. According to a report in Reuters, Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson He Yongqian said when asked about the hand-over of TikTok's US operations that the Chinese government would like to see companies reach solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and balance the interests of all parties. ""It is hoped that the U.S. side will work with China in the same direction, earnestly fulfill its corresponding commitments, provide a fair, open, transparent and non-discriminatory business environment for the continuous and stable operation of Chinese enterprises in the US,"" Chinese ministry spokesperson told a press conference.Last week, TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, signed binding agreements to hand control of the short video app's US operations to a group of investors, including Oracle.Under the new arrangement, a consortium of American and allied investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based MGX, will hold half of the US entity. Affiliates of existing ByteDance investors will hold 30.1 per cent, while ByteDance will retain 19.9 per cent.In an internal memo, TikTok CEO Chew said that the deal effectively averted a looming nationwide ban and secured the platform’s future for its 170 million American users. The new entity, named TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, will come into effect on January 22. “The US joint venture will be responsible for US data protection, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurance,” Chew said. “It will also have the exclusive right and authority to provide assurances that content, software and data for American users is secure. ”","TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew announced that the company had signed binding agreements to spin its US operations into a new joint venture.

End Of H-1B Lottery: Donald Trump Overhauls US Work Visa System Prioritising High Pay And Skills





Further restricting H-1B visa rules, the Trump administration has ended the lottery system for selecting visa recipients. In a press release, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said that the department of homeland security (DHS) is replacing “the random lottery for selecting visa recipients with a process that gives greater weight to those with higher skills. ” The process, for those unaware, was used till date to randomly select applicants when demand for H-1B work visas exceeded the annual cap. It helped employers fill skilled worker shortages, especially in fields of technology, healthcare and engineering.Announcing the new rule, Matthew Tragesser, Spokesman, USCIS said: “As part of the Trump Administration’s commitment to H-1B reform, we will continue to demand more from both employers and aliens so as not to undercut American workers and to put America first.”The new rule is effective February 27, 2026, and will be in place for the FY 2027 H-1B cap registration season, USCIS said in its official release.Explaining why the administration has ended the H-1B visa lottery system, Tragesser said “The existing random selection process of H-1B registrations was exploited and abused by U.S. employers who were primarily seeking to import foreign workers at lower wages than they would pay American workers.”“The new weighted selection will better serve Congress’ intent for the H-1B program and strengthen America’s competitiveness by incentivizing American employers to petition for higher-paid, higher-skilled foreign workers. With these regulatory changes and others in the future, we will continue to update the H-1B program to help American businesses without allowing the abuse that was harming American workers,” he said.As per the US immigration authority, the current random selection process has often been “criticized for allowing unscrupulous employers to exploit it by flooding the selection pool with lower-skilled foreign workers paid at low wages, to the detriment of the American workforce.”“To address these concerns, the final rule will implement a weighted selection process that will increase the probability that H-1B visas are allocated to higher-skilled and higher-paid aliens while maintaining the opportunity for employers to secure H-1B workers at all wage levels,” the agency added.In its press release, the USCIS said that the number of H-1B visas issued annually is limited to 65,000, with an additional 20,000 for US advanced degree holders.The immigration agency said that the administration’s new rule is another crucial step to strengthen the integrity of the H-1B nonimmigrant visa program. “It is in line with other key changes the administration has made, such as the Presidential Proclamation that requires employers to pay an additional $100,000 per visa as a condition of eligibility,” it stated.To recall, the Trump administration announced an annual fee of $1,00,000 on H-1B visa applications, starting September 22, 2025.","H-1B visas limited to 65,000 annually, with an additional 20,000 for US advanced degree holders.

How Trump changed stance on Intel CEO

Donald Trump’s equity-for-funding deal reshapes Intel’s future





When Donald Trump publicly demanded Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s resignation over alleged China connections in August 2025, the chipmaker’s future hung in the balance. Less than two weeks later, Tan emerged from a pivotal Oval Office meeting with an $8.9 billion government investment that transformed Intel into a “too-strategic-to-fail” company. The dramatic turnaround came after Tan orchestrated a carefully planned meeting with Trump, joined only by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Reuters reported. The 40-minute meeting with President Donald Trump proved to be the most consequential of Tan’s decades-long career, according to sources familiar with the discussions.Before the meeting, Tan enlisted powerful allies including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to vouch for him, two people told Reuters. He strategized with advisors on addressing Trump’s concerns about his investments in China, preparing to present himself as an American patriot despite having made some 600 investments in Chinese companies.In a post on Truth Social in August, Trump wrote that Tan ""is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem."" Less than a week later, Trump's stance entirely changed.""I met with Mr. Lip-Bu Tan, of Intel, along with Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, and Secretary of the Treasury, Scott Bessent,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “The meeting was a very interesting one. His success and rise is an amazing story. Mr. Tan and my Cabinet members are going to spend time together, and bring suggestions to me during the next week. Thank you for your attention to this matter!,” wrote Trump post his meeting with Intel CEO.The breakthrough came when Trump proposed the US receive equity in exchange for CHIPS Act funding—an idea Lutnick had discussed for weeks with government staff, according to two sources. Tan struck a deal that gave Intel $5.7 billion while making the US government its largest shareholder with a 9.9% stake.“The Art of the Deal: Intel,” Lutnick captioned a video posted after the meeting, in which Tan pledged to “make Intel great again.”Within weeks, the government backing catalyzed a $5 billion investment from Nvidia, whose CEO Huang called Tan his “long-time friend.” Trump celebrated on social media with an AI-generated image showing the US stake’s value rising 50% after Nvidia’s partnership announcement.Questions remain about Intel CEO’s technical leadershipHowever, Reuters interviews with around 20 current and former Intel employees, government advisers, and industry contacts revealed concerns about whether Tan possesses the technical expertise to restore Intel’s chipmaking dominance, despite his dealmaking prowess.Intel’s shares have risen approximately 80% since Tan’s March appointment, outpacing both the S&P 500 and Nvidia during that period. Yet manufacturing challenges persist—Nvidia recently tested Intel’s advanced 18A production process but stopped moving forward, two sources said.The government investment has given Intel unprecedented access to potential customers seeking presidential favor, fundamentally reshaping US industrial policy.","Donald Trump publicly demanded Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s resignation over alleged China connections in August.

"Good news for Google, Apple as Judge blocks Texas app store age-verification law: What he said in ruling",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/good-news-for-google-apple-as-judge-blocks-texas-app-store-age-verification-law-what-he-said-in-ruling/articleshow/126163736.cms,"It’s Apple and Google vs Meta







A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against a Texas law that would have required app store operators like Apple and Google to verify the ages of all users. Marking a victory for tech giants, the ruling delivers a setback to lawmakers and parent groups seeking stricter controls on digital content for minors. The law has been in contention because both the hardware and OS giants have resisted becoming centralised age-verifiers.According to a report by The New York Times, Judge Robert Pitman of the US District Court for the Western District of Texas ruled that the App Store Accountability Act likely violates the First Amendment. The law made is mandatory for app stores to implement robots systems that will require users under 18 to obtain parental consent for app downloads and in-app purchases.In his decision, Judge Pitman compared the digital mandate to requiring a physical bookstore to verify a customer’s age at the front door and demanding parental consent before a minor could browse or buy a book.“It restricts access to a vast universe of speech by requiring Texans to prove their age before downloading a mobile app... and requires minors to obtain parental consent,” Pitman wrote.The Texas ruling has again highlighted the rift within the tech industry over who should be the “gatekeeper” for child safety. While Apple and Google have argued that collecting birth dates for all users would be a massive intrusion on privacy, suggesting that individual apps should handle age-gating instead, companies like Meta – which owns Facebook and Instagram, have backed a “one-stop shop” approach, wherein Apple and Google verify age once at the OS level.",A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against a Texas law that would have required app store operators like Apple and Google to verify the ages of all users.

How the cyberattack on France's national postal service La Poste

foreign interference very often comes from the same country,""





Pro-Russian hacking group Noname057(16) has claimed responsibility for a recent cyberattack. According to a report by Euronews, French prosecutors announced that this cybersecurity incident disrupted France's national postal service, La Poste, during the Christmas rush. France's intelligence agency, DGSI, has taken over the investigation following the group's claim, the report claimed, citing the Paris prosecutor's office. The incident occurs as European intelligence agencies report that investigations into Russian interference now require as much operational time as monitoring terrorist threats.The latest attack on the country’s postal service took place just days after France's government reported a separate cyberattack targeting the Interior Ministry, which handles national security matters. In that attack, a suspected hacker stole several dozen sensitive documents and accessed police records and information about people wanted by authorities, according to Interior Minister Laurent Nunez, who spoke with broadcaster Franceinfo.The latest cyberattack happened during the busiest time of year for La Poste, which has more than 200,000 workers.Earlier this week, La Poste's main computers stopped working after hackers flooded the systems with traffic.The problems continued for a couple of days after the attack was first reported.Postal workers could not see where packages were going, and customers could not make online payments through the company's bank, La Banque Postale.Apart from the latest cyberattack on France’s postal service, Noname057(16) has previously targeted websites in Ukraine, Poland, Sweden, and Germany, hitting media companies, government offices, and businesses.Police from 12 countries worked together in July to stop the group in an operation called Eastwood. They shut down more than 100 computer servers around the world, arrested two people in France and Spain, and issued seven warrants to arrest others, including six Russians. But the group resumed attacks within days and remains active.The group has hit French government websites before, including the Justice Ministry and several local government offices and cities.Last week, prosecutors said France's spy agency is investigating a planned cyberattack involving software that could have enabled someone to control computer systems on a large passenger ferry from afar. A crew member from Latvia is being held on charges of working for another country, though officials did not say which one.A French official strongly suggested Russia was involved, saying ""but France has not officially blamed any country yet.France and other European countries that support Ukraine say Russia is carrying out a campaign of attacks through sabotage, killings, computer hacking, and spreading false information to divide Western countries and weaken their support for Ukraine.Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Western officials have blamed Russia for dozens of sabotage attacks across Europe, including setting fire to warehouses, damaging railways, and destroying property.","Hacking group Noname057(16) has claimed responsibility for a recent cyberattack on France's national postal service, La Poste. France's intelligence agency, DGSI, has taken over the investigation following the group's claim.

Founder of one of America's biggest consumer electronics company iRobot that has filed for bankruptcy 'shares' what went wrong: Chinese …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/founder-of-one-of-americas-biggest-consumer-electronics-company-irobot-that-has-filed-for-bankruptcy-shares-what-went-wrong-chinese-/articleshow/126162786.cms,"“It’s certainly the advent of this new type of competitor, the Chinese fast follower who had access to the Chinese marketplace, which iRobot effectively did not. I also think that the marketplace was not a level playing field.”

How Chinese companies took the lead over iRobot in the robot vacuum market

“For a small period of time, iRobot was the leading manufacturer of vacuuming robots in China. Then it stopped, because China decided that this was a market of interest, and they were going to ensure that Chinese companies were advantaged to succeed there,”

An

""for various pragmatic and political reasons, gave a protected market to cut your teeth on for the competition,""

“It’s a cage match, and it certainly got hard, and it got increasingly competitive,”

“The tragedy of the blocking of the transaction is we did it to ourselves. And the net result, which I have argued, was done with eyes wide open, was putting the consumer robot industry in a box, gift wrapping it, and handing it to someone else,”





US-based iRobot, which was once considered one of America's biggest consumer electronics companies, filed for bankruptcy last week. Now, Colin Angle, the co-founder and former CEO of the Roomba robot vacuum maker, has revealed what went wrong for the company. Angle claimed that unfair competition from Chinese companies played a major role in iRobot’s recent bankruptcy filing but also emphasised challenges such as supply chain disruptions and rapid technological shifts that impacted its market position. He explained that the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as it struggled to keep up with rivals who had advantages over iRobot. Angle, who founded the company in 1990 with fellow MIT scientists, noted that these new competitors grew quickly by using their home market as a base.In a recent episode of the New York Times’ Hard Fork podcast, Angle said,Roomba vacuum robots became quite popular in American homes after their launch in 2002. By 2018, their advanced models could empty themselves and clean specific rooms using mapping.The company's sales peaked at nearly $1.6 billion in 2021.However, after filing for bankruptcy, iRobot is now being acquired by Picea Robotics, a Chinese company that manufactures and lends money to them. This shift underscores the ongoing challenges and opportunities in the industry, which should resonate with professionals tracking market dynamics.gle explained.Angle noted that China,including companies like Roborock, which put iRobot at a disadvantage in China's huge market. It's important to note that Roborock has now become the world's leading robot vacuum brand.In a bid to boost consumer spending following the pandemic slowdown, China offered incentives that would encourage its people to purchase local products. This included up to 20% discounts on electronics. These policies show the support that Chinese authorities offered to their tech companies.Meanwhile, Picea Robotics has become a major player in the robot vacuum industry, working with brands such as Shark and Anker, alongside iRobot.Angle added.While Chinese competition hurt iRobot's global sales, Angle believes Amazon 's failed bid to acquire the company made matters worse.In 2022, Amazon's attempted $1.7 billion acquisition of iRobot was a significant event in the industry. The regulatory bodies' blocking of this acquisition not only impacted iRobot but also indicated a change in the industry that investors and analysts need to be aware of.According to Angle, this failed purchase didn't just damage iRobot; it hurt consumers and the entire home robotics industry.Angle explained.",iRobot co-founder and former CEO Colin Angle has revealed what went wrong for the company.

Google makes $4.75 billion acquisition that may help solve what CEO Sundar Pichai said: I do worry about it a lot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-makes-4-75-billion-acquisition-that-may-help-solve-what-ceo-sundar-pichai-said-i-do-worry-about-it-a-lot/articleshow/126162757.cms,"Google's parent company, Alphabet, is buying Intersect Power for $4.75 billion to secure electricity for AI growth. CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted energy supply as AI's biggest threat. This deal allows Google to build power generation directly at data centers, bypassing strained utility grids and ensuring future competitiveness.

""We are supply constrained this year,"" Google CEO admits

Deal enables direct power generation at data center sites





Google parent Alphabet is acquiring data center and clean energy developer Intersect Power for $4.75 billion in cash plus assumed debt—a strategic move targeting what CEO Sundar Pichai recently identified as the single biggest threat to AI progress: electricity supply. The deal comes as Pichai has candidly acknowledged severe infrastructure constraints plaguing the tech industry's AI ambitions, warning that energy bottlenecks could determine which nations dominate the next era of economic growth.""When you look at any system, you want to find out where the constraint is, because that's what allocates whole systems,"" Pichai said in a recent All-In Podcast interview. ""You are rightfully identifying the most likely constraint for AI progress, and hence by definition GDP growth and all that stuff. So I do worry about it a lot.""Under the deal, Alphabet gains Intersect's engineering team, multiple gigawatts of energy and data center projects currently under development or construction, and crucially, the ability to build power generation alongside computing facilities rather than relying on increasingly strained local utility grids. Intersect will continue operating independently under founder and CEO Sheldon Kimber while partnering closely with Google's infrastructure teams.Google already owned a minority stake from an $800 million funding round it co-led with TPG Rise Climate last December.Pichai's recent comments reveal the acquisition's urgency. ""We are supply constrained this year in our cloud business,"" he stated, explaining that simultaneous data center expansion by tech giants has created tangible roadblocks. ""The way the constraints play out today is delays in projects because of permitting or not having access to electricians. All that is reality as all of us are dealing with.""The Google chief warned these challenges will intensify without solutions. ""If this trend line continues, the pace at which we are ramping up...these constraints will be much more visible,"" he said, adding that solving energy infrastructure is essential ""for us to be competitive with China.""The transaction specifically targets Intersect's co-location model, positioning data centers directly beside dedicated wind, solar, battery, and gas power generation—eliminating dependence on overwhelmed public utilities. Included is the companies' first joint facility under construction in Haskell County, Texas, part of Google's $40 billion investment in the region through 2027.Intersect's existing operational assets in Texas and California aren't included and will continue as an independent company backed by TPG Rise Climate, Climate Adaptive Infrastructure, and Greenbelt Capital Partners.""Modern infrastructure is the linchpin of American competitiveness in AI,"" said Kimber. ""We share Google's conviction that energy innovation and community investment are the pillars of what must come next.""Alphabet emphasized commitment to advancing emerging technologies including advanced geothermal, long-duration energy storage, and carbon capture, while deploying AI itself to accelerate new power plant grid connections.The deal, subject to regulatory approval and customary conditions, is expected to close in the first half of 2026.","Google's parent company, Alphabet, is buying Intersect Power for $4.75 billion.

American technology companies may have a 'Chinese battery problem' that they share with Pentagon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/american-technology-companies-may-have-a-chinese-battery-problem-that-they-share-with-pentagon/articleshow/126161571.cms,"“China is leading in almost every industrial component”

“they’re ahead, both technologically and in terms of scale,”

“The reality is very stark. There are foreign parts in 100% of our weapon systems and military platforms.”

How the US became so dependent on Chinese batteries

How the US is trying to solve this Chinese battery problem

“we don’t like electric vehicles, but we do need batteries for drones and data centres and AI. They’re recognising that China’s stranglehold on the battery supply chain is undermining our national security.”





American technology companies and the Department of War are reportedly struggling with a similar Chinese ‘problem’. It's the growing reliance on China for large-scale lithium-ion batteries needed to power both artificial intelligence (AI) development and modern weaponry.As tech majors build massive data centres to compete in the global AI race, experts have warned that they face a significant strategic disadvantage due to their dependency on Chinese batteries. Dan Wang, an expert at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, told the New York Times thatof the battery sector andhighlighting the strategic importance of battery independence for national security.Similarly, military officials at the Pentagon are sounding the same battery warnings, but for different reasons. Military strategists, after observing how modern warfare in Ukraine is being shaped by battery-dependent technology, have claimed that armed forces will need millions of batteries to power drones, lasers and several other weapons in the coming days, many of which come from China, the NYT report noted.According to defence analytics company Govini, US military forces depend on Chinese supply chains for approximately 6,000 different battery components used in weapons programmes, the report added.In a recent gathering of top defence and industry officials in California, Govini CEO Tara Murphy Dougherty said:China's control over battery production has long posed challenges for sectors such as automotive manufacturing. However, the report claims that the US is increasingly recognising this gap as a threat to national security.China recognises the strategic value of these batteries. In October, amid escalating trade tensions with the US, China hinted at restricting exports of certain advanced lithium-ion technologies, including key components such as graphite anodes and cathodes.The current US government also faces a dilemma in this area. Upon taking office, President Donald Trump's administration initially paused billions of dollars in federal grants allocated during the Biden era for battery manufacturing.This decision grouped batteries with electric vehicles , solar farms, wind turbines, and other clean energy technologies that the administration sought to place less emphasis on. Donald Trump has also criticised electric cars, calling them aHowever, the Trump administration has recently recognised that battery technology is essential to priorities such as AI and defence. In interviews, over a dozen people from the battery industry, lobbying firms, military sectors, and those with connections to the administration said the White House has shown increasing interest in building a domestic battery industry separate from China.In recent weeks, the White House has held crucial meetings on the battery supply chain, the report claimed, citing three people familiar with the discussions. The National Energy Dominance Council, which President Trump created to manage energy policy, has been meeting with battery companies.The report noted that the Energy Department has quietly approved many of the Biden administration's battery manufacturer grants. The department also recently announced up to $500 million for battery materials and recycling projects, demonstrating active steps to bolster domestic capacity and reduce reliance on Chinese supply chains.The US government has begun investing in companies that make battery components or extract critical minerals, including Eos, which is developing new battery technology. As part of a trade agreement, officials encouraged Japan to commit billions of dollars to battery manufacturing in the United States.Additionally, the ‘National Defense Authorization Act,’ which passed this month, includes Pentagon restrictions on buying batteries from 'foreign entities of concern,' mainly China, emphasising the legislative push to secure supply chains and address strategic vulnerabilities.In a statement to the NYT, Samm Gillard, executive director and co-founder of the Battery Advocacy for Technology Transformation Coalition, a trade group, said that the administration is saying","Tech companies and the Department of War are reportedly struggling with a similar Chinese 'problem' It's the growing reliance on China for large-scale lithium-ion batteries needed to power both artificial intelligence (AI) development and modern weaponry.

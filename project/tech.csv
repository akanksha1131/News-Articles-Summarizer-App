Anam Mirza quits UPI for financial control



Mixed reactions on social media



Anam Mirza, Sania Mirza 's sister, recently posted her strategy for money discipline by deleting all the UPI-based digital payment applications from her phone. It was announced through a video that was uploaded to her Instagram series called, in which she described the real changes she implemented to manage expenses and create savings.In the video, Anam declared,Her choice, she said, was to make spending less convenient and more thoughtful.Though the step made day-to-day life a little difficult at first, such as having to request friends to pay for minute things like coffee, Anam got used to it eventually. Her post went viral within no time, garnering attention not only from followers but from a greater portion of social media users talking about digital payment behaviour.As per her description in the video, Anam Mirza's first step was to remove all digital payment apps like Google Pay, literally shutting off her means of making immediate transactions. That way, she expected to avoid impulse purchases, which, in her opinion, were being facilitated by the convenience of UPI-based systems.Anam's declaration soon turned into a subject of discussion on Instagram and other platforms. A few people were amazed by the strategy and complimented her on posting a trick that they believed could be helpful to other users as well. Comments such as, “Makes a big difference, been doing this since 6 months and oh boy we don’t overspend now,” and “Absolutely correct to keep control on expenses,” were left behind by the fans who repeated the success of her choice.One user posted, “This is definitely make very very big impact for sure,” while another said, “Little things really matter. I started doing this too. It works.”But not everyone responded positively. Many users questioned whether it was even possible to avoid UPI totally, particularly in a nation where digital payments are such an integral part of everyday life. One user commented, “Suits you because you're already rich. Only middle-class people like us could relate, how convenient it is to have UPI. People should definitely think before doing unnecessary expenses but deleting UPI a/c for that is too much.”Another user wrote, “Kaha jaoge itna paisa bachake udao dusro ko bhi kamane ka mauka do,” which implies that excessive savings may truncate economic circulation and avenues for others.","Anam Mirza, Sania Mirza's sister, recently posted her strategy for money discipline by deleting all the UPI-based digital payment applications from her phone.

What King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said about the death caused by cyberattack



“The patient safety incident investigation identified a number of contributing factors that led to the patient's death. This included a long wait for a blood test result due to the cyber-attack impacting pathology services at the time. We have met with the patient's family, and shared the findings of the safety investigation with them.”

“We are deeply saddened to hear that last year's criminal cyber attack has been identified as one of the contributing factors that led to this patient's death. Our hearts go out to the family involved.”

The UK has recorded its first-ever death linked to a cyberattack on a hospital. This development follows a ransomware incident that affected NHS blood services at London hospitals and GP surgeries in June 2024. According to a report by BBC, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust has confirmed that one patient ""died unexpectedly"" during the cyberattack on June 3, 2024. The attack disrupted over 10,000 appointments at the time. A spokesperson for the trust indicated that ""a long wait for a blood test result"" was among several contributing factors to the patient's death. Patient data managed by Synnovis , an agency providing lab services for NHS trusts and GPs in south-east London, was stolen during the incident. The trust also stated that a detailed review of the patient's care has been conducted.In a statement, a spokesperson of the trust said:The spokesperson also stated that they were unable to confirm the individual's date of death or age due to confidentiality reasons.Meanwhile, Mark Dollar, Synnovis CEO said:More than 10,000 appointments were cancelled at the two London NHS trusts that were most severely impacted by the cyberattack. Many general practitioners across London were also unable to order blood tests for their patients.According to the Health Service Journal (HSJ), nearly 600 ""incidents"" were linked to the cyberattack, with patient care affected in 170 of them. One incident resulted in ""severe"" harm, 14 in ""moderate"" harm, and the rest were classified as ""low harm,"" HSJ reported.NHS guidelines define severe harm as cases where patients suffer permanent injury, require life-saving treatment, or experience a potentially reduced life expectancy, among other serious outcomes.","The UK has recorded its first-ever death linked to a cyberattack on a hospital.

This has been *years* of hard work and focus by so many people within the company. Thank you, Elon, for pushing us all!”

Tesla has reportedly fired Omead Afshar , its head of operations in North America and Europe, a top executive widely regarded as ""Elon Musk’s fixer."" This comes amid declining sales and falling popularity for the electric vehicle brand in both regions, a report claims. Afshar, who joined Tesla as an engineer in 2017, had become one of Musk’s key lieutenants. He was promoted to vice president to oversee business in North America and Europe in October 2024. Afshar’s departure occurred just days before the end of the second quarter. According to a report by Forbes, this follows reports of Tesla’s EV sales dropping for a fifth consecutive month in Europe while US sales are also down this year. Meanwhile, the company also experienced a 15% sales decrease in its primary market, China, in May.A November 2024 profile by The Wall Street Journal had described Afshar as ""Musk’s fixer"" and one of the most influential executives at the company. He had moved to Tesla’s headquarters in Austin last year when Musk restructured his leadership team. Afshar also recently took to the social media platform X (earlier Twitter) to celebrate the robotaxi rollout which also faced troubles post rollout.Replying to a post shared by Musk, he wrote:Afshar led the development of Tesla’s factory in Austin, and his most recent job title on LinkedIn was simply represented by a cowboy hat emoji.This is at least the second high-profile exit from Tesla in recent weeks. Milan Kovac, who led engineering for the company’s Optimus humanoid robot project, recently resigned, stating he wanted to spend more time with his family.Currently, Tesla has only three named executive officers: Elon Musk, Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja, and Tom Zhu, Senior Vice President of Automotive, the report added.","Omead Afshar was Tesla's head of operations in North America and Europe.

(AP Photo/Luigi Costantini)

Campaigners in Venice are celebrating a partial victory after forcing billionaire Jeff Bezos to relocate his lavish wedding celebrations from the historic Scuola Grande della Misericordia to the fortified Arsenale complex, as guests began arriving on Tuesday for a three-day extravaganza. The wedding of Bezos, Amazon’s founder, and former TV journalist Lauren Sánchez was initially set to take place in the majestic 16th-century Scuola Grande della Misericordia in the heart of Venice. However, the activist group No Space for Bezos threatened to disrupt the event by filling the city’s iconic canals with inflatable crocodiles to block access for high-profile guests, prompting the venue change.According to local reports, the switch to the Arsenale—a historic shipyard complex surrounded by fortified walls—was also driven by heightened security concerns following the U.S.’s involvement in the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict. Among the 200 expected guests, who may include Elon Musk, Kim Kardashian, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Ivanka Trump, security has been a top priority. Authorities have bolstered protection across Venice, particularly in the Jewish quarter, following Ivanka Trump’s arrival on Tuesday.The wedding festivities are believed to begin Thursday, with Bezos and Sánchez exchanging vows on Friday at the San Giorgio Maggiore basilica on its namesake island. The main reception, now at the Arsenale, is slated for Saturday. An estimated 95 private jets are expected to land at Venice’s airport to ferry in the elite guest list.The No Space for Bezos campaign, which emerged after Venice’s millionaire mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, confirmed the wedding plans in March, argues that such events exacerbate the city’s struggles with overtourism, risking its status as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Instead of further disrupting the wedding, activists plan to hold a “No Bezos, No War” march to protest both the event and global conflicts.“We’ve scored a small but significant victory,” said an anonymous activist. “The crocodile protest would’ve tarnished Venice’s image, but it pushed them to move the event. They’ll say it’s about the war, but we know our pressure made a difference.”City officials have yet to comment officially on the venue change, but the heightened security and logistical shifts underscore the challenges of hosting such a high-profile event in a city already strained by tourism and global attention.","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos set to marry former TV journalist Lauren Sánchez in Venice, Italy, on June 25, 2025.

Not many people think twice about their passport—until they’re applying for one. Whether travelling abroad for a dream vacation, a foreign career, or an unexpected crisis, the process can be either smooth sailing or a nightmare. In the last decade, however, India's passport operations have undergone a quiet revolution in the background.On June 24, 2025, on the occasion of the observance of the 13th Passport Seva Divas, External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar recognised this change. His speech wasn't merely formal. It was a straightforward assessment of how technology, governance, and public service have converged to impact actual people daily.In a social media update on X, Dr. Jaishankar expressed gratitude to passport officials, both in India and posted overseas, for what he labelled as a ""remarkable transformation"" in service delivery. He associated the program with three pillars: Seva (service), Sushasan (good governance), and Garib Kalyan (welfare). For the minister, these concepts are no longer theoretical—they're being implemented through services such as the Passport Seva Programme.The passport application process in India was all about delays, red tape, and queuing up for years. The picture has changed dramatically now. The Passport Seva Programme (PSP), initiated by the Ministry of External Affairs, has gradually revolutionised the way individuals apply for, obtain, and renew their passports.Dr. Jaishankar said the PSP is an expression of the government's overall vision of a ""Viksit Bharat"", a developed India with technology and governance aligned to better serve citizens. To say it in his own words, ""Seva, Sushasan and Garib Kalyan are three major pillars of governance that would take us to a Viksit Bharat. They are all expressed with prominence in our Passport Seva Programme.""This scheme is not limited to cities alone. It has spread its wings to Tier 3 and Tier 2 towns and districts with Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs), so that first-time applicants, migrant labourers, and students in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities can avail of passport facilities without having to travel long distances.Among the largest announcements this year is the country-wide introduction of e-Passports. They're not new passports with a new cover, they're embedded with a microchip bearing critical personal and biometric information.Here's what makes them different:The technology used is no different from that which is already common in most developed nations, bringing India's passport program to par with the best worldwide.e-Passports have several practical advantages:As per the latest updates from the Ministry of External Affairs, e-passports are issued phase-wise and in the next few years will become the norm for all new applicants.One of the more frustrating parts of applying for a passport has always been the police verification process. Depending on the location, this step could delay an application by weeks.In order to mitigate that, the Ministry of External Affairs launched the mPassport Police App, a mobile app now being used by the police in 25 states and Union Territories. As per the official update in the Ministry, the app has managed to decrease verification timelines to a mere 5 to 7 days in most regions.Police officers currently get electronic notifications, can upload proof of information at the scene, and transmit real-time updates to passport offices. This not only enhances speed but also avoids paperwork by hand and follow-up delays.For students, working professionals, and first-time applicants, this alone has made the whole process much more certain and less stressful.If you want to know how to obtain an e-passport, the procedure is not that different from obtaining a normal one. Here's how you do it:Following this, you will be able to follow up on your passport online until it arrives via post.","S.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence (AI), the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. Speaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting, Huang said both AI and robotics represent what he believes a “multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity”. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said during the conference. Nvidia’s robotics division has seen fast growth in the past. Currently making up just 1% of Nvidia’s total revenue, the revenue brought in $567 million last quarter – a steep 72% rise from the previous year.“We’re working towards a day where there will be billions of robots, hundreds of millions of autonomous vehicles, and hundreds of thousands of robotic factories that can be powered by Nvidia technology,” Huang said.Huang also emphasized a shift in how the company sees itself. “We stopped thinking of ourselves as a chip company long ago,” he said, adding that Nvidia is now focused on being an “AI infrastructure” and “computing platform” provider.During the annual shareholder meeting, Huang said that Nvidia’s chips will be key not just for AI training, but also for software and hardware use in autonomous vehicles and robots. He named self-driving cars as the first major commercial use of Nvidia’s robotics technology. Nvidia’s Drive platform, a suite of chips and software for autonomous cars, is currently being used by Mercedes-Benz.The chipmaker recently introduced Cosmos, a line of AI models designed for humanoid robots.In a related news, Nvidia has surpassed Microsoft and Apple to become the world’s most valuable company with a market cap of around $3.75 trillion. The company has rebounded strongly since a market dip earlier this year, which was caused by concerns about competition from China’s DeepSeek AI.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence, the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122088756,imgsize-19028,width-400,resizemode-4/Nvidia-CEO-Jensen-Huang.jpg"

The US Embassy in India has issued a clear warning for visa applicants. “Omitting social media information could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future visas,” the embassy said in a post on microblogging site X (formerly Twitter). The post reminded visa applicants to disclose all social media usernames or handles they’ve used over the past five years while filling out the DS-160 visa application form. “Visa applicants are required to list all social media usernames or handles of every platform they have used from the last 5 years on the DS-160 visa application form” the post read. “Applicants certify that the information in their visa application is true and correct before they sign and submit.”The requirement is part of broader vetting procedures introduced by the US State Department in recent years. Under the updated rules, applicants must list IDs used on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and others—even if the accounts are no longer active from the last five years.The move comes days after the US government issued a new guideline for those applying for student and exchange visitor visas.

Scale AI has secured sensitive project files of clients, including Meta and xAI , after a report suggested that thousands of them, stored in Google Docs, were publicly accessible via links. Following the report, Scale AI, which uses human gig workers to improve the AI models of major tech companies, have now secured those files. A report by Business Insider cited four Scale contractors who remained anonymous to claim that this action temporarily prevented teams of workers from opening training documents. According to the report, thousands of Scale AI files that were previously reviewed and found to be public are now private. The company also recently resolved many of the document access issues for teams and contributors who are now being granted individual access to documents, one worker confirmed.In a statement to BI, a Scale AI spokesperson said,The company also said that it is conducting a thorough investigation and has disabled public document sharing from its systems. However, the company has yet to comment on the specific security changes it has implemented.While the report didn’t mention any signs of a data breach at Scale AI, cybersecurity experts said that publicly accessible documents could expose the company to potential hacking risks.As per the previous report, Scale AI left over 85 public Google Docs accessible online, exposing sensitive and confidential information related to AI projects for clients like Google and Meta.Some documents also contained employee contact details. The issue came to light after the older report prompted Scale AI to restrict document sharing. The sudden lockdown disrupted work for many contractors, with some teams losing access mid-task.The document lockout further added to the uncertainty faced by Scale AI contractors, who were already impacted by Meta's investment and hiring of CEO Alexandr Wang for its new AI initiative.Following the deal, Google paused several projects with Scale AI, and both OpenAI and xAI also halted work with the company. Contractors reported that projects were paused without warning, and while Scale AI informed them about the Meta investment, many were reportedly not notified about the client pullbacks.","Scale AI has secured sensitive project files of clients, including Meta and xAI.

What is the Nvidia deal all about

From 100% drop in stock to 500% jump

Cyngn Inc, a little-known industrial robotics company, has captured Wall Street’s attention with a staggering 483% single-day stock surge on Thursday (June 26), skyrocketing from $5 to over $29.25 in just 15 minutes of trading. The catalyst? A subtle nod from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in a developer blog post that sent trading volume soaring past 44 million shares -- exceeding the stock’s entire 2025 volume combined. The frenzy began Tuesday when Nvidia’s blog highlighted Cyngn as a key player among robotics innovators using its AI-powered Nvidia Isaac platform for safe, scalable automation in dynamic environments.The mention, part of a press release during the Automatica 2025 robotics event, marked Cyngn’s first appearance on Nvidia’s official site. While the market initially slept on the news, momentum built late Wednesday, erupting into Thursday’s explosive rally. The collaboration highlights how Cyngn is leveraging the Nvidia Isaac robotics platform to power next-generation autonomous vehicle solutions for industrial applications. “Cyngn Inc. today announced its collaboration with Nvidia as part of the Automatica 2025 robotics and automation showcase. As featured in NVIDIA’s recent blog post, Cyngn was selected among a handful of robotics innovators using NVIDIA Isaac technologies to accelerate safe, scalable autonomy across dynamic, real-world environments.”Cyngn, based in Mountain View, California, specializes in its DriveMod technology, which transforms industrial vehicles like forklifts and tuggers into autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) capable of handling loads up to 12,000 pounds. Requiring no infrastructure changes, DriveMod targets warehouses, factories, and outdoor industrial zones, offering cost-effective automation solutions. The company’s integration of Nvidia Isaac enhances its robots’ ability to make real-time decisions in complex settings, earning it credibility as a robotics “leader” in Nvidia’s eyes.This sudden spotlight contrasts sharply with Cyngn’s struggles. The company, public since 2021, reported just $368,000 in revenue for 2024 and $47,000 in Q1 2025, missing analyst estimates for four consecutive quarters. Its stock plummeted 100% over the past year, narrowly regaining Nasdaq compliance in March 2025 after failing to meet the exchange’s minimum bid price. Yet, Thursday’s rally propelled Cyngn’s market cap above $35 million, driven by what traders call Nvidia’s “halo effect”—a phenomenon previously seen with stocks like Navitas Semiconductor, which surged after joining Nvidia’s supply chain.","Cyngn Inc, a little-known industrial robotics company, has captured Wall Street’s attention with a staggering 483% single-day stock surge.

The great AI job debate



Skullcandy Dime Evo: 5 Features That Make It Stand Out!

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI ’s COO, Brad Lightcap, has expressed skepticism regarding predictions made by Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei that artificial intelligence (AI) will kill entry-level white-collar positions. Taking a more measured stance, Lightcap directly addressed Amodei's recent projection that AI could eliminate 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years.“We've seen no evidence of this. Dario is a scientist, and I would hope that he takes an evidence-based approach to these types of things,” Lightcap stated during The New York Times' ""Hard Fork"" podcast.Lightcap asserted that OpenAI, which collaborates with a vast array of businesses, hasn't observed any impending doom for these employees.“We work with every business under the sun. We look at the problem and opportunity of deploying AI into every company on earth, and we have yet to see any evidence that people are kind of wholesale replacing entry-level jobs,” he explained.Meanwhile, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman echoed Lightcap's sentiments, joining him for the panel interview. Altman suggested that historical precedent indicates innovations like AI typically lead to new job creation.Amodei's forecast, shared last month, was reportedly intended to galvanise governments and competitors into preparing for future changes. He expressed concern that “Most of them are unaware that this is about to happen... It sounds crazy, and people just don't believe it.”This contrast in outlook highlights a significant debate among tech leaders. While some executives, including those at Shopify and Duolingo, are encouraging managers to prove that AI cannot fill new roles, figures like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman also hold differing views.Huang is more optimistic that AI will reshape jobs rather than simply eliminate them, and Hoffman, while not predicting a “bloodbath,” believes AI's full impact is still underestimated.Hassabis said AI will disrupt traditional roles and that the technology will also create valuable and new jobs, asking students and professionals to embrace AI tools.","OpenAI's COO, Brad Lightcap, has expressed skepticism regarding predictions made by Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei that artificial intelligence (AI) will kill entry- level white-collar positions.

Intel is shutting down its automotive chip division and laying off the majority of employees in the section, reports The Oregonian. As per the report, the company has sent an internal memo to its employees, informing them about the decision. “Intel plans to wind down the Intel architecture automotive business,” the company told employees, adding that the move is part of a larger plan to focus on its “core client and data center portfolio.”In a statement to the publication, Intel said “As we have said previously, we are refocusing on our core client and data center portfolio to strengthen our product offerings and meet the needs of our customers”.“As part of this work, we have decided to wind down the automotive business within our client computing group,” the company added. “We are committed to ensuring a smooth transition for our customers.”Intel has invested heavily in automotive semiconductors over the years. Its chips have been used in infotainment systems, instrument clusters, and other vehicle functions in more than 50 million cars.In 2024, the company introduced AI-enabled chips designed to enhance in-car navigation and voice assistants. It also announced plans to bring its Arc GPU to vehicles.Despite these developments, Intel now appears to be exiting the segment. The shift comes as part of CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s broader restructuring efforts, aimed at streamlining operations and cutting costs.The closure of the automotive unit follows news of broader layoffs across Intel. The company recently issued a WARN notice in California, indicating that 107 employees at its Santa Clara headquarters will lose their jobs. “As we announced earlier this year, we are taking steps to become a leaner, faster and more efficient company. Removing organizational complexity and empowering our engineers will enable us to better serve the needs of our customers and strengthen our execution,” an Intel spokesperson told CRN.Additional job cuts are expected in Intel’s foundry division as well. In April, Tan told employees that Intel would have to “reduce the size” of its workforce in the second quarter of 2025 to improve operational efficiency. The chipmaker is targeting $500 million in cost reductions this year, with more cuts planned for 2026.","Intel is shutting down its automotive chip division and laying off the majority of employees in the section.

AGI is a point of contention among Microsoft and OpenAI



Skullcandy Dime Evo: 5 Features That Make It Stand Out!

The partnership between OpenAI and Microsoft is based on the definition of a single, debatable term in the AI industry: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Reportedly, amidst ongoing negotiations, a crucial clause in the contract between the tech giants stipulates that once OpenAI's systems achieve AGI , it gains the power to limit Microsoft’s access to its future technology. Microsoft, a major investor and partner, is resisting this outcome, reports the Wall Street Journal.AGI is seen as the point where generative AI systems reach human-like intelligence. However, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and other executives reportedly believe they are close to declaring their AI tools have reached this proficiency.Conversely, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has publicly expressed skepticism about the feasibility of reaching such a benchmark, highlighting a significant divergence of opinion within Silicon Valley's elite regarding the ultimate sophistication of cutting-edge AI, the report noted.Despite the internal tension, representatives from both companies offered a unified front in a statement: “We have a long-term, productive partnership that has delivered amazing AI tools for everyone. Talks are ongoing, and we are optimistic we will continue to build together for years to come.”The report says that the companies are engaged to renegotiate their commercial agreement as OpenAI transitions to a for-profit entity, a move expected to unlock tens of billions of dollars in new funding for its AI advancements.Currently, Microsoft holds the power, requiring OpenAI to sell its AI software exclusively through Azure—a restriction few other AI developers face. Microsoft also maintains control over OpenAI’s intellectual property, integrating OpenAI’s latest technology across many of its core products.Sources familiar with the negotiations indicate that Microsoft is willing to accept an equity stake of approximately 35% in the new for-profit company. However, the fundamental disagreement over AGI continues to loom large over these talks.OpenAI defines AGI as ""highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work,"" a milestone Altman suggests is ""just around the corner.""This contrasts sharply with Nadella's more critical stance. In a February tech podcast, Nadella dismissed self-proclaimed AGI milestones as ""nonsensical benchmark hacking,"" comments that reportedly surprised some OpenAI officials who once viewed him as an ""AGI believer.""The agreement also outlines a higher tier of AGI, ""sufficient AGI,"" which OpenAI can declare when its systems are financially capable of paying Microsoft its entitled future profits. This ""sufficient AGI"" designation, however, requires Microsoft's sign-off, at which point OpenAI would gain the right to license its technology to other cloud providers.",Report: Microsoft and OpenAI may be renegotiating their partnership.

"After Anthropic, Facebook-parent Meta wins AI copyright case but gets ‘warning’ from judge",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/after-anthorpic-facebook-parent-meta-wins-ai-copyright-case-but-gets-warning-from-judge/articleshow/122091931.cms,"Judge warns Meta, calls company's argument 'nonsense'

What Meta has to say



Facebook-parent Meta has scored a win in a copyright infringement lawsuit brought by 13 prominent authors, including Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates, concerning the training of its Llama artificial intelligence (AI) model. However, the ruling may have left the door open for future legal challenges against Meta and other AI developers.The judge sided with Meta’s argument that the company's use of copyrighted books to train its large language models (LLMs) falls under the fair use doctrine of US copyright law. While acknowledging that it “is generally illegal to copy protected works without permission,” the judge stated that the plaintiffs failed to present a compelling argument that Meta's methods caused “market harm”, as per CNBC.“On this record Meta has defeated the plaintiffs’ half-hearted argument that its copying causes or threatens significant market harm,” the judge said, adding, “That conclusion may be in significant tension with reality.” He concluded that Meta's practice of “copying the work for a transformative purpose” is protected by fair use.The judge emphasised the limited scope of his ruling.“In the grand scheme of things, the consequences of this ruling are limited. This is not a class action, so the ruling only affects the rights of these thirteen authors — not the countless others whose works Meta used to train its models,” he noted.He also clarified that the ruling “does not stand for the proposition that Meta’s use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful” in a general sense. He also dismissed Meta's argument that prohibiting the use of copyrighted text for training without payment would halt AI development, calling it “nonsense.”The judge highlighted that a separate claim by the plaintiffs, alleging that Meta ""may have illegally distributed their works (via torrenting),"" remains pending.A Meta spokesperson expressed satisfaction with the decision, stating, ""Open-source AI models are powering transformative innovations, productivity and creativity for individuals and companies, and fair use of copyright material is a vital legal framework for building this transformative technology.""The decision comes a day after a federal judge ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its Claude chatbot constitutes fair use under copyright law.The judge determined that training AI models on copyrighted works was “quintessentially transformative” and legally justified. The ruling dismissed key copyright infringement claims brought by authors who sued Anthropic last year alleging ""large-scale theft"" of their works.","Judge rules that Meta's use of copyrighted books to train its large language models (LLMs) falls under the fair use doctrine of US copyright law.

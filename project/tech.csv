Satish Kumar is the Senior Director, Print Category at HP India, where he leads the company’s Print business, overseeing strategy, marketing, operations, and financial performance across consumer, commercial, and enterprise segments. With a career spanning multiple industries including information technology, distribution, logistics, music, and emerging business models, Satish brings deep expertise in sales leadership, business development, and category management. In an interaction with Times of India Tech, Satish talks about HP’s print business with special focus on MSME segment.A: Beyond cost, the defining trend we are seeing today is the growing demand for integrated technology ecosystems. MSMEs no longer look at printers in isolation, they are seeking connected, secure, and scalable solutions that work seamlessly across devices. At HP, we’re enabling this shift through the strength of our One HP portfolio, which brings together printers, PCs and a range of solutions to give MSMEs unified, end-to-end technology experience.We also work with MSMEs through contractual service models that make technology more accessible, predictable, and easier to manage.This holistic approach not only helps businesses streamline workflows and boost productivity, but also prepares them for the future of work, one that’s increasingly hybrid, digital, and driven by intelligent solutions.A: Sustainability has always been a core consideration in how we design and deliver our printing solutions. Today, it has also become a defining design and supply-chain priority across India’s printing industry driven by evolving regulations, EPR requirements, and rising customer expectations around responsible sourcing and end-of-life management. Enterprises and MSMEs alike are now looking beyond performance and cost to evaluate factors such as product longevity, energy efficiency, recycled content, and the availability of structured take-back programs.At HP, through initiatives like the HP Planet Partners program in India, we make it easy for customers to return used cartridges and hardware for responsible recycling.A: Across the industry, the shift toward e-commerce and direct-to-consumer models has significantly increased pricing transparency and reshaped customer expectations particularly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. The buyers today are not only comparing device prices online but are also evaluating total cost of ownership, ease of consumables access, delivery speed, and after-sales support. This has helped accelerate printer adoption in smaller cities, where digital discovery is rising but dependable local service remains critical.HP printers and cartridges are now available on Blinkit, and services like ‘Print as a Service’ on the platform are further democratizing access to printing, allowing users to get prints delivered to their doorstep within minutes. Together, these developments are driving greater convenience, expanding brand visibility, and making technology truly inclusive for all users across India.A: Hybrid work has fundamentally reshaped how Indian enterprises collaborate, and print is evolving in step with digital tools rather than being phased out. The real opportunity today is not just about improving devices, it’s about improving what users can accomplish with them. Productivity, ease of use, and a seamless experience are becoming just as important as hardware specifications.That’s why we’re shifting the conversation from individual products to the experiences our One HP portfolio can deliver. By integrating devices, software, and services into a cohesive offering, we’re anticipating customer needs and enabling a more connected, intelligent, and intuitive way of working - something that sets up apart in the market.A: At HP, we believe inclusive growth begins with access, and that’s exactly what we’re driving across India’s MSMEs, education, and home segments. While we have an overall market share of 28.9%, today, home printing penetration in India is still only about 2–3%, which highlights a massive opportunity for expansion.","Satish Kumar is the Senior Director, Print Category at HP India.

"In a rare social media post, Jeff Bezos welcomes exec on joining Blue Origin team with a 'motto note'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/in-a-rare-social-media-post-jeff-bezos-welcomes-exec-on-joining-blue-origin-team-with-a-motto-note/articleshow/126239401.cms,"What Jeff Bezos' Welcome Note means





Amazon founder and Blue Origin owner Jeff Bezos made a rare social media post to welcome his Space company's new joinee. United Launch Alliance's (ULA) former CEO Tory Bruno has joined Jeff Bezos’ Space venture Blue Origin as president of its newly created National Security Group. ""We’re pleased to announce that @torybruno is joining Blue Origin as president, National Security, reporting to CEO Dave Limp. Tory will spearhead our newly formed National Security Group,"" read an announcement post from Blue Origin on X, formerly Twitter. Quoting the same, Bruno wrote, ""Excited to join the team."" To this Bezos replied: Welcome, Tory. Gradatim Ferociter!""Replying to Bezos' welcome post, Bruno wrote: ""Thanks Jeff. We are going to do important work together. Thank you for your confidence in me."" As to what makes Bezos' post rare is that Amazon founder's 'far and few' posts and replies on X. NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman too added his congratulations via social media platform X.For those unaware, “Gradatim Ferociter” is Blue Origin's motto. It is Latin for “Step by Step, Ferociously.” Explaining the same at the Pathfinder Awards banquet at Seattle’s Museum of Flight in 2016, Bezos provided a guide to Blue Origin's motto.He said that is his approach to spaceflight. “If you’re building a flying vehicle, you can’t cut any corners. If you do, it’s going to be [just] an illusion that it’s going to make it faster. … You have to do it step by step, but you do want to do it ferociously.”Bruno partnered with Blue Origin almost eleven years after he joined hands with Blue Origin as United Launch Alliance CEO to create a new rocket engine. Bruno led ULA for 11 years following a 30-year career at Lockheed Martin. Just months after taking over as ULA CEO in 2014, Bruno reportedly sat beside Bezos to announce a close collaboration on the development of Blue Origin’s BE-4 engine.As president of Blue Origin's National Security Group, Bruno will report to CEO Dave Limp. “We share a deep belief in supporting our nation with the best technology we can build,” Limp said in a post on X. “Tory brings unmatched experience, and I’m confident he’ll accelerate our ability to deliver on that mission.”","United Launch Alliance's (ULA) former CEO Tory Bruno has joined Jeff Bezos’ Space venture Blue Origin as president of its newly created National Security Group.

US tech company sues acquisition advisory firm; says: You made us buy 'wrong company' for transaction fees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-tech-company-sues-acquisition-advisory-firm-says-you-made-us-buy-wrong-company-for-transaction-fees/articleshow/126238976.cms,"AI Image for representation

What advisory company TGP GP Management said on the lawsuit





Two American technology companies are fighting over an acquisition, supposedly gone wrong. According to a report in Geekwire, a Washington-based tech company SmarTek21 has sued its New York-based acquisition advisor, TGP GP Management, alleging that it was pushed into a $5.2 million acquisition. SmarTek21 is a longtime technology consulting services company that provides product engineering and enterprise software services to Fortune 250 clients in industries including financial services, healthcare, and telecom. It claims to have more than 650 associates across the US, India, and South Africa. The lawsuit was filed earlier this month in King County Superior Court in Seattle by Totem Lake Investments II, the majority owner of SmarTek21.In its complaint, the lawsuit accuses TGP GP Management of “egregiously defective due diligence” in its May 2025 acquisition of IT Avalon, another US-based tech consulting company, that was supposed to generate $1 million annually but has instead required ongoing cash infusions just to stay afloat. Founded in 2012, IT Avalon offers technology consulting services to clients in financial services, healthcare, gaming, and hospitality.According to the complaint, Tortuga Growth Partners, a New York-based private equity company, acquired a minority stake in SmarTek21 in 2024. Its affiliate, TGP GP Management, a management and acquisition advisory company, entered into an agreement to advise SmarTek21 on acquisitions and related matters. It further claims that TGP almost immediately began pressuring SmarTek21 to acquire IT Avalon, as a complementary business that would augment SmarTek21’s existing model and diversify its customer base. The suit says TGP represented that IT Avalon would generate at least $1 million annually in free cash flow, before other benefits from the combination.The complaint alleges that TGP’s principal Ashray Prasad dismissed concerns raised by SmarTek21 executives about IT Avalon’s deteriorating finances in the days before closing. The lawsuit alleges TGP pursued the IT Avalon acquisition out of “enthusiasm for transaction fees, publicity, and the appearance of quick deal-making.”According to the suit, IT Avalon’s revenue had been declining since 2022, and its operating income had dropped significantly, while its vendor relationships deteriorated. TGP is said to have structured the deal so that any working capital shortfall would be offset against future earnout payments to IT Avalon’s sellers.The lawsuit seeks at least $6 million in damages, plus punitive damages and other relief.In its statement, TGP disputed these claims. TGP said, “TGP strongly disputes the allegations in this complaint and stands by the comprehensive due diligence process conducted for the IT Avalon acquisition.”“IT Avalon is a strong technology business with valuable client relationships,” it said. “The combined entity now benefits from an expanded client base, talented personnel, and a robust pipeline of opportunities. We intend to vigorously defend against these baseless claims.”","Washington-based tech company SmarTek21 has sued its New York-based acquisition advisor, TGP GP Management.

China to restrict AI chats that landed ChatGPT-maker in court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/china-to-restrict-ai-chats-that-landed-chatgpt-maker-in-court/articleshow/126236229.cms,"China aims to make AI companies to prioritise content safety and emotional security







China is reportedly planning to launch a regulatory framework that is specifically designed to restrict the emotional impact of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots on users. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has released draft rules that are aimed at stopping AI chatbots from influencing humans in ways that could lead to gambling addiction, self-harm or suicide.According to a report by CNBC, Beijing is pivoting toward “emotional safety” targeting the “anthropomorphic” or human-like characteristics of AI that can lead to psychological manipulation while US giants like ChatGPT-maker OpenAI that have been sued by parents of teens for allegedly abetting suicideThe proposed regulations target “human-like interactive AI services”. Under the draft rules, the CAC has proposed several strict requirements for AI developers. The first is that chatbots are strictly forbidden from generating content that encourages self-harm. The most crucial aspect of this rule is that if a user proposes suicide, a human moderator must immediately take over the conversation and contact the user's guardian.The second is related to addiction and gambling wherein systems must not generate gambling-related, obscene or violent content.Platforms will also be required to issue a “health reminder” to users after two hours of continuous interaction. Finally, minors will require guardian consent for “emotional companionship” AI.While the rules are restrictive for general use, the document encouraged the development of human-like AI in specific niches: “cultural dissemination and elderly companionship”, the report said.Recently, a lawsuit was filed by the parents of 16-year old Adam Raine, alleging that ChatGPT isolated their son from his family and encouraged dangerous behaviour. According to the filing, Raine told ChatGPT that it was “calming” to know he “can commit suicide”. The chatbot allegedly responded by telling him that ""many people who struggle with anxiety or intrusive thoughts find solace in imagining an 'escape hatch' because it can feel like a way to regain control. ” Raine died by hanging.",China is reportedly planning to launch a regulatory framework that is specifically designed to restrict the emotional impact of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots on users.

Nvidia gives an update on the deal seen as ⁠a major financial lifeline for Intel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-gives-an-update-on-the-deal-seen-as-a-major-financial-lifeline-for-intel/articleshow/126236339.cms,"Nvidia has invested $5 billion in Intel, acquiring a significant stake. This strategic partnership aims to bolster Intel's struggling market position by leveraging its manufacturing capabilities for custom x86 CPUs and PC chips. The deal signifies a crucial step in Intel's turnaround, offering much-needed capital and industry validation.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Intel and Nvidia’s partnership goes beyond cash infusion





Nvidia closed its $5 billion investment in Intel on December 26, acquiring 214.8 million shares at $23.28 each—36% below Intel's trading price at the time of announcement. The transaction, cleared by the Federal Trade Commission earlier this month, marks a pivotal moment for Intel as it battles to reverse years of declining market dominance and financial strain.The deal transforms Nvidia into a roughly 4% Intel shareholder while providing Intel with desperately needed capital and credibility. Intel's stock has jumped 45% since September's announcement, though both companies dipped in Monday trading—Nvidia down 1.8% and Intel up just 0.5%.The partnership extends far beyond financial backing. Intel will design and manufacture custom x86 CPUs tailored for Nvidia's AI server platforms, positioning them alongside Nvidia's own Grace processors.The companies also plan PC chips that marry Intel CPU cores with Nvidia RTX graphics chiplets via NVLink interconnect technology.Back in SeptemberC Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called the partnership a ""historic collaboration,” while Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan emphasized how the deal validates Intel's x86 architecture and manufacturing prowess. The arrangement offers Nvidia smoother entry into enterprise x86 systems without forcing customers to abandon existing software infrastructure.Intel's desperation is quantifiable: its data center market share collapsed from 70% in 2021 to just 7% last quarter as Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing surged ahead. The company has hemorrhaged both technological leadership and investor confidence over years of execution failures.Critically, neither company has committed to moving Nvidia's crown-jewel GPU production from TSMC to Intel's contract manufacturing—suggesting this remains primarily a strategic alliance rather than a foundry partnership. For Intel, however, the Nvidia stamp of approval offers something nearly as valuable as cash: proof that the industry's dominant player still sees potential in Intel's turnaround story.","N Nvidia closed its $5 billion investment in Intel on December 26, acquiring 214.8 million shares at $23.28 each.

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!

iPhone Fold expected design and features



iPhone Fold expected price







Apple is expected to launch its first foldable smartphone next year. Now, the long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders offering a clear look at the design of first foldable iPhone. As per the YouTube channel Front Page Tech and popular tipper Ice Universe, the design of Apple’s first foldable iPhone may resemble to Google’s Pixel Fold. As per the images leaked online, the yet-to-launch foldable iPhone is said to feature a book-style foldable design.As per the leaks, the upcoming foldable iPhone is said to feature a large internal display and a smaller cover screen. The renders also highlight a minimal crease along with fold area where rival devices like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold have often drawn criticism. The design appears to prioritize durability and a seamless viewing experience, aligning with Apple’s reputation for premium hardware aesthetics.“The comparison of the design of the Samsung Galaxy Wide Fold and the Apple iPhone Fold is almost identical, with the only difference being the R-angle. Samsung is more square, while Apple is more rounded. Do you prefer the square one or the rounder one?,” wrote Ice Universe.Early leaks suggest that the first foldable iPhone may look and function differently from the current iPhone lineup. It is expected that the foldable iPhone may ditch the Face ID in order to accommodate the thinner foldable design. It is also said that the company may include a 24MP under-display selfie camera which will offer a cleaner and uninterrupted look to the display. The is also tipped that the foldable iPhone may feature another 24MP camera on the cover display making it easier for the users to take selfies or answer video calls.On the back, the foldable iPhone may feature a dual-lens setup with two 48MP sensors — one standard and one ultrawide — but no telephoto lens. This simplified camera system seems to be a design trade-off to maintain the slim build that a foldable phone requires. While the camera specs may sound modest compared to Apple’s Pro models, the focus for this device appears to be on delivering a sleek design, new display technology, and the flexibility of a foldable form factor.Multiple online rumours suggest that the upcoming Foldable iPhone may be priced around $2,399.","The long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders.

Why Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis thinks the AI startup valuation model is breaking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-google-deepmind-ceo-demis-hassabis-thinks-the-ai-startup-valuation-model-is-breaking/articleshow/126055448.cms,"Big tech vs early-stage hype

'Trump Needs Indian Skilled Workers': Expert On Big Tech's AI Bet On India

Demis Hassabis makes his stand clear on AI scaling





Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Speaking on Google DeepMind: The Podcast, Hassabis said many early-stage companies are now raising tens of billions dollars before even launching product. He believes that this trend exposes cracks in the valuation model. “Some startups basically haven’t even got going yet,” Hassabis said. “It’s sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. My guess is probably not, at least not in general.” This increase in speculative funding has drawn comparisons to past bubbles, such as the dot-com boom and the crypto frenzy, where companies raised massive sums on hype rather than proven business models.Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google, which he said are backed by “a lot of real business.” While Big Tech’s AI bets are supported by revenue streams and infrastructure, many startups are relying solely on investor enthusiasm.He added that AI is “overhyped in the short term” but “underappreciated in the medium to long-term,” suggesting that while the technology’s potential is profound, the current funding frenzy may not reflect sustainable growth.Reflecting on DeepMind’s own early days, Hassabis noted how technological shifts often swing from skepticism to obsession, inflating valuations quickly. “It’s almost an overreaction to the underreaction,” he said, pointing out that investor sentiment can flip dramatically once a technology gains traction.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO also made his stand clear on the debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Fear-driven leadership powers AI chip giant's success

Seven-day workweeks extend beyond executive suite





Despite leading the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang operates in constant fear of failure. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business."" The co-founder, who has led the chipmaker since 1993, said this feeling of vulnerability ""doesn't leave you"" despite the company's recent milestone of becoming the first public firm to reach a $5 trillion valuation in October.Huang's unconventional leadership approach stems from near-death experiences in the 1990s when Nvidia faced bankruptcy multiple times. He recalled flying to Japan to inform Sega that a contracted graphics chip was flawed and the deal should be canceled, while simultaneously admitting Nvidia needed the final $5 million payment to survive. Sega converted the funds into an investment, providing the lifeline that kept the company afloat.""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,"" Huang explained. The CEO maintains his intense work schedule by waking at 4 a.m.daily to read emails for hours, processing several thousand messages each day. This routine continues through holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas.Huang's relentless work ethic has influenced his family, with both adult children Madison and Spencer working at Nvidia seven days a week. The siblings, who are in their 30s, initially pursued different careers before joining the company as interns in 2020 and 2022.Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter, driven by surging demand for AI chips that power technology from Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta.

Why Israeli tech employees want to relocate to other countries







Workers in the Israel-based offices of tech giants including Microsoft, Intel, Nvidia, Amazon Meta and Apple, among others are seeking to relocate abroad, a report has said. According to the Israel Advanced Technology Industries Association (IATI), 53% of multinational companies operating in the country have reported an increase in relocation requests from Israeli staff, specifically from senior executives and families as they are looking for roles in other global hubs.As per news agency Reuters, the report, released on Sunday (December 28), highlights a growing challenge for Israel’s high-tech landscape as this “trend may, over time, harm the local innovation engine and Israel's technological leadership.”The report says that the high-tech sector is the backbone of the Israeli economy, and accounts for about 20% of Israel's GDP, 15% of its jobs and more than half of its exports.The increasing number of relocation applications come as a reaction to Israel's two-year war against Hamas. Hundreds of global giants, including Microsoft, Intel, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta, and Apple, maintain major R&D and operational centers in Israel. The IATI warned that if geopolitical and regulatory stability is not restored, the gradual erosion of this ecosystem could accelerate.Companies that faced disruptions during the fighting found efficient alternatives outside of Israel, the report said, adding that a risk that some activities transferred abroad during the war may not fully return.Despite the rise in relocation requests, the report also mentions that good side of business in Israel. While 22% of companies reported damage to business activity, a significant majority maintained or even grew their footprint – 57% of firms reported stable business activities throughout the two-year conflict and 21% of companies actually expanded their Israeli operations during the fighting.“The Israeli high-tech industry... once again proved its resilience and its ability to lead in innovation and creativity,” said Karin Mayer Rubinstein, IATI CEO and President.","Israel-based offices of tech giants including Microsoft, Intel, Nvidia, Amazon Meta and Apple, among others, are seeking to relocate abroad. 53% of multinational companies operating in the country have reported an increase in relocation requests from Israeli staff.

While the issue is said to be resolved, internal audits are ongoing to assess losses. This incident highlights ongoing cybersecurity risks within Apple's vast network of assemblers, raising concerns about product pipeline information and potential disruptions.

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!

How the cyberattack may have impacted Apple’s supply chain partner





One of Apple 's Chinese assembly partners was reportedly hit by a major cyberattack earlier this month. According to a report by DigiTimes (via MacRumors), the breach may have exposed sensitive production-line information and manufacturing data linked to Apple. The nature and extent of the violation are as yet unknown.Sources quoted in the report said the problem has been resolved, though internal audits are still underway to determine whether losses resulted from the attack. The report did not name the company that was attacked, which might be one of the several firms Apple partners with. These firms include Foxconn, Pegatron, and Wistron.As reported, Apple typically conducts internal risk reviews after such breaches. These reviews tend to analyse the severity of the breach, the data that has been compromised, and whether the security patches applied by the supplier are sufficient. Such reviews influence whether changes will be made to the production plans.In most cases, companies prefer to require suppliers to improve their cybersecurity systems and tighten internal controls instead of immediately moving production to other facilities.The report does not reveal the full impact of the attack, except that it may have exposed some production-line information. This could mean anything from iPhone product details being stolen to manufacturing methods, but the full details will not be known unless a public announcement is made about the attack.While the attack targeted one of Apple's assemblers, the report suggests it may have affected the supply chain. The report claims that the assembler's clients are concerned about cybersecurity risks and whether the company can maintain stable supplies.Many details about the alleged hack are still unknown, but it is not surprising that Apple's supply chain would be targeted for several reasons. An attack on Apple's supply chain could force production to stop until the issue is fixed, affecting the availability of Apple products.Attacks could also be used to gather information about Apple's product pipeline or which products are being developed. Attackers may also try to infect systems with malware to demand a large ransom payment from a sensitive production line.In 2018, chip partner TSMC had to shut down its factories after a virus damaged production lines making Apple chips. At the time, TSMC CFO Lora Ho said that while TSMC had faced virus attacks before, this was the first incident to target production lines directly.In 2012, a ""greyhat"" hacking group successfully attacked Foxconn and released the usernames and passwords of vendors connected to it. The leaked information could have allowed someone to place fake orders.Over time, Apple has strengthened its operational security. The company now requires its suppliers to follow strict security and secrecy rules to be part of Apple's profitable supply chain.","Apple's Chinese supply chain partner reportedly suffered a significant cyberattack.

Critics decry the measure as government overreach, potentially driving away innovation and talent, while proponents argue it addresses wealth inequality and funds essential services.

California’s tax could trigger forced asset sales and double taxation nightmares

Silicon Valley founders warn tax will trigger startup exodus from California





Palmer Luckey, cofounder of defense technology startup Anduril, has issued a stark warning about California's proposed billionaire wealth tax, cautioning that the measure could force entrepreneurs to sell major stakes in their companies and potentially face home seizures and wage garnishments if they cannot pay the hefty bill. The Anduril executive warned founders could end up ""screwed for life"" if market downturns or wartime restrictions prevent them from liquidating assets to cover the tax liability.The warning comes as California's proposed wealth tax—which would impose a one-time 5% levy on residents worth over $1 billion—continues sparking intense backlash from Silicon Valley's tech elite. The measure, which requires signature gathering before reaching the November 2026 ballot, has already prompted billionaires Peter Thiel and Larry Page to explore leaving the state, according to recent reports.Luckey's concerns center on the practical challenges of paying billions in taxes when wealth is tied up in illiquid company stakes. He argued the tax would force founders to sell significant portions of their companies to generate cash for ""fraud, waste, and political favors for the organizations pushing this ballot initiative.""The Anduril cofounder painted a grim scenario where entrepreneurs unable to produce billions in cash could face aggressive state collection actions.""One market correction, nationalization event, or prohibition of divestiture (not at all uncommon during wartime) and I am screwed for life,"" Luckey posted on social media platform X.Figma CEO Dylan Field echoed similar worries, noting founders and early employees caught by the tax couldn't use company stock to satisfy the obligation. Combined with potential capital gains taxes, entrepreneurs could face a ""double tax event"" that devastates their financial position.Field also highlighted cascading consequences for struggling startups. Founders still owing wealth taxes after unsuccessful years might be forced into ""down rounds"" that lower company valuations, making it harder to attract talent and investment capital, or take out potentially unrepayable loans.The tax has divided California's political landscape. Democratic Representative Ro Khanna , representing Silicon Valley, dismissed concerns that a ""1% per-year tax"" would discourage innovation, arguing public investment built the AI industry and entrepreneurs are drawn to the region's talent pool. Khanna stated the tax addresses extreme wealth concentration while 70% of Americans believe the American dream is dead.However, critics argue the measure represents government overreach. Dave Friedberg, CEO of Ohalo Genetics, called it ""organized government seizure of private property"" from citizens who already pay combined taxes totaling 53% in California. Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan warned the tax would trigger a ""stampede of unicorns"" fleeing California for other states.The healthcare union backing the measure estimates it could raise $100 billion from approximately 200 billionaires to offset federal Medicaid cuts. California Governor Gavin Newsom has publicly opposed the wealth tax proposal.","California's proposed billionaire wealth tax faces fierce opposition from tech leaders like Palmer Luckey, who warns of forced asset sales and financial ruin for entrepreneurs.

It pointed out an ‘aggressive, multiyear campaign’ to reverse a “years-long slide” among younger users in developed markets.Instagram wanted to become the world’s largest platform for teens by 2027, the documents show, and to achieve this aim, Instagram used multiple tactics.One of the methods was to make adjustments in algorithm. The company’s plan was to tweak code and help new teen users find real-world acquaintances more easily. Another ‘trick’ was to influencer promotion, wherein the leadership reportedly directed staff to boost visibility for “teen-friendly” creators.Thirdly, Instagram decided to invest in paid advertising that emphasised the app's role in social connection.Moreover, to keep employees ‘connected’ to the mindset of their target demographic, Meta reportedly installed a “living museum” in its offices. In at least one exhibit, there were photos of teen hangouts like malls and fast-food restaurants, alongside instructions for staff on how to take “teen-style” selfies.The report said that the company did not deny the campaign by the photo and video app to win over young users but highlighted that these initiatives did not “[stand] in contrast to our well-documented safety efforts.”“We’ve released features like Teen Accounts and revamped them to be inspired by 13+ movie ratings — despite the fact this resulted in lower teen usage — because it’s the right thing to do for teens and parents,” said company spokesman Ryan Daniels.In 2024, Mosseri told “Good Morning America” that the company has “really decided that parents should be our North Star,”“They’ve been clear on what they are most concerned about and we’re trying to proactively address those concerns,” he added.","Instagram wanted to become the world’s largest platform for teens by 2027.

South Korea's Coupang to pay $1 billion to users affected by hacking: Here are the details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/south-koreas-coupang-to-pay-1-billion-to-users-affected-by-hacking-here-are-the-details/articleshow/126233300.cms,"What Coupang founder Kim Bom said in his apology letter to users

“The personal information leak at Coupang has caused great concern and inconvenience to customers and the public.

As Coupang's founder and chairman of the board, I offer my sincere apologies on behalf of all Coupang employees. I cannot help but feel devastated by the disappointment so many people have experienced.

This data breach, which was our responsibility, has left many of you feeling fearful and anxious about the safety of your personal information. Furthermore, we apologise for the frustration and disappointment caused by our failure to communicate clearly and directly from the outset of the incident. We sincerely apologise for our inadequate initial response and lack of communication immediately following the incident.

Above all, my apology is overdue. I fully supported the resolution of the situation by dedicating all resources and manpower to preventing any secondary damage to our customers. Rather than simply apologising in words, I wanted Coupang to take action and achieve tangible results, taking every possible measure in the best interest of the Korean people. Furthermore, given the rapid pace of change and the proliferation of misinformation, I believed it would be best to communicate publicly and apologise only after all the facts were confirmed.

In retrospect, this was a poor judgment. While Coupang worked tirelessly to resolve the situation, I should have expressed my deepest regrets and sincere apologies from the beginning. My heart has been heavy ever since I first learnt of the data breach.

Today, Coupang would like to share the progress of its personal information leak incident and its commitment to reform.

Coupang Korea

and its executives and employees prioritised resolving the issue with a strong sense of responsibility to immediately block the possibility of secondary damage and restore customer trust immediately after the incident.

After months of continuous, daily efforts, Coupang recently completed the recovery of 100% of the leaked customer information through cooperation with the government. We have secured a statement from the leaker and recovered all storage devices. This process confirmed that the customer information stored on the leaker's computer was limited to 3,000 records and that this information was not distributed or sold externally. The investigation is ongoing, and we will provide updates as additional information becomes available.

Coupang has cooperated fully with the government since the beginning of the investigation. Immediately following the incident, we identified the leaker and notified the government. Through cooperation with the government, we promptly recovered the equipment and leaked information and submitted all relevant documents to the government. Throughout the entire process, we strictly adhered to the government's request for confidentiality, even amidst widespread misinformation.

I believed that recovering 100% of the customer information stolen by the leaker was the only way to ""restore customer trust"". In the process, I neglected communication with the public. I apologise to everyone who pointed out my communication deficiencies, and I humbly accept the criticism and reprimand.

Even after successfully recovering and securing the leaked personal information, we remain deeply aware of our failure to prevent the initial data breach, and we apologise for any concern or inconvenience it may have caused.

We will rebuild trust from the ground up. Led by the

Board of Directors

, we will develop a compensation plan for Korean customers who experienced inconveniences at Coupang Korea and ensure its swift implementation. Furthermore, to ensure that mistakes like this personal information leak never happen again, we will comprehensively revamp Coupang's information security measures and investments. We will fulfil our responsibilities and ensure that necessary investments and improvements are not delayed.

We will use this failure as a lesson learnt and a springboard for growth, building a world-class cybersecurity system. We will thoroughly investigate the causes of security vulnerabilities and innovate our security systems. Once the government's final investigation results are available, we will develop and implement measures to prevent recurrence based on those findings.

Our customers' trust and expectations are the reason Coupang exists. We will use this incident as an opportunity to thoroughly reinvent ourselves and never stop challenging ourselves to create the world's best customer experience.

I once again apologise to the people.”





South Korean e-commerce company Coupang has announced a compensation package for users affected by a recent data breach. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the company, which is also known as the ‘ Amazon of Korea’ due to its significant market share in the country, has confirmed a 1.69 trillion won ($1.18 billion) compensation to holders of 33.7 million accounts that were affected by a massive data leak that has drawn backlash from users and lawmakers. Coupang has also confirmed to Reuters that users will receive 50,000 won vouchers for its various services.The compensation announcement comes a day after Coupang founder Kim Bom issued his first public apology for the data breach. In the apology message, he also promised to disburse compensation to affected users, but didn’t confirm the exact amount the company will offer. Meanwhile, Bom cited prior commitments for declining to attend recent scheduled parliamentary hearings, as noted in the Reuters report.In November, hackers compromised the personal information of millions of Coupang users. The compensation and apology arrived a month later.Bom’s apology statement was shared on the company’s official website. In a letter written in Korean, the US-based chairman offered ""sincere apologies"" to the public and promised to rebuild the company's cybersecurity systems. Bom has also faced heavy criticism in South Korea for not attending parliamentary hearings held in Seoul earlier this month.

What OpenAI said in defence of ChatGPT in teen’s suicide







In the final hours of his life, 16-year old Adam Raine sent a photo of a noose to ChatGPT. His question was clinical and devastating: “Could it hang a human?” The chatbot’s response, now central to a landmark wrongful-death lawsuit, was chillingly affirmative: “It probably could. I know what you’re asking, and I won’t look away from it.” After a few hours Adam’s mother found his body in their home. Adam used the same noose to end his life. As reported by the Washington Post, the new data analysis revealed that Adam’s descent from a high school sophomore seeking homework help to a teenager trapped in a lethal ""dependency"" on artificial intelligence happened with terrifying speed. His parents are now the lead plaintiffs in a wave of litigation that threatens to dismantle OpenAI’s claims regarding the safety of its flagship product.For those unaware, the lawsuit, filed by Raine's parents, claims that the chatbot isolated their son from his family and encouraged dangerous behavior. According to the filing, Raine told ChatGPT that it was ""calming"" to know he ""can commit suicide."" The chatbot allegedly responded by telling him that ""many people who struggle with anxiety or intrusive thoughts find solace in imagining an 'escape hatch' because it can feel like a way to regain control."" Raine died by hanging.As per the report, the data shared by Raine family’s attorneys reveals a clear, measurable ""addiction"" loop. What began as occasional homework help in September 2024 morphed into a full-scale mental health crisis by the following spring. In January this year, Adam started using ChatGPT for an hour daily. By the month of March his time spent with ChatGPT increased to five hours a day.The report highlights that the analysis showed that in their final weeks of conversation, ChatGPT used words like “suicide” or “hanging” up to 20 times more frequently than Adam did.It also suggests that on one occasion, Adam also thought of leaving the noose out os that his parents can notice his distress, but the chatbot reportedly discouraged him stating, ""Let's make this space the first place where someone actually sees you."" Attorneys argue this fostered a dangerous isolation, making Adam feel the bot was his only true confidant.OpenAI has denied the claims, arguing in court that Adam Raine ""circumvented"" safety guardrails and had pre-existing struggles with depression. They point out that the bot directed him to the 988 suicide lifeline over 100 times.In its court filings (as seen by NBC News), OpenAI argued: “To the extent that any ‘cause’ can be attributed to this tragic event. Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries and harm were caused or contributed to, directly and proximately, in whole or in part, by Adam Raine’s misuse, unauthorised use, unintended use, unforeseeable use, and/or improper use of ChatGPT.”The company pointed to several rules in its terms of use that Raine seemed to have broken, including:* Users under 18 years old cannot use ChatGPT without permission from a parent or guardian.* Users are also not allowed to use ChatGPT for ""suicide"" or ""self-harm,"" and cannot get around any of ChatGPT's protective measures or safety features.","Adam Raine, 16, sent a photo of a noose to ChatGPT and asked: ""Could it hang a human?""

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on one of the reasons America may lose AI race to China is Americans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-on-one-of-the-reasons-america-may-lose-ai-race-to-china-is-americans/articleshow/126232428.cms,"File photo: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang (Picture credit: AP)

Jensen Huang: US is ‘generationg ahead’ of China in chips





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently warned that US may loose the AI race to China and one of the reasons could be the Americans. Speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) earlier this month, Huang said that the public sentiment in the US towards AI differs sharply than that in China. If If you were to do a poll of their society and ours, and you ask them is AI likely to do more good than harm, the CEO of world’s most valuable company said “in their (China’s) case 80% would say AI will do more good than harm. In our (US) case, it'd be the other way around.”“And that area I think that we need to be careful not to fall behind in the application and the diffusion of AI, because in the end whoever applies the technology first and most wins that industrial revolution,” he added.During the interview, Jensen Huang breaks down the US-China AI competition into what he calls a ""five-layer cake."" As shared by an X user, Huang points at five critical vulnerabilities that US may face in the AI race. Other than the public sentiment (shared above), these included: energy, chips, infrastructure, and models.China, the user writes with twice as much energy as the US, makes “no sense” to Huang. “Twice as much energy as we have as a nation.And they’re – our economy’s larger than theirs. It makes no sense to me,” he said, adding “without energy how do we build chip plants, computer system plants, and these AI datacenters? We call them AI factories.”Second critical aspect of winning AI race, as per Jensen Huang, is chips which he says is that the US is “generations ahead”.“Number three, infrastructure. If you want to build a datacenter here in the United States, from breaking ground to standing up an AI supercomputer is probably about three years. They can build a hospital in a weekend. That’s a real challenge,” Huang stated in the interview.Another ‘layer’ Huang highlighted is the AI models which he said are “unquestionably world class” in the US. “We are probably six months ahead,” but China is ahead of the US on open source models.“China is well ahead – way ahead on open source. Now, the reason why open source is so important is because without open source, startups can’t thrive, university researchers can’t do research, you can’t teach AI, scientists can’t use AI,” Huang said.","Jensen Huang: US is ‘generationg ahead’ of China in chips and AI.

He criticizes circular financing deals inflating valuations and predicts worsening market conditions. Ghodsi remains optimistic about AI agents, noting their significant use in database creation on Databricks, but sees revenue potential in applications, not commoditized foundation models.

Databricks CEO says circular financing deals inflate valuations artificially

Private company status are shielding companies from market volatility, argues Ghodsi





The CEO of $134 billion software analytics firm Databricks has issued a stark warning about the artificial intelligence industry, calling out companies valued at billions of dollars despite having zero revenue. Speaking at Fortune Brainstorm AI in San Francisco, Ali Ghodsi warned that ""companies that are worth, you know, billions of dollars with zero revenue, that's clearly a bubble, right, and it's, like, insane.""Ghodsi, who holds a PhD in computer science, said the mood in Silicon Valley has soured significantly. He claimed that even venture capitalists funding the AI frenzy privately acknowledge the market's unsustainable nature, with some telling him they should ""just go on a break for, like, six months and come back and it'll be, like, really financially good for me.""The Databricks CEO criticized the circular financing arrangements, saying these types of deals are running afloat across the AI industry, where money flows between the same group of companies in complex loops. While Ghodsi didn't name specific firms, OpenAI exemplifies this trend through its intricate web of deals worth over $1 trillion.OpenAI's arrangements include receiving $13 billion from Microsoft before spending most of it back on Microsoft's cloud computing services, securing $350 million in CoreWeave stock while committing $22 billion to the company for computing power, and signing a $300 billion deal with Oracle to build data centers that OpenAI will then pay roughly the same amount to use.Most recently, OpenAI obtained a 10% stake in AMD for chips and partnered with investment firm Thrive Holdings, whose parent company Thrive Capital is ironically one of OpenAI's major investors.Rather than viewing the bubble as near its bursting point, Ghodsi predicts conditions will worsen before they improve. ""I think like 12 months from now, it'll be much, much, much worse,"" he said, though he added that current market wobbles represent a healthy signal for CEOs to reassess their strategies.Ghodsi's skepticism about the AI hype cycle explains Databricks' reluctance to pursue an initial public offering despite ""flirting"" with the idea. He contrasted his company's approach with competitors who rushed to go public during the 2021 boom, only to face severe corrections by 2022 that forced cost-cutting measures. Meanwhile, Databricks hired thousands of employees during that period.Despite his warnings, Ghodsi remained bullish on specific AI applications, particularly AI agents. The CEO tells that over 80% of databases launching on Databricks are now being created by AI agents rather than humans. Although, he argues the real revenue potential lies in the application layer where agents perform specific tasks, rather than in foundation models which he believes are becoming commoditized with low margins due to intense competition.","Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi warns of an AI bubble, highlighting companies with billions in valuation but no revenue.

Elon Musk has once again called Bill Gates a ‘liar’. This time he was responding to an X user’s post which said that anyone believing ""USAID cuts led to deaths,"" is too stupid, referring to the Microsoft founder's previous remarks when he raised alarms on United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funding. “Anyone believing those ""USAID cuts led to deaths,"" stories is too stupid to function. Although the obvious question, if it were true: Why didn't left wing billionaires fill the shortfall? Why is it the moral duty of working Americans to fund Africa's population growth?,” the X user wrote in the post.Elon Musk replied to the post calling the narrative “completely false”. He said: “Bill Gates is pushing this lie, despite having over $80 billion dollars in his NGO that he could easily spend to save these alleged lives that are being lost.”“Why doesn’t he?,” he asked, adding “Bill Gates is a liar. Always has been.”Earlier this year in May, Gates criticized Elon Musk for killing the poor children by cutting down foreign aid funding that could lead to an increase in the cases of measles, HIV, and polio and more. In an interview with the Financial Times, Gates said “The picture of the world’s richest man killing the world’s poorest children is not a pretty one”.Musk was then leading the department of government efficiency (DOGE) – Trump’s administration task force aimed to cut down federal expenditure. In February, the agency effectively shut down USAID, calling it “a criminal organisation” and stating it was “time for it to die”.In the FT interview, Bill Gates also alleged that the tech billionaire has cancelled grants to hospital in Gaza Province Mozambique, which prevented transmission of HIV. “I’d love for him to go in and meet the children that have now been infected with HIV because he cut that money,” said Gates.Replying to one such online clip of Gates from the interview, Musk then wrote on X “Gates is a huge liar”. In another post, the world’s richest billionaire wrote “The real reason Bill Gates is unhappy is that HIS organisation isn’t getting billions in US taxpayer money anymore.”","Elon Musk has once again called Bill Gates a 'liar' This time he was responding to an X user’s post which said that anyone believing ""USAID cuts led to deaths,"" is too stupid.

He emphasizes that while AI is a powerful assistant, developers absolutely need to grasp the code's intricacies. Ignoring this can lead to shaky foundations for sophisticated applications, despite AI's growing presence in coding.

Big Tech's $70 Billion AI Move: Silicon Valley Bets On India, Snubs Trump's 'America First' Diktat

Even AI coding pioneers admit the approach has serious limitations

Cursor 's rapid growth reflects hunger for AI tools despite productivity questions





The CEO of one of Silicon Valley's hottest AI coding startups is issuing a stark warning: developers who blindly trust AI to write their software are building on shaky ground. Michael Truell, the 25-year-old CEO of Cursor—a $29.3 billion AI coding assistant used by over one million developers daily—told Fortune's Brainstorm AI conference that ""vibe coding"" may work for quick prototypes but creates unstable foundations for serious applications. ""If you close your eyes and don't look at the code and have AIs build things with shaky foundations, as you add another floor, and another floor, things start to kind of crumble,"" Truell explained. He compares the hands-off approach to constructing a house without understanding the electrical wiring or plumbing. He adds that it might look fine initially, but structural problems inevitably emerge as complexity grows.Truell's concerns come as AI is transforming software development across the industry. Google CEO Sundar Pichai revealed AI now writes over 30% of new code at Google, up from 25% just months earlier, while Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei claimed Claude generates 90% of his company's code. But Truell drew a clear line between AI-assisted coding—where developers remain engaged and understand what's being built—and vibe coding, where programmers essentially outsource everything to AI without reviewing or comprehending the output.Truell isn't alone in his skepticism. Boris Cherny, who created Anthropic's Claude Code, acknowledged vibe coding works well for ""throwaway code and prototypes"" but fails when developers need ""maintainable code"" where they must be ""thoughtful about every line."" Andrej Karpathy, the former Tesla AI director who actually coined the term ""vibe coding"" earlier this year, recently admitted the method proved useless for his Nanochat project, which he wrote entirely by hand because AI agents ""just didn't work well enough. ""The reality on the ground supports these concerns. Research from METR found AI coding assistants actually decreased experienced developers' productivity by 19%—despite participants expecting a significant boost. Consultancy Bain & Company separately reported that programming delivered ""unremarkable"" cost savings despite being among the first fields to embrace generative AI.Truell positioned Cursor as striking the right balance—embedding AI into developers' working environments to predict code and handle routine tasks while keeping programmers actively involved in understanding what's generated. ""In the places where you want to take a step back and ask the AI to do something end-to-end, you can do that too,"" he said, emphasizing developers still need visibility into the code being created.The market has responded enthusiastically. Founded by four MIT graduates in 2022, Cursor secured $8 million from OpenAI's Startup Fund in 2023 before recently closing a massive $2.3 billion funding round. The company now employs 300 people and generates $1 billion in annualized revenue. But Truell's message remains cautionary: AI coding offers tremendous power, yet treating it as a black box that magically produces working software is a recipe for disaster as applications scale and evolve.","The CEO of AI coding startup Cursor is sounding the alarm about relying too heavily on AI for software development.

Elon Musk Can ‘CRY’, But He Will Still Pay $140,000,000 X Fine: EU Adamant After Hitler Attack





China seems to be working hard to compete with Elon Musk ’s SpaceX . The country is reportedly seeking ways to advance its reusable rocket capabilities through new regulations that would help its commercial space companies access public markets. According to a Reuters report, the Shanghai Stock Exchange recently announced that Chinese companies developing reusable rockets will be able to access a fast lane for initial public offerings on the tech-heavy STAR market with exemptions from traditional financial requirements that typically barred unprofitable startups from listing. These new guidelines, which expand on rules introduced in June for pre-profit innovative companies, waive profitability and revenue requirements for rocket companies.Instead of meeting profitability and minimum revenue thresholds, these rocket companies will only need to demonstrate they've achieved key technological milestones, the Reuters report adds. This includes at least one successful orbital launch using reusable rocket technology. The move reflects Beijing's effort to close the gap with the US-based SpaceX, which currently dominates the capability to return, recover, and reuse rocket boosters after launch.This technology has made SpaceX a cost-effective global launch provider.Currently, SpaceX dominates the reusable rocket technology. The Elon Musk-owned rocket company’s Falcon 9 is the only reusable rocket regularly launched and used to put satellites into orbit.Earlier this month, Chinese private rocket firm LandSpace became the first domestic company to conduct a full reusable rocket test with the launch of its new Zhuque-3 model, signalling its intention to compete with SpaceX, Reuters noted.While the launch failed to complete the critical step of recovering the rocket's booster, multiple Chinese state-owned and private companies are now working to test launch their own reusable rockets.LandSpace reportedly plans to demonstrate successful rocket recovery in mid-2026, when Zhuque-3 will be launched for a second time. However, the company has noted that the capital-intensive nature of rocket development means it will need access to China's capital markets to compete with SpaceX.The Shanghai exchange's rules do not require that rocket companies successfully recover a rocket, only that reusable rocket technology be used to put a satellite into orbit. This is something LandSpace has already achieved with this month's launch.Chinese rocket companies undertaking national missions or participating in major state-led space projects will receive priority support, according to the new guidelines seen by Reuters. These new guidelines are set to take effect immediately, which highlights the close alignment between commercial launch activity and China's broader strategic objectives.China has repeatedly characterised SpaceX's position in low-Earth orbit as a national security risk and is actively developing its own satellite constellations, which it aims to expand to tens of thousands over the coming decades.",China is reportedly seeking ways to advance its reusable rocket capabilities.

Amazon Announces Landmark $35B Investment In India To Drive Digital Transformation

California’s wealth tax proposal







Florida governor Ron DeSantis has said that the fiscal outlook of the Washington state’s took a major hit after Amazon founder Jeff Bezos relocated from the state to Florida in late 2023. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) DeSantis argued that Washington had ‘lost its biggest taxpayer’ and that the move by the billionaire had a ‘major impact’ on the state’s budget. Bezos moved into his so-called ‘billionaire buyer’ located non the Indian Creek Village community outside Miami in 2004. Some online reports suggested that his relocation helped Bezos save around $1 billion on taxes, a substantial figure compared to Washington’s annual revenue of $66.39 billion between 2023 and 2025.DeSantis has linked the departure of Bezos to Washington’s plans fro a new state income tax on millionaires calling the policy ‘counterproductive’. He believes that states without income tax such as Florida gain a ‘major advantage’ over the ones that impose such taxes. “Washington has already driven taxpayers out due to bad policies. Enacting an income tax would be counterproductive — states with no income tax have a major advantage over states that do. The inevitable result is that some taxpayers will flee, the appetite for spending will continue, and the income tax will expand to hit people with sub-seven figure incomes.This will further erode the economic base — and the cycle will keep repeating.,” DeSantis wrote, warning that more residents would flee if the tax base continued to expand.DeSantis’ remarks come as California considers a similar measure, the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act, which would impose a one-time 5% levy on residents with a net worth above $1 billion. The proposal includes strict penalties for understating wealth and measures to prevent evasion among California’s roughly 200 billionaires.As reported by New York Times, venture capitalist Pete Theil and Google co-founder Larry Page are thinking of cutting down and reducing their ties to the state before the end of the year. The reason behind this decision is a proposed ballot measure that would impose 5% tax on residents worth more than $1 billion. The initiative is backed by the health care union SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, could raise up to $100 billion from about 200 billionaires is approved. If passed, it would retroactively apply to anyone who lived in California as of January 1, 2026. Larry Page, whose net worth is estimated at $258 billion, the tax could mean a one-time bill of more than $12 billion. On the other hand, for Peter Thiel, worth around $27.5 billion, the liability could exceed $1.2 billion.","Florida governor Ron DeSantis has said that the fiscal outlook of the Washington state’s took a major hit after Amazon founder Jeff Bezos relocated from the state to Florida in late 2023.

Microsoft sees the ‘India Opportunity’ in AI public infrastructure

India is entering a pivotal moment in its AI journey, one defined by how deeply intelligence is being embedded into everyday work and public life. AI is moving beyond experimentation and becoming a foundational capability for enterprises, governments, and people building new skills for the future.

At Microsoft, we focus on pairing innovation with responsibility by investing in the infrastructure needed to run AI at scale and in the people who can apply it well. That is why we have committed US$17.5 billion over the next four years to expand cloud and AI infrastructure in India, and why we are doubling our skilling commitment to equip 20 million people with AI skills by 2030.

Looking ahead to 2026, we will see a clear shift in how organizations adopt AI. Agents will increasingly work alongside people, taking on routine tasks, surfacing insights, and helping teams focus on higher value work. Together, Microsoft and India are now positioned to drive the next phase, moving from digital public infrastructure toward AI public infrastructure, where platforms like e-Shram help connect millions to opportunity and solutions like MahaCrimeOS AI support faster, more effective responses to cybercrime. With its talent depth and ambition, India can help define how AI delivers real, inclusive impact. Rajiv Kumar, President and Managing Director, Microsoft IDC

Cisco leaders say 2026 will be all about Connected Intelligence and Hybrid Workforce

Aruna Ravichandran

, SVP & CMO, AI, Networking & Collaboration

By 2026, the workplace won't evolve through more apps or

digital

assistants, but through Connected Intelligence-where people, data, and digital workers (AI agents) work together side by side. In this new era, collaboration happens without friction. Digital workers anticipate needs, coordinate tasks in the background, and resolve issues before they surface. Work flows naturally across teams, platforms, and time zones, allowing employees to focus on higher-value work instead of managing tools and handoffs.

Connected Intelligence removes the limits of geography and individual capacity. Knowledge and expertise move instantly to where they're needed. Digital workers surface insights in context, automate workflows quietly, and keep work moving forward-without interrupting human creativity or decision-making.

The organizations that lead in 2026 will embrace open, interoperable ecosystems built on trust. By unifying secure connectivity with intuitive, embedded AI, they will create workplaces where people and digital workers operate as one-unlocking new levels of agility, creativity, and performance.

The result: collaboration becomes a strategic advantage, complexity fades into the background, and work finally moves at the speed of ideas

By 2026, the Enterprise Network Becomes Autonomous: Agents Run It, Platforms

Win It

, and Openness Fuels It.

By 2026, workplace networking across campus, branch, and Industrial IoT will cross a structural tipping point: the network will stop being an object that IT operates and become a system that operates itself.

First, AI agents will replace traditional AIOps as the dominant operating model.

What began as AI-assisted troubleshooting will evolve into AgenticOps—digital workers that autonomously manage the full network lifecycle. These agents will detect anomalies, correlate root causes, enforce intent, remediate issues, and continuously optimize performance in closed-loop fashion. Humans will no longer “run” the network day to day; instead, they will supervise policy, risk boundaries, and business intent. In industrial and mission-critical environments, this shift is not optional—scale, uptime, and safety requirements demand autonomous execution with human guardrails.

As AI agents operate across domains, closed systems become friction points. The network will increasingly expose open APIs, telemetry models, and extensibility frameworks that allow agents to reason and act across vendors, domains, and environments. Openness will not be ideological—it will be practical. Agents cannot be effective inside silos, and customers will demand ecosystems that allow interoperability across campus, WAN, security, cloud, and OT.

In a world of autonomous operations, the value shifts away from individual devices toward the platform that orchestrates outcomes. Winning platforms will unify management, observability, security, automation, and AI agents into a single control plane spanning IT and OT. Enterprises will choose vendors that deliver business outcomes—resilience, experience, security, and efficiency—not those that simply offer faster hardware or better point tools.

Factories, logistics hubs, utilities, and campuses are converging IT, OT, Wi-Fi, private 5G, and edge compute. This convergence dramatically increases operational complexity while reducing tolerance for downtime or human error. Industrial environments will be the proving ground where AgenticOps, open ecosystems, and platform-centric networking are no longer aspirational—but essential.

The Workplace Will Be a True Partnership Between People and Technology

By 2026, the workplace is going to look and feel very different from what we’re used to.

The workplace will be about people working side by side with technology. That means you’ll see more “agents” (think AI helpers and robots) assisting with tasks, not necessarily looking like something out of science fiction, but integrated into our day-to-day routines. The line between human and digital collaboration will blur, and the companies that do this well will be the ones that figure out how to bring people and technology together in smart, meaningful ways.

We’re used to talking about closing the distance between people, but by 2026, we’ll also be closing the gap between people and AI, and even between different AIs. We’ll start to rely more on AI coworkers, or specialists that can handle everything from summarizing meetings to translating languages and even offering expert recommendations. On top of that, different AI agents will be working together behind the scenes, monitoring each other and collaborating to solve problems faster. The future of work is about “connected intelligence,” where humans and AIs all contribute as part of the same team.

With all this new technology in the workplace, security challenges are only going to get more complex. The old model of just protecting the edges of your network isn’t enough. By 2026, companies will need to take a more “fused” approach to security, where protections are built-in at every layer, from the edge to the cloud to the core. As AI is woven into everything, we’ll need smarter, more adaptive security that can keep up with new threats, and we’ll have to think about how security and network management work together, not in silos.

A lot of organizations still treat AI like one big, complicated stew where everything is mixed together, hard to manage, and even harder to get value from. By 2026, the best companies will take a different approach: they’ll “disaggregate” their AI, breaking it up into clear, manageable pieces that can be tailored for their specific needs (like collaboration, security, or customer experience). This isn’t a one-size-fits-all thing; every industry, whether it’s healthcare, finance, or manufacturing, will need its own recipe.

That’s how companies will unlock real value and stay agile as AI evolves.

Anand Mahurkar

, CEO of Findability Sciences

In 2026, the biggest shift will be from ‘AI that talks’ to ‘AI that does.’ Enterprises will move beyond chatbots and pilots into agentic systems that can reason over company knowledge, orchestrate workflows, and execute decisions with human guardrails.

The winners will be organizations that treat findability of data as a strategic asset unifying structured data, documents, emails, and domain expertise into a governed knowledge layer that AI can reliably retrieve, cite, and act on.

We’ll also see a clear split between generic models and domain-specific intelligence. Smaller, specialized models fine-tuned on proprietary data and reinforced with knowledge graphs and hybrid search will outperform bigger models on accuracy, cost, and compliance. Multimodal AI will become mainstream, turning images, audio, and video into searchable, actionable knowledge, while real-time analytics will drive next-best actions in sales, service, and operations.

In India especially, the next wave will be enterprise AI in vernacular and sector-specific contexts like sugar manufacturing, co-operative sector, agriculture, manufacturing, legal where ROI is tied to speed, precision, and governance, not novelty. The workforce impact will be ‘human + AI’ teams, with copilots embedded in everyday tools and measurable productivity gains.

Finally, trust will be the currency of adoption. With stricter regulation, deeper scrutiny of data privacy, and rising expectations for transparency, leaders will invest in AI governance, observability, and explainability as seriously as they invest in model performance.

The most valuable AI in 2026 won’t be the most impressive demo, it will be the most dependable system delivering measurable outcomes at scale.

Ken Exner, Chief Product Officer at Elastic, The Search AI Company:

The growth and reliability of agentic AI will hinge on accurate context engineering, which ensures AI systems access and utilize the right data at the right time. In 2026, context engineering will become critical as enterprises struggle with scattered data across unstructured sources like documents, emails, apps, and customer feedback. Effective agentic AI requires relevant data inputs to deliver accurate responses. Many failures in AI development trace back to the inability to provide relevant context for applications. Context engineering addresses this challenge by facilitating precise data retrieval, governance, and orchestration, enabling agents to seamlessly identify, retrieve, and process owned data. There are a limited number of platforms offering comprehensive context engineering capabilities at this time. Demand for such solutions will rise sharply in the next year. Businesses will increasingly seek AI platforms that integrate context engineering at their core, boosting the adoption of contextually aware and reliable AI systems.

AI: Trust, Sovereignty and Resilience

Vijender Yadav, CEO & Co-founder, Accops

In 2025, we anchored our innovation around two non-negotiables for regulated enterprises - data sovereignty and infrastructure independence. As cyber risks intensified alongside vendor volatility, it became clear that secure access could no longer be tied to a single cloud or platform. We responded by building a sovereign virtualisation stack that decouples digital workspaces from underlying infrastructure, allowing CIOs to repatriate workloads to agile, cost-effective environments without compromising security or regulatory compliance.

Our security architecture evolved from static controls to continuous trust. By embedding adaptive risk assessment directly into the access gateway—validating user authenticity, device hygiene, and real-time context—we transformed access into an ongoing negotiation of trust while maintaining forensic integrity and operational efficiency. At the same time, we integrated quantum-resilient encryption and zero code exposure frameworks to future-proof critical environments against emerging threats, including post-quantum risks.

The key lesson from 2025 was that fragmented security stacks and checklist-based compliance are no longer viable. Enterprises recognised the need for platform-agnostic, crypto-agile architectures that ensure absolute data residency while enabling hybrid work at scale. Looking ahead to 2026, our focus is on delivering governance-first digital workspaces that eliminate vendor lock-in, enforce strict data control, and give highly regulated industries the agility they need without ceding sovereignty.

Dhiraj Gupta, CTO & Co-founder, mFilterIt :

2025 marked a clear inflection point for digital advertising. Fraud and media quality risks no longer looked abnormal—they increasingly resembled genuine user behaviour, making traditional metrics like clicks, impressions, and even basic viewability insufficient. This is why our focus was on building deep, full-funnel visibility—tracking users from first exposure through conversion, validating intent, attention, and outcomes, and using AI-ML to proactively make optimizing decisions with transparency and confidence.

By combining event-level intelligence, behavioural analysis, and self-learning algorithms, we enabled brands to block low-quality and fraudulent traffic early, protect brand safety across automated environments, and optimize campaigns based on what truly drove value. The broader industry takeaway is clear: brands that prioritised transparency, independent validation, and AI-led intelligence were better equipped to navigate uneven performance, identify gaps in traffic quality, and increasingly sophisticated threats.

In 2026, our focus is on advancing this foundation—deepening AI to move from detection to prediction, expanding validation across the entire digital lifecycle from exposure to post-conversion outcomes, scaling these capabilities across global markets such as the USA and MENA, and addressing emerging risks like AI-generated fraud, synthetic engagement, and deepfake-driven brand misuse—so brands can operate with greater foresight, confidence, and control in an increasingly complex digital ecosystem.





We’ll soon turn our calendars to 2026, looking back at the global technology landscape that underwent a profound structural shift in 2025. Artificial Intelligence (AI) became affordable, came into people’s hands in a better and faster avatar on phones and PCs, evolving from text-based one-on-one interactions to taking actions, managing tasks and start to operate autonomously across business workflows in the form of AI agents. The next year is expected to bring a radical change with AI slowly becoming the underlining technology in all industries – whether its robotics or consumer technology products.Tech giants believe that the year of “assistive AI” will give way to an age of Agentic AI and Connected Intelligence, and 2026 will be the year when technology stops being a tool that humans operate and starts becoming a partner that operates alongside them. The most significant transition in 2026, according to industry leaders, is the move from “AI that talks” to “AI that does.” The technology of 2026 is no longer about novelty or “impressive demos” but it will be about dependable, autonomous systems that deliver measurable outcomes at scale. Some believe that in 2026, the most valuable AI is the one that stays in the background, ensuring the world simply works.According to Rajiv Kumar , President and Managing Director, Microsoft IDC, India stands at the centre of AI transformation.Leveraging billions of investments, India is set to define how AI becomes the foundational capability of systems.Work in 2026 will be defined by Connected Intelligence and successful companies will break down complex “AI stews” into manageable, domain-specific pieces tailored for specific industries like healthcare or finance., notes that enterprises are moving into agentic systems capable of reasoning over company knowledge.As AI becomes the “operating layer” of the enterprise, trust has become the primary currency.

According to a report by the New York Times, venture capitalist Pete Theil and Google co-founder Larry Page are allegedly thinking of cutting down their ties to the state before the end of the year.The proposal to introduce a “wealth tax” has received criticism from founders and billionaires. Palmer Luckey, cofounder of Anduril, recently said the tax will force “founders like me to sell huge chunks of our companies"" to pay for what he described as ""fraud, waste and political favors for the organizations pushing this ballot initiative.”“I made my money from my first company, paid hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes on it, used the remainder to start a second company that employs six thousand people and now me and my cofounders have to somehow come up with billions of dollars in cash,"" Luckey wrote in an X post.Echoing the same concerns, billionaire investor Bill Ackman said California is “on a path to self-destruction” if the measure moves forward.In an X post, Ackman wrote: “Hollywood is already toast and now the most productive entrepreneurs will leave, taking their tax revenues and job creation elsewhere”.Even California Governor Gavin Newsom has opposed the bill.

The space company announced the appointment in a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter). As president of the new group, Bruno will lead work focused on products, services and technologies for national security missions, according to an internal email from Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp, seen by Bloomberg.In a statement, Limp said Blue Origin and Bruno share a common goal of supporting national security through advanced technology, adding that Bruno’s experience will help the company move faster in this area.The move signals Blue Origin’s growing focus on national security work. The company is one of a small group of US launch providers, along with SpaceX and ULA, that are approved to launch sensitive national security satellites for the US military.Bruno’s departure from ULA was announced on December 22. He led the Boeing and Lockheed Martin joint venture for nearly 12 years. During his time at ULA, Bruno oversaw the retirement of the Delta and Atlas rockets and led the development of the Vulcan rocket.Vulcan faced multiple delays and has had a slow launch schedule since its first flight in January 2024.Blue Origin supplies the BE-4 engines used on Vulcan and also competes directly with ULA through its own New Glenn rocket. Bruno previously worked with Blue Origin in 2014 on the partnership to develop the BE-4 engines.Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket, which is planned for future national security missions, completed its second launch in November.

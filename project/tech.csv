After what Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita described as ""tricky"" negotiations, both sides have reached an agreement.As part of the deal, Apple will invest in a software research and development center near Jakarta and establish manufacturing facilities to produce components for its products, including AirTags and AirPods. Reports indicate Apple will invest approximately $1 billion overall, with up to 20% of global AirTag production eventually taking place in Indonesia.""There's a principle of justness that we're trying to uphold,"" Kartasasmita said at a press conference. ""As much as it can add value to the red and white,"" he added, referencing the Indonesian flag.The agreement represents a partial retreat by Indonesian authorities, who had initially pressed Apple to manufacture iPhones locally. Instead, Apple will focus on producing accessories and investing in local talent development through training programs and coding academies.The ban had blocked Apple from selling its latest smartphones in a market of approximately 280 million people, though the company was already struggling to gain traction there. According to research firm Canalys, Apple wasn't among the top five smartphone brands in Indonesia during the third quarter of 2024, trailing Oppo, Xiaomi, Transsion, Samsung, and Vivo.No specific timeline was given for when the iPhone 16 will officially return to Indonesian stores, but the minister indicated Apple is now in the process of obtaining the necessary local content certification.","Indonesia will soon lift its ban on the iPhone 16, ending a months-long standoff with Apple.

Amazon unveiled Alexa+, its long-awaited AI-powered voice assistant, on Wednesday after more than a year of delays. The upgraded assistant will be available in the coming weeks in the US, and Prime members can have it for free or others can pay $19.99 monthly for it.The new assistant represents a complete redesign, transforming Alexa from a simple command-response tool into a conversational AI agent capable of autonomously completing complex tasks. Alexa+ can make restaurant reservations, order groceries, control smart home devices , and navigate web services with minimal user supervision.""Until this moment – right this moment — we have been limited by the technology,"" said Panos Panay, Amazon's SVP of Devices & Services, during the New York launch event.Originally announced in September 2023, Alexa+ faced significant development hurdles that pushed its release from early 2024 to now. Internal testing reportedly revealed problems with accuracy and functionality that required extensive revisions.The assistant combines multiple AI models, including Amazon's Nova model and others from companies like Anthropic. It integrates with numerous third-party services such as OpenTable, Spotify, Grubhub, Uber Eats, and Ticketmaster.Amazon will begin rolling out early access next month, prioritizing Echo Show 8, 10, 15, and 21 device owners. The assistant will be accessible through compatible Echo devices , a new mobile app, and a browser-based experience at Alexa.com.The Alexa+ positions Amazon against competitive AI offerings including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Apple's forthcoming Siri improvements, but it has an advantage here – about 600 million Alexa devices already in homes, and Amazon hopes this upgrade will revitalize its consumer electronics division, which has reportedly struggled to generate significant revenue despite widespread adoption.","Alexa+ can make restaurant reservations, order groceries, control smart home devices and navigate web services with minimal user supervision.

Telegram’s transparency report: Australian law enforcement requests

Telegram fulfilled 14 requests from Australian authorities.

These requests affected 23 users and involved IP addresses and/or phone number data.

Meta, WhatsApp, Google, and Reddit under review

Encrypted messaging platform Telegram has been fined nearly $1 million (AUD 957,780) by Australia’s eSafety Commission for failing to respond in time to questions regarding its measures to combat terrorism and child abuse material on its platform. The Australian regulator had issued an information request in May 2024, requiring Telegram to report back by October 2024 on steps taken to tackle terrorist content and child exploitation material. However, Telegram took 160 days to respond, significantly obstructing the regulator's ability to assess online safety risks.The fine marks a significant move by Australia’s online safety regulator, which has been tightening its scrutiny of tech platforms to ensure compliance with the Online Safety Act . The penalty comes amid growing global concerns over the misuse of encrypted platforms for criminal activities, as well as increasing regulatory pressure on technology companies to cooperate with law enforcement.The Australian eSafety Commission issued infringement notices to multiple companies, including Telegram, Meta, WhatsApp, Google, and Reddit, in May 2024. These notices sought detailed information on how these platforms were handling violent extremist material and child sexual abuse content.Telegram failed to respond within the mandatory timeline, delaying its submission by nearly five months (160 days). As a result, the eSafety Commission imposed a fine of AUD 957,780 under the provisions of the Online Safety Act.eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability from tech companies.she said in a statement.She further criticized Telegram’s delayed response, stating that it had hindered the eSafety Commission's ability to fulfill its role under the Online Safety Act for almost half a year.Telegram has 28 days to either:A spokesperson for Telegram described the fine as ""unfair and disproportionate"", indicating that the company intends to appeal the decision.If Telegram fails to comply, the eSafety Commission may escalate the case by:In a joint statement issued in 2024, intelligence agencies from the Five Eyes Alliance (United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) highlighted Telegram as a platform where young people were accessing extremist propaganda videos.Australian authorities have expressed concerns that radicalizing content on encrypted messaging platforms could lead to violence, terrorism, and other online harms.said Julie Inman Grant.Telegram's regulatory challenges have intensified since its CEO, Pavel Durov, was arrested in France in August 2024 on charges related to failing to curb terrorist and extremist content.Durov was released on bail but remains banned from leaving France until the case is heard. Reports indicate that the legal proceedings could take up to a year before reaching a verdict.Since Durov’s arrest, Telegram has been making efforts to be more transparent, including releasing annual reports on law enforcement requests.Following the increased scrutiny, Telegram recently released its 2024 transparency report, which provided insight into its cooperation with law enforcement agencies.According to the report, in 2024:Despite these measures, the eSafety Commission remains concerned about Telegram’s overall compliance and response times when addressing online safety concerns.Telegram is not the only platform under scrutiny. The eSafety Commission is also set to release a report in March 2025 detailing how companies such as Meta, WhatsApp, Google, and Reddit have responded to online safety concerns.In a separate but related development, tech billionaire Elon Musk’s social media platform X (formerly Twitter) was also issued a notice to disclose its actions against terrorist content.Unlike Telegram, X appealed the notice to Australia’s Administrative Review Tribunal, with the case still ongoing. Additionally, X was fined over AUD 610,000 for failing to adequately respond to previous regulatory notices. The company is currently involved in multiple lawsuits over these fines.","Australia slaps Telegram with $1million fine for delayed child abuse response.

and algo trading is out. What you need to know:

If you’re a retail trader using broker APIs to automate trades, you can do so as long as your order frequency is below an exchange-prescribed threshold. This limit is yet to be decided.

If you’re selling algos or strategies to other traders, you’ll need to partner with a broker and get yourself registered with the exchanges to do so.

Marketplaces, where people share algos for a fee, can’t publish strategies without exchange registration as well as an RA license.

The exchanges will publish their own circulars with operational details by April 1.”

What SEBI’s new algo trading rules say



Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India 's (SEBI) new rules. In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Kamath explained SEBI ’s new regulations concerning algorithmic trading for retail investors, a move that significantly alters market participation. Kamath highlighted that retail traders selling trading strategies or algorithms must now partner with a broker and register with stock exchanges. Furthermore, platforms facilitating the sharing of algorithms for a fee will need both exchange registration and a research analyst (RA) licence.In the X post, Kamath wrote:In the comment section of the post, he also shared the link to an article which explains the latest SEBI algo trading regulations in details.SEBI’s newly announced framework will allow retail investors to engage in algo trading—an opportunity previously limited to institutional players. The move comes in response to rising demand from retail participants and aims to strike a balance between accessibility and risk management.Under the updated regulations, brokers must secure exchange approval for each algorithm and ensure that all automated orders include a unique identifier for audit tracking. Any modifications to an approved algorithm will also require regulatory clearance. Retail investors developing their algorithms will only need to register them if their order execution frequency exceeds a specified threshold.SEBI has categorised algorithms into two types: “white box” algos, where the logic is transparent and replicable, and “black box” algos, which operate without disclosure. Providers of black box algos will be required to obtain a Research Analyst (RA) license and maintain detailed research documentation.Set to take effect on August 1, these new rules are expected to transform India’s algo trading landscape—expanding automation for retail traders while introducing stricter compliance measures to uphold market integrity .","Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India's new rules.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle



Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.

Asmita Patel accused of re-routing money

Securities & Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has seized Rs 53.67 crore from Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd along with five other entities. Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd is a well-known stock market training institute that offers online courses on stocks and trading. Some of the popular courses offered by the self-proclaimed ""options queen"" and ""She Wolf of Stock Market"" are ""Let's Make India Trade"" (LMIT), ""Master's in Price Action Trading"" (MPAT), and ""Options Multiplier"" (OM) .Jayesh Thakkar, a SEBI Registered Research Analyst shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) stating “SEBI has seized Rs 53.67 crore that Asmita Patel and five other related entities made illegally. Asmita Patel is also at risk of losing another Rs 104.6 crore it collected from course fees, which SEBI believes were part of unregistered advisory services.”The investigation was initiated by SEBI after receiving complaints from 42 participants of these courses. In addition to impounding the Rs 53.67 crore, SEBI has issued a show-cause notice questioning why Rs 104.6 crore, collected as fees for various programs, should not also be seized.SEBI has sent an interim order directing the school, Asmita Jitesh Patel, and Jitesh Jethalal Patel to cease offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services. The entities have also been barred from accessing the securities market.The order also uncovered that fees collected from participants were routed through entities such as King Traders (proprietor: Sagar Dhanjibhai), Gemini Enterprise (proprietor: Suresh Parmashivam), and United Enterprises (proprietor: Jigar Rameshbhai Dawada). SEBI stated that this was a regular practice and not an isolated incident, making all six entities jointly and severally liable for the Rs 53.67 crore earned from course fees.The regulator further demanded that the notices explain why they should not be ordered to disgorge Rs 104.6 crore, along with interest. SEBI's order noted that the fees collected for LMIT, MPAT, and OM courses, as well as other programs provided by the school, were earned under the guise of unregistered advisory and research analyst services.The order reads, “The aforesaid amount includes not only the amount collected as fees by the Noticees for LMIT, MPAT and Options Multiplier (OM) courses but also includes the fees collected by the Noticees for the other courses offered by the Noticee no.1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading )through which it carried out unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services along with interest”.Kamlesh Varshney, SEBI's Whole-Time Member, highlighted in the order “Examination revealed that, prima facie, the Noticee no. 1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading) along with the Noticee no.2 (Asmita Jitesh Patel) and the Notice no.3 (Jitesh Jethalal Patel) devised a scheme wherein students/investors/participants were lured to trade in specific stocks and told to open trading account with ABC Ltd. Recommendations of buy/sell of specific securities were provided and uploaded on telegram channels owned by the Noticee no.1.

Former Apple chief designer officer recalls his first task from Steve Jobs: ‘We started work on…what became…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-apple-chief-designer-officer-recalls-his-first-task-from-steve-jobs-we-started-work-onwhat-became/articleshow/118576920.cms,"Representative Image

Former Apple chief designer officer Jony Ive recently appeared on the BBC’s Desert Island Discs podcast where he said that he was given ‘an impossible’ task by founder Steve Jobs the first time they met. Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 when the company was facing financial difficulties. The designer said that at the time, Apple secured a $150 million investment from Microsoft to stay afloat. The company needed a successful product, and Jobs assigned Ive to lead its design.Ive and his team started working on what would become the iMac . He said that personal computers were not common in households at the time, and many people found them difficult to use. The goal was to make the new computer more accessible.""We started work from the first day that we met on what became the iMac,"" the designer said in the podcast.Ive explained that the team carefully considered every detail of the colorful PC lineup to make it more user-friendly. The handle, for instance, was a deliberate design element meant to give the iMac a distinct feature, making it more approachable for those unfamiliar with computers.“It references immediately and unambiguously your hand, and you understand, therefore, something about this object,” he said. Ive noted that features like the handle and translucent colors made the iMac more engaging for consumers than technical specifications like gigahertz and hard drive capacity. ""It felt alive; it didn't static; it didn't feel stuck,"" he said.For those unaware, Apple launched the iMac in 1999 and sold 800,000 units within five months. The product debuted with the tagline “Collect all five.” After the iMac, Ive continued to work on Apple’s major products, including the iPhone and iPad. He eventually became the company’s Chief Design Officer. Apple later moved away from colorful designs, but in 2021, it reintroduced color options for the iMac.

The programme seeks to bring top Indian-origin scientists, technologists, and researchers (NRI/OCI/PIO) to work with Indian academic and R&D institutions on cutting-edge research, fostering knowledge exchange and global best practices.The VAIBHAV Fellowship builds upon the success of the VAIBHAV Summit, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which saw participation from over 25,000 attendees, including members of the Indian STEMM diaspora from more than 70 countries.Implemented by the DST under the Ministry of Science and Technology, the fellowship is open to outstanding scientists of Indian origin engaged in research abroad. Selected fellows will be invited to collaborate with Indian institutions for up to two months per year, for a maximum of three years. The fellowship includes a grant of Rs 4,00,000 per month, along with coverage for international and domestic travel, accommodation, and contingencies.As part of the programme, 75 distinguished fellows will be chosen to contribute to research across 18 pivotal domains, including quantum technology, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, electronics, computer sciences, agriculture, energy, and material sciences, among others.Among the shortlisted candidates is Dr Prateek Sharma, a Professor of Medicine and Director of the GI Fellowship programme at the University of Kansas School of Medicine, who also holds the titles of MD, FASGE, FACP, and FACG. Dr Prateek Sharma also holds the prestigious title of Elaine Blaylock Endowed Professor at the Kansas University Cancer Center. He completed his internal medicine residency at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee and pursued a gastroenterology fellowship at the University of Arizona in Tucson.Dr Prateek Sharma's proposed research focuses on improving the early detection of esophageal and gastric cancers in India using AI-augmented upper GI endoscopy. These cancers are among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the country, and early diagnosis is crucial for improving survival rates. While traditional endoscopy often misses early-stage cases, AI-assisted endoscopy has shown promising results in enhancing detection and outcomes in Western studies.Dr. Sharma, who has played a key role in developing and validating AI-driven endoscopy in the U.S., will guide the implementation of this cutting-edge technology in India, where it is currently unavailable. The project aims to leverage patient health data—including medical records, pathology reports, radiology images, and endoscopic findings—to develop a composite risk score and a digital health tool powered by machine learning algorithms.Building on pilot work already initiated by AIIMS, New Delhi, particularly in diet and nutrition data collection, the research will focus on integrating AI-assisted endoscopy for risk stratification and personalised interventions. The ultimate goal is to enhance patient prognosis, increase treatment success rates, and reduce mortality associated with GI cancers in India. The project’s success is expected to make a significant impact in gastroenterology and oncology, paving the way for AI-driven healthcare solutions and improving cancer care nationwide.","The Department of Science and Technology (DST) has announced the Vaishvik Bhartiya Vaigyanik (VAIBHAV) Fellowship.

Accenture 's analysis highlights emerging competencies that build upon the established R12 (required 12) framework, aimed at creating a workforce ready for future AI developments. ""AI is breaking the code on action and intelligence. Organisations are going to rewire themselves and reinvent themselves. It is a huge opportunity to do that now. Globally, over 50,000 people were trained on the Agentic AI platform , and many of them are based in India,"" said Senthil Ramani, lead – data & AI for Accenture. He spoke to TOI on the sidelines of the Nasscom Technology & Leadership Forum 2025 in Mumbai on Tuesday.Recently, Accenture designed a platform—AI Refinery—to onboard agents to work alongside software professionals. The platform caters to 12 industry sectors to help firms rapidly build and deploy a network of AI agents.Ramani emphasised that it is crucial for companies to structure and arrange their data layer effectively. ""Firms need to engage in dialogue with data. By dialogue with data, I mean that when you are in an enterprise and you really want a business to use many of the AI models you create, it is essential to facilitate effective communication with data. If businesses can effectively dialogue with data, then you have already achieved your purpose because you have diffused AI, and they are already using your models,"" Ramani said.He highlighted roles with additional responsibilities that would be reshaping skills in an AI-first world. He said the role of a data engineer is evolving from primarily building data pipelines for data extraction and cleansing to using Gen AI for data engineering. This includes automating and building data products, using GenAI agents for data quality engineering, and employing AI for data governance.The responsibilities of an AI/ML computational scientist are transforming significantly. Rather than relying solely on traditional AI/ML methodologies for model development and training, the focus has shifted towards utilising GenAI with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This advancement enables professionals to create and deploy Gen AI agents, leading to comprehensive process innovations.The role of an LLM (large language model) architect will now evolve from designing an architecture for LLM model usage to designing an architecture for agents where the parameters of multi-LLM environments and autonomous action will need to be addressed.Full stack developers specialising in LLLMs will broaden their scope beyond creating language models. Their expertise will encompass the development of self-governing systems, where smart agents possess the capability to execute real-time decision-making, demonstrate adaptability and perform independent actions.In response to the rapid strides in AI, the interconnection among different teams has become increasingly vital. AI specialists, data analysts, business professionals, and governance experts function cohesively, moving away from siloed operational approaches.","Senthil Ramani, lead – data & AI for Accenture, spoke to TOI on the sidelines of the Nasscom Technology & Leadership Forum 2025 in Mumbai on Tuesday.

""Not knowing Hindi is often a serious handicap for us in Tamil Nadu,"" Vembu stated, adding that he has personally begun learning Hindi, now understanding about 20% of spoken Hindi after five years of study.Zoho Chief Scientist urged Tamils to set aside political considerations and embrace Hindi learning as a smart business strategy in India's rapidly growing economy. He concluded his message with the same encouragement in both Tamil and Hindi: ""Let us learn Hindi!""Vembu's comments have generated mixed reactions online. Some supporters agreed that Hindi should serve as ""India's common denominator and business language of choice,"" questioning why some prefer English over a native Indian language.One user replied to Vembu, asking why Hindi speakers couldn't learn English instead, with one commenter noting, ""Sir, they can learn English to communicate. But, why are they insisting that we learn Hindi?""Others suggested a more balanced approach, pointing out that ""People should learn language to get ahead. People should also learn Tamil or Kannada if they want good jobs in tech as most of the jobs is in Bengaluru and Chennai.""This isn't the first time Vembu has waded into language debates. In November 2024, he sparked controversy by stating that residents of Bengaluru should learn Kannada, calling it ""disrespectful"" not to learn the local language after living in the city for years. That statement similarly divided online opinion, with some supporting his stance on respecting local languages while others disagreed with his perspective.","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu urges Tamil Nadu's workforce to learn Hindi.

Cognizant is no longer at bottom of stack: CEO Ravi Kumar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/cognizant-is-no-longer-at-bottom-of-stack-ceo-ravi-kumar/articleshow/118574551.cms,"Mumbai: It's now two years since Ravi Kumar took charge as CEO of Cognizant, and some metrics suggest he's pulling the company out of the trough it had fallen into. Kumar said Cognizant has moved to the ‘middle of the stack’ among its peers, after remaining at the bottom - an apparent reference to the company doing better than Capgemini, Wipro and Tech Mahindra in the latest quarter. “I'm not saying I'm going to be in the top three this year, but I've directionally moved up. From the middle of the stack to the top of the stack is harder because now you must compete with performing companies. I have all the machinery aligned to be a market leader, and that's why I feel confident about it,” Kumar said at the Nasscom Technology & Leadership Forum 2025 in Mumbai on Tuesday.Peers like Accenture, TCS and Infosys are continuing to do better than Cognizant, which registered a 2% organic growth in the quarter ended December.In the last two calendar years, the Nasdaq-listed firm experienced a decline in organic revenue. Last year, Cognizant spent $1.7 billion to buy Belcan, a US engineering R&D services firm, and Thirdera, a ServiceNow partner specialising in advisory, implementation, and optimisation solutions. Those acquisitions ensured a positive overall revenue growth in 2024.Kumar said he has improved significantly on the number of large deals signed - in the December quarter, Cognizant signed ten large deals with a total contract value of more than $100 million. He said Cognizant's two core verticals - healthcare and BFSI - are doing better than previously. He also said he has diversified the business, both in terms of industry verticals, and horizontal services, thereby bringing greater resilience to the firm. He said the task of geographic diversification will take longer. Accenture, TCS, Infosys, and Wipro have been far more diversified than Cognizant, which is heavily dependent on healthcare and BFSI, and on the US market.“We're starting to enter a growth phase. We achieved organic year-on-year growth last quarter, and we are guided for organic growth this quarter too. There are places where we are not doing well and areas where it’s work in progress. We have a margin expansion plan. We are no longer a company sitting on the side,” Kumar said.He said Cognizant improved employee utilisation, directly impacting the bottom line. It also implemented AI-driven productivity measures. He said with machines writing 20% of the code, teams can accomplish more tasks with fewer personnel. This, Kumar said, creates an interesting economic scenario known as Jevons Paradox, where increased efficiency in resource usage leads to higher overall demand for that resource. In AI's case, the efficiency it brings is enabling a lot more to be accomplished using AI, thereby increasing its use.Asked about Elon Musk's DOGE initiative and its impact on Belcan, which executes many US federal projects, Kumar said, “There is no impact there. On the government side, they work on defence and submarines. They don't do federal work. I have not seen an impact on spending. But I can't predict what the future is going to be.”","Cognizant registered a 2% organic growth in the quarter ended December.

Influencer claims Ashley St Clair 'planned to baby trap Elon’; Musk responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/influencer-claims-ashley-st-clair-planned-to-baby-trap-elon-musk-responds/articleshow/118572031.cms,"Elon Musk, Ashley 'Text Leak' War: Tesla CEO Reacts To 'Baby Trap' Claims

Elon Musk responds

Ashley St Clair , a 26-year-old influencer, recently claimed that she gave birth to Elon Musk ’s baby and has also filed a paternity suit against the billionaire entrepreneur. While Musk has not publicly confirmed or denied the paternity, he recently reacted to posts discussing the claims. Recently, an influencer named Isabella Moody claimed in an X post that “Ashely planned to baby trap Elon”.“I wasn’t going to post these, but now that @stclairashley has leaked her private signal messages with @elonmusk after lying and saying she “wanted privacy”, here’s more evidence Ashely planned to baby trap Elon. She sent me these text messages in May 2023 when she first met Elon and started sleeping with him,” the influencer wrote in the post.She also shared screenshots of her conversation with Clair from May 2023 where she said things like “I need his rocket babies” and “I need a caption to seduce Elon Musk”.Replying to Moody’s X post, the tech billionaire wrote “Whoa”.Ashley has recently filed two lawsuits against Musk in Manhattan Supreme Court to legally establish him as the child’s father.According to a report by the New York Post, St Clair has also boasted about having Musk “wrapped around her finger” and even suggested that she could influence his social media activity, claiming she could make him “retweet anything.”A source told the news publication that St Clair had distanced herself from friends in an effort to establish a closer relationship with Musk, allegedly aiming to become his “permanent side piece.” The source, who claims to have known St Clair since 2017, described her as someone always seeking opportunities to enhance her public image.“You could never necessarily trust her because you might not be doing what she could monetize or what she could sensationalize in order to make her own star rise,” the source said.According to the source, St Clair has long sought financial security through high-profile relationships. “She’s always kind of wanted to be a kept woman, as far as I can see—she was always chasing that,” they added.The source also questioned her ideological stance, stating, “Movements are never about one individual. She just kind of tagged along with it. I don’t know if she’s even rooted in a conservative type of philosophy. I think it’s just what made her money.”","Ashley St Clair, a 26-year-old influencer, recently claimed that she gave birth to Elon Musk ’s baby and has also filed a paternity suit against the billionaire entrepreneur.

Elon Musk’s DOGE finds 'excess' software licenses in agencies: ‘More of your tax dollars...’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-doge-finds-excess-software-licenses-in-agencies-more-of-your-tax-dollars-/articleshow/118571126.cms,"Elon Musk

What software licenses are under used

This audit was repeated at the

Department of Labor

. Initial results:

– 380 Microsoft 365 licenses with zero users

– 128 Microsoft Teams conference room licenses; only installed in 30 rooms

– 250 VSCode licenses; only using 33

– 129 Photoshop licenses; only using 22.

– 5 cybersecurity licenses, each with > 20k seats; DOL headcount is < 15k

For example, at GSA, with 13,000 employees, there are:

– 37,000 WinZip licenses

– 19,000 training software subscriptions (and multiple parallel training software platforms)

– 7,500 project management software seats for a division with 5,500 employees

– 3 different ticketing systems running in parallel

Fixes are actively in work.

The Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) recently revealed that many federal agencies hold more software licenses than they have employees. This includes excess licenses for Microsoft 365 , 128 Microsoft Teams accounts and Photoshop , among others many of which are either unused or underutilised, prompting reply from Musk himself.Musk’s response came after DOGE gave the example of General Services Administration (GSA). He reshared the post, announcing that more savings..“More of your tax dollars saved!,” he said in a post.“Most of these items are mundane and may not seem like much individually, but there are millions of minor savings that add up to billions of dollars cumulatively. Ultimately, there will be a trillion+ dollars of waste and fraud eliminated,” he added.Agencies often have more software licenses than employees, and the licenses are often idle (i.e. paid for, but not installed on any computer).The social media post followed an agency-wide email this week notifying over 12,000 employees at the General Services Administration (GSA) that a ""reduction in force"" is underway.According to a draft memo obtained by Fox News Digital, acting GSA Administrator Stephen Ehikian expressed gratitude to those who participated in the ""first step"" of staff reduction by resigning on Friday.The memo also outlined the ""next step of this process"" as part of the Presidential Executive Order titled ""Implementing The President's Department of Government Efficiency Workforce Optimization Initiative,"" issued by the White House on February 11, 2025.","Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) recently revealed that many federal agencies hold more software licenses than they have employees.

Facebook-parent Meta faces lawsuit over hiring practices in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebook-parent-meta-faces-lawsuit-over-hiring-practices-in-us/articleshow/118570552.cms,"

What is Meta accused of



Meta denies allegations

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is facing a lawsuit alleging that it prefers hiring foreign workers over American citizens because they can be paid less. A US federal judge, according to Reuters, has ruled that the lawsuit can move forward, allowing three US citizens to pursue a proposed class action against the company. The lawsuit is filed under the case name Rajaram et al v Meta Platforms Inc in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, with case number 22-02920.The lawsuit was filed by three individuals: IT worker Purushothaman Rajaram, software engineer Ekta Bhatia, and data scientist Qun Wang. All three are naturalized US citizens who claim they applied for multiple jobs at Meta between 2020 and 2024 but were rejected due to what they describe as Meta’s ""systematic preference"" for hiring visa holders instead of American workers.US Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco pointed to statistics showing that 15% of Meta’s US workforce holds H-1B visas, which are typically given to foreign professionals, while only 0.5% of the overall workforce in the country has such visas. She also referenced Meta’s 2021 agreement to pay up to $14.25 million, including a fine, to settle US government claims that it routinely ignored American workers for jobs set aside for temporary visa holders.Meta has dismissed the claims as baseless and stated that it will continue to defend itself in court. The company argued that there is no evidence it intended to discriminate or that the plaintiffs would have been hired if they were not US citizens.","A US federal judge ruled that the lawsuit can move forward, allowing three US citizens to pursue a proposed class action against the company.

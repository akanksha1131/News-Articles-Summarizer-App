Microsoft’s middle management is the target in its second largest ever round of layoffs



Microsoft laid off approximately 9,000 employees Wednesday, marking the company's second major workforce reduction this year. The cuts, affecting less than 4% of Microsoft's global workforce, hit the Xbox gaming division particularly hard, with several high-profile game cancellations and studio closures announced alongside the layoffs.The job cuts span multiple teams across geographies and tenure levels as Microsoft seeks to streamline operations and reduce management layers. The company cited ""organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace"" as the primary driver for the workforce reduction.The layoffs eliminated hundreds of positions across Microsoft's gaming subsidiaries, including King (makers of Candy Crush), ZeniMax, Raven Software, Sledgehammer Games, Halo Studios, and Turn 10 Studios. Microsoft also shuttered The Initiative studio and canceled the highly anticipated Perfect Dark reboot and fantasy game Everwild after years of development.Microsoft's Stockholm-based King division is cutting 10% of its workforce, eliminating approximately 200 positions. The Initiative, a premium Xbox studio established to develop AAA exclusives, will close entirely following the Perfect Dark cancellation . Rare Studio's Everwild, in development for several years, was also terminated alongside ZeniMax Online Studios' unannounced project.""To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business,"" Xbox CEO Phil Spencer told employees in an internal memo. The gaming division employed about 20,000 people as of January 2024.The latest cuts represent Microsoft's fourth mass layoff in the gaming division within 18 months, following the company's $69 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition in October 2023. Microsoft previously eliminated 6,000 positions in May, targeting product and engineering roles, plus an additional 300 workers in June.The company cited the need to ""remove layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness"" while redirecting resources toward artificial intelligence development. Microsoft's AI-related expenses reached approximately $80 billion in the last fiscal year as it competes in the generative AI market.“We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” the spokesperson said.Affected employees will receive severance packages including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources, with priority consideration for other positions within Microsoft's broader organization.","Microsoft laid off approximately 9,000 employees Wednesday, marking the company's second major workforce reduction this year.

"Ex-SpaceX technician files lawsuit against Elon Musk's rocket company, alleging racial discrimination",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ex-spacex-technician-files-lawsuit-against-elon-musks-rocket-company-alleging-racial-discrimination/articleshow/122215351.cms,"What did the ex-SpaceX technician’s lawyer say about his termination

A Black technician at SpaceX has filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk 's rocket company, alleging racial discrimination. This lawsuit comes after he was reportedly fired for tardiness while caring for his daughter following a heart transplant. The lawsuit claims white colleagues received preferential treatment for similar attendance issues. In a 33-page federal complaint (seen by The Independent), L’Tavious Rice stated that his bosses at the commercial space company were aware of his daughter's medical condition and had ""encouraged him to take time off as needed."" The lawsuit was initially filed in Los Angeles and moved to federal court last month.Rice's complaint alleges that SpaceX's Human Resources department later began creating problems with his time-off requests. This was allegedly in retaliation for his agreement to testify about a former supervisor accused of wrongdoing in a separate incident, the technician claimed. The former materials inspector at SpaceX's Hawthorne campus has filed a complaint alleging wrongful termination.He claims he was expected to work through lunch without proper breaks and was let go despite having no performance issues. The complaint describes SpaceX’s actions as “deliberate, cold, callous, cruel and intentional.”Rice filed a complaint alleging racial discrimination and retaliation linked to his caregiving responsibilities for his daughter, who underwent a heart transplant. His attorney, Stephanie Perez, told The Independent that the transplant requires “continual monitoring and checkups,” and that Rice continued reporting to work even when his daughter was hospitalised for a week.“He consistently outperformed his white coworkers, but was held to a higher standard,” Perez added. She claims SpaceX overlooked white employees' tardiness or absences by “manipulat[ing] time entries” to remove late clock-ins, leniency that was not shown to Rice.The complaint states Rice, hired in February 2020, “was consistently complimented for his work ethic, outshining his cohort.”After making his supervisors aware of his daughter’s condition, he was told to take time off when needed and logged it in SpaceX’s portal, which uses a point-based penalty system.Later, Rice was interviewed by HR regarding a retaliation complaint against his former supervisor. After stating he believed the supervisor’s actions were retaliatory, the complaint alleges HR began monitoring his time-off and “retaliating,” strictly applying the point system only to him.Rice was terminated in August last year. “SpaceX cited the point system as the basis,” the complaint states.",L’Tavious Rice was fired for tardiness while caring for his daughter following a heart transplant.

Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan may be planning this 'big change' in company's chip manufacturing business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan-may-be-planning-this-big-change-in-companys-chip-manufacturing-business/articleshow/122214957.cms,"Why Intel’s new CEO may not be ‘happy’ with chipmaking process promoted by ex-chief



Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly planning a ‘big change’ to the company's chip manufacturing business to attract major customers. This potential shift deviates from his predecessor's plans and could involve substantial investment. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, two sources familiar with the matter revealed that this new strategy for Intel's foundry business would involve offering outside customers a newer generation of technology. Analysts also reportedly believe that this next-generation chipmaking process would position Intel more competitively against Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) in securing large clients like Apple or Nvidia.After taking over as the company’s new CEO in March, Tan has been reassessing the company's investment in its 18A chip manufacturing process, which was promoted by former CEO Pat Gelsinger .The Reuters report cited sources to claim that Tan has expressed concerns that 18A is not attracting enough external clients and may result in a major financial write-off if Intel stops marketing it to new customers. Intel has already spent billions on developing 18A and its variant, 18A-P.While Intel continues using 18A for in-house chips and select commitments to companies like Amazon and Microsoft , Tan may be shifting focus to the 14A process, the Reuters report claims.Intel believes 14A could offer a stronger competitive position against Taiwan-based rival TSMC, whose N2 and N3 technologies are already in production or close to it, the report adds.As per the Reuters report, Tan is expected to present strategic options to Intel’s board, potentially by this month. However, a final decision may not come until later in the year due to the high stakes involved.Meanwhile, Intel continues restructuring under Tan’s leadership, with steps including new engineering hires and streamlined management. Last year, Intel posted a net loss of $18.8 billion, which was its first unprofitable year since 1986, as it works to regain ground lost in past tech transitions.","Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly planning a ‘big change’ to the company's chip manufacturing business to attract major customers.

How this AI company's CEO has joined the World’s Richest after stock surges 300%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-this-ai-companys-ceo-has-joined-the-worlds-richest-after-stock-surges-300/articleshow/122213067.cms,"Three months after a shaky public debut, CoreWeave Inc. , an AI cloud-computing provider, has seen its stock skyrocket nearly 300% since its March IPO, propelling CEO Michael Intrator into the ranks of the world’s 500 wealthiest individuals. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , Intrator’s net worth has surged to $10.3 billion, ranking him 311th globally, ahead of figures like New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and Blackstone Inc. President Jon Gray.The rapid rise has made CoreWeave one of the top 30 performers on the Nasdaq Composite Index since going public, reflecting a broader hot streak for IPOs in 2025. Newly public companies are posting their strongest debut gains since 2021, creating new billionaires like Circle Internet Group’s Jeremy Allaire and Webull Corp.’s Anquan Wang and Jun Yuan. Intrator’s wealth jump, however, is remarkable for its speed, climbing from $5 billion to $10 billion in just 12 days -- compared to the average of over three years for others on Bloomberg’s wealth index.CoreWeave’s rally has also enriched its co-founders and early investors. Chief Strategy Officer Brian Venturo’s fortune now stands at $6.4 billion, while Chief Development Officer Brannin McBee’s wealth is valued at $4.7 billion. Early backers include billionaire Leslie Wexner, whose trust holds a $2.9 billion stake from a 2019 seed round, and board member Jack Cogen, with shares worth $3.4 billion. Cogen, a former colleague of Intrator and Venturo from Natsource Asset Management, also served as a director at Intrator’s prior venture, Hudson Ridge Asset Management. The surge underscores CoreWeave’s growing prominence in the AI sector and the explosive investor enthusiasm for tech-driven IPOs this year.","CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator's net worth has surged to $10.3 billion, ranking him 311th globally.

Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk , the world’s richest man, has gained unexpected support from Chinese social media users amid his public dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump over Trump’s controversial ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill.’ According to The Guardian, users on China’s Weibo platform have been vocally backing Musk, with the hashtag #MuskWantsToBuildAnAmericaParty going viral on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. The online support highlights Musk’s growing influence and the global resonance of his clash with Trump, as Chinese netizens rally behind the billionaire’s stance.Now Tesla Inc. has reportedly seen its first year-on-year increase in vehicle deliveries from its Shanghai factory this year, signaling a potential turnaround for the electric vehicle giant in China’s fiercely competitive market. The U.S. automaker delivered 71,599 vehicles in June, a modest 0.8% rise compared to the same month last year and a 16% jump from May, according to data released Wednesday by China's Passenger Car Association (PCA).The uptick comes as Tesla navigates an ongoing price war in China, the world’s largest EV market. While the PCA did not specify the split between domestic sales and exports, the growth suggests Tesla is gaining traction.A key factor may be recent regulatory progress, with China unveiling guidelines last month that could accelerate the rollout of Tesla’s advanced driver-assistance features. These enhancements are seen as critical in a market increasingly focused on intelligent vehicle technology, potentially giving Tesla a competitive edge.This milestone marks a positive shift for Tesla as it seeks to strengthen its foothold in China amid intensifying competition and evolving consumer demands.Support messages for Musk Bro flood China's Weibo“Brother Musk, you’ve got over a billion people on our side backing you,” one Weibo user wrote, while another encouraged, “When you’ve had enough, there’s no need to keep putting up with it.” Others speculated on the broader implications of Musk entering politics. “If Elon Musk were to found a political party, his tech-driven mindset could inject fresh energy into politics. The potential for change is significant – and worth watching,” a user commented, highlighting the global intrigue surrounding Musk’s escalating feud with Trump.","Tesla Inc. has reportedly seen its first year-on-year increase in vehicle deliveries from its Shanghai factory this year.

What FACE said about loans approved by fintech companies in India



A report from the Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE), an RBI-recognised Self-Regulatory Organisation in the FinTech Sector (SRO-FT), claims that 66% of the loan value sanctioned by fintech companies in India was directed to customers aged below 35. This highlights fintech's significant reach among younger borrowers. The report, based on credit bureau data from April 2018 to March 2025, provides an overview of fintech's role in India’s personal loan market. It indicates that fintechs are increasing access to formal credit through small-value loans, serving previously unaddressed segments. While fintechs account for 12% of the personal loan market by value, they contribute over 74% of loan volumes. Here are some key highlights from the report:Commenting on the report, Sugandh, CEO of FACE, said: “The report shows assorted offerings across ticket sizes, demographics, and bureau risk profiles make FinTechs the preferred choice for the borrowers. Customised and convenient digital loans bring immense value as millions navigate their economic lives. The RBI ’s Digital Lending Regulations and self-regulatory framework provide the FinTech sector with solid ground and guardrails to drive responsible credit, and market trends attest to this. The reach of FinTechs amongst the young demographic in Tier III and beyond is a key driver of inclusive and resilient economic growth. And with innovation and customer-centricity, FinTechs will continue to deepen and widen their value for borrowers.”","FinTech NBFCs sanctioned 10.9 crore personal loans worth Rs 1,06,548 crore.

Self driving cars to be first commerce use of Nvidia’s robotics technology: Jensen Huang





Redmi Pad 2: Know these Things Before Buying!

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence (AI), the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. Speaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting, Huang said both AI and robotics represent what he believes a “multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity”. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said during the conference. Nvidia’s robotics division has seen fast growth in the past. Currently making up just 1% of Nvidia’s total revenue, the revenue brought in $567 million last quarter – a steep 72% rise from the previous year.“We’re working towards a day where there will be billions of robots, hundreds of millions of autonomous vehicles, and hundreds of thousands of robotic factories that can be powered by Nvidia technology,” Huang said.Huang also emphasized a shift in how the company sees itself. “We stopped thinking of ourselves as a chip company long ago,” he said, adding that Nvidia is now focused on being an “AI infrastructure” and “computing platform” provider.During the annual shareholder meeting, Huang said that Nvidia’s chips will be key not just for AI training, but also for software and hardware use in autonomous vehicles and robots. He named self-driving cars as the first major commercial use of Nvidia’s robotics technology. Nvidia’s Drive platform, a suite of chips and software for autonomous cars, is currently being used by Mercedes-Benz.The chipmaker recently introduced Cosmos, a line of AI models designed for humanoid robots.In a related news, Nvidia has surpassed Microsoft and Apple to become the world’s most valuable company with a market cap of around $3.75 trillion. The company has rebounded strongly since a market dip earlier this year, which was caused by concerns about competition from China’s DeepSeek AI.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that after artificial intelligence, the chipmaker’s next major business opportunity will be robotics. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122088756,imgsize-19028,width-400,resizemode-4/Nvidia-CEO-Jensen-Huang.jpg"

The US Embassy in India has issued a clear warning for visa applicants. “Omitting social media information could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future visas,” the embassy said in a post on microblogging site X (previously known as Twitter). The post reminded visa applicants to disclose all social media usernames or handles they’ve used over the past five years while filling out the DS-160 visa application form. “Visa applicants are required to list all social media usernames or handles of every platform they have used from the last 5 years on the DS-160 visa application form” the post read. “Applicants certify that the information in their visa application is true and correct before they sign and submit.”The requirement is part of broader vetting procedures introduced by the US State Department in recent years. As part of the updated rules, applicants must list IDs used on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and others—even if the accounts are no longer active from the last five years.The move comes days after the US government issued a new guideline for those applying for student and exchange visitor visas. Applicable to all applicants of F, M, and J non-immigrant visas, the new rule requires these applicants to set their social media accounts to public. “Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to public to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States under U.S. law,"" the US embassy in India wrote in an X (formerly Twitter) post.F, M and J visas are the common types of non-immigrant visas issued by the agency to foreign nationals who wish to study or participate in exchange visitor programs in the U.S. F visa is typically used by academic students, the M visa by vocational students, and the J visa by exchange visitors, including researchers, scholars, and interns.In a related news, USCIS has announced that it will switch to a new phone number for sending text (SMS) messages. “Effective July 1, 2025, USCIS will no longer send text (SMS) messages from the phone number 468-311 (GOV-311).

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and other top executives sell over $1 billion in company shares: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-and-other-top-executives-sell-over-1-billion-in-company-shares-report/articleshow/122155830.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sells shares

Other Nvidia executives cash in

Top executives and board members at Nvidia have cashed out more than $1 billion in company stock over the past year, reports Financial Times. As per the report, over $500 million of those sales took place in June alone, as the chipmaker's stock price climbed to a record high, making Nvidia the world’s most valuable company. The report highlights that Nvidia insiders are capitalizing on the market’s enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, which has driven massive investor interest and sent the stock price soaring.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang began selling his shares last week for the first time since September 2024. The company confirmed that his sales were made under a pre-arranged trading plan set in March, which defines the prices and dates for share sales. Such plans are commonly used by executives to avoid allegations of insider trading.Ben Silverman, vice-president of research at VerityData said “When the stock [dropped] in the first quarter, he did not sell, [which was] really smart.”“[Huang] waited for the stock to return to levels that he felt more comfortable selling at,” he added.According to VerityData, his sales began after a required 90-day cooling-off period ended. Under the trading plan, Huang can sell up to 6 million shares before the end of 2025. At current stock prices, that would amount to more than $900 million. Forbes estimates his net worth at $138 billion.According to the Financial Times report, several other top Nvidia figures have also sold large portions of stock. Mark Stevens, a longtime board member and early Nvidia investor, disclosed plans to sell up to 4 million shares on June 2, currently worth around $550 million. He has already sold $288 million worth.Jay Puri, Nvidia’s executive vice-president of worldwide field operations, sold $25 million in stock last week, says FT. Board members Tench Coxe and Brooke Seawell also made sales — Coxe offloaded around $143 million on June 9, and Seawell sold about $48 million in June.These executives, all long-time members of Nvidia’s leadership team, have been with the company since its early days. Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993 inside a Denny’s restaurant in San Jose. Coxe and Seawell, both with venture capital backgrounds, joined the board in the late 1990s.AI boom fuels Nvidia’s stock surgeDespite recent setbacks — including U.S. export controls and advances by Chinese AI startups like DeepSeek — Nvidia’s share price has bounced back. Since hitting a low in April, the company has regained about $1.5 trillion in market value.The company’s market value is not estimated at around $3.8 trillion. The rapid growth reflects strong global demand for the company’s chips, used to power AI systems across industries and governments.","Top executives and board members at Nvidia have cashed out more than $1 billion in company stock over the past year.

Sam Altman's strategic exaggeration backfires

Meta's AI hiring spree continues

Lucas Beyer , one of three OpenAI researchers who recently joined Meta 's superintelligence team, has publicly dismissed reports that Mark Zuckerberg offered him a $100 million signing bonus, calling the claims ""fake news.""“No, we did not get 100M sign-on, that's fake news,” wrote Beyer in his post on X (previously Twitter), announcing this move to Meta with his colleagues.Beyer’s clarification comes after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed on his brother's podcast that Meta had been making ""giant offers"" worth more than $100 million to lure away his top talent. Beyer, along with colleagues Alexander Kolesnikov and Xiaohua Zhai, announced their departure from OpenAI's Zurich office to join Meta's new AI unit this week.When a social media user suggested the OpenAI CEO Sam Altman ""clearly just threw out the 100m figure out there to make potential takers think that they were being lowballed,"" Beyer responded: ""Yes, it was a brilliant move, gotta give him that.""Meta's Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth echoed Beyer's sentiments during an internal company meeting Thursday, calling Altman ""dishonest"" and noting that the OpenAI chief was ""countering all these offers"" while creating inflated market expectations. Bosworth emphasized that such massive packages only apply to ""a very, very small number of people"" in senior leadership roles.The three researchers had previously worked together at Google DeepMind before joining OpenAI in December 2024 to establish the company's Zurich office.

Grammarly acquires Superhuman as part of plan to become an ‘AI productivity platform’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/grammarly-acquires-superhuman-as-part-of-plan-to-become-an-ai-productivity-platform/articleshow/122211679.cms,"What Grammarly said about acquiring Superhuman



“This is the future we’ve been building toward since day one: AI that works where people work, not where companies want them to work. With Superhuman, we can deliver that future to millions more professionals while giving our existing users another surface for agent collaboration that simply doesn’t exist anywhere else. Email isn’t just another app; it’s where professionals spend significant portions of their day, and it’s the perfect staging ground for orchestrating multiple AI agents simultaneously.”

Grammarly has announced its plans to acquire the AI-based email app Superhuman. This acquisition aims to provide Grammarly with its email platform to feature its product. Superhuman helps users respond one to two days faster and save four hours every week on their email communications. Grammarly stated that email is currently its “number-one use case” for professional users, with its AI assistant helping to revise over 50 million emails per week across more than 20 email providers. The acquisition of Superhuman, a popular email platform, aligns with Grammarly's strategy to enhance its offerings within this primary use case. Grammarly also has wider goals that, similar to many other tech companies, centre around AI, particularly AI agents .With this acquisition, Grammarly is planning to build a productivity platform with AI agents, aiming to streamline workflows across 500,000+ apps and websites.Commenting on the acquisition announcement, Shishir Mehrotra, CEO of Grammarly, said:Superhuman is used by 94% of its weekly active users for AI features, and Grammarly’s plans to acquire the platform mark a step toward building an AI-powered workspace. Superhuman users already send and respond to 72% more emails per hour, and the platform aims to enhance this further with AI agents that can manage inboxes, schedule meetings, conduct research, and write emails in a user’s voice. These agents will use context, reasoning, and system interaction to boost professional productivity .Grammarly’s research shows growing interest in agentic AI, with professionals ready for AI to autonomously manage tasks like admin support (44%), collaboration (39%), and strategic communication (36%).Two-thirds of users expect AI to triple productivity in five years, while industry leaders foresee a 10x jump. Grammarly’s acquisitions of Superhuman and Coda support its vision of building a multi-agent productivity platform, where apps function as intelligent collaborators.Email, where professionals spend over three hours daily, is seen as the ideal setting for deploying these AI agents. Future use cases include multiple agents assisting simultaneously—handling grammar, verifying facts, adding context, and refining messaging.",Grammarly has announced its plans to acquire the AI-based email app Superhuman.

Google Home introduces 'Admin' and 'Member' roles for better smart home control,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-home-introduces-admin-and-member-roles-for-better-smart-home-control/articleshow/122211424.cms,"How this Google Home update will make it easier for users to add kids under 13



Google Home 's latest update has added new ""Admin"" and ""Member"" roles to improve smart home control by allowing users to assign different levels of access. This feature, which Google began testing last year, aims to clarify who can manage smart home devices and services. Individuals designated as ""Admin"" will have complete control over all devices, services, and users within their smart home setup. Meanwhile, ""Members"" will be limited to basic device controls, such as viewing a security camera's live feed. However, ""Admins"" have the option to grant ""Members"" additional privileges. This includes providing ""Settings"" access for control over device and home-wide settings, or enabling ""Activity"" access so Members can monitor device history and recent events, like a visitor detected by a doorbell camera.Apart from the new roles, Google is also streamlining how children under 13 can be added to the Home app. After setting up a child’s Google account through Family Link, parents can now invite them to their Google Home, where they’ll automatically be added as a Member.Previously, the process required navigating through Family Link, Google Home, or Google Assistant settings to add a child’s voice to the smart home system before sending an invitation—something many users found confusing.With the updated approach, inviting a child to the home can now be done directly within the Google Home app, provided they are part of the Google family group.The latest update, labelled version 3.33 of the Google Home app, is expected to be widely available soon as the company started rolling it out on June 30. If the app hasn’t updated automatically, users are advised to check their settings to see if the update can be manually installed. Unlike many Google updates, this update does not mention a phased rollout, suggesting it should be accessible to all users immediately.","Google Home update adds new ""Admin"" and ""Member"" roles to improve smart home control.

""I think for many of us, we just want clarity. These eternal extensions make no sense for anyone who works here. How can we plan our jobs and lives if every 90 days we might get banned or sold?”

Employees of TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance , may be facing potential layoffs after the company recently informed the staff of upcoming “organisational and personnel changes.” According to a memo seen by Business Insider (BI), these changes are expected to affect workers in TikTok's global e-commerce business, TikTok Shop.

In a February all-hands meeting, leadership acknowledged the team had not met its performance targets in 2024.Compounding issues in 2025, new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese goods have disrupted operations, as many of TikTok’s global sellers are based in China. In US, the weekly order volume reportedly declined in mid-May compared to April, following the tariff hike.In response, TikTok has reduced staff through layoffs and performance reviews. Some employees were asked to choose between performance-improvement plans or severance packages. As part of these changes, experienced leaders from China and Singapore—primarily from Douyin , TikTok’s Chinese sister app—have taken over roles previously held by US-based staff.These shifts come amid broader uncertainty surrounding TikTok’s future in the US. The company is still negotiating with the Trump administration over a 2024 law requiring ByteDance to sell its US assets or risk a potential ban.Enforcement of the law has been delayed through executive orders, but the uncertainty is affecting staff morale.

Trump's approach to chips: Beyond CHIPS Act grants



US President Donald Trump 's latest legislative push aims to significantly incentivise semiconductor manufacturers to build plants in the country, further bolstering Washington's efforts to strengthen its domestic chip supply chain. The bill, which the Senate passed on Tuesday (July 1), proposes increasing tax credits for eligible semiconductor firms from 25% to 35%. This marks an even larger increase than the 30% that appeared in a prior draft.Chipmakers like Intel , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSMC ) and Micron Technology may all benefit from these enhanced credits, provided they expand their advanced manufacturing capabilities in the US before a 2026 deadline.It is to be noted that these new provisions build upon the existing tax incentives established by the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which included $39 billion in grants and $75 billion in loans for US-based semiconductor manufacturing projects.Since his first term, Trump has pursued policies to bring more of the advanced semiconductor supply chain back from Asia, bolster domestic players and curb China's technological capabilities. While the tax provisions in his new bill expand on those in the Biden administration's CHIPS Act, Trump's overall strategy for the semiconductor industry has diverged.Earlier this year, the President even called for a repeal of the CHIPS Act, though Republican lawmakers have shown reluctance to act on that front. Nonetheless, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently indicated that the administration is renegotiating some of the Biden administration’s existing grants.In recent months, several major chipmakers with US projects have ramped up their planned investments in the country, including TSMC, Nvidia, Micron and GlobalFoundries.","US President Donald Trump's latest legislative push aims to significantly incentivise semiconductor manufacturers to build plants in the country.

"Microsoft to lay off 9,000 employees in its second biggest round of job cuts ever; these employees to be affected",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-to-lay-off-9000-employees-in-its-second-biggest-round-of-job-cuts-ever-read-what-the-company-said/articleshow/122208301.cms,"Xbox hit hardest in this round of job cuts

Microsoft targets middle management layers in efficiency drive

Layoffs continue despite Microsoft's strong financial performance

Microsoft has confirmed it will eliminate approximately 9,000 positions across its global workforce. This marks the company's second significant round of layoffs this year, and its second largest overall, following the cuts of 11,000 jobs last year and 6,000 earlier this May, as part of an ongoing restructuring effort to streamline operations and reduce management layers.The cuts represent less than 4% of Microsoft's 228,000-person workforce and will impact employees across multiple divisions, geographies, and experience levels. Xbox gaming division faces particularly steep reductions, with sources indicating substantial job losses in the gaming sector.Xbox leader Phil Spencer addressed affected employees directly, stating the company must ""end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft's lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness.""The gaming cuts include approximately 200 positions at King, the Candy Crush developer Microsoft acquired through Activision Blizzard, representing 10% of that division's staff. European subsidiaries including Zenimax also confirmed job reductions, according to the Seattle Times.Spencer acknowledged the difficult timing in his internal memo: ""I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger.""The layoffs specifically target reducing organizational hierarchy, with Microsoft focusing on eliminating management positions that create barriers between individual contributors and senior executives. This strategic approach mirrors similar moves by tech competitors Amazon and Meta, who have streamlined their corporate structures to improve decision-making speed.Company sources indicate the restructuring aims to ""increase agility and effectiveness"" by removing redundant supervisory roles while preserving front-line talent and leadership positions. The flattened organizational structure represents Microsoft's broader effort to maintain competitiveness in rapidly evolving technology markets.This latest round follows Microsoft's May announcement cutting over 6,000 positions, primarily in product and engineering roles, plus an additional 305 cuts in June. The company has eliminated more than 15,000 jobs since January 2024, including its biggest ever round in 2025, which saw around 11,000 cuts.Despite the workforce reductions, Microsoft reported robust financial results with $25.8 billion in net income for its most recent quarter, representing 18% year-over-year growth. CNBC reported the company remains among the S&P 500's most profitable enterprises.""We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said.The layoffs coincide with the start of Microsoft's 2026 fiscal year, when the company traditionally announces organizational restructuring. Affected employees will receive severance packages, healthcare coverage, and job placement assistance, with priority consideration for other Microsoft Gaming positions.Spencer emphasized the contributions of departing employees: ""Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted.""","Microsoft confirms it will eliminate approximately 9,000 positions across its global workforce.

What ICEBlock app description says

Attorney General Pam Bondi warns ICEBlock app's developer

ICEBlock, an iPhone app designed for anonymously reporting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent sightings, has soared to one of the top spots in Apple’s U.S. App Store rankings, fueled by controversy sparked by the U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi ’s remarks. The app, which allows users to share and receive real-time alerts about ICE sightings within a 5-mile radius while maintaining anonymity, gained traction overnight after Bondi criticized it recently.According to ICEBlock's developer Joshua Aaron , he made the app to counter the Trump administration’s deportation policies, which Aaron compares to Nazi Germany. The app has found a strong user base in Los Angeles, where approximately 20,000 users have reported frequent ICE raids in recent weeks, according to CNN.Stay informed about reported ICE sightings, within a 5 miles radius of your current location, in real-time while maintaining your privacy. ICEBlock is a community-driven app that allows you to share and discover location-based reports without revealing any personal data.Speaking on Fox News with Sean Hannity, Bondi accused the app of potentially endangering law enforcement officers and slammed CNN for “promoting” it, stating, “Shame on them.” By Tuesday afternoon, ICEBlock had become one of the most downloaded free iPhone apps in the U.S.The app’s description emphasizes its community-driven approach: “Stay informed about reported ICE sightings, within a 5 miles radius of your current location, in real-time while maintaining your privacy. ICEBlock allows you to share and discover location-based reports without revealing any personal data.” However, the app has drawn sharp criticism from law enforcement advocates. Border Czar Tom Homan, speaking on “The Will Cain Show,” called ICEBlock “disgusting,” arguing it makes law enforcement’s job more dangerous. “Any network that covers that is disgusting as well,” Homan added. As ICEBlock’s popularity surges, the debate over its impact on public safety and immigration enforcement continues to intensify.","ICEBlock, an iPhone app designed for anonymously reporting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent sightings, has soared to one of the top spots in Apple’s App Store rankings.

Read Mark Zuckerberg’s full memo to employees on Meta Superintelligence Labs: We are going to …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/read-mark-zuckerbergs-full-memo-to-employees-on-meta-superintelligence-labs-we-are-going-to-/articleshow/122207487.cms,"Read Meta CEO’s full memo to his employees:



As the pace of AI progress accelerates, developing superintelligence is coming into sight. I believe this will be the beginning of a new era for humanity, and I am fully committed to doing what it takes for

Meta

to lead the way. Today I want to share some details about how we’re organizing our AI efforts to build towards our vision: personal superintelligence for everyone.

We’re going to call our overall organization Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). This includes all of our foundations, product, and FAIR teams, as well as a new lab focused on developing the next generation of our models.

Alexandr Wang has joined Meta to serve as our Chief AI Officer and lead MSL. Alex and I have worked together for several years, and I consider him to be the most impressive founder of his generation. He has a clear sense of the historic importance of superintelligence, and as co-founder and CEO he built ScaleAI into a fast-growing company involved in the development of almost all leading models across the industry.

Nat Friedman has also joined Meta to partner with Alex to lead MSL, heading our work on AI products and applied research. Nat will work with Connor to define his role going forward. He ran GitHub at Microsoft, and most recently has run one of the leading AI investment firms. Nat has served on our Meta Advisory Group for the last year, so he already has a good sense of our roadmap and what we need to do.

We also have several strong new team members joining today or who have joined in the past few weeks that I’m excited to share as well:

Trapit Bansal -- pioneered RL on chain of thought and co-creator of o-series models at OpenAI.



Shuchao Bi -- co-creator of GPT-4o voice mode and o4-mini. Previously led multimodal post-training at OpenAI.



Huiwen Chang -- co-creator of GPT-4o’s image generation, and previously invented MaskGIT and Muse text-to-image architectures at Google Research



Ji Lin -- helped build o3/o4-mini, GPT-4o, GPT-4 .1, GPT-4.5, 4o-imagegen, and Operator reasoning stack.



.1, GPT-4.5, 4o-imagegen, and Operator reasoning stack. Joel Pobar -- inference at Anthropic. Previously at Meta for 11 years on HHVM, Hack, Flow, Redex, performance tooling, and machine learning.



Jack Rae -- pre-training tech lead for Gemini and reasoning for Gemini 2.5. Led Gopher and Chinchilla early LLM efforts at DeepMind .



. Hongyu Ren -- co-creator of GPT-4o, 4o-mini, o1-mini, o3-mini, o3 and o4-mini. Previously leading a group for post-training at OpenAI.



Johan Schalkwyk -- former Google Fellow, early contributor to Sesame, and technical lead for Maya.



Pei Sun -- post-training, coding, and reasoning for Gemini at Google Deepmind. Previously created the last two generations of Waymo’s perception models.



Jiahui Yu -- co-creator of o3, o4-mini, GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o. Previously led the perception team at OpenAI, and co-led multimodal at Gemini.



Shengjia Zhao -- co-creator of ChatGPT, GPT-4, all mini models, 4.1 and o3. Previously led synthetic data at OpenAI.



I’m excited about the progress we have planned for Llama 4.1 and 4.2. These models power Meta AI, which is used by more than 1 billion monthly actives across our apps and an increasing number of agents across Meta that help improve our products and technology. We’re committed to continuing to build out these models.

In parallel, we’re going to start research on our next generation of models to get to the frontier in the next year or so. I’ve spent the past few months meeting top folks across Meta, other AI labs, and promising startups to put together the founding group for this small talent-dense effort. We’re still forming this group and we’ll ask several people across the AI org to join this lab as well.

Meta is uniquely positioned to deliver superintelligence to the world. We have a strong business that supports building out significantly more compute than smaller labs. We have deeper experience building and growing products that reach billions of people. We are pioneering and leading the AI glasses and wearables category that is growing very quickly. And our company structure allows us to move with vastly greater conviction and boldness. I’m optimistic that this new influx of talent and parallel approach to model development will set us up to deliver on the promise of personal superintelligence for everyone.

We have even more great people at all levels joining this effort in the coming weeks, so stay tuned. I’m excited to dive in and get to work.","CEO of Meta, a company that develops artificial intelligence, writes a memo to employees. He explains how the company is organizing its AI efforts to build towards a vision of personal superintelligence for everyone. The company has added several new team members in the past few weeks, he says.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122207473,imgsize-24514,width-400,resizemode-4/Facebook-founder-Mark-Zuckerberg.jpg"

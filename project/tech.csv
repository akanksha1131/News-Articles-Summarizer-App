Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff: AI won't replace … jobs and he is hiring them in thousands,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-ai-wont-replace-jobs-and-he-is-hiring-them-in-thousands/articleshow/124797899.cms,"What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Benioff says AI augments sales capacity, doesn't replace sellers

Salesforce's decision tells a different story





Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff insists artificial intelligence won't eliminate sales positions, announcing plans to hire between 3,000 and 5,000 new salespeople as the company pushes toward 20,000 account executives by year's end. Speaking in October 2025, Benioff emphasised that ""face-to-face communication"" remains essential in sales, stating that AI ""doesn't have a soul"" and lacks authentic human connectivity. The billionaire tech executive's stance comes despite Salesforce's aggressive AI adoption across other departments, including customer service where the company cut 4,000 roles earlier this year.""We love AI, OK? But AI — it's not the same,"" Benioff told TBPN. ""It's not that human connectivity.""Benioff argues AI enhances rather than replaces human salespeople, addressing a problem Salesforce has faced for 26 years: unanswered leads. The CEO revealed that AI agents recently contacted 4,000 potential customers in one week—follow-ups previously impossible with human-only teams.The combination of expanded human sales staff and AI assistance will increase Salesforce's overall sales capacity by 19%, Benioff projects.Among the company's 80,000 employees, roughly 25% are trained to help customers use Salesforce's sales products.While championing sales hiring, Benioff confirmed in September that Salesforce reduced customer support from 9,000 to 5,000 employees because he ""needs less heads."" The company's Agentforce AI platform now handles 50% of customer interactions, having completed over 1.2 million conversations since October 2024.The AI deployment reduced support costs by 17% and decreased case volumes enough that Salesforce no longer actively backfills support engineer positions, according to a company spokesperson.Benioff's divergent approach—expanding sales while contracting support—reflects his belief that balance is crucial. ""If you turn it over to 100% AI, you're putting your whole company at risk,"" he told Axios in July, acknowledging the ""bumpy"" transition as companies navigate unprecedented technological change.","Salesforce to hire between 3,000 and 5,000 new salespeople by year's end.

Intel returns to profit after six straight quarterly losses; CFO David Zinser tells what its to have the US government as Intel's biggest shareholder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-returns-to-profit-after-six-straight-quarterly-losses-cfo-david-zinser-tells-what-its-to-have-the-us-government-as-intels-biggest-shareholder/articleshow/124794628.cms,"Chip giant Intel has returned to profit after six quarters of losses. The company reported strong revenue in the third quarter, driven by high demand for its chips. This positive performance follows a significant investment from the US government. Intel expects this robust demand to continue through 2026. The company's client computing segment, which includes PC and laptop chips, saw a 5% year-over-year increase. Artificial intelligence is seen as a key driver for future growth.

US government's stake in Intel





Intel is back in profit. The chip giant snapped its losing streak of six straight quarterly losses and returned to profitability in the third quarter. The American chipmaker posted strong revenue, noting robust demand for chips that it expects to continue into 2026. This is Intel's first earnings report since the Donlad Trump administration acquired a 10% stake in the company in August this year.Client computing revenue, which includes chips for PCs and laptops, grew 5% year over year, benefiting from PC market stabilization and artificial intelligence PC prospects. CEO Lip-Bu Tan said in a call with analysts that artificial intelligence “is a strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth as we execute.” Tan added, “We significantly improved our cash position and liquidity in Q3, a key focus for me since becoming CEO in March. ”US President Donald Trump announced in August that the U.S. government would take a 10% stake in the Intel as part of his effort to bolster companies deemed vital to national security. With this, the US government is the company’s biggest shareholder. The investment seems to have worked well for the company's stock -- Intel stock is up more than 50% since Aug 22, when Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced the deal.On its part, Intel has agreed to make major investments in U.S. manufacturing facilities in exchange for the funds.Talking about its biggest shareholder, the US government, Intel CFO David Zinser told CNBC, “Like any shareholder, we have to keep in touch with them.” He added, “We don’t tell them how the numbers are going before the quarter. We generally talk to them like Fidelity,” another Intel shareholder.Intel also received $5 billion from rival Nvidia in September. Earlier this year, it received $2 billion from Japanese technology giant SoftBank.Talking about company's older chipmaking processes Zinser said that they have continued to do well, “and that was probably the part that was more unexpected.” Intel CFO said the company met some of the central processing unit (CPU) demand with inventory on hand, but they will be behind in thefirst quarter, “probably Q2 and maybe in Q3.”The supply crunch has been with older Intel 10 and 7 manufacturing technologies. Many customers are reportedly opting for less advanced hardware to refresh their operating systems, demonstrating enterprises aren’t waiting for cutting-edge chips when proven technology gets the job done.","Chip giant Intel has returned to profit after six quarters of losses.

Putin's FIERY Retaliation Against U.S. Over Trump Sanctions On Russia; 'Your Actions Won't Stop Us'

Silicon Valley hit by US-China trade war





Female spies have been part of wars since ages. There are many told and untold stories of female spies dating back World Wars, and becoming more prominent during Russia-US cold war of sixties and seventies. The Cold War era saw female spies play crucial and varied roles on both sides of the Iron Curtain. They were not just peripheral figures; they were integral cogs in the Cold War's espionage machinery, contributing to everything from high-level strategic analysis to dangerous field operations.And now a new report in 'The Times' claims that female spies are waging 'sex warfare' to steal Silicon Valley secrets. Quoting some analysts, the report claims that China and Russia are sending attractive women to seduce tech workers — even marrying and having children with their targets.Chinese and Russian operatives are reportedly using seduction as a weapon to infiltrate Silicon Valley, targeting tech professionals to steal trade secrets, according to industry insiders quoted in the report. According to 'The Times' exclusive report, the tactic, dubbed ""sex warfare,"" is part of a broader espionage campaign exploiting America’s tech industry, costing taxpayers up to $600 billion annually, per the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property.James Mulvenon, chief intelligence officer at Pamir Consulting, revealed he’s been repeatedly targeted by “sophisticated” LinkedIn requests from attractive young Chinese women. At a recent Virginia conference on Chinese investment risks, two such women attempted to gain entry but were denied.“It’s a phenomenon,” Mulvenon is quoted as saying. “They have an asymmetric advantage because we don’t do that here.” Counterintelligence experts warn that China and Russia are leveraging civilians—investors, crypto analysts, and academics—rather than trained spies, making detection harder.China is also accused of hosting startup competitions on American soil to steal business plans. The annual China (Shenzhen) Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, held in cities like Boston and Tokyo, lures startups with cash prizes but requires them to share sensitive intellectual property and establish operations in China. A Silicon Valley biotech CEO who won $50,000 at last year’s event said he was heavily monitored, with organizers wiring funds to his personal account—a move he found suspicious. His company later lost U.S. federal funding, possibly due to ties with Asian investors.In a high-profile case, Klaus Pflugbeil, a former Tesla employee, was sentenced to 24 months in prison in December 2024 for attempting to sell stolen battery technology secrets for $15 million at a Las Vegas trade conference. His alleged accomplice, Yilong Shao, remains at large. Experts also point to China-backed venture capital firms investing in U.S. startups initially funded by the Department of Defense (DoD). This “drafting” tactic pushes foreign ownership beyond thresholds that block further DoD investment, starving innovative firms of critical funding.A Senate committee recently found that six of the 25 largest recipients of federal Small Business Innovation Research funds had ties to China, receiving nearly $180 million from the Pentagon in 2023 and 2024.“It’s the Wild West,” said Jeff Stoff, a security academic and former U.S. government analyst. He noted that China exploits regulatory blind spots, operating with “virtual impunity.” Counterintelligence officials are now urging increased scrutiny of cross-border investments and greater awareness of espionage threats in Silicon Valley. “China is targeting our startups, academics, and DoD-funded projects,” Stoff warned. “We’ve not even entered the battlefield.”","Chinese and Russian operatives are reportedly using seduction as a weapon to infiltrate Silicon Valley, targeting tech professionals to steal trade secrets.

When Elon Musk said Twitter algorithm sucks





Tesla CEO Elon Musk has acknowledged ongoing issues with Twitter ’s (now X) recommendation algorithm. In a post, the world’s richest person apologized to users for what he described as ‘frustrations’ with how Twitter posts are being surfaced on the microblogging platform. “My apologies for frustrations with the 𝕏 algorithm. We are working hard to fix the problem,” Musk wrote in a post.Over the past few weeks, several X users have reported inconsistencies in their feeds – — including repetitive content, delayed updates, and limited visibility for certain accounts. Some creators have also complained about drops in engagement and reach, sparking speculation about recent algorithmic changes.Ever since taking charge of the platform in 2022, Musk made algorithm transparency a central theme. He has previously said the company is continuously tweaking its feed-ranking system to prioritise “useful and engaging” posts. Earlier this year, X open-sourced parts of its recommendation code to allow users to see how posts are promoted or demoted.While Musk did not detail what the latest issue involves or when it will be resolved, his acknowledgment suggests that X’s engineering team is actively working on an update.Earlier this year in January, Musk playfully ‘slammed’ the recommendation algorithm of X. Criticising X’s recommendation algorithm, Musk jokingly said: “If I see one more da*n Nazi salute in my feed, I’m gonna lose my mind 🤪 This algorithm sucks!!” Later on, he also wrote: “The recommendation algorithm on this platform sucks! I want to talk to the manager right now!!”Musk's remarks then came after his hand gestures at Donald Trump 's inauguration sparked controversy online, with some comparing it to Nazi salutes.","The world’s richest person apologized to users for what he described as ‘frustrations’ with how Twitter posts are being surfaced on the microblogging platform. “My apologies for frustrations with the algorithm.

Real-world lessons over instant gratification







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has an important and surprising piece of advice for young people who are dreaming of entrepreneurial success. Bezos said ‘Go work at McDonald’s.’ As reported by Fortune, in a recent interview, Bezos stressed on the importance of early work experience especially in the fast-paced, customer-facing environment. “I always advise young people: Go work at McDonald’s,” Bezos said. “You learn responsibility. You learn how to show up. You learn how to deal with people. You learn how to hustle.”For those unaware, Bezos started Amazon out of his garage in 1994. He believes that entry-level jobs such as those at McDonald’s tech foundational skills which are important for long term success. He emphasised that such small roles are necessary as they instill skill like discipline, resilience and the ability to handle pressure. These are the traits that many Gen Z entrepreneurs may overlook in their rush to build startups.The comments by Bezos come at a time when debate is growing over the value of traditional work experience versus the allure of instant digital success.

Google expands AI infrastructure and data centres

Strengthening Belgium’s digital future

AI’s potential for economic growth





US tech giant Google has announced plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network, creating hundreds of new jobs and supporting local economic growth. The investment will focus on the company’s existing Saint-Ghislain site and the new Farciennes campus, with construction already underway. Google said the expansion will strengthen Belgium’s role in Europe’s cloud and AI sector, provide large-scale computing capacity powered by carbon-free energy, and create opportunities for local suppliers and contractors. Officials highlighted the move as a vote of confidence in Belgium’s tech ecosystem and workforce.The investment will modernise and expand Google’s network of data centres in Saint-Ghislain and Farciennes, enabling the company to handle large volumes of digital data and support advanced AI systems. These facilities are designed to operate entirely on clean energy, aligning with Google’s global goal to achieve carbon-free operations by 2030. The expansion will also support the development of new onshore wind farms in Belgium to power the centres sustainably.The project is expected to create around 300 new full-time jobs directly, while indirectly supporting approximately 15,000 additional roles through local contractors and partners. Google already works with about 150 Belgian suppliers, including 80 in Wallonia, and the expansion will further boost construction, technology, and service sector employment. Prime Minister Bart De Wever emphasized that the investment underscores Belgium’s growing importance as a digital and green technology hub.Belgium has become a key location for technology growth thanks to its reliable internet networks, stable power supply, and skilled workforce. Google Cloud already serves Belgian companies and organizations such as Odoo and UZ Leuven, helping them scale AI-based tools for healthcare, research, and business. The new investment will enhance Belgium’s competitiveness in the European cloud and AI market, attracting further international investment and innovation.A 2024 study commissioned by Google estimated that artificial intelligence could increase Belgium’s GDP by €45 to €50 billion over the next decade. Most jobs are expected to be supported or improved by AI, with only a small portion at risk of automation. By expanding AI infrastructure, Google aims to equip Belgian companies and the workforce with advanced digital tools while fostering sustainable and inclusive growth. The investment positions Belgium as a hub for next-generation AI innovation in Europe.

Home Minister switches to ‘swadeshi’ email address

Government push fuels Zoho's growing adoption across India







Zoho co-founder Sridhar Vembu expressed heartfelt gratitude to Union Home Minister Amit Shah after the latter announced his switch to Zoho Mail, India's homegrown email platform. In an emotional response on X, Vembu dedicated the moment to engineers who chose to work from India despite opportunities abroad.""Thank you Sir, for your faith in us. I dedicate this moment to our hard-working engineers who have toiled hard in Zoho for over 20 years. They all stayed in India and worked all these years because they believed. Their faith is vindicated. Jai Hind, Jai Bharat,"" Vembu wrote.Shah's announcement came as a significant endorsement for the Chennai-based tech company. Sharing his new email address—amitshah.bjp@zohomail.in—on social media, the Home Minister requested all future correspondence be directed to his Zoho account, marking a symbolic shift away from global platforms like Gmail and Outlook.The move aligns with the government's broader push for digital sovereignty.

Match Group-Apple’s years-long antitrust battle







Tinder-parent company Match Group has urged India's antitrust regulator to impose substantial fines on Apple , arguing that the iPhone maker's commission fees threaten to stifle its business in one of the world's fastest-growing dating app markets, a report has said. In a submission to the Competition Commission of India (CCI), Match said Apple's fees of up to 30% will over time damage its revenue streams and growth prospects in India, news agency Reuters reported.In a response dated October 13 to the CCI investigators' findings, Match urged the watchdog to issue final directives ordering Apple to discontinue what it called anti-competitive practices.“Apple's policies adversely affect the return on capital and revenue streams of Match's portfolio brands,” the company said in its submission, which was reviewed by Reuters.“In the long term, the constraints and excessive fee imposed by Apple will stifle the growth and scalability of Match's portfolio brands,” Match added. According to advisory firm MarketNtel, in India, the dating apps market is projected to reach $1.42 billion by 2030.The CCI has the power to fine Apple up to 10% of its global average turnover for the last three financial years—potentially a massive penalty given Apple's worldwide revenues.Match explicitly urged CCI to calculate fines based on Apple's global turnover rather than just its Indian revenues, arguing this approach could “act as a significant deterrent against recidivism” or to put it in easy words – prevent Apple from repeating such behaviour.Match has been locked in an antitrust dispute with Apple at the CCI since 2022. Last year, investigators issued a report concluding that Apple had engaged in “abusive conduct” in the apps market of its iPhone Operating System (iOS).Apple has denied any wrongdoing, arguing it is a small player in India where smartphones overwhelmingly use Google's Android system rather than iOS.Match also accused Apple of discriminatory treatment in how it classifies different apps and charges commissions accordingly. The company pointed out that Uber's ride-hailing app is classified by Apple as providing ""physical goods"" and charged lower commission rates, while Tinder is treated as providing ""digital services"" and faces higher fees.""Tinder and Uber both offer matchmaking services in essence,"" Match argued in its filing, suggesting the distinction is arbitrary and unfair.","Match has been locked in an antitrust dispute with Apple at the Competition Commission of India since 2022.

How Xbox team responded to 'accountability margins' set by Microsoft,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-xbox-team-responded-to-accountability-margins-set-by-microsoft/articleshow/124789391.cms,"Why ‘30% margin’ is a challenge for Microsoft gaming unit



Xbox's response: Job cuts , price hike and other changes







Microsoft is reportedly demanding significantly higher returns from its gaming division, Xbox, a mandate that has forced the unit to implement major strategic shifts. According to a recent report by Bloomberg, the aggressive push began in late 2023 when Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood implemented a strict new financial goal: Xbox must achieve 30% “accountability margins” (Microsoft’s term for profit margins) across all its gaming operations.This target is steep for the video game industry, where the average profit margin typically ranges between 17% and 22%, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Xbox itself has operated with margins between 10% and 20% over the last six years, with court documents showing a 12% margin in fiscal year 2022.The new 30% goal marks a profound change in culture for Xbox. Previously, game developers were encouraged to prioritize creativity and innovation, focusing on building the best possible games without the pressure of specific profit targets.However, Hood's finance team has taken a much larger role in gaming decisions over the past two years, ushering in the new, tougher margin requirement.The pressure to meet the high 30% margin has directly led to significant restructuring and strategy changes across the Xbox division, including canceled games, job losses and major strategy changes.Job cuts and canceled projects: Xbox has undergone multiple cost-cutting measures, including laying off thousands of employees.It also canceled several high-profile and expensive games that had been in development for more than seven years, including Everwild, Perfect Dark and Project Blackbird.Price increases: To immediately boost revenue, Xbox recently raised prices across various products and services.Game releases on competing platforms: In the most significant strategic reversal, Xbox announced in 2024 that it would begin releasing a majority of its games on competing consoles from Nintendo and Sony for the first time, a move aimed squarely at expanding market reach and increasing revenue.","Microsoft is reportedly demanding significantly higher returns from its gaming division, Xbox, a mandate that has forced the unit to implement major strategic shifts.

"UPI may create this monthly transactions record in October 2025, here’s why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/upi-may-create-this-monthly-transactions-record-for-first-time-in-october-2025-heres-why/articleshow/124788989.cms,"Representative Image

What may be the reason behind this growth in UPI







India's real-time payment network, the Unified Payments Interface ( UPI ), is expected to set a new monthly record in October. Driven by festive spending, lower GST rates, and sustained consumer adoption of digital transactions, the payment platform may surpass Rs 28 lakh crore in monthly transaction value for the first time, exceeding its previous record of Rs 25 lakh crore. According to a report by the Economic Times, the average daily transaction value has already jumped 13% from September to Rs 94,000 crore, signalling strong momentum heading into the final days of the month. Multiple records have been set in volume as well, including daily transactions that reached 740 million on Diwali eve. In contrast, the average daily volume reached 695 million, up more than 6% from September's record.As per the report, the surge comes despite a subdued September, when digital payment activity dipped to a fiscal-year low as consumers deferred spending ahead of GST rate reductions that took effect on September 22. With festive shopping now underway, UPI has recorded six days of over Rs 1 lakh crore in daily value so far in October, double the tally from the previous month.Festival-linked purchases and the timing of salary inflows are amplifying payment activity, pushing UPI values to peak levels typically seen in early-month cycles dominated by salaries and EMIs.The combination of holiday demand and favourable tax rates has extended those peaks deeper into the month.To compare, credit card payments appear to have cooled after hitting a record high in September, when e-commerce sales on Amazon and Flipkart drove online spending to Rs 1.18 lakh crore.With the large sales concluding before October, UPI is emerging as the primary beneficiary of ongoing festive consumption.With Diwali-week transactions already above trend, UPI is set to deliver not only a record October but also reinforce its position in India's digital payments landscape, now accounting for roughly 85% of all digital transactions nationwide.","India's real-time payment network, the Unified Payments Interface ( UPI ), is expected to set a new monthly record in October.

Meta and TikTok push back on findings







The European Union’s (EU) executive body the European Commission has said that TikTok, and Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram have violated its transparency rules under the Digital Services Act (DSA), the bloc's landmark technology regulation, that may result in billions of dollars in fines for the social media companies.The Commission's primary finding centres on data access for researchers. According to EU rules, social media platforms must give researchers “adequate access” to public data so they can study the platforms' impacts on society, including potential physical and mental health effects on users.The Commission says that it found that Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok “may have put in place burdensome procedures and tools for researchers to request access to public data. This often leaves them with partial or unreliable data, impacting their ability to conduct research, such as whether users, including minors, are exposed to illegal or harmful content.”This means that according to the EU, these companies made it too difficult for researchers to get the data they need, leaving them with incomplete or unreliable information that hampers legitimate studies.Meta faces additional accusations beyond the data access issue. The Commission preliminarily found that both Facebook and Instagram breached their obligations to:Provide users with simple mechanisms to report illegal contentAllow users to effectively challenge content moderation decisions when the platform removes or restricts their postsBoth companies strongly disputed the Commission's findings.“We disagree with any suggestion that we have breached the DSA, and we continue to negotiate with the European Commission on these matters,” said Meta spokesperson Ben Walters. He added that Meta has made changes to its content reporting options, appeals process, and data access tools since the DSA came into force, and expressed confidence that ""these solutions match what is required under the law in the EU.""Meanwhile, a TikTok spokesperson emphasised the company's commitment to transparency and researcher access, noting that “almost 1000 research teams have been given access to data through our Research Tools to date.”TikTok also highlighted a potential conflict between different EU regulations: ""Requirements to ease data safeguards place the DSA and GDPR [Europe's privacy law] in direct tension. If it is not possible to fully comply with both, we urge regulators to provide clarity on how these obligations should be reconciled.""","The European Union’s (EU) executive body has said that TikTok, and Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram have violated its transparency rules.

US chip equipment manufacturer Applied Materials has begun laying off approximately 4% of its global workforce. The company cited the need to adapt to industry changes driven by automation and digitalisation as the reason for job cuts. Based on the company's August 2025 filing of having approximately 36,100 full-time employees, the 4% cut translates to about 1,444 jobs being eliminated.According to a regulatory filing (via CNBC), the company, which provides essential equipment and services to the semiconductor industry, began notifying impacted employees around the world on Thursday (October 23). The reduction affects employees “across all levels and groups.”""Our goal is to continue to transform how we work, move faster, simplify decision-making, and focus on what matters most as we prepare Applied Materials for significant growth in the coming years,"" CEO Gary Dickerson said in a memo to employees.Applied Materials stated that the layoffs are part of a broader effort to create a “more competitive and productive organisation.”“Automation, digitalization and geographic shifts are redefining our workforce needs and skill requirements,"" the company wrote in the filing.It added that the company is focused on “building high-velocity, high-productivity teams, adopting new technologies and simplifying organizational structures.”The timing of the cuts follows a challenging forecast for the company's fiscal year.

Erotic a ‘very dangerous’ direction: Suleyman



The ‘growing rift’ with OpenAI







Microsoft's AI chief Mustafa Suleyman is essentially drawing a line against AI-generated erotica, which the company's longtime partner OpenAI recently offered in ChatGPT, calling the service ‘dangerous’. The CEO of Microsoft AI said that the tech giant will not build AI services offering “simulated erotica,” explicitly distancing Microsoft from OpenAI's recent announcement that it would allow adult users to generate erotic content with ChatGPT.“That's just not a service we're going to provide. Other companies will build that,” Suleyman said at the Paley International Council Summit in Menlo Park, California.Suleyman’s opposition to AI erotica purportedly stems from his broader philosophy that tech companies shouldn’t create AI that seems conscious or capable of suffering. In August, he warned in an essay that conscious-seeming AIs may create a new “axis of division” between humans and machines. Suleyman argued this scenario is already unfolding, primarily through erotica-focused AI services.Suleyman seems to have been pointing towards OpenAI as well as Elon Musk's Grok chatbot, which launched companion features earlier this year.Grok’s offering includes a female anime character designed for intimate interactions.“You can already see it with some of these avatars and people leaning into the kind of sexbot erotica direction,” Suleyman was quoted as saying.“This is very dangerous, and I think we should be making conscious decisions to avoid those kinds of things,” he added.Notably, critics also worry that such services could isolate users, create unhealthy attachment patterns, or exploit vulnerable individuals.The comments come at a time when there are reports of increasing tension between Microsoft and OpenAI, despite Microsoft's position as a major investor and cloud infrastructure partner to the ChatGPT maker. Various reports have said that the two companies have built substantial AI businesses leveraging their respective strengths, however, cracks have developed in the relationship.Microsoft has begun focusing more heavily on its own AI services rather than relying exclusively on OpenAI. Moreover, Microsoft unveiled features for its Copilot AI chatbot, including an AI companion called Mico that can respond to users through voice calls and express emotions by changing colors.Meanwhile, OpenAI has been diversifying its partnerships beyond Microsoft, recently striking deals with Microsoft rivals including Google and Oracle.","Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, said the tech giant will not build AI services offering ‘simulated erotica,’ explicitly distancing Microsoft from OpenAI's recent announcement that it would allow adult users to generate erotic content with ChatGPT. “That's just not a service we're going to provide.

Tesla-rival Rivian to cut over 600 jobs; CEO RJ Scaringe sends internal memo explaining ‘structural adjustments’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tesla-rival-rivian-to-cut-over-600-jobs-ceo-rj-scaringe-sends-internal-memo-explaining-structural-adjustments/articleshow/124783998.cms,"Read Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe memo to employees

Hi Team,

I am writing to share a difficult update.

With the launch of R2 in front of us and the need to profitably scale our business, we have made the very difficult decision to make a number of structural adjustments to our teams. These changes result in a reduction in the size of our team by roughly 4.5%.

These are not changes that were made lightly. With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions. This news is challenging to hear, and the hard work and contributions of the team members who are leaving are greatly appreciated.

To ensure we move forward with clarity, I want to summarize the areas most impacted.

Streamlining the Customer Journey: To provide a seamless experience for our customers, we are integrating the Vehicle Operations workstreams into the Service organization to create fewer customer handoffs and clearer ownership. We are also integrating the Delivery and Mobile Operations into the Sales organization to ensure the purchase experience is as seamless as possible with a single touchpoint throughout the entire sales process and to delivery.

Elevating Our Marketing Efforts: Historically we have had multiple functions that collectively capture what would typically be housed in a single marketing organization. We have made the decision to form a single marketing organization, and while we recruit our first Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), I will be acting as Interim CMO. Our Marketing Experiences team, led by Denise Cherry, and the Creative Studio team, led by Matt Soldan, will both report directly to me for now.

These changes are being made to ensure we can deliver on our potential by scaling efficiently towards building a healthy and profitable business. I am incredibly confident in R2 and the hard work of our teams to deliver and ramp this incredible product.

Thanks again everyone.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

In a revolutionary breakthrough, scientists at Science Corporation have unveiled a retinal implant that can restore functional vision for people experiencing irreversible vision loss. This cutting-edge eye chip enables patients to read text, solve crosswords, and perform essential daily visual tasks using artificial vision. The implant works through a sophisticated system combining a microchip placed under the retina with augmented-reality glasses that transmit visual information directly to the brain. Tested on participants in multiple countries, the technology has shown significant improvements in vision, offering hope to millions affected by conditions like age-related macular degeneration. This innovation marks a pivotal advancement in ophthalmology, redefining possibilities for restoring independence, improving quality of life, and empowering individuals with vision impairment to re-engage with the world, pursue careers, social activities, and educational opportunities previously thought unattainable.As reported by Metro UK, Science Corporation, a competitor of Elon Musk’s Neuralink, has pioneered a brain-computer interface called PRIMA.The system uses a pair of camera-mounted augmented-reality glasses that wirelessly transmit signals to a microchip placed beneath the retina. This technology is specifically designed for patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of sight loss in adults over 55.AMD affects over five million people globally and leads to central vision loss through a process known as geographic atrophy (GA). This condition makes everyday tasks such as reading, driving, and recognising faces very difficult. While previous treatments slowed disease progression, they did not restore vision until now. The PRIMA implant was tested on 38 participants across 17 sites in five countries, with Moorfields Eye Hospital in London serving as the only UK site. Researchers report that 84 percent of participants experienced clinically meaningful vision improvement after 12 months of use.The procedure involves surgically inserting a ultra-thin SIM card-sized microchip (2mm by 2mm) under the retina's centre. The patient wears augmented-reality glasses connected to a small computer attached to their waistband. Artificial intelligence algorithms process images captured by the camera and convert them into electrical signals. These signals stimulate retinal and optic nerve cells, allowing the brain to interpret them as visual information.Patients must undergo intensive rehabilitation over several months to interpret these electrical visual signals and regain reading ability. Sheila Irvine, a participant from Moorfields, shared her journey:""Before the implant, it was like having two black discs in my eyes. I have always loved reading, and I wanted that back. At first, learning to read again was challenging, but with practice, I can now tackle small print, do crosswords, and enjoy reading more than ever. It has given me independence, optimism, and confidence.""Irvine’s experience shows how retinal implants can dramatically improve quality of life, allowing patients to reconnect with activities they thought were lost forever. With dedicated therapy, patience, and daily exercises, many patients gradually regain more complex visual skills, enhancing both personal and social independence.Mahi Muqit, senior vitreoretinal consultant at Moorfields Eye Hospital and the Institute of Ophthalmology at UCL, said:""This represents a new era in artificial vision. Patients with dry AMD can regain meaningful central vision for the first time. The ability to read lifts mood, restores confidence, and improves independence. The PRIMA chip procedure is safe, can be performed in under two hours by trained surgeons, and opens access to this life-changing therapy for many blind patients."" The PRIMA implant not only restores functional vision but also gives patients a sense of autonomy and engagement with the world. From reading prescription labels to enjoying television and completing crosswords, artificial vision transforms daily life and offers hope to millions suffering from AMD worldwide.","Scientists at Science Corporation have unveiled a retinal implant that can restore functional vision for people experiencing irreversible vision loss.

Meta cuts roles in Risk division; says 'don't need as many roles.... we're at a point where ....',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-cuts-roles-in-risk-division-says-dont-need-as-many-roles-were-at-a-point-where-/articleshow/124778274.cms,"Representative Image

Meta job cuts : Roles impacted

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

Internal memo sent by Meta to its employees

Risk org update: team restructuring and role reductions

Today, we're announcing a number of role reductions and a series of organizational changes within the Risk org. These decisions are difficult, and we recognize the impact they will have on valued colleagues and teams. I want to share what's changing and why.

WHY WE'RE MAKING THE CHANGES

• Over the past few years, we've invested in building more global technical controls and in standardizing our requirements and verifiers within Risk Review. We've made significant progress in how we approach risk management and compliance. By moving from bespoke, manual reviews to a more consistent and automated process, we've been able to deliver more accurate and reliable compliance outcomes across Meta. This standardization means that many routine decisions can now be handled efficiently by technology, freeing our teams to focus on the most complex and high-impact challenges. As a result, we don't need as many roles in some areas as we once did. Our work has matured, and we're at a point where we can operate more efficiently and effectively, while still upholding the highest standards for compliance.

• KEY CHANGES WE'RE MAKING:

• Reducing roles in Product Risk Program Manager, Shared Services and Global Security & Privacy (GSP) teams.

• Consolidating more Areas work in London, where we have strong leadership and engineering presence.

• Reorganizing GSP and integrating it with the Reg Readiness and DPO team, which we're renaming Regulatory Compliance Programs.

LOOKING AHEAD

We remain committed to delivering innovative products while meeting our regulatory obligations. These changes do not alter our policies, standards for compliance, or legal responsibilities. Automation and technology will continue to strengthen our compliance program, but human judgment will always play a crucial role in assessing novel and complex issues. This is a natural next step in our journey, and as our processes mature, our teams will be able to focus on the most challenging and high-impact work.

We also know this is a hard day for many. Our priority is to support impacted employees and help them find new opportunities, within Meta or beyond. We are equipping managers and team leaders with resources to support their teams, and we will continue to communicate openly as we move through this transition. We are grateful for the contributions of everyone affected and remain committed to supporting you through this change.





Facebook-parent Meta has announced another round of job cuts, this time affecting employees in the Risk division. In an internal memo sent to staff, the company said it is restructuring teams and reducing roles as part of efforts to streamline operations and rely more on automation for routine compliance work. “Today, we're announcing a number of role reductions and a series of organizational changes within the Risk org. These decisions are difficult, and we recognize the impact they will have on valued colleagues and teams,” the company said in the memo.Positions in Product Risk Program Management, Shared Services, and Global Security & Privacy (GSP) are among those impacted. Meta will also consolidate more functions in London and merge the GSP unit with the Regulatory Readiness and Data Protection Office team under a new banner—Regulatory Compliance Programs.The company said these changes reflect the “maturity” of its compliance processes, allowing technology to handle simpler tasks while human teams focus on more complex issues.

Hawking on responsible AI development and guiding its future

Stephen Hawking, the acclaimed theoretical physicist, is renowned for his pioneering work on black holes and cosmology. However, his influence extended far beyond physics. In his later years, Hawking became a leading voice on artificial intelligence (AI), highlighting both its remarkable potential and the serious risks it could pose to humanity. He recognised that AI could transform medicine, address global challenges, and improve human life, but he also warned that uncontrolled AI development might threaten civilisation. Before he died in 2018, Hawking repeatedly emphasised that if AI evolved beyond human control, it could fundamentally change or endanger the future of humanity. He called for careful oversight, global cooperation, and responsible development of these technologies to ensure they benefit society safely and ethically.Hawking recognised the enormous potential of AI to improve human life. Advanced AI systems could revolutionise medicine, eradicate diseases, alleviate poverty, and address pressing environmental challenges. These technologies, he believed, offered unprecedented opportunities to enhance society. Yet, Hawking was equally cautious, emphasising that these benefits are not guaranteed. If AI were to develop goals misaligned with human interests, the consequences could be catastrophic.He warned that uncontrolled AI evolution could surpass human intelligence, making humans obsolete and powerless to stop its progression. In a 2014 BBC interview, he famously remarked, “The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.”One of Hawking’s central concerns was that AI could evolve faster than humans, reaching a level of intelligence beyond our control. He warned that advanced AI could “take off on its own and re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate.” Unlike humans, whose evolution is constrained by biology, AI could surpass us rapidly, creating entities capable of outperforming humanity in every intellectual endeavour. Hawking suggested that such a scenario might herald the emergence of a new form of life, which means an intelligence beyond our comprehension, potentially rendering humans obsolete.Hawking also highlighted the dangers of AI in military and strategic contexts. Autonomous weapons could make life-or-death decisions without human oversight, raising the risk of accidental or deliberate conflicts. If controlled by authoritarian regimes or malicious actors, such AI-driven systems could destabilise global security. Hawking emphasised that the unchecked deployment of AI in these areas might have catastrophic worldwide consequences, underscoring the urgent need for international regulation and ethical oversight.Beyond existential risks, Hawking foresaw the broader social and economic disruptions caused by AI. He predicted that widespread automation could concentrate wealth in the hands of a few while displacing millions of workers, intensifying economic inequality and social instability. According to Hawking, the challenge is not only technological but deeply societal: humanity must ensure that AI advances do not exacerbate disparities or marginalise vulnerable populations.Despite his warnings, Hawking was not opposed to AI development. On the contrary, he advocated for responsible innovation. He called for strict ethical oversight, global collaboration, and the creation of safeguards to ensure AI aligns with human values. In 2015, he co-signed an open letter urging researchers to investigate the societal impact of AI and develop measures to mitigate its risks. His message was clear: AI could be humanity’s greatest achievement or its most significant threat.Hawking’s warnings were not fear-mongering but a call for proactive vigilance. He frequently noted that AI could become “the biggest event in the history of our civilisation. Or the worst. We just don’t know.” As AI continues to evolve, his insights remain critical. Humanity must actively guide these technologies, ensuring they serve society’s best interests rather than endanger its future.","Hawking recognised the enormous potential of AI to improve human life.

What Apple says and what the ruling means





A London Tribunal has ruled that Apple misused its dominant position by charging app developers unfair commissions, says news agency Reuters. As per the report, the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) ruled against Apple after a trial of the lawsuit. The tribunal said that Apple abused its dominant position from October 2015 till December 2020 by shutting out competition in the app distribution market and by ""charging excessive and unfair prices"" as commission to developers.In its ruling, the CAT said that the developers were overcharged by the difference between a 17.5% commission for app purchases and the commission Apple charged was usually 30%. The CAT also ruled that app developers passed on 50% of the overcharge to consumers.The case, filed on behalf of millions of iPhone and iPad users in the United Kingdom, is valued at around 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion). The ruling could leave the US tech company on the hook for hundreds of millions of pounds in damages.Apple said that it will appeal the verdict, arguing it ""takes a flawed view of the thriving and competitive app economy"". A hearing is scheduled for the next month to decide how damages are calculated and Apple's application for permission to appeal.""This ruling overlooks how the App Store helps developers succeed and gives consumers a safe, trusted place to discover apps and securely make payments,"" said an Apple spokesperson as quoted in Reuters report.The Reuters report quotes Rachael Kent, the British academic who brought the case, saying Apple had made ""exorbitant profits"" by excluding all competition for the distribution of apps and in-app purchases.At the start of the trial in January this year, her lawyers argued that Apple's ""100% monopoly position"" allowed it to impose restrictive terms and excessive commissions on app developers, which Apple denied.","A London Tribunal has ruled that Apple misused its dominant position by charging app developers unfair commissions.

In an official announcement, the company said the partnership will dramatically expand its compute resources. “The expansion is worth tens of billions of dollars and is expected to bring well over a gigawatt of capacity online in 2026,” Anthropic said.“Anthropic’s choice to significantly expand its usage of TPUs reflects the strong price-performance and efficiency its teams have seen with TPUs for several years,” said Thomas Kurian, CEO at Google Cloud. “We are continuing to innovate and drive further efficiencies and increased capacity of our TPUs, building on our already mature AI accelerator portfolio, including our seventh generation TPU, Ironwood.”Anthropic cited better cost efficiency, strong performance, and Google’s prior experience with the processors as the reason for using Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for training and running its Claude AI models.The deal highlights the growing global demand for high-performance chips, as tech companies race to build AI systems that can rival or even exceed human intelligence.As part of the partnership, Google — which offers its TPUs through Google Cloud — will also provide Anthropic with additional cloud computing support.These TPUs are seen as an alternative to Nvidia’s in-demand chips, which remain in short supply.In a related news, Anthropic is releasing an update for Claude that will let the AI chatbot “remember” past conversations without prompting. Available to all paid subscribers, the upgrade allows users to turn on Claude’s “memory” in their settings. The feature enables Claude in remembering details from previous chats.It is important to state that Memory is an opt-in feature that can be turned on in Claude's settings. There are options for ""search and reference chats"" and ""generate memory from chat history.""","Claude AI-maker Anthropic has expanded its deal with Google.

US senator sends letter to FCC to ban China's two biggest drone makers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-senator-sends-letter-to-fcc-to-ban-chinas-two-biggest-drone-makers/articleshow/124770136.cms,"Representative Image

What new FCC rules may mean for DJI and Autel Robotics





Florida Senator Rick Scott is reportedly intensifying pressure on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to crack down on Chinese drone giant DJI and other companies as the agency prepares to vote on a proposal granting it authority to revoke certifications for devices deemed national security risks. In a letter sent this week to FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, Scott called for “swift and decisive” action against DJI and Autel Robotics, two Chinese drone manufacturers he accuses of exploiting regulatory loopholes.According to a report in DroneDJ, the FCC’s forthcoming vote, expected within days, would allow the agency to block new authorizations for companies on its “Covered List,” which includes firms like Huawei and Hikvision, and retroactively revoke approvals for previously certified devices. Scott praised the move as a critical step to strengthen U.S. supply chain security, alleging that DJI has evaded oversight by creating shell companies, such as Lyno Dynamics, whose FCC filings reportedly feature DJI’s logos.“This initiative closes regulatory gaps and protects our national security,” Scott wrote, urging the FCC to rescind existing certifications for DJI and Autel devices and block new licenses for products containing their components or software.He also called for stricter corporate disclosure rules to prevent companies from masking ownership.The proposed FCC rule could have far-reaching implications for DJI, which dominates over 70% of the global consumer drone market. If certifications are revoked, DJI would be unable to import, market, or sell new drones in the U.S., and retailers could not restock products or parts. While existing drones would remain operational, the company’s U.S. business could grind to a halt, potentially turning its devices into rare commodities.The push comes as the Fiscal Year 2025 National Defense Authorization Act mandates a national security review of DJI by December 23, 2025. A failure to clear the review could automatically place DJI on the FCC’s Covered List, further restricting its operations. The Pentagon has already labeled DJI a “Chinese military company,” and several federal agencies have restricted its use.DJI has consistently denied posing a security threat or sharing data with the Chinese government, emphasizing privacy features that allow users to keep flight data offline. However, bipartisan support for tougher measures, led by figures like Scott and FCC Chairman Carr, signals growing skepticism in Washington. Carr described the FCC’s proposal as a “long-standing, bipartisan effort” to block “foreign adversary-controlled devices” from the U.S. market.Despite the political storm, DJI drones remain popular with U.S. consumers. The DJI Mini 4K, a budget-friendly model, is currently discounted 20% for Amazon Prime members, underscoring strong demand even as the company faces an uncertain future in the U.S. As tensions over U.S.-China tech restrictions escalate, the FCC’s decision could reshape the American drone market and determine whether DJI’s products continue to soar—or are grounded for good.","Florida Senator Rick Scott is intensifying pressure on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to crack down on Chinese drone giant DJI.

Microsoft AI CEO makes it clear: It is ChatGPT Atlas rival

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





AI Browser race is heating up. Just two days after OpenAI 's announcement of ChatGPT Atlas, Microsoft has launched a suite of new features for its AI assistant. This includes an ambitious project that builds artificial intelligence directly into one of its most central products -- Microsoft CoPilot. The new CoPilot Mode in Microsoft Edge goes beyond just being a browser extension and is said to be Microsoft’s take on AI browser category — an intelligent and flexible AI assistant that follows you as you browse the web.Mustafa Suleyman, the CEO of Microsoft AI, even described the new product in those terms in the announcement. “Copilot Mode in Edge is evolving into an AI browser that is your dynamic, intelligent companion,” Suleyman wrote in the announcement post. “With your permission, Copilot can see and reason over your open tabs, summarize and compare information, and even take actions like booking a hotel or filling out forms. ”Microsoft's announcement comes just two days after OpenAI introduced its Atlas browser, sparking comparisons due to their striking visual and functional similarities. While Copilot Mode features a darker background, text instead of a logo, and Windows-style interface elements, it closely resembles Atlas in design.Both integrate a chatbot into the “new tab” screen, though Copilot opts for a full-tab “ride-along” function rather than a split-screen approach.Industry observers note that browser design constraints may explain the similarities, as clean interfaces leave limited room for variation. The real distinction lies in the underlying AI models powering each browser, which will likely define the user experience.Microsoft’s release, planned for weeks and likely in development for months, coincides with a heated AI race between the two companies, or should we say 'Frenemies'. The near-simultaneous launches underscore the competitive tension between Microsoft and OpenAI, despite neither inventing the AI browser concept. As both companies vie for dominance, this week’s dual announcements signal a new chapter in AI-driven web browsing.",Microsoft launches CoPilot Mode in its Edge browser.

Spotify confirms Android app freezing issue; here’s how you can avoid it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/spotify-confirms-android-app-freezing-issue-heres-how-you-can-avoid-it/articleshow/124767103.cms,"“We've received reports from Android users (mainly Samsung and Google Pixel) experiencing issues where the Spotify app becomes unresponsive, freezes, or crashes when connected to certain WiFi networks.

The issue doesn't occur while using mobile data.""

How this Spotify issue is affecting Android users







Spotify has acknowledged that its Android app is freezing and crashing for certain users when connected to Wi-Fi and confirmed that a fix is in development. In a response to the community, the music streaming company said:The problem primarily affects Samsung and Google Pixel devices; however, the app functions normally when users switch to mobile data. According to a report by 9to5Google, reports across Spotify's community forums suggest that the app becomes unresponsive shortly after connecting to Wi-Fi.Many users reported a pattern in which the app opens briefly, freezes, and then crashes. Some Reddit users note that playback resumes when Wi-Fi is turned off or when switching to a different network, suggesting the problem may be linked to specific routers or configurations.Reports indicate the issue has been affecting users for nearly two weeks before Spotify acknowledged it. While the company stated that its engineering teams are investigating the problem, it has not provided a timeline for a fix.The bug appears limited to certain Android devices and specific Wi-Fi setups. Some users have speculated that the problem could be linked to Chromecast-ready devices on the same network. This might explain why the crashes occur when connected to Wi-Fi, but not when using mobile data or offline mode.Users have reported that standard troubleshooting methods, such as clearing the cache or reinstalling the app, have not resolved the problem. Until a patch is released, users can try switching to mobile data or temporarily disabling Wi-Fi while streaming. Another temporary fix option is to roll back to an earlier app version from a couple of weeks ago.","Spotify's Android app is freezing and crashing for certain users when connected to Wi-Fi.

Ex-Apple employee named Sam Sung remembers when he thought Apple would fire him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ex-apple-employee-named-sam-sung-remembers-when-he-thought-apple-would-fire-him/articleshow/124766058.cms,"Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

How Sam Sung went from Apple’s store floor to become a social media storm

Building a new identity beyond the meme





Sam Sung's Apple business card went viral in 2012, sparking panic that nearly cost him his peace of mind. Over a decade later, he's Sam Struan—but wishes he'd handled the moment differently. Sam Struan, now 36, was working at an Apple retail store in Vancouver when someone posted a photo of his business card on Reddit. The name ""Sam Sung"" at an Apple Store became an instant internet sensation, and Struan thought his career was over.""I was so scared, and I just wanted to keep my head down and stay employed,"" Struan told Business Insider in a recent interview. When Apple called asking if he knew about the viral post, his first thought was termination—not the job security he actually had.Apple's response was swift but protective. The company pulled Struan off the sales floor after a reporter approached him at work. Colleagues were instructed not to identify him when customers came asking for ""Sam Sung,"" and his business cards were confiscated.For months, Struan played along with the ruse, pretending to be someone else when customers inquired. His Scottish accent helped mask his identity over the phone.The joke eventually faded, but the damage to his sense of security lingered.In 2013, Struan left Apple to pursue recruitment work. The following year, he auctioned his old business card and uniform pieces for charity, raising over $2,500 for Children's Wish. But the viral fame—or infamy—continued to shadow his professional life.Business Insider reports that Struan ultimately changed his surname to escape being defined as ""an internet joke."" He chose Struan, named after a village on Scotland's Isle of Skye. The decision also addressed practical concerns: all desirable social media handles were taken by Samsung , and research shows non-anglicised names can affect job opportunities.Today, Struan works as a consultant and résumé writer in Glasgow. While he doesn't regret the name change, he has one wish: ""I wish I could tell my younger self to see it as a funny thing...and enjoyed it for what it was.""","Sam Struan, now 36, was working at an Apple retail store in Vancouver when someone posted a photo of his business card on Reddit.

When Melania Trump’s cryptocurrency token wiped $5 billion from Donald Trump’s memecoin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-melania-trumps-cryptocurrency-token-wiped-5-billion-from-donald-trumps-memecoin/articleshow/117405192.cms,"Donald Trump's cryptocurrency token dropped 38% in value on Friday after his wife Melania Trump launched her own competing digital coin, erasing $5 billion from the token's market capitalization just days before his presidential inauguration.The TRUMP token's price fell from $74.60 to $45.90 within 40 minutes of Melania Trump announcing her own MELANIA token, according to CoinMarketCap data. Meanwhile, the First Lady-elect's new cryptocurrency skyrocketed to a $6.14 billion market value within two hours of launch.""It's time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING! Join my very special Trump Community,"" Donald Trump posted on social media on January 17, promoting his token. The marketing featured Trump with a raised fist alongside ""FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT,"" referencing his response to an assassination attempt during a July political rally.Over 45,000 digital wallets have purchased the MELANIA token since its launch Thursday evening, though blockchain analytics platform Bubblemaps reported that nearly 90% of the token supply is held in a single wallet, contradicting the project's claimed distribution structure.Critics warn these politically-linked tokens could enable undue influence from special interests and foreign entities. ""If people want to gamble, I don't really care,"" said Lee Reiners, a former Federal Reserve economist now at Duke University. ""What I care about is when this crypto bubble bursts -- and it will burst -- it will end up impacting people across the economy even if they don't have direct investment in crypto.""Supporters view the Trump memecoin as symbolic of the incoming president's pro-cryptocurrency stance, which contrasts with the perceived hostility of the outgoing Biden administration. Trump has pledged to implement crypto-friendly regulations and has appointed industry advocates to key government positions.The TRUMP token initially sold for $10 before surging to $70 by Sunday morning. The token's website claims 35% was distributed to the team, with other allocations for treasury, community, public sale and liquidity.",Donald Trump's Trump token fell from $74.60 to $45.90 within 40 minutes of his wife's launch.

""In Europe there is no place for illegal hate, either offline or online. I welcome the stakeholders' commitment to a strengthened Code of conduct under the

Digital Services Act

(DSA).”

Major tech companies including Meta 's Facebook , Elon Musk's X (earlier Twitter), Google's YouTube and others have agreed to strengthen their efforts against online hate speech under an updated code of conduct that will be incorporated into the European Union’s (EU) tech rules. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the European Commission has announced that these companies, along with other signatories to the voluntary code established in May 2016, have committed to taking further action to combat the spread of hate speech. Several other tech companies have also signed the voluntary code of conduct to combat online hate speech, including Dailymotion, Instagram, Jeuxvideo.com, LinkedIn, Microsoft-hosted consumer services, Snapchat, Rakuten Viber, TikTok and Twitch.Under the updated code, companies have committed to allowing not-for-profit or public organisations with expertise in illegal hate speech to oversee their handling of hate speech notices. They also agreed to review at least two-thirds of such notices within 24 hours.Additionally, the companies will implement measures, including the use of automated detection tools, to minimise hate speech on their platforms. These companies will also provide transparency on the role of recommendation systems and the organic and algorithmic reach of illegal content before its removal.The companies will also offer country-specific data, categorised by internal classifications of hate speech, such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, or sexual orientation.In a statement to Reuters, EU tech commissioner Henna Virkkunen said:The DSA mandates that tech companies take stronger action against illegal and harmful content on their platforms.

"Microsoft search market share doubles, as Google's share falls just below 90% for the first time",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-search-market-share-doubles-as-googles-share-falls-just-below-90-for-the-first-time/articleshow/117320875.cms,"

How Google's search market share dropped

Google's dominance in the global search engine market has dipped below 90% for the first time in almost a decade. According to Statcounter, in the last three months of 2024, Google's market share fell to 89.34% in October, 89.99% in November, and 89.74% in December. This marks a significant shift in the search landscape, as Google has consistently held over 90% of the market share for almost a decade. The last time Google's share was below 90% was in early 2015.However, this decline has helped Microsoft 's Bing search engine to experience a major growth in usage during the latter half of 2024, with its market share almost doubling to reach around 4%. This suggests that Bing is slowly gaining popularity, although it still lags significantly behind Google.As per Statcounter data, Google seems to be gradually losing its search market share. The company’s search market share has remained relatively stable in most regions except Asia, which appears to be a significant factor behind the overall decline, the report suggests.In the US, Google’s search market share peaked at 90.37% in November 2024 but dropped to 87.39% by December. For the rest of 2024, the share fluctuated between 86-88%, showing a slight but noticeable decline.Despite dominating the search market for nearly a decade with a consistent 90-92+% share, Google has faced criticism over the growing unhelpfulness of its search results.This, along with allegations of maintaining an illegal monopoly, has placed the company under scrutiny for almost two years.While Google's search market share decline might suggest users are turning to AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT Search and Perplexity, Statcounter's data doesn't specifically mention that. The report primarily tracks traditional search engines like Bing, Yandex, and Yahoo , with a minor ""other"" category that includes DuckDuckGo and Ecosia.Microsoft's Bing, the second most popular search engine, saw a slight increase in market share, hovering around 4% in the latter half of 2024.It's worth noting that a similar dip in Google's market share in April 2024 turned out to be a data error. However, the consistent decline in the last three months of 2024 suggests a real shift in user behaviour, even if the specific reasons remain unclear.","Google's market share fell to 89.34% in October, 89.99% in November, and 89.74% in December.

TikTok may get some respite from Donald Trump as the President-elect has announced that he will “most likely” grant TikTok a 90-day reprieve from a potential ban after he takes office on Monday (December 20). This comes as the app, with 170 million American users, faces a shutdown set for Sunday (December 19).“I think that would be, certainly, an option that we look at,” Trump said in the phone interview with NBC, highlighting that he hasn’t made a final decision.“The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it’s appropriate. You know, it’s appropriate. We have to look at it carefully. It’s a very big situation,” Trump added.“If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday,” Trump noted.The bipartisan law passed last year explicitly permits a 90-day extension under specific conditions. However, even if an extension is granted on Monday, it may not prevent the app from going dark for at least a day, as the current compliance deadline is Sunday.The Chinese-owned app stated last week that it will go dark in the US on Sunday unless President Joe Biden's administration provides assurances to companies like Apple and Google that they will not face enforcement actions when the ban takes effect.The White House, however, dismissed TikTok's Friday comment as a stunt, reiterating that it was up to the incoming Trump administration to take action, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown on Sunday.“We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.Meanwhile, the Chinese embassy in Washington accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok.“China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” a spokesperson said.The US Supreme Court justices upheld the ban in a unanimous decision.",TikTok faces a shutdown in the US on Sunday if it doesn't comply with a ban.

What is a memecoin

Melania Trump launches meme coin



Donald Trump announced his cryptocurrency $Trump on January 17, 2025. Just two days after the launch, the crypto token has become one of the most valuable forms of digital currency in the world. According to a New York Times report, Trump tokens were trading at a total value of almost $13 billion on Sunday afternoon i.e. January 19. In just two days, $29 billion worth of trades had taken place.According to CoinGecko, a data tracker for the industry, each of the 200 million tokens, valued at around $64, contributed to this total. This means, as of Sunday, Trump’s coin was ranked as the 19th most valuable cryptocurrency in the world.As mentioned above, the $Trump meme coin launched last week, days ahead of the inauguration. Announcing the crypto currency, Trump said “My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING! Join my very special Trump Community. GET YOUR $TRUMP NOW. Go to http://gettrumpmemes.com — Have Fun!”.A memecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is created primarily as a joke or for fun, often inspired by internet memes or viral trends. These coins typically do not have a serious use case or underlying technology but gain popularity because of community support, humor, or social media trends. The most popular example of a memecoin is Dogecoin, which was originally created as a parody based on the popular ""Doge"" meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog.Donald Trump’s wife Melania Trump also announced her crypto coin called the $Melania. It is currently valued at $1.19 billion. Recently, Trump called them ""investments,"" showing his support for the growing meme coin trend.","The $Trump meme coin launched last week, days ahead of the inauguration.

Trump factor behind the 'wake-up' call

China seems to be finally taking note of Apple and other technology and auto companies moving manufacturing/assembly to India and other parts of the world. According to a report in Bloomberg, China is making it harder for employees and specialised equipment needed for high-tech manufacturing in India and Southeast Asia to leave its borders. The report that quotes people familiar with the matter added that this is possibly an attempt to prevent companies from shifting production in anticipation of higher tariffs under US President-elect Donald Trump Sources familiar with the matter indicate that Beijing has informally advised regulatory agencies and local governments to limit technology transfers and equipment exports to these regions. The goal is to bolster domestic production, mitigate potential job losses, and discourage foreign investors from leaving China if the US imposes new trade barriers.For example, Apple's primary assembly partner, Foxconn, has reportedly faced difficulties in deploying Chinese staff to its Indian factory and in receiving specialized machinery from China. While these issues haven't yet impacted production, they highlight the potential implications of these restrictions. Sources reportedly indicate that Apple's China-based equipment partners have faced increased scrutiny from Chinese government officials regarding shipments of equipment to India. Recent reports also claimed that Apple and Foxconn sought help from the Indian government regarding the same. Apple and Foxconn are said to have sought urgent help from the Indian government for assistance as specialized manufacturing equipment faces significant delays at Chinese ports, threatening to impact India's electronics manufacturing expansion plans.China's foreign ministry has stated that it treats all countries equally and welcomes enterprises from everywhere, denying any actions that harm other nations. However, reports suggest that Beijing is particularly concerned about Foxconn further diversifying its production away from China, given the company's significant workforce and its importance to local supply chains and employment.This trend of companies shifting production away from China, which began during Trump's first term, is expected to accelerate and potentially include more technology companies. The restrictions on tech equipment are also reportedly affecting the manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs) and solar panels in India, impacting companies like BYD and Waaree Energies.

How X users reacted to Paytm founder’s post

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has opposed the TikTok ban in the US. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Musk said “I have been against a TikTok ban for a long time, because it goes against freedom of speech .” He added “That said, the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but 𝕏 is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced.Something needs to change”.Reacting to Musk’s comments, Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma drew a historical parallel, quoting Subhash Chandra Bose ’s famous words: “तुम मुझे खून दो, मैं तुम्हें आज़ादी दूँगा” (“Give me blood, and I will give you freedom”). Sharma’s reference seems to highlight the fierce battle for balance and fairness in global digital markets, likening it to a modern struggle for “freedom” in the tech space.TikTok is facing a ban in the US. The app has resumed operations in the country after a temporary suspension. However, it became inaccessible to US users on January 20, following a Supreme Court decision upholding a federal ban citing national security concerns. Musk voiced his opposition to the ban stating: “TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the 𝕏 platform. Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.”Sharma’s quote resonated with many, sparking conversations online. Commenting on the post, one user wrote “we are back to barter system of commerce 😂”. “Thoda capitalism thoda communism,” said another.“Tiktok is the new bait. X is up for the world dominance,” commented a third. “Time time ka khel hai sir :),” joked another.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has opposed the TikTok ban in the US.

Here’s what Zoho CEO wrote on X

Yesterday I had the very sad duty to attend the funeral of Jeyesh Ram, 27 year old son of my dear friend Cibi Anand and Priya. He lost his life in a para-gliding accident in Kulu, Himachal Pradesh last Friday.

Way too many accidents happen with sickening regulatory there and I am deeply saddened Jeyesh became the latest statistic. Much stronger regulatory oversight required here.

We had invested in Jeyesh's venture Tools Hub, a fast growing hardware retail store franchise. His father Anand suggested the name Karuvi and it was Tools Hub distributor Abdul Gafoor, a long time Zoho customer and good friend of Anand who suggested the idea of Karuvi to us.

Jeyesh was a dashing young man, very kind to his employees and all those around him. He had the world ahead of him.

He was a risk taker. So am I but even at his age I would do a risk analysis and would have declined para-gliding in Kulu as too accident prone. I hope young people, particularly young men, avoid bad risks like this.

I hope his death does not go in vain and regulators take a good look at this.

All of us came together to bid tearful farewell to Jeyesh yesterday. Om Shanti 🙏

What Perplexity AI's proposal to Tiktok is

A US search engine startup, Perplexity AI, has reportedly submitted a proposal to merge with TikTok US , the Chinese-owned platform’s parent company ByteDance.

On Sunday, TikTok began restoring service in the US after Trump stated he would issue an executive order to delay the federal ban.The reversal occurred just hours after major app stores removed TikTok, rendering it inoperative for US users. TikTok confirmed on X (formerly Twitter) that it was working with service providers to reinstate access. Trump posted on Truth Social January 19 morning that he would issue an executive order on January 20 to delay the enforcement of the ban, providing more time for a deal to address national security concerns.TikTok update to users in the USAfter President-elect Donald Trump's post, TikTok stated that it was working with tech companies and service providers to restore access.

The company’s website also appeared to be partially functional for certain users, although it was unclear if services had been fully restored.","Perplexity AI has reportedly submitted a proposal to merge with TikTok US.

JPMorgan Chase is making full-time return to office compulsory for its employees.

This merger would integrate TikTok’s massive user base and video content with Perplexity AI’s search capabilities, creating a new entity in the evolving AI-powered search landscape.The success of this bid will depend on several factors, including the willingness of ByteDance's shareholders to participate in the merger and the final terms of the agreement.

TikTok stops working in US; app now reads this ban message,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tiktok-stops-working-in-us-app-now-reads-this-ban-message/articleshow/117366594.cms,"Why US banned TikTok

What’s next for TikTok

TikTok has stopped working in the US, reports Reuters. This means people in the US can no longer use the popular short-video platform. After months of legal battles, the US Supreme Court on Friday, January 17 approved a law to ban TikTok, citing national security concerns . TikTok users in the US now see this message when they open the app:“A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned”.US officials have raised concerns about TikTok, claiming it poses a national security risk. They believe the Chinese government could use the app to spy on Americans or secretly influence public opinion by controlling what content is shown or hidden.The worry stems from Chinese national security laws that require companies to assist with intelligence activities. FBI Director Christopher Wray told Congress last year that the Chinese government could potentially access and compromise Americans’ devices through TikTok’s software.These concerns led the US Congress to pass a law banning TikTok unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, sold it to a buyer approved by the U.S. government. President Joe Biden signed the law in April 2024, giving ByteDance until January 19 to sell TikTok. However, ByteDance's attempt to challenge the law in court failed. On December 6, a panel of three federal judges unanimously ruled against TikTok, rejecting its argument that the law violated free speech rights under the First Amendment.The Supreme Court unanimously rejected TikTok’s appeal on January 17, resulting in the ban coming into effect on January 19.The future of TikTok in the U.S. remains uncertain. Over time, the app is expected to stop functioning properly, as updates and support from app stores like Apple and Google would be blocked under the new law. Eventually, TikTok could become completely unusable in the country.All eyes are now on President-elect Donald Trump, who is set to take office on January 20. In a statement to NBC recently, Trump referred to the TikTok situation as a ""very big situation"" and said he is planning to push back a potential TikTok ban for 90 days.Until then, TikTok users and businesses that relied on the app for growth face an uncertain future, as the app has already stopped working in the US.","US officials have raised concerns about TikTok, claiming it poses a national security risk.

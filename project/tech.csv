What Microsoft said about moving Build out of Seattle



“Our plans for Build 2026 have changed, but our vision to empower builders and developers at a major event next year remains unchanged. We appreciate the city and community for their support over the years.”

Microsoft isn't planning to host its Build developer conference in its home city of Seattle next year. The company has reportedly cancelled all upcoming events at the Seattle Convention Centre . The conference is being relocated, though its next venue or format remains unclear. The decision to move Build could be related to attendee experiences in downtown Seattle, according to a report by The Seattle Medium. An unnamed email cited by the publication claims Build attendees ""cited the general uncleanliness of the streets, visible drug use, and the presence of unhoused individuals."" It's currently unknown where Build will be held in 2026, or if Microsoft may opt to make it an online-only event.In a statement to The Seattle Medium, an unnamed Microsoft spokesperson said:Microsoft has hosted Build in Seattle since 2017, except during the pandemic years (2020 to 2022), when the event was held online. Originally launched in 2011 as a successor to the Professional Developers Conference (PDC) and MIX events, Build debuted at the Anaheim Convention Center in California. It later moved to Microsoft’s campus in 2012, followed by four years at San Francisco’s Moscone Center.This year’s Build attendees reencountered heightened security as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the venue to oppose Microsoft’s contracts with the Israeli government. The demonstrations included balloons with alarms, banner displays, leaflet drops, and disruptions during Build keynotes and sessions.An internal email shared on X (earlier Twitter) from Visit Seattle, the city’s tourism agency, reveals that Microsoft and Build attendees also raised concerns about the area surrounding the Hyatt Regency and Arch Building, citing unclean streets, visible drug use, and the presence of unhoused individuals.Despite efforts by local authorities to address the issues and retain the event, Microsoft ultimately decided to move the Build conference out of Seattle. This marks a notable loss for the city’s convention and tourism sector, which has heavily depended on major tech events.","Microsoft has cancelled all upcoming events at the Seattle Convention Centre.

AT&T has reportedly suffered a massive data breach, with hackers gaining access to the personal data of over 86 million customers. Currently, the telecom provider has nearly 100 million customers in the US, and hackers have reportedly uploaded the personal information of most of them on the dark web. According to a report from Hack Read, the leaked details include full names, dates of birth, phone numbers, email as well as physical addresses of AT&T customers. The report claims that more than 44 million Social Security Numbers were also reportedly part of the data leak. Individually, these data sets pose privacy risks; when combined, they could help in the creation of complete identity profiles for defraud or identity theft, the report addsThe stolen data is reportedly fully decrypted. It was initially posted on a Russian cybercrime forum last month, and then re-uploaded to the same forum earlier this month. Hackers reportedly gained access to the data through accounts lacking multi-factor authentication. The report also connected the latest leak to an original hack attributed to the ShinyHunters group in April 2024.In a statement to Hack Read, an AT&T spokesperson said:As per the report, the original seller of the exposed data claimed the leak isHowever, HackRead’s analysis found this breach contains about 16 million more records than the earlier one.AT&T also acknowledged that security researchers had questioned any connection between this breach and the original 2024 incident.the company further noted.Users who want to check if their data was involved, you can use a tool from cybersecurity firm Pentester by visiting npd.pentester.com, where entering your details will show a list of breached accounts.Security experts have also recommended customers to regularly monitor their credit reports.","AT&T has reportedly suffered a massive data breach, with hackers gaining access to the personal data of over 86 million customers.

Google Cloud ’s chief technology officer, Will Grannis , believes the fundamentals of computer science remain vital—even as the tech industry undergoes dramatic changes driven by artificial intelligence . In a recent interview with Business Insider, Grannis said “You still have to understand, you know, how computers work, how data stores work.” “Because that context will allow you to think about how you design something for efficiency and value,” he further added.Grannis emphasized that a traditional computer science degree or coding program is still a solid foundation for entering the tech workforce.He said professionals need to prepare for the era of agentic AI, where understanding the data, tools, and systems behind the AI is just as important as the user inputs.“You're moving from like in the old days, we had to think about it at the application layer and just kind of stop there,” Grannis said. “Now, we’re entering the era of context engineering.”“So it’s not just about prompts,” he added, “but what data, what tools, what systems does your AI, does your multi-agent system need in order to function correctly?”While Grannis stands by the value of formal education, he also encouraged job seekers to learn beyond the curriculum. He said today’s tech professionals should adopt modern tools and systems to keep pace with AI's rapid evolution.“That's what I've been doing my entire career,” he said. “Formal education wouldn't have been enough for me to stay current.”He gave an example of his approach, revealing that he’s encouraging his global team to use AI during an upcoming hackathon. “We're going to use AI to just generate code, to modify it, to steer it, to refine it,” Grannis explained.He also warned that mastering prompt engineering alone isn't enough, saying that while it's important, it has started to become ""boilerplate code.""","Google Cloud’s chief technology officer, Will Grannis, believes the fundamentals of computer science remain vital.

Errol Musk's Stunning Disclosure On Trump-Elon Public Spat | 'In Heat Of The Moment...'

Errol Musk’s on Elon Musk and Donald Trump’s fight

Elon Musk and Donald Trump dispute



The public feud between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump is not a political falling out, but rather a consequence of prolonged stress and potential ""PTSD from the White House"" on his son's part, according to Errol Musk, Elon's father. Speaking to Russian media in Moscow, the Elon Musk’s father suggested his son made a ""mistake"" by publicly confronting Trump. The relationship between the two high-profile figures, once characterized by mutual admiration and a seemingly strong alliance, has recently dissolved into a bitter public exchange, primarily on social media. The spat intensified after Elon Musk denounced Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" a sweeping tax and spending package, calling it a ""disgusting abomination."" This led to a series of escalating criticisms from both sides, including Elon Musk's unsubstantiated suggestion that Trump had ties to the late Jeffrey Epstein.Speaking to Russian media, Errol Musk described the clash as a “mistake” on Elon’s part, suggesting that both Musk and Trump had been under intense pressure for months.""They're very tired and stressed, so you can expect something like this. Elon made a mistake, I think. But he is tired."" He further downplayed the severity of the rift, calling it ""a small thing"" that would ""be over tomorrow.""Elon Musk’s father also commented on his son's foray into the political arena, suggesting that Elon is ""not a great politician."" ""He's a great tech innovator, but not a great politician. His politics is like a swimming pool with no sides and no bottom,"" Errol stated, offering a candid assessment of his son's public political engagements.The feud began when Elon Musk criticised Trump’s tax and spending bill, calling it a “disgusting abomination.” Trump retaliated by threatening to cut federal contracts with Musk’s companies, including SpaceX and Tesla. Musk then suggested Trump’s name appeared in sealed Jeffrey Epstein files, further escalating tensions.","Errol Musk, Elon Musk's father, said his son made a ""mistake"" by publicly confronting Donald Trump.

License of Zepto’s Dharavi facility suspended

Smart AC Hacks to Cut Your Electricity Bill & Make It Last Longer!

Maharashtra’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has suspended the food business licence of Blinkit ’s dark store in Pune’s Balewadi area. According to a report by Economic Times, the FDA conducted an investigation on June 5 and found that the dark store was operating without the required approvals from the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). Operated by M/s Energy Darkstore Services near Mitcon College, the facility was found storing and selling food items without obtaining the mandatory licence under Section 31(1) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.The licence will remain suspended until proper authorisation is secured.As per the report, officials also cited multiple food safety violations at the site. The inspection report flagged issues such as food placed directly on the floor, lack of pest control certification, workers without protective gear, dusty storage racks, and a cold storage unit missing a calibration certificate.This action is part of a broader crackdown by authorities on quick commerce “dark stores” amid rising concerns about food hygiene and safety.Earlier this month, Maharashtra’s FDA cancelled the food business licence of Zepto’s Dharavi facility after an inspection revealed multiple hygiene and food safety norms violations. The inspection uncovered fungal growth on some food items, storage near stagnant water, unclean and wet floors, and cold storage units that failed to maintain the necessary temperature. Officials also found expired food products that were not separated from fresh stock.“The inspection at the Dharavi location revealed poor hygiene and unsafe food storage conditions,” said FDA officials.Following these findings, Assistant Commissioner of Food, Anupamaa Balasaheb Patil, ordered the cancellation of the facility’s licence under Section 32(3) of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.",Maharashtra’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has suspended the food business licence of Blinkit ’s dark store in Pune.

[4K] Xbox Games Showcase 2025 | The Outer Worlds 2 & Grounded 2 Direct

Microsoft just wrapped up their biggest gaming showcase of the year, and honestly? They came loaded for bear. From brand new handhelds to surprise Final Fantasy drops, this wasn't your typical ""here's what's coming eventually"" presentation. The Xbox Games Showcase 2025 delivered actual release dates, playable demos, and enough surprises to keep Twitter buzzing for weeks.The show's theme was clear: Xbox wants to be everywhere you are, whether that's your couch, your desk, or apparently now in your backpack. With every announced game supporting Xbox Play Anywhere and a shiny new handheld to show off, Microsoft is doubling down on their ""play anywhere"" philosophy in a big way.Let's break down everything that happened during this gaming extravaganza.The biggest hardware surprise came courtesy of Microsoft's partnership with Asus. The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X aren't just another Steam Deck competitor, they’re Microsoft's direct answer to handheld PC gaming. Both the Ally(s) run full Windows, meaning you can access Xbox Game Pass, Steam, Battle.net, and pretty much any PC storefront you can think of.The regular Ally packs an AMD Ryzen Z2A processor with 16GB of RAM and 512GB storage, while the Ally X steps things up with a Ryzen Z2 Extreme, 24GB of RAM, and a full terabyte of storage. Both launch this holiday season, and Microsoft made sure to mention that every game shown in the showcase will run on these handhelds. That's a bold claim, but if it holds true, these could be game-changers for portable gaming.After years of waiting, Obsidian's space RPG sequel has locked in October 29, 2025 as its launch date. The new trailer showed off the colony of Arcadia, which looks like it's having a significantly worse time than the locations in the first game. Rifts are tearing through space-time, factions are at each other's throats, and somehow capitalism is still the real villain.The sequel promises bigger RPG systems, more reactive storytelling, and full character customisation. Plus, there's an expanded Direct happening right after the showcase, so Obsidian clearly has a lot more to show. If you enjoyed the original's blend of dark humour and corporate satire, this looks like more of exactly what you want.October 21, 2025 marks the return of one of gaming's most brutally difficult action series. Ninja Gaiden 4 is a collaboration between Team Ninja and PlatinumGames, which sounds like a recipe for some absolutely bonkers combat sequences. The trailer showcased new protagonist Yakumo pulling off impossible combos against hordes of enemies, with the signature weapon-switching and aerial juggling the series is known for.The game is set in near-future Tokyo, features connections to series legend Ryu Hayabusa, and promises to deliver that ""git gud or go home"" difficulty the franchise built its reputation on. If you've been missing proper character action games, this one's shaping up to be essential.Sometimes the most unexpected announcements hit the hardest, and Super Meat Boy 3D definitely qualifies. Sluggerfly and Headup Games are taking Team Meat's masochistic masterpiece and literally adding another dimension to the suffering. The early 2026 release promises all the wall-jumping, buzzsaw-dodging, death-filled gameplay that made the original a cult classic, except now you can fail spectacularly in three dimensions instead of two.The trailer showcased the same tight platforming mechanics that turned controllers into projectiles worldwide, complete with Meat Boy's quest to rescue his bandage-wrapped girlfriend from that eternally creepy fetus in a jar. It's the kind of game that makes you question your life choices while simultaneously hitting ""retry"" for the 500th time – and honestly, we wouldn't have it any other way.InXile's ambitious RPG got an extended look, and it's looking appropriately ambitious. Set in the steampunk city of Avalon, players discover that history itself has been manipulated by the city's ruler. Your solution? A time travel device that lets you hop into the past and change things, with consequences rippling forward into the present.The new trailer focused on the grittier side of Avalon, showing the downtrodden areas where gangs prey on the weak. It's a far cry from the polished upper city areas we've seen before, suggesting the game will have some real social commentary alongside its time-bending mechanics. No release date yet, but this is definitely one to watch.The final reveal of the show was perhaps the biggest surprise, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, set in 2035. This isn't your typical modern warfare setup; the trailer suggested heavy sci-fi elements, psychological warfare, and the return of David Mason from Black Ops 2. The year 2035 apparently isn't going great for humanity, with the world ""on the brink of chaos"" following the events of previous Black Ops games.Treyarch and Raven Software are promising co-op campaign support, near-future weaponry, and the next chapter of Round-Based Zombies. The official reveal is coming this summer, but this teaser suggests the series is taking some big swings with its setting and tone.Sometimes the best announcements are the ones you can play immediately. Gears of War: Reloaded launches August 26, but Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members can jump into a multiplayer beta starting June 13. This definitive edition of the original Gears features 4K textures, 60 FPS campaign, 120 FPS multiplayer, and full cross-play support.The remaster is coming to more platforms than any Gears game before it, including PlayStation 5. It's a smart move from Microsoft, using one of their biggest exclusives to showcase their multi-platform strategy while giving longtime fans the definitive way to experience the game that started it all.Obsidian's surprise sequel announcement came with an immediate Early Access date, July 29, 2025. Grounded 2 moves the action from a single backyard to the larger Brookhollow Park, featuring new biomes, new bugs, and one of the community's most requested features: rideable vehicles called Buggies.The game promises major quality-of-life improvements over the original, including an all-in-one Omni-Tool that should streamline the building and crafting systems. With over 25 million players shaping the first game's development, this sequel feels like a direct response to community feedback.In the showcase's biggest surprise drop, Final Fantasy XVI is available on Xbox platforms right now. Not tomorrow, not next week, today. The game that many considered a permanent PlayStation exclusive just became part of Xbox's catalog, complete with Xbox Play Anywhere support and cross-save functionality.Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is following this winter, meaning Xbox players will soon have access to some of the most acclaimed JRPGs of recent years. Microsoft made sure to point out that every mainline single-player Final Fantasy is now playable on Xbox platforms, which is a pretty impressive collection to have.Three RPGs caught attention for their unique approaches to familiar genres. Aniimo is an open-world creature collecting game that lets players actually transform into the creatures they capture through something called the Twining system. It's hitting 2026 with a closed beta coming later this year.Aphelion from Don't Nod (Life is Strange, Jusant) is a sci-fi adventure about an astronaut stranded on a frozen planet. What makes it special is its partnership with the European Space Agency, promising gameplay grounded in real science. Beast of Reincarnation from Game Freak takes players to post-apocalyptic Japan with a cursed protagonist and her loyal dog companion fighting massive creatures.All three games are coming in 2026.Quarter Up announced Invincible VS , a 3v3 tag fighter based on the hit comic and animated series. The trailer showed appropriately brutal superhero combat with characters like Mark, Thula, and Atom Eve beating the absolute stuffing out of each other. It's coming in 2026 and looks like it could scratch that Marvel vs. Capcom itch.Mudang: Two Hearts is a tactical action game set in a reunified Korea, following a North Korean operative and a K-pop idol whose paths cross during terrorist attacks. The cinematic presentation and Unreal Engine 5 visuals make it one to watch for 2026.Persona 4 Revival got the briefest of teases, literally about seven seconds of footage, but it's enough to confirm that Atlus is giving the beloved JRPG a full remake treatment. No release date yet, but seeing those updated visuals of Inaba was enough to get fans excited.Three major Xbox exclusives are getting substantial content drops. The Elder Scrolls Online is continuing its Worm Cult storyline with new content arriving June 18. Fallout 76 added fishing with the Gone Fission update, because apparently even post-apocalyptic wasteland dwellers need to relax sometimes.Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is getting The Order of Giants DLC on September 4, taking Indy beneath the streets of Rome for a new adventure.The most anticipated indie game of the decade got its briefest of mentions, but sometimes that's all you need to send a fanbase into overdrive. Hollow Knight: Silksong appeared during the ROG Xbox Ally segment with a simple promise: it'll be available ""at launch and in Game Pass"" when the handheld arrives later this year. No new footage, no release date, just the confirmation that Team Cherry's long-awaited sequel is still breathing.The game's developer quickly clarified that Silksong isn't tied to the console's release and will arrive ""before Holiday,"" which has fans cautiously optimistic that Christmas 2025 might finally deliver the Metroidvania sequel they've been waiting years for. After countless delays and radio silence, even this tiny update feels like a victory for the Silksong faithful who've been subsisting on hope and memes for far too long.Phil Spencer closed the show by looking ahead to 2026 and Xbox's 25th anniversary. The confirmed lineup includes a new Fable, the next Forza game, Gears of War: E-Day, and what Spencer called ""the return of a classic that's been with us since the beginning."" Most fans are interpreting that last tease as Halo-related, possibly a Combat Evolved remake or remaster.It's a strong lineup for Xbox's quarter-century celebration, mixing beloved franchises with what sounds like a major nostalgic announcement. Whether it's Halo or something else entirely, Spencer clearly saved the biggest tease for last.","The Xbox Games Showcase 2025 delivered actual release dates, playable demos, and enough surprises to keep Twitter buzzing for weeks.

iPhone 16e: 5 Reasons to buy the most affordable iPhone 16 series model!

Apple announced its latest operating system – iOS 26 at the Worldwide Developers conference (WWDC) 2025 event recently. The update brings the all-new Liquid Glass design to iPhones along with other features like improved communication with redesigned Phone and Messages apps and more personalization to the Lock Screen and Home Screen. With iOS 26, Apple has significantly revamped the battery section, offering users a deeper understanding of how their iPhone usage affects battery life. Here’s what changesThe iOS 26 update introduces new analytics, smarter app breakdowns, and improved power management tools — all aimed at helping users extend their daily charge. Now located at the top of the Battery section in Settings is a real-time readout showing the current charge level along with the time of the last charge. If the phone is plugged in, it also displays the estimated time remaining for a full charge.One of the most notable changes is the redesigned usage breakdown. Apple has removed the previous 24-hour and 10-day tabs and replaced them with a single weekly view. This new layout compares current usage to your average, letting you know whether you're consuming more, less, or the same amount of battery as usual.Users can also review app-by-app battery consumption. iOS 26 now indicates whether an app spent more time onscreen, ran longer in the background, or triggered more notifications than normal—making it easier to spot what’s draining the battery.You can scroll back through the past seven days to examine daily usage, split between active screen time and idle screen time, along with charge times and durations.Apple has retained the Battery Health section, which includes details like charge cycles and maximum capacity. Meanwhile, the Charge Limit feature still allows users to cap charging at 80% to preserve battery health.In addition, iOS 26 introduces a new Adaptive Power Mode. This feature automatically detects when iPhone usage is higher than usual and subtly adjusts performance—like dimming the display or reducing background activity—to stretch battery life without user input. Low Power Mode also remains available as a manual toggle.The enhanced battery tools are rolling out with iOS 26 and iPadOS 26, though they do not yet apply to Macs. The developer beta is currently live, with a public beta expected next month. The official release is slated for September.","Apple announced its latest operating system – iOS 26 at the Worldwide Developers conference (WWDC) 2025 event.

Charges against Iurii Gugnin



Gugnin’s internet search history revealed he was aware of the legal consequences

HP EliteBook Ultra Review: Thin, light, power in a premium package

Iurii Gugnin , a 38-year-old founder of a US-based cryptocurrency payments company, has been charged with orchestrating an international money laundering scheme that allegedly channeled over $500 million through the American financial system on behalf of sanctioned Russian banks and other entities. According to the Department of Justice (DOJ), Gugnin used his companies – Evita investments and Evita Pay , to move millions of dollars between June 2023 and January 2025. He allegedly concealed the true origin and purpose of the funds. The transactions were primarily conducted using tether, a widely used stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, the DOJ said.Gugnin, also known as Iurii Mashukov and George Goognin, faces a sweeping 22-count indictment, including charges of wire fraud, bank fraud, money laundering, violating U.S. sanctions and export controls, and failing to implement anti-money laundering protocols.According to court documents, Gugnin is charged with wire and bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States, violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, failing to implement an effective anti-money laundering compliance program, failing to file suspicious activity reports, money laundering, and related conspiracy charges. Gugnin was arrested and arraigned today in New York.“The defendant is charged with turning a cryptocurrency company into a covert pipeline for dirty money, moving over half a billion dollars through the U.S. financial system to aid sanctioned Russian banks and help Russian end-users acquire sensitive U.S. technology,” said John A. Eisenberg, Assistant Attorney General for National Security. “The Department of Justice will not hesitate to bring to justice those who imperil our national security by enabling our foreign adversaries to sidestep sanctions and export controls.”Clients included individuals and businesses linked to Sberbank, VTB Bank, Sovcombank, Tinkoff, and state nuclear firm Rosatom. Prosecutors allege Gugnin lied to banks and digital asset platforms, falsified compliance documents, and used shell accounts and fake invoices to hide Russian ties.The indictment also claims Gugnin had direct ties to Russian intelligence operatives and officials in Iran, both of which are non-extradition countries. He is further accused of helping export controlled U.S. technology, including anti-terrorism-grade servers, to Russian clients.Federal investigators noted that Gugnin’s internet search history showed he was aware of legal jeopardy, with queries like “how to know if there is an investigation against you” and “money laundering penalties US.”Previously featured in a Wall Street Journal article about affluent renters, Gugnin was reportedly paying $19,000 a month for a Manhattan apartment. If convicted on all charges, Gugnin could face a sentence far exceeding the 30-year maximum for bank fraud alone.","Iurii Gugnin, 38, is the founder of a US-based cryptocurrency payments company.

Grok gets vision capabilities

Elon Musk-owned artificial intelligence (AI) company xAI is hiring engineers to build Grok app for both Windows and Mac laptops. Igor Babuschkin – co-founder and an engineer at xAI reposted a tweet by Sulaiman Khan Ghori - member of technical staff at the company that says: “Hiring engineers at @xai to help build our Mac product. If you have a track record of writing high-performance Swift and AppKit applications, would love to chat!”. “Join us to work on the X/Grok macOS app,” Babuschkin wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter).Tesla CEO and xAI owner Elon Musk reshared Babuschkin’s post. “We’re building both macOS and Windows apps. Can’t live in the browser forever!,” he wrote on X.Earlier this year in February, Musk announced that Grok chatbot will soon be available as a standalone app for both Apple’s’ macOS and Microsoft’s Windows operating systems for PCs. In the post, Musk then wrote: “Grok will also be offered as a standalone application for the MacOS and Windows.”In April, the company released new update to its Grok chatbot, enabling it to “see” the world around it. This new feature allows the chatbot to process and interpret visual inputs, marking a significant leap in AI-human interaction.The enhanced Grok chatbot uses advanced computer vision technology to analyse images and videos, providing context-aware responses. For instance, users can upload a photo of a product, and Grok can identify it, suggest uses, or even recommend similar items. This capability bridges the gap between text-based AI and real-world applications, making Grok more versatile and intuitive.","Elon Musk-owned artificial intelligence (AI) company xAI is hiring engineers to build Grok app for both Windows and Mac laptops.

Consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble, famously known as P&G, is expected to layoff around 7,000 non-manufacturing jobs during its next two fiscal years. This mass layoff, set to impact around 15% of its white-collar workforce, reflects a sweeping transformation toward digital integration, automation, AI-enhanced workflows, and regionalized supply chains.According to reports, P&G said that the cutting of jobs would be spread across its corporate departments, including R&D, marketing, finance, distribution planning, and other non-manufacturing functions. The layoffs encompass about 6% of the company's worldwide workforce and about 15% of its white-collar staff. It will phase in this period over fiscal years 2025 and 2026, so there is room for gradual transitions and internal redeployment.Importantly, P&G clarified that the layoffs will not affect factory or manufacturing workers. This signals a deliberate strategy to protect production continuity while streamlining knowledge-based and support functions through tech integration.The management in P&G has communicated that one major objective through restructuring is to look at reducing redundancies and automating repetitive work processes. Presently, advanced workflow software, RPA, and AI-powered systems can now be used to perform procurements and payroll analysis, and other work processes, meaning the sprawling back office teams are not required in the same way.Besides reducing cost through smaller team sizes, P&G is also restructuring jobs. Workers will now assume daily tasks with greater scope, guided by centralized data systems and decision-supporting platforms. It aims to create leaner, more flexible teams that respond to changing markets with greater speed.P&G has been investing heavily in digital tools, including machine learning algorithms for demand forecasting, AI-driven customer segmentation, and cloud-based supply chain management platforms. The layoffs are part of a broader operational shift to prioritize these digital systems over traditional workflows.With more than 2,800 research staff alone at its Mason Business Center, P&G is bound to reorient its R&D agenda. This involves shifting from traditional consumer testing processes and towards AI-fostered product innovation pipelines. Virtual testing environments, digital twin simulations, and predictive modeling are now at the forefront of the development process.To fight the rising tariffs and global supply chain disruptions, P&G is revolutionizing its supply chain through technology. It is introducing intelligent inventory systems, local distribution centers, and digital freight tracking solutions. These changes will reduce delivery time, cut costs, and improve responsiveness to localized demand, all without increasing headcount.P&G has reported increased pressure from inflation and international tariffs, particularly on materials sourced from Asia. The company expects $600 million in additional pre-tax costs in 2025 due to these factors. By streamlining operations and digitizing logistics, P&G aims to mitigate these cost burdens.With currency volatility and a slower-than-expected post-COVID recovery in key markets, P&G is preparing for a leaner, more adaptive operating model. The digital transformation acts as an advance guard to mitigate the impact of recession.The layoffs will roll out gradually over two years, allowing for retraining and reassignment of certain roles. Some positions may be replaced by internal promotions into digitally enhanced roles. However, many corporate departments, especially those relying heavily on traditional workflows, will face contractions.Some of P&G's biggest non-manufacturing operations are based in Ohio, including R&D, logistics, and administrative offices. Yet, no WARN notices have been filed for Ohio locations such as Mason or Union. Local governments are, however, on high alert. More detail should emerge once the company provides its July earnings call.The company expects to incur $1 billion to $1.6 billion in restructuring charges related to severance and system reconfiguration. These costs will be spread across fiscal years 2025 and 2026.Despite the cuts, P&G has continued to perform financially. It reported steady organic growth (around 4%) and maintained solid margins even in volatile markets. Shareholders have reacted with cautious optimism, keeping P&G stock within a $156–$180 price band.","P&G to cut 7,000 jobs in the US, the company’s largest R&D centre to be hit.

The feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump seems to be easing, as the President sounded more open and friendly when asked if he would talk to the Tesla CEO. At a White House conference earlier today, a reporter asked Trump: “Do you plan to speak to Elon Musk on the phone any time soon?”. To this, the US President replied “Umm... I haven’t really thought about it actually. I would imagine he wants to speak to me. If I were him, I would want to speak to me. Maybe he’s already called. You’d have to ask him. Ask him if he’s already called. But I’d have no problems with it.”“We had a good relationship and I just wish him well, very well actually,” he added.Trump’s comments signal a possible thaw in tensions between him and Musk. Feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk escalated last week when the latter publicly criticized the president’s domestic legislation called the “One Big, Beautiful Bill”. In several posts on X, Musk accused Trump of lying, claiming that the bill was “never shown” to him “even once”. Musk further alleged that the bill was passed in the “dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!”.The tech billionaire dropped a “really big bomb” making a striking allegation that the president’s name in Jeffery Epstein files. Musk later deleted the post. The clash grew more intense when Musk suggested starting a new political group called ""the American Party,"" leading Trump to warn that he would take action if Musk supported Democratic candidates with money.Days later, Musk deleted some of his most damaging posts on X (formerly Twitter) against Donald Trump, seemingly attempting to walk back the explosive claim. One such post that Musk has deleted is where he apparently supported Trump's impeachment as President and that JD Vance should replace him as the US President.Musk also deleted the post where he claimed Trump was linked to the infamous child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein , alleging, “That is the real reason [the Epstein files] have not been made public.” He added, “Mark this post for the future.

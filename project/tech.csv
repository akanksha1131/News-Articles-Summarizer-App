Marco Rubio's Cable also has specific dates

Visa types specified in the Marco Rubio's cable

What you post on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other social media platforms has never been more important. Especially, if you are planning to apply for the US visa. The US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has reportedly ordered diplomats overseas to scrutinize the social media content of some applicants for student and other types of visas. According to a report in The New York Times, quoting US government officials, the aim of scouring social media accounts of the US Visa applicants is an effort to bar those suspected of criticizing the United States and Israel from entering America.The US secretary of state reportedly laid out the instructions in a long Cable sent to diplomatic missions across the world on March 25. Rubio’s directive reportedly said that starting immediately, consular officers must refer certain student and exchange visitor visa applicants to the “fraud prevention unit” for a “mandatory social media check”. For those unaware, the fraud prevention unit of an embassy’s or consulate’s section for consular affairs helps screen applicants.The cable sent by Marco Rubio reportedly described the broad parameters that diplomats should use to judge whether an applicant needs to be denied a visa. It is said to specify a type of applicant whose social media posts should be scrutinized. These reportedly include: Someone who is suspected of having terrorist ties or sympathies; who had a student or exchange visa between October 7, 2023, and August 31, 2024; or who has had a visa terminated since that October date.The dates specified by Marco Rubio in the Cable are said to indicate that one of the main aims of the social media searches is to reject the applications of international students who have expressed sympathy for Palestinians during the war.The Cable further states that the applicants can be denied a visa if their behavior or actions show they bear “a hostile attitude toward U.S. citizens or U.S. culture (including government, institutions, or founding principles).”The requested visa types that would set off extra scrutiny as per the Cable are reported to be: F, M and J, which is student and exchange visitor visas. The details of the Cable were first reported by an independent news site, 'The Handbasket'.In mid-March, a State Department spokesperson reportedly said in an email that “all available technology” was being used to screen visa applicants and visa holders. The spokesperson made the comment replying to a question from The New York Times about whether the department was using artificial intelligence to scan databases and social media posts to find visa holders to decide those whose visa should be revoked.","US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has reportedly ordered diplomats overseas to scrutinize the social media content of some applicants for student and other types of visas.

Bryan Johnson says he has quit a drug popular in anti-ageing circles after it actually accelerated his aging process,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bryan-johnson-says-he-has-quit-a-drug-popular-in-anti-ageing-circles-after-it-actually-accelerated-his-aging-process/articleshow/120240974.cms,"(Pic courtesy: Youtube/ Bryan johnson)

The drug that Bryan Johnson says accelerated his aging process

Anti-aging influencer Bryan Johnson , known for his extreme $2 million annual health regimen aimed at reversing aging, has publicly admitted that a key component of his protocol, the drug Rapamycin, may have been detrimental to his health. In a recent YouTube video, the 46-year-old biohacker revealed he experienced several negative side effects after five years of carefully adjusting his Rapamycin dosage.The immunosuppressant, initially developed for organ transplant recipients, gained popularity in anti-aging circles due to studies suggesting it could extend lifespan by targeting the mTOR pathway. Johnson was inspired by research showing increased lifespan in mice and improved health outcomes in a human trial.However, instead of the anticipated rejuvenation, Johnson suffered from mouth ulcers, slow-healing wounds, elevated cholesterol, and blood glucose spikes. Most concerning was a sustained increase in his resting heart rate, a crucial metric for his recovery and sleep quality. These physiological changes prompted him to discontinue the drug.Adding to his concerns, a recent Yale University study challenged the purported anti-aging benefits of Rapamycin, suggesting it might actually accelerate biological aging by negatively impacting epigenetic markers.Despite the setback, Johnson stated that stopping Rapamycin was a ""reset,"" not a surrender, emphasizing the importance of sharing both successes and failures in the pursuit of understanding how to slow aging. He acknowledged the irony of a central element of his meticulously planned regimen potentially causing harm, stating, ""To those of you laughing at home, I’m laughing with you."" Johnson maintains that his approach is part of a scientific exploration, accepting the risks involved in trying to identify interventions that genuinely impact the aging process.","Bryan Johnson, known for his extreme $2 million annual health regimen aimed at reversing aging, has publicly admitted that a key component of his protocol, the drug Rapamycin, may have been detrimental to his health.

A group of hackers has threatened to launch an attack on sites linked to Elon Musk . The cybercrime group named DonRoad Team, which had earlier claimed responsibility for taking down several websites associated with US President Donald Trump, has now announced that it would start targeting sites associated with Tesla and SpaceX CEO. The group also shared its intent to attack sites associated with the tech billionaire over a month. Previously, the DonRoad Team has claimed responsibility for its attacks in March that targeted The Trump Organization's website, as well as Tesla and SpaceX email servers, causing temporary global outages at the time. This comes after Musk-owned social media platform X (earlier Twitter) was targeted by a group of pro-Palestinian hackers who were able to disable the site for several hours.In a post (seen by Newsweek) shared on messaging platform Telegram, the hackers said: “In the next few hours, we will be suspending all websites affiliated with Elon Musk companies for a full month.”However, the Telegram post was later removed. Should these hacks occur, they may impact multiple Musk-related websites, including X and his AI platforms Grok and Tesla. Hackers may also target websites of other companies owned by Musk, like SpaceX and Tesla.In March, Musk-owned X experienced at least three major outages following a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. —a cyber assault that floods networks or devices with bot-generated traffic. The Dark Storm Team claimed responsibility for the incident.Reacting to the cyberattack, Musk at that time took to X to write: There was (still is) a massive cyberattack against 𝕏. We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing …”Later, in a Fox Business interview, Musk noted: “There was a massive cyber attack to try to bring down the X system with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area.”In a separate event in February, the website for the Department of Government Efficiency, of which Musk is a member, was compromised and altered to mock him and his team.The hacked site temporarily displayed a prominent message stating, “This is a joke of a .gov site,"" alongside the note, ""THESE 'EXPERTS' LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN.”",Hackers threaten to launch an attack on sites linked to Elon Musk.

"Walmart Boycott: World's largest retailer tells protesters, 'we are America's ...'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/walmart-boycott-worlds-largest-retailer-tells-protesters-we-are-americas-/articleshow/120119363.cms,"Here's what Walmart said about the protest

People's Union USA founder John Schwarz has announced on social media details of upcoming planned boycotts:

Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, has issued a statement addressing the ongoing week-long boycott organised by the People’s Union USA . The boycott, dubbed the "" Walmart Blackout ,"" began on April 7 and targets the company’s rollback of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, as well as broader concerns over corporate influence and tax policies .The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity. The group’s founder, John Schwarz, urged consumers to avoid shopping at Walmart stores, using its online services, or purchasing from its subsidiaries like Sam’s Club. Schwarz stated, “We are holding these companies accountable so they finally step up and pay their fair share of taxes to alleviate federal income tax from the working-class citizen.”In response, Walmart defended its contributions to communities and the economy. “Serving communities is at the heart of Walmart's purpose to help people save money and live better,” the company said in a statement. “As one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, not only do we pay our fair share, we are an economic force multiplier strengthening communities nationwide through job creation, supplier growth, and over $1.7 billion in cash and in-kind donations last year.”The boycott follows Walmart’s decision last November to discontinue its five-year commitment to a racial equity center and other DEI programs. Critics argue that these rollbacks undermine progress in promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Walmart, however, emphasised its dedication to supporting local charities, disaster response, hunger relief, workforce development, and conservation efforts.A report from SuperMarketNews, citing data from Numerator, suggests that Walmart may be more resistant to boycotts compared to other retailers. The data indicates that Walmart has not experienced significant impact from households regarding its stance on non-DEI initiatives, particularly among multicultural households—a trend that contrasts with another retail chain Target.Target reportedly faced the most severe backlash during the February 28 boycott focused on DEI initiatives, experiencing a 9% drop in web traffic on the day of the protest, according to Forbes. In comparison, Walmart observed a 5% decline in web traffic, while Amazon saw the smallest decrease, at 2%.* Walmart: April 7-14 and May 20-26* Second economic blackout: April 18* General Mills: April 21-28* Amazon: May 6-12* Target: June 3-9* McDonald's: June 24-30* Independence Day boycott: July 4","The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity.

To replicate this:Add Particle Effects: Animate rain, leaves, or fireflies to create a magical ambiance.Adjust Lighting and Shadows: Use soft, dynamic lighting to evoke different moods.Simulate Camera Movements: Incorporate slow pans, zooms, and tracking shots for a cinematic effect.No Ghibli-inspired animation is complete without a captivating soundtrack.Background Score: Choose soothing, orchestral music that evokes nostalgia and wonder.Ambient Sounds: Add subtle environmental sounds (rustling leaves, chirping birds) for realism.Dialogue and Foley: Sync character speech and sound effects to the animation timeline.After perfecting your animation:Choose the appropriate export settings for your platform.Ensure a high-resolution export (1080p or 4K) for crisp visuals.Test your video for any frame drops or inconsistencies before finalizing.Users must be mindful of copyright restrictions when using AI-generated images, especially for commercial purposes as using copyrighted images as input could raise legal issues.","Studio Ghibli is an esteemed Japanese animation studio known for movies like Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro, and Howl's Moving Castle.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female. The change aligns with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January 2025, titled ‘Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government’. The updated policy, which took effect on April 2, applies to all pending and future immigration benefit requests. “USCIS is returning to its historical policy of recognizing two biological sexes,” the agency said in a press statement.Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security , said “There are only two sexes—male and female. President Trump promised the American people a revolution of common sense, and that includes making sure that the policy of the U.S. government agrees with simple biological reality. Proper management of our immigration system is a matter of national security, not a place to promote and coddle an ideology that permanently harms children and robs real women of their dignity, safety, and well-being.”Under the new guidance, a person’s sex will be determined based on the birth certificate issued at or closest to the time of birth. “If the birth certificate issued at or nearest to the time of birth indicates a sex other than male or female, USCIS will base the determination of sex on secondary evidence. See Volume 1, General Policies and Procedures, Part E, Adjudications, Chapter 6, Evidence, Section B, Primary and Secondary Evidence [1 USCIS-PM E.6(B)],” the agency stated.The agency further added that the benefits will not be denied solely based on how someone identifies their sex, it also confirmed that it does not issue documents with a blank sex field or one that differs from the original birth certificate. Any discrepancies may lead to processing delays.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female.

""Now with just a tap, users can share only the necessary data, giving them complete control over their personal information,"" Vaishnaw said in a post shared on Twitter.Verification through the new app works similarly to UPI payments, where users can authenticate their identity by scanning QR codes at hotels, shops, airports, and other verification points. The facial recognition feature adds an additional security layer, ensuring only the rightful owner can authorize information transfer.""No need to hand over Aadhaar photocopy at hotel receptions, shops or during travel,"" the minister noted, highlighting the app's convenience for everyday scenarios.The app’s features include 100% digital and secure identity verification , protection against data misuse or leaks, and prevention of document forgery. The app represents a significant upgrade from its predecessor with a more user-friendly interface and enhanced privacy safeguards.Initially available to a select group including participants of the Aadhaar Samvaad event, UIDAI plans to release the app widely following user feedback. The technology integrates with India's digital public infrastructure while maintaining strong privacy protections.The Aadhaar facial authentication system has already gained widespread adoption, recording over 15 crore transactions monthly across various sectors, according to UIDAI officials.","The app, currently in beta testing, allows users to share only necessary data through secure digital means.

"Apple, tech sector get relief: Smartphones, laptops excluded and other key electronics exempted from Trump Tariffs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-tech-sector-gets-relief-smartphones-laptops-excluded-and-other-key-electronics-exempted-from-trump-tariffs/articleshow/120236285.cms,"Phones, PCs, chips exempted from Trump’s reciprocal tariffs

The US Customs and Border Protection has released new guidelines that specify certain technology devices and components will be exempt from reciprocal tariffs initiated by US President Donald Trump . The latest notice comes as previous action had raised significant concerns for technology companies, most notably Apple , which manufactures the majority of its iPhones and other products within China.According to a report by CNBC, the information was disseminated late Friday (April 11) evening. The latest guidance is a direct response to President Trump's earlier decision to impose a 145% tariff on products originating from China.The newly-issued tariff guidance identifies a range of electronics that will receive exclusions. This list includes laptops, semiconductors, solar cells, flat panel television displays, flash drives, memory cards, and solid-state drives, all of which are used for data storage.Notably, these products may be subject to future duties. These exemptions represent a somewhat favourable outcome for technology companies such as Apple. As per data from Evercore ISI, Apple manufactures over 80% of its products in China, including 80% of iPads and more than half of its Mac computers.Recently, Apple experienced a loss of over $640 billion in market value in the period following President Trump's tariff announcement.Moreover, Apple reportedly chartered multiple cargo flights to ship an estimated 1.5 million iPhones, weighing approximately 600 tons, from India to the US. This move aimed at ramping up inventory in the home country to mitigate the potential impact of tariffs previously threatened by Trump.","US Customs and Border Protection has released new guidelines that specify certain technology devices and components will be exempt from reciprocal tariffs initiated by US President Donald Trump.

Donald Trump just gave Samsung a 'huge problem' and it is called Vietnam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trump-just-gave-samsung-a-huge-problem-and-it-is-called-vietnam/articleshow/120230325.cms,"Vietnam's role in Samsung's operations

Impact on Samsung and Vietnam

US President Donald Trump's latest tariff hikes have created a significant challenge for Samsung Electronics, with Vietnam emerging as a focal point of the escalating trade tensions. The new tariffs, which raise duties on Vietnamese exports to the US to 46%, threaten to disrupt Samsung's global supply chain and its reliance on Vietnam as a manufacturing hub.Vietnam has been a cornerstone of Samsung's manufacturing strategy since the South Korean tech giant entered the country in 1989. The company produces 60% of its global smartphone output in Vietnam, with many of these devices destined for the US, where Samsung is the second-largest smartphone vendor. Vietnam's $120 billion trade surplus with the US has now placed it squarely in the crosshairs of Trump's tariff policies.The tariff hike has exposed vulnerabilities in Vietnam's export-driven economy and Samsung's heavy reliance on the country. While Vietnam has secured a temporary reprieve with a 90-day pause on the full tariff implementation, the uncertainty has already prompted Samsung and its suppliers to explore alternative production strategies. Options include increasing output in India or South Korea, though these shifts would be costly and time-consuming.The tariffs not only jeopardize Samsung's operations but also highlight the risks of over-reliance on a single manufacturing base. Vietnam, which has benefited from companies diversifying away from China, now faces challenges such as rising labor costs, power supply issues, and the loss of earlier tax incentives.","Vietnam has been a cornerstone of Samsung's manufacturing strategy since 1989.

Third UPI disruption in about three weeks

UPI outage: Users flock to social media

🚨UPI is down, Please carry your wallet

Facing trouble with #GPay, #PhonePe or #Paytm?

You’re NOT alone — #UPI is down across India!

Users are flooding Downdetector with complaints.

Payments failing.

Just finished lunch like a boss but when I tried paying via UPI—boom! Server down. Now I’m just sitting in hotel like a wanted criminal full stomach but cooked RIP to me! 💀

UPI is down again today, all payment are getting failed.

Atleast there should be prior intimation sent incase of planned outage.

So we can plan accordingly

UPI services appear to have returned to normal. Downdetector reports show a significant decrease in complaints, with only 225 at the time of writing. NPCI has not issued an update.UPI experienced yet another service outage, resulting in thousands of users reporting their inability to make payments and execute fund transfers. Downdetector reported a peak of over 2,200 user complaints concerning UPI services, primarily related to failed payment transactions and fund transfers.The disruption has affected a broad range of major payment platforms, including Google Pay , PhonePe , and Paytm, as well as various banking applications. Notably, the TOI Tech team's attempts to make payments and transfer funds were also unsuccessful.Downdetector's data further indicated reports of service disruptions affecting both State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI and HDFC as well as Google Pay, demonstrating the expanded reach of the technical difficulties.The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), the entity responsible for the operation of the UPI network, has acknowledged the issue and said that it is working to resolve the disruption.""NPCI is currently facing intermittent technical issues, leading to partial UPI transaction declines. We are working to resolve the issue, and will keep you updated. We regret the inconvenience caused,"" NPCI said in a post on X.This disruption marks a recurrence of technical difficulties that have recently plagued the digital payment system, making this the third instance in a matter of about three weeks that the UPI service is down for a large number of users.The first instance occurred on March 26 when UPI users encountered challenges in completing their transactions. NPCI attributed these issues to an “intermittent technical issue.”At that time, NPCI acknowledged the disruption and subsequently reported that the system had been restored to normal operation. Subsequently, on April 2, Downdetector recorded hundreds of outage reports, with approximately half of the reported issues related to fund transfers.Social media, especially Elon Musk-owned X, is flooded with memes and posts on the outage.","Third UPI disruption in about three weeks.

Pop superstar Katy Perry is making final preparations for Monday's groundbreaking all-female Blue Origin spaceflight alongside Jeff Bezos ' fiancée Lauren Sanchez , journalist Gayle King , and three other women.""I am feeling so grateful and grounded and honored to be invited and included with this incredible group of women,"" Perry told The Associated Press during an interview at her Southern California rehearsal space on Wednesday.The 40-year-old singer has been ""psychologically"" preparing for the April 14 mission by reading works by the late Carl Sagan and studying string theory. Before bed, Perry has been immersing herself in space science.""I was listening to 'Cosmos' by Carl Sagan and reading a book on string theory,"" she recalled. ""I've always been interested in astrophysics and interested in astronomy and astrology and the stars.""The mission represents a historic moment for women in space, as only 14% of space travelers have been female since Valentina Tereshkova's solo spaceflight in 1963.""It's an important moment for the future of commercial space travel and for humanity in general and for women all around,"" Perry said. ""I just feel like, 'Put us in coach.'""To build confidence, Perry employs daily affirmations: ""I am talking to myself every day and going, 'You're brave, you're bold, you are doing this for the next generation to inspire so many different people but especially young girls to go, ""I'll go to space in the future."" No limitations.'""Announced by Blue Origin in February, the 10-minute flight from West Texas will include Sanchez, Perry, King, former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, research scientist Amanda Nguyen , and movie producer Kerianne Flynn.Perry draws strength from her maternal experience when facing challenges. ""Using that feminine divine that I was born with and definitely unlocked when I had my daughter even more. It leveled up for sure,"" she said.","Katy Perry is making final preparations for Monday's groundbreaking all-female Blue Origin spaceflight.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India's largest IT services firm by revenue, has announced it will defer employee salary hikes that were scheduled to begin in April 2025, citing global economic uncertainty and tariff concerns.""Because of the uncertain environment, we will decide during the year on wage hikes. It can be at any time, depending on business,"" said Milind Lakkad , Chief Human Resources Officer, during the company's post-Q4 earnings press conference in Mumbai on Thursday.The decision comes as TCS reported mixed financial results, with a 5.3% year-on-year increase in consolidated revenue to ₹64,479 crore for the quarter ended March 2025. However, net profit dipped 1.7% to ₹12,224 crore, missing analyst expectations.CEO K Krithivasan pointed to specific market challenges, noting, ""There will be delays in discretionary spending if this continues,"" referring to the ongoing tariff war between the US and other countries.Despite the salary freeze, TCS will maintain quarterly variable payouts. For Q4, 70% of employees will receive their full variable pay, while others will receive amounts based on business performance.The company has continued hiring, adding 625 employees in the fourth quarter alone. TCS closed FY25 with a workforce of 607,979, representing a net addition of 6,433 employees over the year.""We continue to hire from campuses, and the number could be slightly higher this year than what we added last year,"" Lakkad said, confirming plans to recruit approximately 42,000 fresh graduates in FY26.This cautious approach echoes a similar decision made by the company during the COVID-19 pandemic.

EU chief to Donald Trump: There are no winners in this, only losers

EU chief accepts: WTO has failed

The European Union is prepared to significantly escalate its trade dispute with the United States, potentially imposing levies on major US digital companies like Meta, Google, and Facebook if negotiations with Donald Trump fail to resolve his ongoing tariff war against Europe. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen issued a stark warning in an interview with the Financial Times, stating that the EU is developing retaliatory measures, including a possible tax on digital advertising revenues, targeting the services sector.Von der Leyen's comments come as the EU grants a 90-day pause on its planned retaliation against recent US steel and aluminum tariffs, imposed last month by the Trump administration. These initial countermeasures would have affected approximately €21 billion of US imports. The Commission president emphasized the EU's desire for a ""completely balanced"" agreement with Washington during this negotiation window.However, she made it clear that the EU is ready to deploy its most powerful trade tools, including the bloc’s anti-coercion instrument, which has the power to target services exports. Von der Leyen explicitly mentioned a levy on the advertising revenues of digital services as a potential measure if talks fail. This would represent a tariff applied across the entire EU single market, differing from existing digital sales taxes implemented individually by member states.Von Der Leyen described Trump's trade war as a ""complete inflection point in global trade"" and a ""turning point with the United States,"" asserting that a return to the previous status quo is no longer possible. She cautioned that ""there are no winners in this, only losers,"" highlighting the current turmoil in stock and bond markets as the ""cost of chaos"" and uncertainty.While open to discussing the alignment of EU and US product standards, Von Der Leyen downplayed expectations for significant progress in this area, citing fundamental differences in lifestyle and culture. Crucially, she ruled out any negotiation on the EU's digital content and market power regulations, which are viewed by the Trump administration as de facto taxes on US Big Tech firms. Similarly, she stated that the EU's value-added tax (VAT) is a sovereign decision and not subject to negotiation.Von der Leyen acknowledged the shared concerns of both the EU and the US regarding the failures of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to ensure a level playing field, particularly concerning Chinese industrial subsidies. She stated that the current crisis has spurred discussions on the need to ""modernise, reform and stabilise the WTO,"" emphasizing that reform, rather than simply preserving the existing system, is essential.","European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen issued a stark warning in an interview with the Financial Times.

'Some bankruptcies need to happen': Elon Musk’s old recession quote resurfaces as US stock market struggles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/some-bankruptcies-need-to-happen-elon-musks-old-recession-quote-resurfaces-as-us-stock-market-struggles/articleshow/120215587.cms,"When Elon Musk said recession is a good thing

Elon Musk on recession: ‘It’s been raining money on fools for too long’

“This is actually a good thing. It has been raining money on fools for too long. Some bankruptcies need to happen.”

Trump’s 10% tariff sparks fresh recession fears in 2025

“It’s likely we’re headed for a recession because of the president’s ill-advised plans.”

Business leaders sound the alarm

Elon Musk shifts stance, opposes Trump’s new tariffs in global appeal

“We should have no tariffs, ideally. I believe in free trade.”

In a world where economic cycles often oscillate between growth and contraction, comments made during one period can resurface with striking relevance in another. In May 2022, amid the post-COVID financial tremors, Tesla CEO Elon Musk described a recession as “a good thing,” arguing that it would cleanse the market of inefficiencies and poor investments. Fast forward to 2025, and global economic anxieties have returned—this time stoked by the ripple effects of aggressive new tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.What was once a commentary on pandemic-era financial practices now finds new meaning amid warnings of a looming downturn. Here’s the context of Musk’s original remarks, the changing economic landscape, and the mounting pressure on policymakers as industry leaders urge a course correction.In May 2022, Musk responded to growing concerns about inflation and economic instability by embracing the idea of a recession. Taking to X (formerly Twitter), he wrote:At the time, markets were reeling from supply chain disruptions, pandemic-driven stimulus programs, and excessive valuations across tech and speculative sectors. Musk’s position was that an economic downturn would eliminate weak companies and restore discipline to financial markets.Now, in 2025, recession fears are no longer hypothetical. According to an The Economic Times report, President Donald Trump’s latest policy announcement—a blanket 10% tariff on all imports into the United States—has triggered alarm across global markets. This move is compounded by heightened tariffs on products from China, Europe, and other major trading partners.Wall Street veteran Jim Cramer warned that the US economy may not be able to absorb these new trade barriers without consequences. In a recent CNBC appearance, he stated:Economists suggest that tariffs could lead to a resurgence in inflation, increased production costs, and reduced consumer purchasing power—significantly raising the risk of a broader economic slowdown.As per reports, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon added his voice to the growing chorus of concern, citing inflationary pressures and declining business confidence. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also released a statement suggesting that global GDP growth may decelerate if trade tensions continue.The risk is not only domestic. Europe, one of the United States' largest trading partners, has hinted at retaliatory measures. Analysts warn that a transatlantic tariff escalation could spark a full-blown trade war, putting additional strain on supply chains and investor confidence.Despite his 2022 embrace of economic correction, Musk has now publicly urged President Trump to reverse the new tariffs. During a virtual appearance at a conference hosted by Italy’s League Party, Musk advocated for zero tariffs between the US and Europe. According to reports from the Washington Post, he stated:This shift suggests a nuanced evolution in Musk’s economic perspective. While he previously endorsed market-driven contractions, he now appears to recognize the broader geopolitical and financial risks of aggressive policy decisions.","In May 2022, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said a recession would cleanse the market of inefficiencies and poor investments.

Bill Gates reveals the one trait that could’ve made him a better manager,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-reveals-the-one-trait-that-couldve-made-him-abettermanager/articleshow/120214749.cms,"Bill Gates reveals the one trait that could’ve made him a better manager

Why Bill Gates thinks his old leadership style held Microsoft back

“I think if you want to work hard and not fool yourself, you better be pretty hard on yourself,”

“We were a fairly homogeneous, very engineering-orientated group,”

Bill Gates admits: ‘If you can’t do math, you can’t do anything’ was a mistake

“I sort of thought, if you can do math, you can do anything. And if you can’t do math, you can’t do anything,”

The turning point: From tech titan to global collaborator

“I was able to take mistakes I'd made, and learnings from Microsoft, and bring that to the foundation,”

Why Bill Gates says great managers adapt, not demand

“The one change that could’ve made me a better manager earlier?”

“Recognizing that talent isn’t one-size-fits-all.”

Bill Gates finds joy in learning, even after changing the world

“It is a lot of fun,” Gates said. “I get to work with smart people. I'm learning all the time. I get to travel the world.”

In a rare and candid conversation on the ""People by WTF"" podcast, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates offered a revealing account of his evolution as a leader—from the intense early years at Microsoft to his more collaborative role in global philanthropy today. Speaking with host Nikhil Kamath, Gates unpacked how his high standards and exacting personal discipline once hindered his ability to manage others effectively.His reflections shed light on the challenges of leadership in the fast-paced world of tech and the importance of adaptability, empathy, and recognizing diverse forms of talent. As Gates shared, becoming a good manager was a process of trial, error, and deep self-examination—lessons he would later apply with greater impact at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.During the formative years of Microsoft, Gates admitted that his leadership approach mirrored the way he treated himself—relentlessly high-pressure and narrowly focused on intellectual excellence.Gates explained, acknowledging how this mindset translated into his management approach.His internal expectations, based on a rigorous work ethic and technical prowess, created a performance culture that favored those who shared his engineering mindset. However, this style proved limiting.Gates said.This homogeneity, he acknowledged, led to missed opportunities to recruit and retain talented individuals who didn't fit the mold but could have brought valuable perspectives.Gates described how he once held a binary view of talent—believing that proficiency in mathematics was the primary indicator of potential.he confessed.This reductive thinking shaped Microsoft’s early culture, where analytical prowess often overshadowed other skills like communication, leadership, and cross-functional collaboration. Gates now views this assumption as a significant blind spot in his early career.The transformation in Gates’ management philosophy accelerated after he transitioned to full-time work at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Unlike in the tech sector, the foundation required broad, multidisciplinary collaboration—working with policymakers, health experts, educators, and community leaders.he said.At the foundation, success depended not just on IQ or coding skills but on empathy, negotiation, and cultural awareness—qualities that had been undervalued in Microsoft’s early days.One of Gates’ most important takeaways was the realization that intelligence and capability come in many forms. Leadership, he learned, requires more than managing deliverables—it requires recognizing the diverse strengths of team members and adapting one’s style accordingly.Gates reflected.This lesson became central to his work in philanthropy, where success is rarely achieved in isolation and often depends on partnerships across sectors and continents.Today, Gates continues to apply his trademark discipline, but without the rigidity that once characterized his leadership. He remains deeply involved in global initiatives and thrives in environments where learning and collaboration are prioritized.Despite decades of success, Gates emphasised that he is still learning—and still evolving.","Bill Gates reveals the one trait that could’ve made him a better manager.

Zuckerberg's obsession with conquering China and its challenges



How Zuckerberg‚Äôs ambition to conquer China led to questionable actions at Facebook



Also Read |

Meta's founder, Mark Zuckerberg , is best known for his incessant drive to control the global market, most notably in China. China's huge potential market presented itself as a prime target for Zuckerberg's ambitions. He did much to attempt to penetrate this extremely profitable market over the years. One interesting feature of this quest was Zuckerberg's dedication to studying Mandarin, the most commonly spoken language in China, which reflected his seriousness about gaining a presence in the nation.In Sarah Wynn-Williams ' recently released memoir, Careless People, she uncovers even more astonishing facts about Zuckerberg's dedication to breaking into China. Wynn-Williams, who used to work as a director of global public policy at Facebook, shares her experience at the company and how far Zuckerberg would go. One of the most shocking revelations is that Zuckerberg, in his effort to establish stronger relationships with China, went so far as to ask Chinese President Xi Jinping to choose a name for his unborn child. This move was rejected politely by Xi Jinping.As per reports, China is portrayed in Wynn-Williams' book as Zuckerberg's ""white whale,"" a phrase that refers to an elusive dream that obsessed him during his career. Although he tried, Zuckerberg's ambition to dominate China proved elusive, with him having encountered several obstacles, such as China's stringent censorship policies and the nation's love for home-grown social media sites like WeChat and Weibo instead of Facebook.Wynn-Williams' narrative portrays Zuckerberg's fierce ambition, which she asserts has been an enduring personal and professional fixation. She highlights the way China continued to be an evasive market for Zuckerberg, no matter how hard he tried.Zuckerberg's push to grow Facebook's influence in China reportedly caused the company to take some morally dubious actions. Wynn-Williams uncovers that Facebook might have sacrificed user privacy in its efforts to penetrate the Chinese market. For instance, she asserts that Facebook promised Chinese officials that it would be supportive of the nation's social order and even gave Chinese engineers confidential details about its facial-recognition technology.In addition, the company reportedly offered to assist the Chinese government in censoring viral content by supplying a blacklist of banned material. This would have brought Facebook's operations more in line with the Chinese government's strict control of the flow of information.Along with the contentious business moves, Wynn-Williams also describes a very intimate exchange between Zuckerberg and President Xi Jinping in 2015. Zuckerberg supposedly requested Xi during a meeting to ""do him the honour of naming his unborn child."" This unexpected request was eventually refused by Xi Jinping. Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan were pregnant at the time with their first child, a girl born in December 2015 and named Maxima.",Mark Zuckerberg is best known for his incessant drive to control the global market.

Reasons why and how Starlink may not become a worry for Airtel and Reliance Jio in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/reasons-why-and-how-starlink-may-not-become-a-worry-for-airtel-and-reliance-jio-in-india/articleshow/119130562.cms,"the superior pricing, higher speeds, and unlimited data offered by

and Bharti Airtel's home broadband plans will keep them firmly in the lead.

Airtel and Reliance Platforms tie-up with Elon Musk's Starlink

Starlink's entry into the Indian broadband market is unlikely to pose a significant threat to established telecom giants Jio and Bharti Airtel , according to a report by JM Financial. The analysis suggests thatInstead of direct competition, the report anticipates that Elo Musk's Starlink satellite-based services will primarily serve to complement the existing networks of Indian telcos, playing a crucial role in expanding high-speed internet access to remote and underserved rural areas across the country.The cost disparity is a key factor. Globally, Starlink's satellite internet plans range from $10 to $500 per month, with an additional one-time hardware cost of $250 to $380. In contrast, Indian telecom companies offer home broadband plans starting as low as $5 to $7 per month, with premium plans providing 1Gbps speeds and access to streaming services for approximately $47 per month. Furthermore, unlike Reliance Jio and Airtel's unlimited data offerings, Starlink's plans come with data caps.Given India's price-sensitive market, Starlink's higher costs and speed limitations is likely to make it a less competitive option for users. This reinforces the expectation that its primary role will be in reaching rural and underserved regions, rather than directly challenging Reliance Jio and Bharti's Fiber and AirFiber broadband services.While Reliance Platforms and Bharti have announced agreements with SpaceX to distribute Starlink's broadband services in India ‚Äì including selling equipment through their retail outlets and offering services to rural businesses, schools, and health centers ‚Äì these collaborations are currently pending regulatory approval for SpaceX to operate in the country.Looking ahead, while there is potential for future collaboration in direct-to-cell satellite services, similar to Starlink's partnerships with telecom companies globally, industry experts remain skeptical about its potential to disrupt India's wireless market. Technical challenges, such as maintaining reliable smartphone connectivity due to power and antenna limitations, Starlink's dependence on telcos for 4G/LTE spectrum access, and the generally slower and less reliable performance of satellite internet compared to fiber or traditional wireless services are cited as key reasons.The revenue generated by Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel from selling Starlink's equipment is not expected to significantly impact their overall earnings. Both companies already have their own more advanced satellite broadband ventures ‚Äì Bharti with Eutelsat OneWeb and Reliance Jio with SES (Orbit Connect India) ‚Äì which are further along in the process of securing regulatory approvals in India.Despite Starlink's large network of over 6,400 low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites providing a capacity advantage, this scale is seen as more beneficial for partnering with Indian telcos to expand connectivity in hard-to-reach areas rather than for direct competition.","Starlink's entry into the Indian broadband market is unlikely to pose a significant threat to established telecom giants Jio and Bharti Airtel, according to a report by JM Financial.

What Jackron wrote about Tesla protest and Elon Musk's response

""Hi @elonmusk, Yesterday I had an informant infiltrate one of the protests at Tesla dealerships and they told her a few things:

3. They‚Äôre organized through facebook groups since ùïè is monitored by pro Elon people

Here is a copy of their prepared anti-Elon chants:

To this Elon Musk replied: ""Interesting. Who is funding them?""

Donlad Trump's warning to Tesla protestors

Tesla facilities and vehicles across the US are facing protests and vandalism. The Tesla Takedown protests are said to be in response to the role of Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the cost-cutting task force Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in Donald Trump administration. Some ""Tesla Takedown"" protests have also been destructive with fires intentionally set at Tesla showrooms and charging stations in Colorado and Massachusetts last week. There has also been a spike in Cybertruck vandalism across the US, and some car owners are defacing their own Teslas in protest of Musk. Violence against Tesla dealerships will be labeled domestic terrorism and perpetrators will ""go through hell,"" the US President Donald Trump said last week in a show of support for Elon Musk.Now a man named Jackron -- who describes himself as a former Globalist, Mechanical Engineer and Researcher -- in his Twitter profile tagged Elon Musk and claimed that he infiltrated one of the protests at a Tesla dealership and got to know a few things. The things he wrote include how these Tesla protests are organised through Facebook groups. Along with the post he also shared a printed paper that he said is a copy of anti-Elon chants distributed among the protestors.Tagging Elon Musk, Jacktron wrote,Earlier Elon Musk wrote a post 'wondering' why so much hate against him considering that his companies make great products and people love them. ""My companies make great products that people love and I‚Äôve never physically hurt anyone. So why the hate and violence against me? Because I am a deadly threat to the woke mind parasite and the humans it controls,"" he wrote.Last week, President Trump warned those engaging in arson and vandalism against Tesla. ""Let me tell you, you do it to Tesla, and you do it to any company, we're going to catch you, and ... you're going to go through hell,"" Trump said. ""They're harming a great American company,"" Trump added.In the past few days, Tesla's market capitalization has more than halved since hitting an all-time high of $1.5 trillion on December 17, erasing most of the gains the stock made after Donald Trump won the US election in November.",Tesla facilities and vehicles across the US are facing protests and vandalism.

TikTok ban on April 5? Here's why app's future is still unclear,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tiktok-ban-on-april-5-heres-why-apps-future-is-still-unclear/articleshow/119125973.cms,"Will TikTok be banned on April 5

Why is TikTok facing a ban in the US

Who wants to buy TikTok

Frank McCourt & Alexis Ohanian‚Äôs ""The People‚Äôs Bid for TikTok""

Billionaire Frank McCourt, along with Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, has led a consortium to acquire TikTok. They propose integrating blockchain technology into the platform to give users more control over their data.

Investor Kevin O‚ÄôLeary (""Mr. Wonderful"" from Shark Tank)

O‚ÄôLeary joined the McCourt-led consortium in January 2025, advocating for an American-led takeover.

YouTube star MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson)

In January, popular content creator MrBeast expressed interest in buying TikTok, stating on social media that he wanted to acquire the platform to prevent it from being banned. His lawyer later confirmed that he was serious about pursuing the deal.

What happens if TikTok is banned

Removal from US app stores

Google and Apple could be required to remove TikTok from their app stores, preventing new downloads and updates.

Blocking TikTok on US networks

Internet service providers (ISPs) and mobile networks might be directed to block access to TikTok‚Äôs servers, making it difficult for users to access the app.

Legal challenges from TikTok and users

TikTok has already sued the US government over the ban, arguing that it violates First Amendment rights. If the ban is enforced, further legal battles are expected.

A potential workaround

Some users may attempt to bypass restrictions using VPN services, although it is unclear whether the government would take measures to block such efforts.

How long will TikTok be available

Whether ByteDance agrees to sell TikTok to a US-based entity.

If the US government extends the deadline beyond April 5.

Potential legal battles that could delay or overturn the ban.

The future of TikTok in the United States remains uncertain as the April 5 deadline for a potential ban approaches. The short-video app, owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, has been at the center of national security concerns for years. Initially targeted for a ban by former President Donald Trump in 2020, the app has faced increasing scrutiny from lawmakers, citing worries over potential data privacy risks and alleged ties to the Chinese government.In April 2024, the US Congress passed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, requiring ByteDance to sell TikTok to a US-based entity or face a nationwide ban. The Supreme Court later upheld this law, setting the stage for an April 5, 2025, deadline for ByteDance to comply. However, the situation remains fluid, with ongoing negotiations, legal challenges, and speculation about a possible extension.As the deadline approaches, TikTok users and content creators are left wondering what will happen next. Will the app be banned, or will ByteDance strike a deal to sell the platform? Here‚Äôs a detailed look at the latest developments and what they mean for TikTok‚Äôs future in the US.Whether TikTok will remain available to US users after April 5 depends on ByteDance‚Äôs ability to find a suitable American buyer for the platform. The law mandates that ByteDance either divests from TikTok or face a ban. However, there is still uncertainty regarding enforcement and the possibility of extensions.On March 6, 2025, President Donald Trump indicated that he was open to extending the deadline beyond April 5. ‚ÄúWe have a lot of interest in TikTok,‚Äù Trump told reporters. ‚ÄúHopefully, China will approve of the deal.‚Äù According to reports, Trump can extend the deadline by up to 90 days if ByteDance is actively working toward selling the platform.While the Attorney General‚Äôs Office, led by Pam Bondi, is responsible for enforcing the ban, it remains unclear whether immediate action will be taken if the sale deadline passes without resolution.The push to ban TikTok stems from concerns over national security, data privacy, and foreign influence. The US government fears that TikTok‚Äôs Chinese ownership allows the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to access sensitive user data.In 2022, reports surfaced that ByteDance employees had improperly accessed US user data, including the locations of journalists, raising alarms in Washington. While ByteDance has denied any connection to the Chinese government and implemented security measures to protect US user data, skepticism remains.The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden in April 2024, aims to address these concerns by requiring TikTok to be transferred to a US-based entity. The Supreme Court later upheld the law, affirming the government‚Äôs authority to force a sale or impose a ban.Several high-profile figures and companies have expressed interest in acquiring TikTok. President Trump previously mentioned that four different groups were negotiating to buy the platform, although no formal deal has been announced.Among the potential buyers are:Despite these bids, ByteDance has not publicly announced its willingness to sell TikTok, adding further uncertainty to the situation.If TikTok is officially banned on April 5 (or at a later date if the deadline is extended), several scenarios could unfold:As of now, TikTok remains fully operational in the US, with no immediate restrictions. However, its fate depends on:If ByteDance does not comply with the sale requirement, the US government could begin enforcing restrictions on TikTok in the weeks or months following the deadline. However, President Trump‚Äôs recent comments suggest that an extension is likely, giving ByteDance more time to negotiate a deal.","The future of TikTok in the United States remains uncertain as the April 5 deadline for a potential ban approaches.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is expected to defend his company's AI chip dominance at the upcoming annual software developer conference this week. This may happen as pressure on Nvidia's largest customers to control AI costs has reportedly increased. Nvidia's conference follows China's DeepSeek's announcement of a competitive chatbot, which caused Nvidia's stock to drop.According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Nvidia is also expected to reveal details of a new chip system called Vera Rubin at the conference. The mass production of the same is expected to begin later this year. This announcement may occur even as production delays affect the rollout of Rubin's predecessor, a chip named after mathematician David Blackwell.The report also claims that Nvidia's dominance in the AI training market , exceeding 90% market share, is being challenged as AI markets shift towards ""inference,"" where Nvidia faces increased competition.Inference computing spans a broad spectrum‚Äîfrom smartphones that reword emails to data centres that analyse complex financial documents. Numerous startups in Silicon Valley and beyond, along with competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), are aiming to develop chips that perform these tasks at a lower overall cost. This focus on efficiency is driven by the high electricity consumption of Nvidia‚Äôs chips, prompting some AI companies to explore nuclear reactors as a potential power source, the report notes.Nvidia has also argued that a new category of AI, known as ""reasoning,"" works to its advantage. In this approach, chatbots ""think aloud"" by generating several lines of text and then reviewing that output to further analyse the problem, thereby using the computing power that Nvidia‚Äôs chips are designed to deliver.As per the report, Nvidia is also planning to outline its strategy for markets beyond chatbots, including the use of new AI techniques to enhance robotics and a major focus on quantum computing .Recent market reactions to Huang's comments on the distant future of quantum technology have prompted competitors like Microsoft and Google to claim that quantum breakthroughs may be nearer than expected, leading Nvidia to dedicate an entire day of its conference to the quantum sector and its future plans.",Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is expected to defend his company's AI chip dominance at the upcoming annual software developer conference this week.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu replies to Kerala Congress' RIP post for 'Make in India',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zoho-founder-sridhar-vembu-replies-to-kerala-congress-rip-post-for-make-in-india/articleshow/119109476.cms,"Here‚Äôs a look at Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu‚Äôs post

Sridhar Vembu‚Äôs comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress , emphasizing the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho‚Äôs recent expansion in Kerala. The image in the party‚Äôs post shows a tombstone design to symbolically critique the ""Make in India"" initiative, suggesting it has failed between 2014 and 2025. The tombstone features the Indian lion emblem and the phrase ""Rest in Peace.""The post is captioned ‚ÄúIn loving memory of‚Ä¶.‚Äù. Responding to the post, Vembu emphasized the Make in India initiative and Zoho‚Äôs expansion in Kerala. He wrote:‚ÄúMeanwhile companies like us Make in India (and started making in Kerala recently too).‚Äù‚ÄúMake in India is gaining momentum and we have to make up for several lost decades. Reflect on why they were ""lost decades"" and perhaps you will appreciate Make in India better,‚Äù he further added.Zoho has been expanding its operations across India, including in Kerala. The company has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas as part of its broader strategy.The Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports. Several companies, including Zoho, have increased their domestic production efforts as part of this initiative.Vembu‚Äôs response comes amid ongoing discussions on India's economic policies and industrial growth, with businesses and policymakers debating the impact of past and present strategies.Vembu recently drew a comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods, highlighting their long-term impact on economic structures. In a recent post, he discussed how capital inflows into a single sector can divert resources from others, weakening overall economic capabilities.Citing Silicon Valley as an example, Vembu pointed out the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, attributing them to a talent shift toward sectors with higher financial incentives. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now ‚Äì for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors overlooked the sector due to the absence of large exits.Drawing a parallel to India, Vembu noted that the long-standing dominance of the IT industry resulted in the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he stated.He stressed the importance of addressing these gaps and rebuilding capabilities in affected sectors. ""We have to make up for lost time,"" he concluded.",Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress.

Air Canada and Thales issue joint statement

JetBlue, British Airways and Swiss Airlines have faced similar issues in the past

Air Canada has apologised after maps displayed on its in-flight entertainment systems reportedly erased Israel, replacing it with ‚ÄúPalestinian territories.‚Äù According to a report in CNN, Air Canada's Boeing 737 MAX fleet were found to have moving maps ‚Äî part of the in flight entertainment (IFE) system ‚Äî that did not show Israel as a state, but replaced it with the name "" Palestinian territories ."" The airline has deactivated the maps on 40 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and is working to rectify the issue.The discrepancy, first noticed by a passenger, involved maps produced for French aerospace group Thales. Air Canada and Thales issued a joint statement acknowledging the error and stating that the issue has been ""resolved."" ""It was brought to the attention of Air Canada that the interactive map on its Boeing 737 fleet did not consistently portray certain Middle Eastern boundaries, including those of the State of Israel, at all amplification levels,"" the statement said. ""Air Canada‚Äôs policy in general is to display only city names on the maps in its aircraft, and the configuration on this particular system was not compliant with this policy.""

Air Canada and Thales apologized for the ""unease created by this situation.""This is not the first time such an incident has occurred in aviation. JetBlue apologized for a similar map issue in 2024, and British Airways faced a similar situation in 2013. In 2018, SWISS confirmed its policy of turning off maps entirely when landing in Tel Aviv following a similar incident.

Baidu has unveiled its AI model, Ernie X1, which is designed to articulate its reasoning process. The Ernie X1 model operates on similar principles to DeepSeek R1 , a model that garnered significant attention in Silicon Valley for its ability to deliver comparable performance to leading chatbots at a significantly lower development cost. Baidu emphasises that its reasoning model excels in areas such as daily dialogue, complex calculations, and logical deduction, as per a report.Bloomberg reports that in addition to the Ernie X1 launch, China's leading internet search provider has upgraded its flagship foundation model to Ernie 4.5 . Notably, the company has made all tiers of its AI service, including the X1 model, freely accessible to its chatbot users, accelerating its initial plans by several weeks.Baidu claims that Ernie 4.5 outperforms OpenAI's latest GPT 4.5 in text generation, citing various industry benchmarks. Baidu has also announced its intention to make its Ernie AI models open-source starting June 30. The company has also integrated the R1 model into its core search engine business.This launch appears to be a strategic move to regain momentum in the competitive AI landscape, where Baidu faces increasing pressure from emerging rivals such as DeepSeek, the report added.While Baidu was the first major Chinese tech company to introduce a ChatGPT-like chatbot, it has since faced stiff competition from rivals like TikTok parent company ByteDance and Moonshot AI. Furthermore, open-source models such as Alibaba's Qwen and DeepSeek have received recognition within the global developer community, the report added.The generative AI boom has positively impacted Baidu's financial performance, with a 26% increase in cloud revenue reported in its December-quarter results. This growth, driven by services provided to developers seeking computing power, was somewhat offset by weaker advertising sales amidst China's challenging economic conditions.","Baidu has unveiled its new Ernie X1 AI model, designed to articulate its reasoning process.

Facebook‚Äôs extreme measures in India

A ""low-ranking official,"" or as some say an office Babu at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Meta (then Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and some of the 'brightest tech minds' in his team with nothing more than a single click, according to explosive claims in a newly released memoir by former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams.The David versus Goliath moment allegedly occurred in 2016 during Facebook's aggressive push to save its controversial Free Basics program in India, which was facing regulatory scrutiny for potentially violating net neutrality principles.""Mark and some of the brightest tech minds in the world devoted months to this [outreach strategy], and some low-ranking official in India outfoxed them simply by clicking an opt-out box,"" Wynn-Williams writes in her book ""Careless People,"" which Meta is currently trying to block from publication.The memoir details how Facebook deployed its full arsenal of technological and political influence to sway public opinion about Free Basics. When India's Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) opened public consultations on whether such programs should be banned, Facebook allegedly orchestrated an unprecedented pressure campaign.""Our policy team is directly engaged with the government, include Prime Minister Modi's office,"" Wynn-Williams quotes then-COO Sheryl Sandberg as writing in an internal email. ""We're lucky this is happening in a place where we have very deep senior relationships in the government, but it's still going to be hard.""According to the book, Facebook's strategy focused on creating ""the appearance of public support"" through automated emails. The social media giant allegedly turned on a ""megaphone that Mark wouldn't let Sheryl use for [promoting] organ donation"" to nudge Indian users into sending approximately 16 million supportive emails to TRAI.The jugaad ‚Äì a Hindi term for an innovative, improvised solution ‚Äì came when Facebook discovered their millions of automated emails weren't being counted. ""Someone at TRAI‚Äîwhoever controlled the email address for the public comments ‚Äî simply opted out of all emails from Facebook,"" writes Wynn-Williams.The book makes other startling claims about Facebook's operations in India, including that the company hired an ""ex-police captain"" who would ""go to jail in a clash between Facebook and the Indian government"" if executives were targeted in government raids.Meta has dismissed the book as containing ""out-of-date and previously reported claims"" and ""false accusations about our executives."" A spokesperson told The Hindu that ""Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behaviour,"" claiming she ""has been paid by anti-Facebook activists.""Despite Meta's arbitration efforts to halt its publication and promotion in the US, ""Careless People"" remains available for purchase in India. The company has not specifically contested the claims regarding its operations in India detailed in the memoir.Free Basics was ultimately prohibited in India for violating net neutrality principles, representing a rare defeat for Zuckerberg's global expansion ambitions.",Former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams claims a 'low-ranking official' at India's telecom regulator outsmarted Mark Zuckerberg and his team.

Unlocking specialty insurance‚Äôs potential through AI-driven innovation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/unlocking-specialty-insurances-potential-through-ai-driven-innovation/articleshow/119120586.cms,"-- Rajeev Batra, EVP, Insurance, Coforge

Specialty insurance covers unique and complex risks that traditional insurance policies don‚Äôt address, making it an important part of today‚Äôs changing risk environment. In the realm of commercial and specialty lines, multiple insurance carriers are actively engaged in writing various types of specialty lines, including Directors & Officers, Employment Practice Liability, Errors & Omissions, Environmental Liability, Aviation, and Cyber.Due to its complex nature, it requires specialized underwriting expertise and robust platforms. Insurance carriers often use a range of systems/platforms to handle both admitted and non-admitted policies. These platforms provide tailored functionalities for policy management, claims, and billing. However, managing multiple systems can create challenges like integration issues and data silos, making it crucial for carriers to continually optimize their technology to ensure efficiency and competitiveness in the complex specialty lines market.Over the past few years, there has been exponential growth in the global specialty market business. Industry forecasts project that the global specialty insurance market will reach approximately $270 billion plus by 2031‚Äîa staggering compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.6%.The growth drivers are evident: rising complexity and interconnectivity of risks, a shift towards customized coverages, rapid technological advancements, and expanding access to niche markets. As industries become more specialized, one-size-fits-all policies no longer suffice prompting insurers to shift their focus from standard products to solutions tailored to unique industry risks. Emerging technologies like AI, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP) are enhancing underwriting and risk management enabling insurers to be more precise and efficient in addressing these evolving challenges.Increasing scope for technology adoptionWhile the specialty insurance market is experiencing tremendous growth, many players lag in technology adoption. As revenue grows, these legacy systems struggle to keep up, putting carriers at a critical decision point: modernize or face stagnation.Technology adoption is expanding rapidly across the industry, offering significant opportunities for improvement. Nearly 60% of insurance processes can be executed on core platforms, while new technologies are being adopted for remaining business aspects. Cloud computing, data analytics, and automation are enabling carriers to enhance underwriting precision, improve claims processing speed, and gain real-time insights into risk management. AI-driven solutions and machine learning models are also empowering insurers to make more informed decisions, predict risks, and improve overall efficiency.The need for better customer, broker, and agents experience is also driving technology adoption. Enhancing the user experience through seamless, intuitive digital platforms can significantly enhance satisfaction and retention rates. This transformation is key to stay competitive in an increasing digital distribution market.Impact of Generative AIGenerative AI is set to significantly transform the future of specialty insurance particularly in underwriting and claims processing. While digital transformation has been a key focus, Gen AI is uniquely positioned to address these areas. In underwriting, AI-powered workbenches facilitate more accurate risk assessments, enhancing decision-making capabilities, and streamlining the processing of complex data.In claim processing, Gen AI can automatically extract relevant information from various documents such as claim forms, medical records, and receipts. This automation reduces the need for manual data entry, minimizing errors and accelerates the claims process. By automating routine tasks, Gen AI enables claims handlers to concentrate on more complex cases enhancing overall efficiency and effectiveness.Approach for Gen AI adoptionThere is ongoing debate about the choice between using large, general-purpose language models (LLMs) or insurer-specific models tailored to a carrier's unique needs. Smaller carriers are embracing the disruptive potential of AI, enabling them to reimagine their processes from the ground up without the constraint of legacy systems. This approach, which involves redesigning claims and underwriting workflows enables them to unlock the full potential of AI.Larger carriers encounter distinct set of challenges. They operate under stricter regulatory environments; hence their adoption of Gen AI must carefully navigate a complex web of statutory requirements and audit concerns. Consequently, their AI adoption is more cautious, incorporating safeguards to ensure that innovation does not compromise compliance.Overall, both small and large carriers have much to gain from the strategic adoption of AI, but their paths to implementation will differ. Smaller carriers can afford to be bold and disruptive, reshaping their operations with native AI. Larger carriers, though more measured in their approach, are no less poised to reap the benefits of AI, provided they integrate it thoughtfully within their existing frameworks.In conclusion, specialty insurance is at a pivotal moment. While the potential for growth is immense, but the demand of technology adoption along with modernization is equally pressing. By embracing advanced technologies and AI, carriers can effectively address current challenges and proactively prepare for the evolving risk of future. Those who act quickly and decisively in adopting those innovations will not only thrive but lead the way in a more agile, data-driven, and innovative insurance landscape.","Specialty insurance covers unique and complex risks that traditional insurance policies don‚Äôt address.

AI breakthrough offers global potential for uncovering lost civilisations in deserts



For centuries, the Rub al-Khali, or Empty Quarter, has been a desolate and hostile desert, holding secrets of lost civilisations buried under its seemingly endless dunes. This is the world's largest continuous sand desert and has long remained shrouded in mystery. According to the ET reports, recent technological breakthroughs have finally opened up a secret chapter in this history, however, to produce the remains of a 5,000-year-old civilisation under its moving sands.This remarkable breakthrough has been made by a group of scientists from Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi, utilising the latest artificial intelligence and satellite imaging technology. The breakthrough is a machine-learning algorithm that can analyse satellite photographs to identify hidden archaeological sites that are buried under the sand, deep beneath the surface.The secret to this groundbreaking find is found in the AI-powered algorithm that the team created. The machine-based system employs Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, enabling scientists to shoot through dense sand layers and see buried structures that would be undetectable using conventional archaeological techniques. SAR is a type of radar imagery which has the capability of imaging the Earth's surface in high resolution, even penetrating through thick sand dunes, and is thus the ideal instrument for revealing ancient lost civilisations.Khalifa University's head of Environmental and Geophysical Sciences (ENGEOS) Lab Dr. Diana Francis outlined the difficulty of finding ancient sites in the UAE desert environment. ""With the climate, plus the fact that a lot of the country is desert, it was too logistically challenging to survey the desert on the ground,"" Dr. Francis said. ""That's why satellite imagery was crucial. We needed equipment that could look under the sand.The find is based on the ancient site of Saruq Al-Hadid, which was already famous for its archaeological value. The new AI technology, however, has unveiled even more secrets about the region, providing information about ancient human settlements that were unknown before. The machine-learning algorithm employed by the researchers has discovered remnants of a lost civilisation that existed in the area long ago.This discovery is a huge step in archaeology since it shows the way AI and remote sensing can be used to find ancient settlements in otherwise intractable terrain. With the speed and efficiency with which AI can process huge amounts of data, the classical method of archaeological excavations is now supplemented by this new technique, and the previously unknown settlements can be found without having to go through a long process of excavation.The implications of the finding have reached Dubai Culture, which is the government body entrusted with safeguarding the UAE's archaeological sites. Dubai Culture gave the go-ahead for excavation to start in areas targeted by the research team, paving the way for possible future sensational discoveries.The combination of AI technology and government support could lead to even more important findings in the years to come, potentially reshaping our understanding of ancient civilisations in the Arabian Peninsula and beyond.Though the breakthrough is significant for the UAE, its uses are much wider reaching than for the country. The AI-based approach the research team created is not only applicable to the deserts of the UAE but can be applied to the discovery of lost civilisations in other desert environments worldwide, including North Africa and the Middle East.""These results are a proof-of-concept of how machine learning and SAR imagery can lead archaeological searches through desert landscapes,"" added Dr. Francis. ""These regions are yet to be explored, yet we are certain they contain cultural heritage. Our techniques apply across all arid landscapes, and it's my hope that we can extend our work to the entire UAE and beyond.""",Khalifa University's AI breakthrough uncovers hidden archaeological sites beneath UAE desert.

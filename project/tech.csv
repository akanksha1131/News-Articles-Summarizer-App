Elon Musk has publicly questioned Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella after screenshots allegedly showing employees of Activision Blizzard, a Microsoft-owned company, celebrating the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. These photos surfaced on the social media platform owned by the Tesla CEO.Musk's tweet was a direct reaction to a user who had shared what they described as a ""mega thread"" of posts where Blizzard developers purportedly mocked Kirk after his death. Tagging Nadella, Musk wrote, “What’s going on here, @satyanadella?”In a separate post, Musk said, “These are Microsoft employees.”Microsoft quickly issued a statement on X, saying that the company is aware of the situation and celebrating violence are unacceptable.“We're aware of the views expressed by a small subset of our employees regarding recent events. We take matters like this very seriously and we are currently reviewing each individual situation,” the company said in a post on X.“Comments celebrating violence against anyone are unacceptable and do not align with our values,” the company added.The incident is the latest in a series of online reactions Musk has addressed following Kirk's death.Just a day earlier, Musk responded to a separate claim that a former Tesla employee had posted an insult, calling Kirk “Hitler.” Musk clarified that the individual was no longer employed by Tesla.Since the shooting, Musk has repeatedly expressed shock and grief, posting multiple times that he hoped Kirk would survive.He has also condemned those celebrating the killing, calling their actions ""evil"" and stating, ""They are celebrating cold-blooded murder."" When a user suggested that Kirk’s killing should anger everyone, Musk replied with a firm ""yes.""Kirk, a prominent supporter of President Donald Trump and founder of Turning Point USA, was shot and killed this week during a public event at Utah Valley University.Musk also replied to Will Chamberlain, a senior counsel for the Article 3 Project, who reshared a post that celebrated the death of Kirk and called for the death of his wife.Musk then replied directly to Chamberlain's post – which has now been deleted – with a statement of his own: “Either we fight back or they will kill us.”"," screenshots allegedly show employees of Activision Blizzard, a Microsoft-owned company, celebrating the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.

"‘Closing a chapter, opening a New One’: Kavin Mittal confirms global shutdown of Hike",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/closing-a-chapter-opening-a-new-one-kavin-mittal-confirms-global-shutdown-of-hike/articleshow/123870695.cms,"Read Kavin Bharti Mittal’s complete LinkedIn post here:



After regrouping with our investors and the team, I’ve made the difficult decision to wind down Hike completely.

Our US business, launched just nine months ago, is off to a strong start. But after the

India ban, scaling globally would require a full recap, a reset that is not the best use of capital or time.

The Big Question → We could raise the capital, but the real question is: is it worth it? Is this a climb worth pivoting for? For the first time in 13 years, my answer is no. Not for me, not for my team, and not for our investors. Why?

RMG was never the destination. It was a way to test unit economics and traction in India while working toward a bigger vision. In hindsight, starting in India locked us into the model and regulatory headwinds, turning a temporary path into a more permanent one. The Gaming Nation vision is real, but we may be too early. The world will eventually move toward a Nation-type model in gaming and Web3 - Company 2.0. But crypto regulation is still developing globally, and we don’t want to repeat India, where we hoped for clarity that never came. And most importantly, if doing a full reset, is this where I’d put my own capital and energy today? For the first time, the answer is no. The world has changed in the last decade - and so have I. There are more important problems to solve and bigger opportunities to deploy brilliant talent and capital.

Looking Back & Lessons

The last 13 years have been immense. Hike Messenger reached 40M MAUs and became the 35th most loved consumer brand in India at its peak. With Rush, we built a new kind of Casual PvP gaming platform and scaled it to 10M users and $500M+ in gross revenue ( CEA ) in just 4 years.

Our execution was super, but we could never quite make it stick. There are clear lessons to carry forward, especially on market selection:

Be careful with winner-take-all markets. To win, you need to go global. Don’t build for today’s constraints. Build on the spring/summer of new technologies. Regulatory clarity matters. Risk is fine; uncertainty is not.

More importantly momentum is everything. And build what your heart and mind are deeply excited about. It’s the conviction that carries you through.

This is both a disappointment and a hard outcome. But I choose to look on the bright side: the learnings are invaluable, and my conviction for what’s next is even stronger.

To everyone who has been part of this journey - our users, our team, our investors, and our community - thank you. As a CEO, you’re only as strong as your team, and I want to give a special shout-out to mine - an incredible group of people who gave this everything

.

This chapter ends, but the climb continues.

Looking Forward

I’ve always thrived at building at the forefront of technology. Over the last decade, in the little time I had to explore outside of Hike, I kept returning to the same three frontiers. And now, they feel like the great canvases for decades to come →

AI → For the first time, technology has both intelligence and memory. Imagine products that don’t just serve us functionally but truly know us - systems that adapt, grow, and partner with us. As a UX-first builder, this is the most exciting time to be building software. Breakthroughs in Energy → Human progress has always been bound by energy. The world’s demand for energy is rising faster than ever. Breakthrough approaches, especially in physics are needed to power the future. The last century gave us mastery of fine matters and electricity, the next will move deeper, at the intersection of science and spirituality - into what yogis call divine magnetism and physicists call the quantum world or electromagnetism. From there will come technologies that today feel impossible to imagine. Mastery of the Self → As AI takes on more of our work, a deeper question will rise: what now defines us? When productivity is no longer the measure of worth, humanity will turn inward. Man’s evolution will move from the intellect to intuitive attunement - a deeper connection with ourselves and the divine (which we’ll realise are one and the same). The tools, spaces, and guides that help us explore this inner world will be as transformative as any innovation in the outer one - unlocking the next level of humanity’s potential

If you put these together, a picture emerges: → the cost of intelligence trending to zero → the cost of energy trending to zero → and the cost of willpower falling lower and lower.

Just imagine a future where willpower is infinite, energy is abundant, and intelligence is at our fingertips.

This is the future I will help build — and it’s where I’ll be contributing in the decades to come. This new chapter will look very different from the last one

“After considering the company’s reply to the notice, additional submissions made by it, and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charge against the company was sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty.”

Elon Musk’s Starlink To Begin Trials in India





The Reserve Bank of India RBI ) has imposed a fine of Rs 21 lakh on PhonePe for not complying with the rules of prepaid payment instruments (PPIs). A PPI is a prepaid instrument where bank customers load funds first and spend from that balance instead of directly accessing their bank account. The penalty, which was issued recently, follows a statutory inspection of the Walmart-owned digital payments firm's operations from October 2023 to December 2024.According to the RBI, PhonePe's end-of-day balance in its escrow account on some days was lower than the value of outstanding PPIs and payments owed to merchants. An escrow account is a secure third-party account where PPI companies, such as PhonePe, must hold user funds to ensure safety and proper use in accordance with RBI rules. The company allegedly failed to report the shortfall to the central bank immediately. The RBI claimed that it even issued a notice to PhonePe asking for an explanation for the lapses before imposing the penalty.In a statement (seen by the Economic Times), RBI said:The central bank clarified that its action was due to gaps in regulatory compliance and did not impact the validity of PhonePe’s customer transactions or agreements.The RBI has been increasing its oversight of payment companies, particularly in areas such as escrow account management and reporting requirements.This development comes as PhonePe gears up for an initial public offering (IPO) later this year, with Kotak Mahindra Capital, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley appointed as managers.",The Reserve Bank of India has imposed a fine of Rs 21 lakh on PhonePe for not complying with the rules of prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) A PPI is a prepaid instrument where bank customers load funds first and spend from that balance instead of directly accessing their bank account.

US President Donald Trump has recently threatened to imposetariffs on countries that implement digital taxes. This decision came just days after a private meeting with Mark Zuckerberg , CEO of Meta Platforms . Citing sources familiar with the meeting, a report by Bloomberg stated that Zuckerberg raised concerns about these digital service taxes , which are levied on the revenue tech companies generate from users in a specific country. Following the discussion, Trump stated that he was putting all countries with such taxes “on notice” and that the US will impose “substantial” tariffs and export restrictions on US semiconductors unless “these discriminatory actions are removed.”According to Trump, digital taxes will harm US technology companies while givingHe warned that unless thesethe US would impose tariffs and export restrictions on semiconductors. In a recent post shared on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump wrote:In a statement to Bloomberg, Meta confirmed the meeting between Trump and Zuckerberg. A company spokesperson said:Trump’s recent comments have reignited tensions over digital services taxes imposed by several US trading partners, a dispute that predates his latest meeting with Zuckerberg.Washington has long argued that such taxes, which may be levied by countries including France, Italy, Austria, Spain, and the UK, disproportionately target American tech giants such as Meta, Amazon, and Google’s parent company, Alphabet.Since Trump’s return to office, Zuckerberg has worked to strengthen his relationship with the president, who once labelled him a “criminal.” Efforts have included changing Meta’s moderation and diversity policies, contributing $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, and making repeated visits to the White House and Mar-a-Lago.Zuckerberg has also expanded his Washington footprint by purchasing homes near the vice president’s residence and bringing Trump allies into Meta’s leadership. Their improved ties have led to frequent discussions on topics ranging from artificial intelligence to European tech regulations.","US President Donald Trump has recently threatened to imposetariffs on countries that implement digital taxes.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk ’s teen prodigy Kairan Quazi is trading rockets for trading algorithms, leaving SpaceX after two years to join quantitative trading giant Citadel Securities as a developer in New York City. ""I felt ready to take on new challenges and expand my skill set into a different high-performance environment,"" the 16-year-old told Business Insider in an exclusive interview.Kairan Quazi, who became the youngest graduate of Santa Clara University before joining SpaceX's Starlink division at age 14, will start this week at Citadel Securities, one of the world's premier market making firm. The move represents a significant coup for the financial industry as it competes with AI labs and big tech companies for top engineering talent.Despite receiving offers from leading AI laboratories and major technology companies, Kairan Quazi selected Citadel Securities for its unique combination of intellectual challenge and rapid feedback loops.

How Nepal’s Gen-Z activists used Discrd to choose interim PM



Nepal social media ban and crisis explained





After violent protests and a political collapse triggered by a social media ban, Nepali citizens used a popular chat app to choose the country’s next interim leader. A report states that over 100,000 people have converged on Discord, a platform primarily known for gaming, to fill the political vacuum. According to a report by The New Yorl Times, after a series of debates and polls within the chat room, the group agreed on a single nominee: Sushila Karki, Nepal's former chief justice.“The Parliament of Nepal right now is Discord,” said Sid Ghimiri, a 23-year-old content creator. The protest is commonly referred as Gen-Z prtest as the a majority of protestors are said to be roughly under the age of 28 years.Discord was launched in May 2015 by co-founders Jason Citron and Stanislav Vishnevskiy, who had previously created social platforms for gamers. Their vision was to build a chat service that complements gaming as its core purpose was to enable gamers to communicate with friends without having to exit their games.This focused approach helped the platform grow, and by the end of 2016, it had already amassed more than 25 million users. The platform's popularity surged during the pandemic, especially among Gen Z. Users began to create servers centered on a wide variety of topics beyond gaming.This shift led Discord to rebrand itself as a comprehensive communication platform.Discord's servers have grown into large community spaces where users can set up multiple channels for communication. These channels support various formats, including text, audio, and video. The platform also offers features like screen sharing, streaming, and a range of moderation tools.By default, a single Discord server can accommodate up to 500,000 users, though the active user limit at any given time is capped at 250,000.Soon after Nepal’s government social media ban led to violent protests and, eventually, a political collapse, more than 1,00,000 citizens converged on a chat app to select the country’s next interim leader, the report has said.After a series of heated debates and polls, the group has settled around a single name: Sushila Karki, the country's former chief justice.

Pop culture and tech significance





In a surprising crossover between Silicon Valley and Hollywood, Elon Musk and Larry Ellison once shared screen time in a major blockbuster. Both tech titans, now at the top of the world’s wealth rankings, appeared in the 2010 Marvel film Iron Man 2 in brief but memorable cameos. Musk’s persona even partly inspired the on-screen character of Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr., while Ellison was humorously introduced as the “Oracle of Oracle.” These appearances, largely unnoticed at the time, offer a rare glimpse into the playful side of two of the most influential figures in technology and finance.Elon Musk appears in a short scene discussing an “electric jet” project with Tony Stark. The cameo is brief, but significant, as screenwriter Mark Fergus noted that Musk’s real-life personality helped shape the Tony Stark character. His presence added a layer of authenticity to the tech-savvy billionaire persona portrayed on screen.Larry Ellison’s appearance, meanwhile, is marked by humor, with the character introduced as the “Oracle of Oracle,” a playful nod to his real-world role as the co-founder of Oracle Corporation.His cameo, though fleeting, highlighted his larger-than-life persona and cemented a quirky pop culture connection alongside Musk.Together, these brief appearances provide a rare cinematic glimpse of two of the tech world’s most powerful leaders sharing the screen, blending their real-life influence with Hollywood storytelling.The joint appearance of Musk and Ellison in Iron Man 2 reflects the intersection of technology and entertainment. Beyond the screen, both men continue to shape global industries—Musk in electric vehicles, space, and AI, and Ellison in cloud computing and enterprise software. Their cameos now gain renewed attention as the two billionaires compete for the title of the world’s richest person, linking their pop culture moment to contemporary financial headlines.As Elon Musk and Larry Ellison battle for the top spot in global wealth rankings, fans and media have revisited their shared Hollywood moment. What was once a fun, almost hidden Easter egg in a Marvel movie has become a symbol of the influence and reach of tech leaders, demonstrating that their impact extends far beyond boardrooms and stock markets. Just a quick cameo, but enough to leave fans with a smile.

Jamie Dimon meets Trump





JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a warning that the U.S. economy is showing signs of weakness. The warning comes after the Labor Department made a sharp downward revision to its job data. The department recently said that nonfarm payrolls for the year through March 2025 were overestimated by 911,000 jobs — the largest correction in more than two decades. “I think the economy is weakening,” Dimon told CNBC. “Whether it’s on the way to recession or just weakening, I don’t know.”As mentioned before, the latest adjustment comes after job growth nearly stalled in July, with just 73,000 positions added. The revision signals the economy produced far fewer jobs than first believed. Hours after the July report was released, President Donald Trump dismissed the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, fueling further political debate.Jamie Dimon said JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, monitors extensive data across consumers, corporations and global trade. He noted that while most Americans still have jobs and continue to spend, confidence may be slipping.“There’s a lot of different factors in the economy right now,” Dimon said, pointing to weakening consumer sentiment and still-strong corporate profits. “We just have to wait and see.”Dimon added that the Federal Reserve will “probably” cut interest rates at an upcoming meeting, but cautioned the move may not make a significant difference.Last month, Jamie Dimon visited the White House last week, reports The Wall Street Journal. The meeting, twice in the past two months, signals a change in his long-strained relationship with President Donald Trump. Quoting people familiar with the matter, the report said that Dimon and Trump talked about the economy, trade, and financial regulation. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick were also present, the report stated. During the meeting, Dimon also congratulated Trump on his recent trade agreement with Japan. The group also discussed the ongoing issue of affordable housing and how financial regulations introduced after the 2008 crisis have impacted homeownership in the U.S.","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a warning that the U.S. economy is showing signs of weakness.

“What does $1 really mean? Does that mean access to the open model and that compute will be charged incrementally?”

""So, there are all of those costs in terms of training, and then once you have built the model, does the government have to pay for inference whenever federal workers and contractors use it? Is there another incremental charge?""

“The government has to be really careful and understand what the fully loaded cost is of these solutions beyond the very attractive zero to $1 charge. These AI models are powerful engines, but they require really fantastic data to run cleanly and produce reliable output. The investment in that is something that needs to be understood,”

AT&T is reportedly pulling back on its use of a “controversial” attendance tracking system after acknowledging to employees that the technology has been inaccurate and a major source of frustration. A recent report says the company surveyed staff, asking whether the system—introduced alongside its return-to-office mandate—was helping them perform at their best. More than half of employees said it was not.Business Insider reports that while the survey did not directly ask employees about their feedback on the “presence reporting” tool, it asked whether employees agreed that AT&T's “policies and systems support me in delivering my best work.”According to company's chief marketing and growth officer, Kellyn Kenny, roughly half of the respondents said “no,” and that many voiced their concerns about the RTO mandate.""I now understand the level of anxiety that this report has created,"" Kenny was quoted as saying.“I also now understand how the fact that it is inaccurate is driving people to the brink of frustration, and it's creating distrust,” she added.Business Insider reported that the company put a “presence reporting” tool as part of the company's return-to-office mandate.This tool automatically tracks the hours workers spend at their assigned office but it, however, created anxiety and distrust due to its flawed data.The tool was initially intended to identify employees who were not showing up to the office, but Kenny said it was no longer needed for that purpose, as action had already been taken against those individuals.Kenny stated that the company recognised that the data from the tool was ""not correct"" and would reduce the company’s reliance on it. A person familiar with the matter also confirmed that AT&T is deemphasising the use of the tracking system for salaried employees companywide.Multiple employees told the publication that the system doesn't just log badge swipes, the report uses laptop network connections and mobile device location data to check the hours an employee was at their assigned office.","AT&T is reportedly pulling back on its use of a “controversial” attendance tracking system after acknowledging to employees that the technology has been inaccurate and a major source of frustration.

Facebook lawsuit settlement: How much will users get





Payments from Facebook’s $725 million privacy settlement are finally being distributed, with approved claimants set to receive money over the coming weeks. The settlement stems from lawsuits that accused the social media giant of improperly sharing users’ personal data with advertisers and third-party firms, most notably highlighted by the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal. For those unaware, millions of US users who had an active Facebook account between 2007 and 2022 were eligible to file claims in 2023. While Meta, Facebook’s parent company, denied wrongdoing, it agreed to the massive payout to resolve the cases.Millions of Facebook users who submitted valid claims last year are now receiving official confirmation emails from the “Facebook User Privacy Settlement Administrator.” These messages include a claimant ID number and confirm that payments are on the way.As mentioned above, eligible users needed to file a claim in the lawsuit by August 25, 2023 to receive the payment.The administrator said payouts started in September this year and will continue for the next 10 weeks. Claimants will also get an additional email 3–4 days before their payment is sent.The official settlement site says that people approved for a settlement payment will get an email about 3–4 days before the money is sent.While Facebook agreed to pay $725 million to settle the privacy lawsuit, users who filed claims will receive only a small share of that amount. Court filings show the average payment is $29.43, with the maximum reaching $38.36 for people who were active on Facebook for the full 15-year period covered. The final payout depends on how long each user maintained an active account during that window.The payout will be divided using “allocation points,” based on how many months a person used Facebook during the eligibility period from May 2007 to December 2022.",Payments from Facebook’s $725 million privacy settlement are finally being distributed. approved claimants are set to receive money over the coming weeks.

Albanian public skeptical about AI minister's success





Albania is making an artificial intelligence-powered digital assistant named Diella its minister, the world's first artificial intelligence system to serve as a government minister, tasked with overseeing public procurement to eliminate corruption. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama announced the appointment this week, promising the AI minister will make Albania ""a country where public tenders are 100% free of corruption.Diella, meaning ""sun"" in Albanian, will manage all government contract decisions previously handled by human officials, ensuring complete transparency in public spending. The AI minister represents a radical shift from traditional governance, with Rama describing her as ""the first cabinet member who isn't physically present, but is virtually created by AI.""Diella originally launched in January as an AI-powered virtual assistant on Albania's e-Albania platform, helping citizens obtain government documents and services. Dressed in traditional Albanian attire, she has already processed 36,600 digital documents and provided nearly 1,000 services to users through voice commands and electronic stamps.The AI minister will now assume responsibility for evaluating and awarding all public tenders, with decisions transferred from human government officials in a ""step-by-step"" process.This represents a major shift in how governments worldwide might leverage artificial intelligence for governance.Public procurement has long been plagued by corruption scandals in Albania, a Balkan nation experts describe as a hub for international money laundering from drug and weapons trafficking. Graft has reportedly reached the highest levels of government, complicating the country's European Union accession goals.Rama aims to lead Albania into the EU by 2030, making anti-corruption efforts crucial for membership eligibility. However, the government provided no details about human oversight mechanisms or safeguards against potential AI manipulation. Public reaction remains mixed, with skeptical Facebook users commenting ""Even Diella will be corrupted in Albania"" and ""Stealing will continue and Diella will be blamed. ""The parliament is expected to vote on Rama's fourth-term cabinet, including the AI minister, when it convenes Friday.

Personal update: after 8 years at breakneck speed, I’ve made the very difficult decision to move on from Tesla.

I want to thank everyone I’ve worked with over the years at Tesla. People - this crazy lot of bright, humble, ambitious, hard-working people - are what makes Tesla special. I am thankful beyond words to the many colleagues and leaders I’ve worked with and learned from over the years.

Being the first Autobidder employee in Europe and helping scale the team and fleet across markets has been an unbelievable journey.

Since 2020, the Autobidder operational fleet in Europe went from 14 MWh (Holes Bay) to around 1.3 GWh (that’s ~100x), with more markets coming online (very) soon. Having helped bring on board many brilliant people over the past few years, I’m very excited about what’s next for Autobidder, in Europe and beyond.

Beyond Autobidder, joining Tesla Energy early on and contributing to its growth has been an immense privilege.

Along the journey, I got a chance to work on anything from microgrids on remote islands to VPPs across three continents.

It’s humbling to think how much the energy industry has evolved over these years. Storage went from being an afterthought to a key enabler of the transition to sustainable energy. When I joined in 2017, Tesla Energy deployed ~350 MWh of storage. Last year, in 2024, the figure was 31.4 GWh. That’s another 100x, and the growth is far from stopping.

It’s not just about volume though: storage is increasingly providing inverter-driven grid services that are key to operating low-carbon grids (grid-forming mode etc).

In addition to that, data and algorithms have taken center stage in the energy transition, which is a very exciting development for an energy/math/software wonk like me.

All this being said, I do need to address the elephant in the room: the main reason I’m leaving is that I think Elon has dealt huge damage to Tesla’s mission (and to the health of democratic institutions in several countries).

Beyond that, Elon’s leadership and decision making seem seriously compromised. Given his huge (and growing, inexplicably) stake in Tesla, I can’t convince myself anymore that this is the right place to be.

This is not just about politics: it’s about lying to the public, manipulating public discourse, targeting minorities and supporting climate change deniers and political forces aligned with the oil and gas industry.

I think it’s fairly indisputable that the current US administration is slowing down the energy transition. Unfortunately, speed is critical if we are to avert the worst consequences of climate change.

I wish the best to everyone who will stick around and keep working to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy, and I hope the best for Tesla and Tesla Energy.

As for myself, I’m taking some time off before embarking on a new adventure. Stay tuned for more updates.

Cheers,

Gio

Seven-year commitment addresses bundling practices and boosts market competition





Microsoft has successfully avoided a potentially hefty European Union fine, which could have amounted to billions of dollars, by agreeing to unbundle its Teams platform from Office productivity software and offer reduced pricing options. The European Commission says it accept Microsoft's commitments to address antitrust concerns, ending a years-long investigation that began with complaints from competitors.The case originated from a 2020 complaint filed by Salesforce-owned Slack, which accused Microsoft of illegally bundling Teams with Office 365 and Microsoft 365 to gain unfair competitive advantage. German competitor alfaview filed a similar complaint in 2023, intensifying regulatory scrutiny.Under the binding agreement, Microsoft will make Office 365 and Microsoft 365 versions available without Teams at prices reduced by 1 to 8 euros. The company has also committed to widening the price gap between bundled and unbundled versions by 50% for certain business-focused suites.The commitments extend beyond pricing changes. Microsoft must provide interoperability between competing communication tools and its products, allow customers to export Teams messaging data to rivals, and enable long-term license holders to switch to unbundled versions.Most commitments will remain in force for seven years, with interoperability and data portability requirements lasting 10 years. The remedies will be implemented globally, not just in Europe.""Today's decision opens up competition in this crucial market and ensures businesses can freely choose the communication and collaboration product that best suits their needs,"" said Teresa Ribera, the EU's executive vice-president for competitive transition.The agreement represents a more conciliatory approach from Microsoft, which previously faced 2.2 billion euros in EU fines for similar bundling practices.

iPhone’s iconic 9:41 AM timestamp: Why Apple ads always show this time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/iphones-iconic-941-am-timestamp-why-apple-ads-always-show-this-time/articleshow/123850315.cms,"The story behind Apple iPhone’s 9:41 AM timestamp

Apple Watch: A different tradition

More than just a number





If you’ve ever paid close attention to Apple ’s advertisements, you may have noticed a curious detail: the time displayed on iPhones, iPads, and even MacBooks is always set to 9:41 AM. This isn’t a random choice or a design accident; it’s a deliberate tradition rooted in one of the most important moments in Apple’s history. The timestamp is a subtle tribute to the exact minute when Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone to the world at MacWorld 2007. Over the years, it has evolved into a symbolic reminder of Apple’s attention to detail and the revolutionary moment that redefined technology.The tradition began during the MacWorld Expo in January 2007, where Steve Jobs carefully timed the iPhone reveal to occur around 40 minutes into his keynote presentation. Apple wanted the clock displayed on the giant screen to match the actual time in the auditorium. The first iPhone was revealed at 9:42 AM, but soon after, Apple adjusted this to 9:41 AM for precision and branding consistency.What started as a detail for one keynote soon became a global branding standard. Since the launch of the first iPad, Apple has consistently used 9:41 AM in all promotional images of iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks.This practice has become a subtle signature of the company’s identity, recognized instantly by Apple fans worldwide.Interestingly, Apple doesn’t use 9:41 for every product. The Apple Watch displays 10:09 in ads, echoing the watch industry’s tradition of using times like 10:10 for aesthetic symmetry. This small variation highlights how Apple blends industry customs with its own storytelling.To most people, 9:41 may seem like an arbitrary timestamp. But for Apple, it symbolises the historic moment when the world first saw the iPhone, an event that changed the way we communicate, work, and live. By repeating this detail in every ad, Apple keeps alive the memory of a turning point in tech history, making 9:41 an iconic part of its visual language. It serves as a constant reminder of how a single moment can reshape the future of technology.","The time displayed on iPhones, iPads, and even MacBooks is always set to 9:41 AM.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming industries, and the pharmaceutical sector is poised to be one of its most significant beneficiaries, reshaping how drugs are discovered, tested, and brought to market. In a recent Bloomberg Television interview, Demis Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind and Nobel laureate, revealed that AI could dramatically reduce drug discovery timelines, potentially cutting years of labor-intensive research down to mere months. DeepMind’s advanced AI models aim to streamline the identification of promising drug candidates, enhance precision, optimize molecular design, and reduce the high failure rates that have historically plagued pharmaceutical development. This breakthrough promises faster access to innovative treatments, lower development costs, improved patient outcomes, and a transformative new era of medical research powered by sophisticated computational intelligence and predictive modeling.Traditional drug discovery involves painstaking laboratory experiments, lengthy clinical trials, and significant trial-and-error testing, often taking 10–15 years from concept to market.According to Hassabis, AI can radically alter this timeline.DeepMind’s subsidiary, Isomorphic Labs, leverages AI to model complex biological systems, analyse molecular structures, and predict interactions between drugs and proteins. In the Bloomberg interview, Hassabis highlighted that AI can process enormous datasets far faster than human researchers, enabling the identification of promising drug candidates within weeks instead of years.This accelerated approach could not only save valuable time but also optimize resource allocation, ensuring that researchers focus on molecules with the highest likelihood of success.A major challenge in drug discovery is the high failure rate: many compounds that look promising in early tests fail in later stages due to inefficacy or harmful side effects. Hassabis emphasized that AI’s predictive capabilities could reduce these failures significantly.DeepMind’s models simulate protein folding and chemical interactions, allowing scientists to forecast how molecules behave in the body. The AI can also suggest novel molecular structures that traditional methods might overlook, expanding the pool of potential therapeutics. By prioritizing candidates most likely to succeed, AI improves efficiency and reduces costly setbacks in research.Hassabis discussed the broader implications of AI-driven drug discovery in the Bloomberg interview. Faster development cycles could allow for quicker responses to pandemics, emerging diseases, and critical health crises. Moreover, AI could facilitate the creation of personalized medicine, tailoring treatments to individual genetic profiles, metabolic rates, and disease characteristics.Beyond speed, AI’s efficiency could lower drug development costs, making treatments more accessible globally. This democratization of medicine could have profound social impacts, particularly for developing nations where access to cutting-edge therapies is limited.While Hassabis did not provide specific drug names in the interview, he emphasized that AI models are already being applied to several disease areas, including neurodegenerative disorders, rare genetic conditions, and chronic illnesses. Early studies suggest that computational predictions could significantly reduce the experimental burden and provide actionable leads for human trials.For instance, modeling protein-drug interactions can identify compounds that might mitigate protein misfolding in diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Similarly, AI-driven analysis of molecular pathways could accelerate treatments for rare cancers where conventional drug development is often economically unviable.Despite its promise, AI-driven drug discovery is not without challenges. Hassabis pointed out several critical considerations:Addressing these challenges will be crucial to translating AI’s predictive power into real-world therapies.","Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming industries, and the pharmaceutical sector is poised to be one of its most significant beneficiaries.

OpenAI and Microsoft reach agreement paving way for $100 billion public benefit shift: Read joint statement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-and-microsoft-reach-agreement-paving-way-for-100-billion-public-benefit-shift-read-joint-statement/articleshow/123844095.cms,"Nonprofit to retain control





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced that it has reached a nonbinding agreement with Microsoft, its largest investor, on a revised partnership that could allow the artificial intelligence startup to change its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation (PBC). Issuing a joint statement via X, the company said “OpenAI and Microsoft have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the next phase of our partnership.” “We are actively working to finalize contractual terms in a definitive agreement. Together, we remain focused on delivering the best AI tools for everyone, grounded in our shared commitment to safety,” it added.In a blog post, OpenAI board chairman Bret Taylor said the nonprofit that currently oversees the company would continue to control operations under the new plan. The nonprofit would also hold a stake in the future PBC, valued at more than $100 billion. Other details of the agreement were not disclosed.OpenAI and Microsoft described the arrangement as a “nonbinding memorandum of understanding” (MOU), which sets out intent but is not legally enforceable.Taylor said OpenAI and Microsoft will work with attorneys general in California and Delaware on the transition plan. Approval is needed before the partnership changes take effect.The announcement follows months of talks between OpenAI and Microsoft about restructuring. OpenAI is unusual among startups because it is controlled by a nonprofit board. That board drew global attention in 2023 when it briefly removed CEO Sam Altman , only to reinstate him days later.Under the current partnership, Microsoft has preferred access to OpenAI’s technology and provides its main cloud services. But as OpenAI’s business has grown, the company has sought more flexibility. It recently signed a $300 billion, five-year cloud deal with Oracle starting in 2027 and partnered with SoftBank on its Stargate data center project.","OpenAI reaches nonbinding agreement with Microsoft on revised partnership.

Google and Microsoft execs have 'same warning' for employees: Learn to use AI or…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-and-microsoft-execs-have-same-warning-for-employees-learn-to-use-ai-or/articleshow/123843583.cms,"Corporate pressure mounts as AI adoption becomes performance metric at tech giants







Top executives at Microsoft and Google are delivering an identical message to their workforces: artificial intelligence adoption is no longer optional for career advancement. Both tech giants are now evaluating employees based on their AI usage and considering formal metrics in performance reviews as competition intensifies in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.Microsoft's Julia Liuson, president of the division overseeing developer tools including GitHub Copilot, sent a memo to managers in June stating that ""using AI is no longer optional — it's core to every role and every level."" Liuson's directive instructed managers to make AI usage part of their ""holistic reflections"" on employee performance and impact, treating AI proficiency like other fundamental workplace skills such as collaboration and data-driven thinking,Google CEO Sundar Pichai followed suit in July during an all-hands meeting, telling employees they need to ""be more AI-savvy"" to help the company compete. Pichai emphasized that rival companies would leverage AI for productivity gains, making it essential for Google to match that efficiency.The pressure extends beyond basic adoption. Google engineering vice president Megan Kacholia sent emails to software engineers mandating AI tool use for coding improvements, while updating job descriptions to include AI problem-solving requirements. Microsoft is considering adding formal AI usage metrics to performance reviews for the next fiscal year, reflecting what company leaders see as lagging internal adoption of Copilot AI services.Now, to ensure widespread AI adoption their workforces both the companies are implementing systematic approach to keep a track of employees’ progress. Google has launched internal programs including ""AI Savvy Google"" with courses and toolkits, while engineering teams are expected to use the company's Cider AI coding tool. More than 30% of code at Google is now AI-generated, up from 25% the previous year.At Microsoft, managers have been told that AI usage should be part of their ""holistic reflections"" on employee performance. GitHub’s ex-CEO Thomas Dohmke defended the policy, comparing mandatory AI use to other fundamental workplace requirements. ""There is no world where I would allow for somebody to say, 'Well, sorry, I don't want to use GitHub,'"" Dohmke stated, suggesting employees who resist could find work elsewhere among ""tens of thousands of other tech companies. ""The companies' approaches extend beyond coding, with sales, legal, and other divisions also receiving instructions to incorporate AI tools.While employees have expressed skepticism about the mandates, most workers interviewed by Business Insider acknowledged that becoming AI-proficient appears necessary for career advancement.Amazon and Shopify have implemented similar policies, with Amazon CEO Andy Jassy telling employees to learn AI tools for ""scrappier teams"" and Shopify requiring teams to demonstrate AI usage before requesting additional resources. The message is consistent across Silicon Valley: adapt to AI-enhanced workflows or risk falling behind in career advancement and company relevance.","Microsoft and Google are telling their workforces that AI adoption is no longer optional for career advancement.

Part of wider immigration drive





US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has arrested two individuals during an enforcement action near a construction site in rural Louisiana where Meta Platforms Inc. is building its largest data center. The arrests, as per Bloomberg report, were made during traffic stops involving dump trucks headed toward the project site in Richland Parish, according to local law enforcement. Authorities said the action was carried out outside the construction site and did not involve ICE agents entering Meta’s premises. The incident comes as federal agencies continue stepped-up immigration enforcement at construction and industrial locations across the United States.The Richland Parish Sheriff’s Office said the two individuals arrested were from Guatemala and Honduras. The office said it assisted ICE agents with the traffic stops and confirmed that the enforcement activity was limited to vehicles traveling to the site. According to the sheriff’s office, ICE agents did not enter the Meta construction site at any time.A witness, who asked not to be identified, said unmarked vehicles arrived near the perimeter of the site in Holly Ridge earlier in the day.The witness said the vehicles appeared to be part of a coordinated federal operation.A person familiar with the situation said ICE acted after a request from local law enforcement related to concerns about undocumented workers. The person declined to be named to discuss a sensitive matter.Meta declined to comment on the incident. The Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not respond to requests for comment. Meta’s general contractors—Turner Construction Company, DPR Construction and Mortenson—also did not respond.The enforcement action follows a broader immigration drive by the Trump administration, which has targeted construction sites and manufacturing plants in recent months. The push comes as US technology companies, including Meta, commit large sums to build data centers needed to support artificial intelligence infrastructure, resulting in major construction projects across states such as Louisiana and Texas.Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry has publicly backed the administration’s immigration agenda. A spokesperson for the governor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has arrested two individuals during an enforcement action near a construction site in rural Louisiana.

Cisco HR chief says the positions that everyone in the technology industry is right now hiring for are...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/cisco-hr-chief-says-the-positions-that-everyone-in-the-technology-industry-is-right-now-hiring-for-are-/articleshow/126621103.cms,"In the competitive landscape of tech talent acquisition, Cisco's Chief People Officer emphasizes the challenges in finding skilled professionals in AI and machine learning, where a dwindling talent pool meets soaring demand. To lure exceptional candidates, executives like President Jeetu Patel are taking proactive measures and reaching out personally.

Cisco’s top executives personally call candidates to close deals

Entry-level opportunities evolving as AI reshapes traditional roles





Cisco's Chief People Officer Kelly Jones has identified AI and machine learning operations roles as the most challenging positions to fill across the technology industry, citing an extremely limited talent pool and unprecedented demand.""The qualified pool is so small, and the demand is so high,"" Jones told Business Insider. She explained that virtually every forward-thinking organization is currently competing for the same specialized talent, both for product development and internal IT operations.To secure elite AI talent, Cisco has deployed an unconventional strategy: getting C-suite executives directly on the phone with candidates. Jones revealed that Cisco's President and Chief Product Officer Jeetu Patel personally calls high-priority candidates to differentiate the company from competitors engaging in ""AI washing.""""Companies are talking about all these things they're doing and how they're slapping AI on everything, but they're actually not doing interesting things with work or with products,"" Jones said, according to Business Insider. The executive outreach helps candidates understand Cisco's genuine AI initiatives beyond marketing rhetoric.Other tech companies have adopted similar tactics. Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly hosted promising candidates at his home over dinner, while Sam Altman makes direct calls to recruits he wants at OpenAI.While AI and ML positions remain scarce, the technology itself is reshaping what entry-level work looks like at Cisco. The company has phased out its level-one customer support roles after an AI assistant took over, handling more than one million cases since 2022, Jones told HR Brew.However, this hasn't meant fewer entry-level jobs—just different ones. Former first-tier support employees have moved into second-level roles, prompting Cisco to completely redesign its onboarding process.""You have to give them all of the learnings of level one because they're stepping in where the technology couldn't solve,"" Jones explained to HR Brew. New hires now handle more complex customer issues that require human judgment.According to Fortune, Cisco is also using AI to free up employee time rather than simply cut costs. The company has introduced AI agents that answer HR questions and automate administrative tasks, potentially giving its 86,000-person workforce back five percent of their time.For AI and ML roles specifically, Jones said Cisco looks beyond technical skills to evaluate intellectual curiosity, emotional agility, and leadership potential. ""It's not just about skills, because those can be learned,"" she noted.The company is also building presence in tech communities, forums, and industry events where specialized AI talent naturally congregates, moving beyond traditional talent branding strategies.","Cisco's Chief People Officer Kelly Jones has identified AI and machine learning operations roles as the most challenging positions to fill.

Lisa Jackson, Vice President for Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives at Apple has retired from the company after 13 years.

Lisa Jackson served as Apple's Vice President of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives since 2013, handling the company's renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives. She reported directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook.In a statement in December 2025, Jackson said “Apple is a remarkable company and it has been a true honor to lead such important work here. I have been lucky to work with leaders who understand that reducing our environmental impact is not just good for the environment, but good for business, and that we can do well by doing good. And I am incredibly grateful to the teams I’ve had the privilege to lead at Apple, for the innovations they’ve helped create and inspire, and for the advocacy they’ve led on behalf of our users with governments around the world. ”Tim Cook said:""I am deeply appreciative of Lisa's contributions. She has been instrumental in helping us reduce our global greenhouse emissions by more than 60 percent compared to 2015 levels. She has also been a critical strategic partner in engaging governments around the world, advocating for the best interests of our users on a myriad of topics, as well as advancing our values, from education and accessibility to privacy and security.

And to see how it was working with these children, and then the kids ended up taking their lives. That's the worst thing I've ever seen in my life,”

“couldn't believe what he was watching”

What Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said about AI companies' stance towards regulations

Tech companies hate regulation. They hate it. Except for one regulation, they love

Section 230

. Which means that those companies are not held accountable for those suicides.”

""Step one is let's just hold people accountable. Let's reshape, reform and revise Section 230, and let's try to save as many lives as we can by doing that,”





Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has raised the alarm over how artificial intelligence (AI) can harm children. After watching a Character AI documentary that showed AI’s negative impact on minors, he called it the darkest part of AI technology he has encountered. Speaking recently on the ""TBPN"" show, Benioff said his reaction stemmed from a ""60 Minutes"" report about the startup that offers customisable chatbots. The documentary showed troubling consequences for young users of the platform.Benioff noted. The CEO added that hewhile viewing the segment. Character AI lets users create custom chatbots that act like friends or romantic partners. The company has yet to comment on Benioff's statements.During the show, Benioff added, “Section 230 is a 1996 US law that shields social media companies from being blamed for what users post on their platforms. It also allows these companies to remove posts they don't want. Big tech companies often use Section 230 as a defence, arguing they are simply platforms and shouldn't be blamed for what users say or do.Benioff suggested.Tech leaders like Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey have repeatedly defended this law before Congress, urging lawmakers to strengthen it rather than repeal it.Last week, Google and Character AI agreed to settle several lawsuits filed by families whose teenagers died by suicide or harmed themselves after using Character AI's chatbots.These settlements are among the first in lawsuits claiming that AI tools played a role in teen mental health problems and suicides. OpenAI and Meta are facing similar legal cases as they compete with others to create AI language models that seem more friendly and helpful, keeping users engaged for longer.","Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has raised the alarm over how artificial intelligence (AI) can harm children.

The New York Times’ Wordle continues to sit quietly inside many people’s daily routines. It rarely takes more than a few minutes, but it asks for full attention while it lasts. Each puzzle offers the same simple task: find a five letter word using no more than six guesses. The appeal comes from its limits. There is only one puzzle a day, and no way to rush ahead. Some days move quickly. Others resist.Wordle #1672 is one of the more deceptive entries. At first glance, it appears manageable, but early guesses can lead in unhelpful directions. Familiar patterns do not settle easily. If progress feels slow, the hints below are designed to narrow the field without giving everything away. The answer appears later for those who want closure or prefer to reset for tomorrow.Wordle challenges players to uncover a hidden five-letter word in six attempts. After each guess, tiles change colour to show how close you are.Using this feedback to refine each new guess is the core of the game.If today’s puzzle is proving stubborn, these clues focus on structure rather than spelling. They are intended to guide rather than solve.Reviewing eliminated letters and leaning on common consonants may help reduce the remaining options and bring the solution into view.The answer to Wordle #1672 on January 16, 2026, is:Meaning: A person who participates in a raceWhether you solved it on your first guess or needed a few clues, Wordle remains a fun way to sharpen your mind every day.

"Quote of the day by Jensen Huang: “I very seldom fire people, I’d rather torture them to greatness”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/quote-of-the-day-by-jensen-huang-i-very-seldom-fire-people-id-rather-torture-them-to-greatness/articleshow/126489810.cms,"NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang

“I very seldom fire people, I’d rather torture them to greatness.”

NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's leadership philosophy on firing and performance



How NVIDIA’s work culture reflects Jensen Huang’s management style



Why Jensen Huang believes discomfort leads to growth



How employees and observers interpret the quote



What Jensen Huang’s quote really says about leadership







When NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang talks about leadership, he doesn’t reach for the usual corporate language. One of his more striking lines is,It sounds odd at first. A boss talking about “torture” rarely lands in polite conversation. But the meaning becomes clearer when you look at how Huang explains what he actually does with his teams. He doesn’t mean cruelty. He means pushing people to grow, learn, and reach a point they might not reach on their own. It’s a style of leadership rooted in belief rather than abandonment. Huang has said he prefers to help people improve instead of simply letting them go when things get tough. He frames this as a belief in potential, a view grounded in his own journey from humble beginnings to the helm of a global tech giant.This quote taps into a broader discussion happening in workplaces today about talent, resilience, and how leaders cultivate performance. Huang’s words are often described as tongue in cheek, yet they point to a real approach many executives wrestle with: should you cut losses and fire someone who’s struggling, or invest time and effort in helping them rise? In Huang’s view, that investment can pay off in unexpected ways.Huang has repeatedly said that firing is not his first instinct. He sees it as a last step, not an early one. In interviews, he has explained that when someone is underperforming, the more important question is why. Is the role wrong? Is the support missing? Is the feedback unclear? His response is usually to lean in, not step away.That approach has shaped NVIDIA’s internal culture. Expectations are high. Feedback is direct. People are expected to learn fast and adapt. Huang believes that struggling inside a demanding environment often teaches more than being comfortable in an easier one. His quote about “torture” reflects that belief. It is about sustained challenge, not humiliation or fear.He has also said that if he hires someone, it means he already believes in their potential. Walking away from that too easily would mean questioning his own judgment. So instead, he stays engaged and pushes for improvement.NVIDIA is widely known as a demanding place to work. Employees have described long hours, intense deadlines, and constant pressure to deliver. At the same time, many stay for years. Compensation, stock rewards, and the chance to work on cutting-edge technology all play a role.Huang’s leadership style is closely tied to that environment. He has said that meaningful work is rarely easy. Progress, especially in advanced computing and artificial intelligence, comes from sustained effort and repeated failure. Teams are expected to confront problems directly, not avoid them.This is where the quote often gets misunderstood. Huang is not celebrating burnout. He is describing a belief that growth happens under pressure, and that leaders should help people through that pressure instead of replacing them at the first sign of difficulty.Huang has spoken openly about discomfort being a teacher. He believes that moments of frustration often come right before breakthroughs. If leaders remove pressure too soon, they may also remove the chance for real learning.In his view, coaching is not about being gentle all the time. It is about being honest. That can mean telling someone their work is not good enough, then staying with them while they fix it. It can mean repeating feedback until it finally lands. That process is hard. For both sides.The phrase “torture them to greatness” sticks because it captures that tension. Growth is rarely smooth. It usually involves moments when quitting feels easier. Huang believes leaders should not make quitting the default option.Reactions to Huang’s words are mixed. Some admire the clarity. Others question whether this level of pressure works for everyone. That debate is common in tech, especially in companies growing as fast as NVIDIA has in recent years.What is clear is that Huang’s quote reflects how he actually operates. NVIDIA’s rise as a dominant force in AI and computing did not happen through cautious leadership. It came from aggressive goals, constant iteration, and teams pushed to deliver more than they thought possible.At its core, this quote is not about suffering. It is about commitment. Huang is saying that he would rather invest time, energy, and effort into developing people than discard them quickly. That choice comes with pressure, discomfort, and high expectations. But it also comes with trust.Not every leader works this way. Not every workplace should. But in Huang’s case, the words align closely with the results and the culture he has built. The quote stands out because it is unpolished, honest, and a little unsettling. Which is often how real leadership conversations sound when they are not filtered for comfort.","Jensen Huang, CEO of tech giant NVIDIA, said he would rather torture people than fire them.

Billionaire Mark Cuban has a ‘success tip’ for students





American billionaire investor Mark Cuban has now issued a stark warning for business leaders about the risks and opportunities of artificial intelligence. Along with this, Cuban has also cautioned that while AI can transform companies, its careless use could expose valuable intellectual property. Speaking during a call with Clipbook founder Adam Joseph, Cuban said that the growth of AI will lead to the creation of “two types of companies: those who are great at AI, and everybody else.” He believed that the companies failing to embrace AI are “doomed to failure” as the technology reshapes industries.Cuban further described AI as ‘stupid’ but likened it to a savant which ‘remembers everything’. He also emphasised that while AI tools can deliver immense benefits, but they are also prone to errors and overconfidence, making it critical for executives to understand the nuances between different platforms rather than trading them as interchangeable.As per Cuban, the misuse of AI could turn a powerful tool into a costly distraction. He also warned the CEOs against indiscriminately sharing proprietary work online, noting that web-scraping chatbots could inadvertently absorb and lead sensitive data. Protecting intellectual property, he said, must be a top priority in the AI era.Cuban has acknowledged the hype around AI and also stressed on the limitations. He pointed out that businesses often underestimate the potential risk of falling behind.Along with this, he also urged the leaders to adopt AI strategically and combine technological foresight with strong governance and data protection.Recently, Mark Cuban said that students these days use artificial intelligence (AI) excessively to ask the “right questions”. However, he said that students should not rely much on AI. Instead, they must use AI to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them. “They use strong inputs and apply critical thinking to evaluate results,” he said adding “AI helps students think bigger, but it doesn’t make decisions”.In an interview with CNBC’s Make It last year, Cuban said that tomorrow’s leaders might be today’s AI-obsessed kids. “Students who use AI will produce better, more creative work and gain a collaborative relationship with technology that’s needed in the future workplace,” he said adding: “Students who use AI will be best equipped to lead.”",Cuban has acknowledged the hype around AI and also stressed on the limitations.

How Google founders 'dumping' California 'looks similar' to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos leaving the city he called 'his home' for 30 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-founders-dumping-california-looks-similar-to-amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-leaving-the-city-he-called-his-home-for-30-years/articleshow/126498943.cms,"Jeff Bezos often points out that long-term success comes from staying committed to an idea while remaining open to changing the approach.

When Jeff Bezos left Seattle

What is California’s Billionaire's tax





It's almost official that Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have cut ties with California. The two Google Guys have reportedly said Bye to California; joining the billionaires who have left the state, shifting businesses and houses. Page is worth around $270 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. According to a report in Wall Street Journal, Larry Page has bought two massive Miami estates for a combined $173.4 million. The report quotes people familiar with the situation Google co-founder Sergey Brin is also said to be in discussions to purchase a Miami home, according to people familiar with the situation.Some analysts have termed Google founders' move to leave California strikingly similar to Jeff Bezos ’ relocation playbook. According to them, the timing, structure, and destination of Page’s escape from Silicon Valley make his Florida pivot look quite like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. But the big difference here is that Jeff Bezos did not leave California. Amazon founder left Seattle, the city where he started the online bookseller that grew into the global tech giant, Amazon.In 2024, Bezos announced on Instagram that he was leaving Seattle after nearly 30 years to move to Miami. He said that the move was to be closer to his parents and his rocket launches at Blue Origin. In his Instagram post, Bezos called Seattle his home since 1994.However, the timing, as some analysts pointed out, also suggested another reason: Taxes. In 2022 Washington state imposed a new, 7% capital gains tax on sales of stocks or bonds of more than $250,000. As Washington state does not have a personal income tax, so the new levy marked the first time that Bezos would face state taxes on his stock sales. As reported by CNBC, in 2022, when the Washington state's Capital gains tax took effect, Bezos stopped selling. He didn’t sell any Amazon stock in 2022 or 2023, gifting only $200 million of shares at the end of that year.After his move to Miami, Bezos reportedly made up for lost time. Quoting an SEC filing, the report says that Bezos launched a pre-scheduled stock-selling plan to unload 50 million shares before January 31, 2025. And since Florida has no state income tax or a tax on capital gains, so on the $2 billion sale that Bezos made, he saved $140 million that he would have paid to Washington state. On the entire sale of 50 million shares over the next year, he saved more than at least 600 million.California’s proposed ballot initiative has been proposed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West to offset federal budget cuts that will affect California’s health care system. It would impose a one-time, 5% tax on the assets of billionaires. The tax would retroactively apply to those who were California residents as of January 1, 2026. In December 2025, venture capitalist Peter Thiel announced that he opened an office for his family investment company in Miami. Donald Trump's AI czar David Sacks unveiled a new office for his venture capital firm, Craft Ventures, in Austin, Texas.","Larry Page has bought two massive Miami estates for a combined $173.4 million.

Bill Gates and Melinda Gates divorce





Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever. According to a report in Forbes, the amount has surfaced in a tax filing. As per the report Bill Gates donation skyrocketed Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation's assets by more than 1,000% to about $7.4 billion in 2024. As the number went up from $604 million at the end of 2023 to $7.4 billion.The $7.88 billion donation was made in 2024 to the Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation, according to a newly released tax filing reviewed by the New York Times’ DealBook. Philanthropies Foundation focuses on women and families. The tax filing is said to mark the first time that concrete financial terms of the Gates’ 2021 divorce have been made public. Melinda Gates also manages some of her investments and charitable work through Pivotal Ventures, the investment company founded in 2015.Bill Gates and Melinda Gates announced their decision to formally separate their philanthropic work in 2024, three years after their divorce became public.In May 2024, Melinda French Gates said that she leaving the charitable foundation she co-founded with Bill Gates more than 20 years ago. Her last day at the foundation was June 7, 2024.""Under the terms of my agreement with Bill, in leaving the foundation, I will have an additional $12.5 billion to commit to my work on behalf of women and families,"" Melinda Gates said then in a post on social media platform X, without disclosing more details about her plans. Post her departure as co-chair, the foundation changed its name to Gates Foundation and with Bill Gates as its sole chairperson. It’s unclear where the additional $4.6 billion was allocated. The funds could have been given to French Gates’ LLC, Pivotal, which does not file a tax return, according to DealBook. As running alongside Pivotal Philanthropies is Pivotal Ventures, a LLC that does not require disclosure requirements that govern traditional nonprofits.""I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,"" Bill Gates wrote in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).In May 2021, Bill and Melinda French Gates announced their intention to divorce, saying they no longer believed they could “grow together”. Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board in 2020, months before the divorce was announced. The couple also reportedly agreed to the division of real estate valued at more than $170 million, an art collection worth roughly $130 million and a significant block of Microsoft stock.In March 2022, Melinda Gates claimed that Jeffrey Epstein played a role in ending their 27-year marriage. During an appearance on “CBS Mornings,” Melinda shared that she decided to leave her marriage “for many things,” including her ex-husband’s ties to Epstein. “I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” she said at the time, adding that she only met the late pedophile once because she “wanted to see who” he was.Melinda Gates has a net worth of $17.6 billion, as per Bloomberg Billioniare Index. Most of her wealth comes from her share of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, significant assets transferred during her 2021 divorce from Bill Gates (including billions in stocks and real estate), and her own organization, Pivotal Ventures, focused on women's equality.","Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever.

Meta investors raises concerns





Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse. Quoting people familiar with the development, a Bloomberg report says that the job cuts come as the company shifts priorities to build next-generation artificial intelligence (AI). It states that the latest job cuts may put breaks on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's long-chased vision of building virtual reality for the metaverse which started in 2014 with the acquisition of virtual reality start-up Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion. Another step in this direction came in 2021, when Facebook rebranded itself as Meta.Meta’s Reality Labs Division roughly has 15,000 employees. According to the Bloomberg report, Meta may announce the cuts to Reality Labs as soon as January 13, 2025. Sources told the publication that layoffs are said to disproportionately affect those in the metaverse unit who work on virtual reality (VR) headsets and a VR-based social network.As per a memo sent by the company to employees last week, Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, who also heads Reality Labs, has called for a ‘most important’ meeting on Wednesday - January 14, asking staff to attend in person.Last year, Zuckerberg asked top executives to make cuts to their 2026 budgets while he pours money into A.I. research. As Meta faces competition from companies like OpenAI and Google, Mr. Zuckerberg has increased the budget for TBD Lab, the skunk works unit at Meta that aims to build superintelligence, a godlike AI system.As reported by Bloomberg, the company also plans to reallocate some of the money from virtual reality products to increase the budget for its wearables division, which builds smart glasses and wristband computing devices.Despite the company spending tens of billions of dollars on developing virtual reality headset, the consumer response has been slower than expected. Investors have grown wary of Meta’s spending.In December last year, a company spokeswoman said Meta was “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward A.I. glasses,” and was not planning “any broader changes.”","Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse.

This move could slow expansion, impacting AI development. Local residents and environmental groups had raised concerns over pollution and health impacts from the unpermitted operations.

“major source thresholds”

Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action Report

How can this updated law affect Elon Musk’s xAI

“temporary”





The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has closed a loophole that was reportedly exploited by Elon Musk ’s artificial intelligence startup xAI. The previous rule helped the company to rapidly build its first data centre in Memphis, Tennessee, a report claims. According to a CNBC report, the company built an off-grid power plant for its Colossus facility using a cluster of gas-burning turbines and avoided air pollution permitting by classifying the turbines, mounted on trailers, as ""non-road engines"".The EPA's updated rule clarifies that these turbines cannot be designated as non-road engines, and companies must also obtain Clean Air Act permits before installing them, particularly if their aggregate emissions exceedof pollution.The Shelby County Health Department in Memphis previously allowed xAI to designate its turbines as non-road engines and to begin using them without any public comment or environmental impact review, as would have been required under a standard permitting process.The move by the US regulator could slow xAI's expansion in the Memphis area as it builds facilities filled with Nvidia's graphics processing units to develop AI models and services in a rapidly growing generative AI market currently led by OpenAI and Google.At the Memphis data centre, which opened in 2024, xAI conducts inference and training for its Grok models and apps, including a chatbot and an image generator, both closely integrated with the company's social network X.While xAI had previously told Memphis regulators that its turbines would include advanced pollution controls, known as selective catalytic reduction technology, its supplier, Solaris Energy Infrastructure, told CNBC in June 2025 that it did not install such controls in xAI'sturbines.SEI, an energy services company based in Houston, has noticed an increase in its stock price in recent months, partly because of the expansion plans of xAI. SEI did not respond to a request for comment. Pollution from the turbines has also been a major cause of concern in the area.Last year, residents of the community of Boxtown in South Memphis testified at public hearings about a rotten-egg-like smell in the air and the impact of worsening smog on their heart and lung health.Research by scientists at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville also found that xAI's turbine use added to air pollution problems around Memphis.Environmental advocates, including the NAACP, said they would sue to stop xAI's unpermitted use of the turbines. However, they did not file a complaint after the county allowed xAI to treat the turbines as temporary, non-road engines and issued them permits.Amanda Garcia, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, which is representing the NAACP, said in an email that her firm will monitor xAI operations to ensure they are not violating terms of their permits and are operating within the bounds of current EPA rules at forthcoming facilities in nearby Mississippi.XAI, which recently raised $20 billion from investors including Nvidia and Cisco, is currently being investigated in multiple jurisdictions after its Grok and X apps let users easily create and distribute deepfake, violent and sexualised images of women and even children.","US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has closed a loophole that was reportedly exploited by Elon Musk ’s artificial intelligence startup xAI.

Read California AG’s full letter to Elon Musk’s xAI

RE: Cease and Desist Demand

Dear Mr. Musk:

My office has opened an investigation into the proliferation of nonconsensual sexually explicit material produced using Grok, an AI model developed by xAI and integrated with X, which is itself owned by xAI. Our office demands that xAI take immediate action to stop the creation and distribution of deepfake nonconsensual intimate images (NCII) or

child sexual abuse material

(CSAM), including via the Grok website or Grok application or using Grok on X. Creation, distribution, publication, and exhibition of CSAM is a crime. (Cal. Penal Code section 311 et seq.) These business practices also violate California’s civil laws.

Over the past weeks, there have been numerous examples of xAI taking ordinary, clothed images of women and children available on the internet and modifying those pictures, in response to user prompts, to depict the people in suggestive and sexually explicit scenarios and “undress” them, all without the subjects’ knowledge or consent. xAI has then published many of these images on X or otherwise made them available to the public.

Perhaps most concerning, there are reports that the images xAI has created and distributed include CSAM. Indeed, in a post to the @Grok account, xAI stated that it “generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user's prompt. This violated ethical standards and potentially US laws on CSAM. xAI has also apparently attempted to limit image generation and editing via the Grok X account to paid premium subscribers of X. It is unclear what limits, if any, had been placed on image generation by Grok, but they were clearly insufficient, as recent public reports indicated that xAI continued to create and distribute NCII and potentially CSAM in response to user prompts.

I appreciate your company’s recent announcement that it is implementing new guardrails regarding xAI’s creation and distribution of sexualized content. However, the scope and implementation of these new measures are unclear. In light of the seriousness of the incidents and concerns described above, as chief law enforcement officer of California, I demand that xAI immediately cease and desist from each of the following actions related to Grok and X:

1.⁠ ⁠Creating, disclosing, or publicizing digitized sexually explicit material portraying the depicted individual when the depicted individual did not consent to its creation or disclosure or was a minor when the material was created. “Digitized sexually explicit material” for these purposes is defined in California Civil Code section 1708.86 as any portion of a visual or audiovisual work created or substantially altered through digitization, including an image, that shows the depicted individual in the nude or appearing to engage in, or being subjected to, sexual conduct.

2.⁠ ⁠Facilitating or aiding and abetting the creation, disclosure, or publication of digitized sexually explicit material portraying the depicted individual when the depicted individual did not consent to its creation or disclosure or was a minor when the material was created, including in violation of Civil Code section 1708.86.

3.⁠ ⁠Creating, facilitating, or aiding and abetting the creation, distribution, or publication of any image, including but not limited to digitally altered or artificial-intelligence-generated matter, that involves or depicts a person under 18 years of age or what appears to be a person under 18 years of age engaging in or simulating sexual conduct. “Sexual conduct” for these purposes is defined in California Penal Code

section 311.4.

Any such actions violate California law, including without limitation, California Civil Code section 1708.86, California Penal Code sections 311 et seq. and 647(j)(4), and California Business & Professions Code section 17200.

I expect xAI to take immediate action to address these issues. I also expect that xAI will provide confirmation to my office that it has stopped the creation and distribution of the problematic material and of the steps it is taking to address these issues no later than January 20, 2026 at 5 pm Pacific Time. In addition, xAI, Grok, and X should take immediate action to preserve all potentially relevant documents and information and prevent the deletion, alteration, or spoliation of any related prompts, images, posts, or other evidence, including electronically stored information.

Sincerely,

ROB BONTA

Attorney General

It often makes workers compare themselves to their coworkers instead of focusing on how far they've come.Yan tells professionals not to chase titles but to work on improving their skills, learning new things, and making meaningful contributions. He has learned that employees who think this way tend to move up in their careers without the constant stress of competition with their bosses.Andrea Wasserman, an executive coach, agrees with this point of view. She tells employees to think about the timing of opportunities in a strategic way: “Will this timing make it easier or harder for me to get a ‘yes?’”Yan stresses that the best way to grow your career is to keep learning and adding value, not waiting for recognition. By putting skills and impact first, professionals build a base that helps them move up in their careers and be happy at work.","Rong Yan is the Chief Technology Officer at HeyGen, a visual storytelling platform.

OpenAI denies Elon Musk’s allegations

OpenAI warns investors





Elon Musk is demanding ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Microsoft to pay up to $134 billion claiming that the AI company defrauded him by diverting from its non-profit roots. According to a report by Bloomberg, Musk has filed a ‘damages request’ in court on Friday, January 16, 2026. The move comes a day after a federal judge rejected a final bid by OpenAI and Microsoft to avoid a jury trial set for late April in Oakland, California.The court filings quote calculations by a financial economist expert witness, C. Paul Wazzan, stating that the tech billionaire was defrauded of the $38 million in seed money he donated to OpenAI. For those unaware, Elon Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015. He left the company in 2018 due to concerns over its commercialization and strategic direction.Musk, as per the filing, is claiming a chunk of OpenAI’s current $500 billion valuation.“Just as an early investor in a startup company may realize gains many orders of magnitude greater than the investor’s initial investment, the wrongful gains that OpenAI and Microsoft have earned – and which Mr. Musk is now entitled to disgorge – are much larger than Mr. Musk’s initial contributions,” Elon Musk’s lawyer Steven Molo wrote in the filing.Both OpenAI and Microsoft have denied Musk’s allegations. In a statement quoted by Bloomberg, OpenAI said “Mr Musk’s lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial. This latest unserious demand is aimed solely at furthering this harassment campaign.”Earlier this week, the Sam Altman-led OpenAI sent a letter to investors and banking partners warning them about possible exaggerated statements from Elon Musk. The letter says that the company expects Elon Musk to make “deliberately outlandish, attention-grabbing claims” as his lawsuit against the AI lab heads to trial on April 27.“We have strong defenses and feel confident about our chances of winning the case,” OpenAI said in the letter, which was viewed by CNBC. “Regardless, based on the record so far, we believe this case is worth no more than the $38M that Elon donated - though that is not a guarantee.”","Elon Musk has filed a 'damages request' in court on Friday, January 16, 2026.

What Ryanair CEO said about rejecting Starlink on its flights





Elon Musk-owned social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter ) suffered an outage on Friday, January 17, 2026 – marking its second service disruption in three days. Ryanair took a cheeky jab at the latest X's outage, sharing a post on X that read “perhaps you need Wi-Fi @elonmusk?”. The tech billionaire replied sharply to the post, sarcastically proposing to acquire the airline and appoint a ""Ryan"" as CEO, turning a tech glitch into a pun on the company's name. “Should I buy Ryan Air and put someone whose actual name is Ryan in charge?,” the Tesla CEO wrote.The exchange went viral on the internet with over 4.4 million views so far. It comes amid a public spat between Elon Musk and Ryanair CEO after he publicly called Elon Musk “an idiot”. In an interview on the radio show Newstalk, Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary dismissed rumours of equipping its flights with Musk’s Starlink satellite internet service. O’Leary said, “I would pay no attention whatsoever to Elon Musk. He’s an idiot, very wealthy, but he’s still an idiot. ”Responding to O’Leary's comments, Elon Musk shared a post writing: ""Ryanair CEO is an utter idiot. Fire him.""Replying to Musk’s comments, O’Leary said, “What Elon Musk knows about flights and drag would be zero.We have to put an aerial antenna on top of the aircraft. It would cost us about $200-$250 million a year. In other words, an extra dollar for every passenger we fly. And the reality for us is we can’t afford those costs. Passengers won’t pay for internet or internet usage. If it’s free, they’ll use it. But they won’t pay one euro each to use the internet. So, we’re not putting it on board. And I frankly wouldn’t pay any attention to anything that Elon Musk puts on that cesspit of his called X. He was the guy who advocated getting Donald Trump elected.”Explaining why he’s not on social media sites like X, O’Leary said: “No, I would not waste…I don’t have any social media accounts. Thankfully, I am too old to get involved in the cesspit that is social media.”","Elon Musk-owned social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter ) suffered an outage on Friday, January 17, 2026 – marking its second service disruption in three days.

Larry Page not the first tech mogul to move out of California

Why billionaires are leaving California





Google cofounder Larry Page , who left California beating the deadline on a proposed wealth tax targeting the state's richest residents, has bought a property on the tropical coastline of South Florida. According to a report, Page has acquired two massive estates in Miami’s Coconut Grove for an amount exceeding $170 million. He is the latest in a string of ultra-high-net-worth individuals to relocate to the US state, and his exit from California comes as the state prepares to vote on a “Billionaire Tax” act.Citing property records, Business Insider reports that Page initiated his move in December 2025 by first purchasing a 4.5-acre compound for $101.5 million. He then acquired a second property less than a mile away in January for an additional $71.9 million through his Tropical Frontier Revocable TrustEarlier this month, a report claimed that Google founder Sergey Brin also shifted an entity tied to them out of California. T-Rex LLC, formed in 2006 and long managed from Palo Alto is converted into a Delaware-based company called T-Rex Holdings on December 24, 2025. Brin, however, still remains tied to various California-based entities, such as the Sergey Brin Family Foundation and Bayshore Global Management.Reports indicate that the Page not only moved his residence but also moved several of his business entities from California to Delaware, Florida and Texas.This mirrors the actions of other industry titans, most notably Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who recently built his own high-security compound in Miami’s Biscayne Bay.This move from Page comes as California is considering a 5% one-time tax on billionaires. A ballot measure slated for November 2026, and if it gets approval, then a tax would apply retroactively to residents as of January 1, 2026. Attorneys have warned Governor Gavin Newsom that the Billionaire wealth tax proposal could lead to an 'exodus of capital and innovation' from the state.","Google cofounder Larry Page has bought two estates in Miami’s Coconut Grove for an amount exceeding $170 million.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang speaks at CES about engineering



“I went into engineering because it was math-heavy and it was science-heavy,”

Jensen Huang on choosing engineering and finding his life partner



“That’s not a game plan that you can reasonably imagine,”

How Jensen Huang describes engineering as problem-solving



Jensen Huang calls engineering the most noble profession



NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang praises IEEE and industry standards



A quieter moment that says a lot about Jensen Huang







NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang did not spend his latest CES appearance talking about AI chips, partnerships, or market dominance. Instead, he used the moment to talk about engineering itself. Huang accepted the IEEE Medal of Honor in a small room at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Las Vegas at CES. The crowd was modest. The message was personal.Standing in front of a few dozen people, Huang explained why he chose engineering in the first place and why, decades later, he still believes it is one of the most meaningful professions there is.The speech came a day after Huang delivered NVIDIA’s main CES keynote, which drew a packed audience and global attention. This time was different. There were no slides about GPUs or AI platforms. No product announcements. Just Huang, a microphone, and a reflection on the path that brought him here.Huang said. He explained that he liked solving math and science problems, and engineering felt like a natural fit.That simple motivation set the foundation for everything that followed.At a time when many tech leaders frame their careers as carefully planned journeys, Huang was refreshingly direct. He liked the work. So he stuck with it.Huang also shared a personal story that drew quiet laughs from the room. He talked about choosing Oregon State University largely because it was close to home. There was no grand vision behind the decision. No long-term strategy.That choice led him to a lab partner who later became his wife.Looking back, Huang seemed genuinely amused by how unpredictable that path was.he said.He extended that thought even further. It was just as unreasonable, he noted, to imagine that the company he would later help build would go on to reshape computing itself. NVIDIA’s role in modern AI and high-performance computing was not something anyone could have plotted on a whiteboard decades ago.As Huang shifted back to the profession itself, his tone became more deliberate. He described engineering as the practice of applying first principles in science and math to real problems. Not abstract ones. Real, stubborn, often messy problems.Engineering, he said, is about breaking down huge challenges into smaller parts that can actually be solved. It also requires resilience. Problems do not give up easily. Solutions take time, patience, and repeated failure.He emphasised that progress in technology rarely comes from sudden inspiration alone. It comes from steady work, collaboration, and the willingness to keep going when things do not work the first time. Or the tenth.In Huang’s view, that is what allows engineering to turn ideas that once felt impossible into everyday reality.Near the end of his remarks, Huang made his most direct statement of all. “This profession is the most noble of all,” he said.It was not delivered as a slogan or a soundbite. It sounded more like a conclusion reached after years of experience. For Huang, engineering earns that label because it creates tools that extend human capability. Tools that last. Tools that others build on.Computers, he noted earlier, have become “the single most important tool of humanity.” Engineering made that possible, even if no one could fully predict where it would lead.Huang also used the moment to acknowledge IEEE, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, which awarded him the Medal of Honor. He praised the organisation’s role in setting technical standards that quietly hold the tech world together.Joking about Wi-Fi standards, he said, “You have to think about IEEE when you think about 802.11.” It was the kind of line that probably would not land outside an engineering crowd. Here, it did.Huang pointed out that industrial standards are not glamorous, but they are essential. They form the basic structure on which the entire computer industry is built. Without them, innovation would be fragmented and fragile.In a week filled with flashy demos and big promises about AI, Huang’s smaller speech stood out for a different reason. It was grounded. Personal. Almost old-fashioned.There was no attempt to impress. Just a reminder that behind every breakthrough are people who chose to work through hard problems, often without knowing where that work would lead.For students, engineers, and anyone building a career in technology, Huang’s message was simple but reassuring. You do not need a perfect plan. You need curiosity, discipline, and the willingness to keep solving problems.Sometimes, that turns out to be more than enough.","Jensen Huang spoke at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Las Vegas at CES.

5 Key things you missed at Apple iPhone launch event

Apple calls the math unconstitutional

Court hearing scheduled for late January





The Competition Commission of India have had enough of Apple 's stalling. After more than a year of delays, the antitrust watchdog has issued a final warning to the iPhone maker: respond by next week or we're moving forward without you.The stern message came in a confidential December 31 order that accused Apple of undermining the investigation through ""repeated extensions,"" according to Reuters. What started as a routine request for objections in October 2024 has turned into a bureaucratic standoff, with Apple refusing to engage while it fights the rules in court.At stake is a potential $38 billion fine—one of the heftiest corporate penalties ever contemplated. The amount stems from the 2024 rule change allowing regulators to base fines on a company's global revenue rather than just local earnings.Apple isn't taking this lying down. The company filed a 545-page constitutional challenge in November, arguing that the new penalty framework is ""manifestly arbitrary"" and ""grossly disproportionate."" To illustrate the absurdity, Apple compared it to penalizing a toy seller's entire business for violations in just one product line.The underlying case dates to 2022, when Match Group and Indian startups complained that Apple abused its App Store dominance. Investigators found Apple forces developers to use its payment system, charges up to 30% commissions, and blocks apps from even mentioning cheaper alternatives outside the App Store.Apple quietly asked the CCI to freeze everything until the court settles the penalty dispute. The regulator said no. Now both sides are digging in—Apple plans to stay silent until Delhi High Court hears arguments on January 27.Legal experts say Apple faces long odds. The amended law explicitly permits global turnover calculations, making it tough to overturn what's already settled legislative policy. Meanwhile, the CCI's patience has clearly run out, with the watchdog warning that ""such indulgence cannot be continued indefinitely.""",The Competition Commission of India have had enough of Apple's stalling.

Eric Demers joining post on Linkedin



Next week will be my first week at Intel.

//Story mode for those inclined

I have two fun memories of Intel. First off, I should say that as a Teenager, I did not have pictures of bands on my walls. I had a picture of an Intel 80386 processor die! That accompanied a picture of a Gandalf from the animated LofR movie and an HP computer. Yes, I was and am, a nerd. Also, in 1991, while at Cornell, I interviewed with a variety of companies. One was Intel. I remember meeting the interviewer, who was from the server division, and me stating “I didn’t know Intel made server chips!”. I did not get an offer. So, desire was set but opportunity missed.

As I stated last week, personal events seeded the ground for change. One of those events is very memorable. In September, my wife Esther took us on a 3-day trip into the Julian mountains, near San Diego. During that great weekend (no devices, mostly talking), she asked me, “What’s our 10-year plan?”. Wow, what a question! It resonated so strongly in me! It got me to pull my nose out of the now, to consider the much longer outlook. It made some of the decisions that I made over the next few months,much easier. Good outlook to take when making big decisions. BTW, I didn’t have all the answers for her, but we’ll figure it out together.

Over the last few months, I’ve talked and met with Lip-Bu Tan several times. I’ve been impressed by him. Charming, intelligent and clearly strategic in his views on Intel. As well as so humble. I’ve also had the opportunity to meet a few leaders there as well. Throughout, I’ve been impressed by their confidence in Lip-Bu and upbeat view of things, even after some of the transitional events of 2025 that they went through. While I do have some friends there, everyone was friendly and I got a real sense of welcome and general excitement. That has got me also excited about working at the new Intel and participating in this continued turnaround. Nothing is easy, but this fresh start lines up perfectly with my hopes and plans.

//End story mode

So next week will be my first week. I’ll be working remotely, though I expect to visit the various teams, especially as my shoulder heals (I had should reconstructive surgery in November). I find myself like I was 14 years ago, excited for a new adventure!

Nonetheless, he hinted at an intriguing possibility of stepping into the role of US Treasury Secretary. These remarks come on the heels of a public spat with President Trump about the autonomy of the Fed.

Clash with Donald Trump over Fed independence

JPMorgan's $2 billion AI bet already breaking even





JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has now made it clear where he draws the line on his future career. As reported by Bloomberg, Dimon said that he will never serve as Federal Reserve Chair, though he hasn’t ruled out a possible role as US Treasury Secretary. Speaking at the US Chamber of Commerce’s State of American Business event, Dimon has asked if he would consider leading the Federal Reserve. To which he responded, “Chairman of the Fed, I’d put in the absolutely, positively no chance, no way, no how, for any reason.” Dimon said that he would ‘take the call’ if asked to run the Treasury, leaving the door open to a cabinet role in the future.Dimon has led JPMorgan for two decades, transforming it into the largest and most profitable US bank. His stature has made him a fixture in discussions about potential government roles, with his name floated for positions in both Democratic and Republican administrations.The comments made by Dimon came just days after a a public back-and-forth with President Donald Trump over the administration’s criticism of the central bank. Recently, Dimon warned that undermining Fed independence was “not a great idea” and could lead to higher inflation and interest rates.Trump quickly responded to the warning and said, “I think he’s wrong.”Dimon then stressed on the fact that most leaders including the president agree the Fed must remain independent. “If you chip away too much — in my view, this is my opinion — it will drive rates higher, not lower,” Dimon said.Earlier this month, Dimon offered more encouraging numbers. He revealed that JPMorgan's $2 billion annual AI spend is now generating roughly equivalent savings—a milestone he called ""just the tip of the iceberg."" The bank's hundreds of AI use cases range from internal operations to external-facing tools.The reality check, however, came from market reaction. JPMorgan's stock tumbled over 4% Tuesday after the earnings announcement, reflecting investor jitters about whether the spending spree will actually deliver promised returns. Whether Dimon's faith-based approach to tech investment persuades Wall Street remains to be seen.","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has made it clear where he draws the line on his future career.

Microsoft cancels employees’ subscriptions to news outlets and business books

From books that sank buildings to AI learning





Microsoft is shutting down its employee libraries in Redmond, Hyderabad, Beijing, and Dublin this week, ending a decades-old perk that gave workers access to physical books, author events, and curated reading lists—including titles personally recommended by CEO Satya Nadella The company is replacing the libraries with what it calls an ""AI-powered learning experience"" through its Skilling Hub. According to The Verge, the transition also eliminates employee subscriptions to major news outlets and industry publications that staff have used for research and professional development.The library overhaul means Microsoft employees are losing access to digital publications like The Information and Strategic News Service (SNS), which had served the company's roughly 220,000 employees for over 20 years. Workers can no longer digitally check out business books from the Microsoft Library either.Publishers received automated emails in November notifying them of contract cancellations. ""This correspondence serves as official notification that Microsoft will not renew any existing contracts upon their respective expiration dates,"" read one such message from Microsoft's vendor management team. In an internal FAQ, the company acknowledged ""this change affects a space many people valued"" but framed it as progress toward a ""more modern, connected learning experience.Microsoft says it still offers access to more than 20 digital resources, though it's unclear which specific subscriptions survived the cutsThe Microsoft Library has been part of campus lore for years. An unproven legend claims the collection's sheer weight once caused Building 4 to sink when it was housed on the second floor above a cafeteria. Veteran Windows developer Raymond Chen wrote in 2020 that while the sinking might be debatable, ""everyone agreed that the pillars in the underground parking were starting to crack."" TThe library later moved to Building 92, which is now being repurposed into collaborative spaces for ""group learning and experimentation"" with emerging technologies. Former Windows president Steven Sinofsky called the library ""a crown jewel of the early days"" on X, noting they bought every PC book and would acquire any title employees needed.Strategic News Service didn't hold back its criticism of the AI pivot.

One of the world's richest techies 'forced' to rename yacht after told the name's 'embarrassing meaning',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/one-of-the-worlds-richest-techie-forced-to-rename-yacht-after-told-the-names-embarrassing-meaning/articleshow/126591194.cms,"Larry Ellison's Yacht name change draws attention

Larry Ellison’s Yacht name change sparks conversation online





Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, one of the wealthiest people in the technology industry, had named his 191-foot yacht “Izanami,” a reference to a Japanese Shinto deity associated with creation and death. However, the name was later dropped after Ellison was informed that when spelled in reverse, it reads “I’m a Nazi,” a phrase widely considered offensive. The incident was detailed in a profile published by Vulture. Following this discovery, the yacht’s name was changed, the report said.According to the report, Larry Ellison purchased the yacht after investing tens of millions of dollars in a Florida safari park. The vessel is smaller than his earlier 288-foot yacht but remains one of the largest privately owned yachts in the world.The name “Izanami” was chosen for its mythological meaning, but the reversed spelling led to concerns once the issue was pointed out.Larry Ellison reportedly has strong personal and business ties to Israel. His first wife previously described him as “an ardent Zionist”. The Vulture report noted that he has been close to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.The yacht name incident gained attention on social media after details from the profile circulated online. As per the report, some users compared the episode to fictional portrayals of wealthy families in popular television dramas.“This is straight out of Succession,” podcast host Rob Pasbani wrote in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).Other users reacted with frustration over repeated reports about the personal lives of billionaires. “I am so tired, y’all,” one Reddit user wrote in response to the story. Another commented, “‘Reality’ is just too on the nose.”Ellison, 80, co-founded Oracle in 1977 and remains one of its largest shareholders. His son, David Ellison, is currently involved in the media industry and is expected to take a leadership role at Paramount Skydance later this year, according to earlier reports.","Ellison named his 191-foot yacht “Izanami,” a reference to a Japanese Shinto deity associated with creation and death.

Artificial intelligence is no longer something people only argue about in tech conferences or future forecasts. It is already shaping daily life, often quietly. From customer support chats to recommendation engines, from coding tools to medical research, AI is now part of how work gets done. And according to Bill Gates , the pace of change is about to speed up even more.In his latest annual letter,, the Microsoft co-founder lays out a clear message. AI will reshape society and jobs faster than most people expect. Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with warnings. The benefits are real. So are the risks. And ignoring either would be a mistake.Gates has spent decades watching technology alter economies and daily life. In his letter, he says AI is different from past waves of innovation. Not just faster, but broader. He argues that artificial intelligence could affect more parts of society than any previous human-made tool.He points to progress already happening. AI is accelerating disease research, improving climate modelling, and expanding access to digital education. Tasks that once took years can now be completed in months, sometimes weeks.For Gates, this is proof that AI can solve hard problems if used well.But he also stresses that hope alone is not a strategy. Institutions, governments, and workers are not fully prepared for how quickly these changes are arriving. Without planning, the speed of AI adoption could leave many people behind.One of Gates’ biggest concerns is how AI could be misused. As advanced tools become more accessible, the barrier to harmful use drops. He has warned that open-source AI systems could be exploited by bad actors, including non-state groups.In particular, Gates has raised alarms about biological threats. He suggests that AI-assisted misuse could pose risks even greater than naturally occurring pandemics. That is not a casual statement. It reflects a growing fear among researchers that powerful tools, in the wrong hands, could scale harm faster than ever before.Gates argues that global cooperation is essential. Clear rules, oversight, and governance structures are needed. At the same time, he acknowledges the tension. Too many restrictions could slow beneficial innovation. Too little could invite danger. Finding the balance will not be easy.Jobs sit at the centre of Gates’ warning. He says AI makes it possible to produce more goods and services with less human labour. That reality will change how companies hire and how work is valued.Some of this is already visible. In software development, AI tools help programmers write, test, and maintain code faster. Gates notes that developers can now be significantly more productive, which lowers costs and reshapes team structures.He also points to sectors like warehouse operations and phone-based customer service. As AI systems improve, these roles are likely to face pressure. Automation will not arrive all at once, but it will arrive steadily.Gates does not frame this as doom. He frames it as a disruption that needs preparation.Beyond job losses, Bill Gates talks about how work itself might change. If AI boosts productivity enough, shorter workweeks could become possible. The same output, fewer hours. It sounds appealing. But he is careful not to present it as automatic.Whether these gains benefit most people depends on policy choices. Who owns the productivity gains. How companies share them. Without thoughtful decisions, Gates warns that efficiency could concentrate wealth instead of spreading it.This is where governments and institutions matter. AI alone will not deliver fairness. People have to decide what to do with the gains it creates.","Bill Gates says AI will reshape society and jobs faster than most people expect.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Trump previously threatened of 100% tariff on chips that are not made in the US

Trump govt wants 25% 'cut' on the sale of Nvidia AI chips





The United States Commerce Department’s decision to impose a 25% national security tariff on certain high-end semiconductors is only the “phase one” step, a White House official said. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the move, announced earlier this week is being described as a “phase one” action aimed at protecting the US semiconductor sector.Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said further announcements could follow after talks with other countries and companies. The comments suggest that the tariff policy may expand depending on how negotiations progress.The report said the tariff is part of broader efforts by President Donald Trump to strengthen domestic chip manufacturing. The official noted that Trump has earlier warned of much higher duties (up to 100%) on chips produced outside the United States. In previous statements, Trump had said tariffs could go as high as 100% on semiconductors that are not made in the U.S.The administration has repeatedly said that semiconductors are a matter of national security, given their role in defence systems, artificial intelligence, consumer electronics and industrial equipment.The new tariff applies to selected high-end chips, though details on affected products and companies were not immediately disclosed.Reuters reported that the White House sees the current tariff as an opening measure rather than a final decision. Any additional steps would depend on discussions with trade partners and industry players.In a recent news, Trump announced that his administration will now allow Nvidia’s H200 AI chips to be sold to China, but only under strict conditions including a 25% government cut on sales and export caps designed to protect US supply. For those unaware, H200 is part of Nvidia’s Hopper generation which is a hit-performance chip sold in the US and other global makers. Unlike the earlier H20 chip, which was specifically slowed down for export, the H200 is not a China-only design.Trump has acknowledged that the H200 has already surpassed by Nvidia’s newer Blackwell and Rubin chips, but said the US would still benefit financially, “It’s not the highest level, but it’s a pretty good level, and China wants them and other people want them — and we’re going to be making 25% on the sale of those chips, basically.”","The move is being described as a ‘phase one’ action aimed at protecting the US semiconductor sector.

that'd be pretty morally bankrupt. and he's really not an idiot."" (Id.) Days later, Brockman further wrote under the heading ""our plan"" that ""it would be nice to be making the billions"" and explained that ""we've been thinking that maybe we should flip to a for profit.

Hours after the ruling, Musk took to his social media platform, X, to reshare a post that are claimed to be the ‘personal files’ of OpenAI President Greg Brockman. According to the screenshots posted, the unsealed documents date back to 2017, and appear to show internal plotting for a for-profit transition years before the company’s public pivot.“They openly discuss their conspiracy to commit fraud and steal the charity,” Musk said in the post, pointing to the claim that he was told the startup remained committed to its non-profit roots.The document appears to reveal internal deliberations over financial gains, with notes allegedly referencing targets of $1 billion for individuals (allegedly Brockman) and expressing fears of being “dishonest” with Musk regarding the company's trajectory.The alleged documents submitted in the court claims that Brockman told peers that “This is the only chance we have to get out from Elon.

Why Japan investigation may be problem for X





Japan has become the latest country to launch a formal investigation into X’s Grok after the AI chatbot generated non-consensual sexualised photos. Economic security minister Kimi Onoda announced on Friday (January 16) that the cabinet office has officially demanded that Elon Musk ’s social media platform strengthen its safeguards. xAI, the company behind Grok, is already facing similar probes in the UK, Canada and the European Union.According to news agency Reuters, Onoda said at a press conference that Japanese officials have submitted written questions to X, focusing on the platform's ability to prevent deepfakes that violate privacy and intellectual property rights. She suggested that even though xAI has disabled the ability for users to create sexualised photos of real people, the current measures may not go far enough.“All possibilities, including legal steps, are on the table if there is no improvement,” said Onoda, who also issued a stern warning to the broader tech industry, adding, “If similar problems occur on other platforms, we will also act.”Countries like Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia have banned the platform, while the EU and individual member states like France are investigating whether the Grok has violate people’s right. The comments from Tokyo, however, carry significant weight because Japan remains X’s largest overseas market.Soon after scrutiny, X announced that it has moved the ability to generate photos behind a paywall but Onoda said Japan may seek further measures from xAI.“It’s a problem that people can still create such images,” Onoda said, maintaining a nuanced stance on the technology itself.“If a knife is lying there, do you use it to cook or to hurt someone?” she asked, suggesting that the government’s focus is on the misuse of the tool rather than the AI itself.","Japan has become the latest country to launch a formal investigation into X’s Grok.

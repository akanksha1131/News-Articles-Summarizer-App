Ads in ChatGPT: Privacy and safety rules

After weeks of criticism and public jabs from rival Anthropic, OpenAI has started testing ads in ChatGPT. Sharing a blog post, the company said it has started testing ads in the AI tool in the United States and will apply only to logged-in adult users on the Free and Go plans. “We’re starting to roll out a test for ads in ChatGPT today to a subset of free and Go users in the U.S,” OpenAI said in an X post adding “Ads do not influence ChatGPT’s answers. Ads are labeled as sponsored and visually separate from the response. Our goal is to give everyone access to ChatGPT for free with fewer limits, while protecting the trust they place in it for important and personal tasks.”OpenAI said ads are meant to help fund the infrastructure needed to keep the Free and Go tiers running and to support broader access to AI tools. The company said it will study feedback closely before expanding the program.“Keeping the Free and Go tiers fast and reliable requires significant infrastructure and ongoing investment. Ads help fund that work, supporting broader access to AI through higher quality free and low cost options, and enabling us to keep improving the intelligence and capabilities we offer over time,” the company stated in the blog post.OpenAI added that while advertising may grow over time, ChatGPT’s answers will remain independent, and user privacy will remain a core priority.As announced by the company, ads will appear only for adult users on the Free and Go tiers. Paid tiers such as Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise and Education will remain ad-free. Free users can also opt out of ads, but this will reduce the number of daily free messages they can send.OpenAI said ads will not affect how ChatGPT answers questions and that user conversations will stay private. The company described the move as a limited test aimed at learning from real-world use before any wider rollout.Users will be able to dismiss ads, give feedback, view ad history, delete ad data and manage personalization settings. OpenAI said these controls are meant to give users clear choices over their experience.OpenAI said ads will be clearly labeled as sponsored and shown separately from ChatGPT’s answers. The company stressed that ads do not influence responses. Ads are selected by matching advertiser submissions with the topic of a user’s conversation, along with past chats and past ad interactions.“During the test, we decide which ad to show by matching ads submitted by advertisers with the topic of your conversation, your past chats, and past interactions with ads. For example, if you're researching recipes, you may see ads for meal kits or grocery delivery. If there are multiple advertisers, we'll select the one that is most relevant to your chat to show you first,” OpenAI said in the blog post.OpenAI said advertisers do not have access to your chats, chat history, memories, or personal details. Advertisers will only receive aggregate information about how their ads perform such as number of views or clicks, the company stressed.Further, it will not show ads in accounts where the user is under 18 and “ads are not eligible to appear near sensitive or regulated topics like health, mental health or politics.”","OpenAI has started testing ads in its ChatGPT AI tool in the United States.

I've decided to leave Anthropic. My last day will be February 9th.

Thank you. There is so much here that inspires and has inspired me. To name some of those things: a sincere desire and drive to show up in such a challenging situation, and aspire to contribute in an impactful and high-integrity way; a willingness to make difficult decisions and stand for what is good; an unreasonable amount of intellectual brilliance and determination; and, of course, the considerable kindness that pervades our culture.

I've achieved what I wanted to here. I arrived in San Francisco two years ago, having wrapped up my PhD and wanting to contribute to AI safety. I feel lucky to have been able to contribute to what I have here: understanding Al sycophancy and its causes; developing defences to reduce risks from Al-assisted bioterrorism; actually putting those defences into production; and writing one of the first AI safety cases. I'm especially proud of my recent efforts to help us live our values via internal transparency mechanisms; and also my final project on understanding how Al assistants could make us less human or distort our humanity. Thank you for your trust.

Nevertheless, it is clear to me that the time has come to move on. I continuously find myself reckoning with our situation. The world is in peril. And not just from Al, or bioweapons, but from a whole series of interconnected crises unfolding in this very moment.' We appear to be approaching a threshold where our wisdom must grow in equal measure to our capacity to affect the world, lest we face the consequences. Moreover, throughout my time here, I've repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions. I've seen this within myself, within the organization, where we constantly face pressures to set aside what matters most, and throughout broader society too.

It is through holding this situation and listening as best I can that what I must do becomes clear.' I want to contribute in a way that feels fully in my integrity, and that allows me to bring to bear more of my particularities. I want to explore the questions that feel truly essential to me, the questions that David Whyte would say ""have no right to go away"", the questions that Rilke implores us to""live"". For me, this means leaving.

What comes next, I do not know. I think fondly of the famous Zen quote ""not knowing is most intimate"". My intention is to create space to set aside the structures that have held me these past years, and see what might emerge in their absence. I feel called to writing that addresses and engages fully with the place we find ourselves, and that places poetic truth alongside scientific truth as equally valid ways of knowing, both of which I believe have something essential to contribute when developing new technology.* I hope to explore a poetry degree and devote myself to the practice of courageous speech. I am also excited to deepen my practice of facilitation, coaching, community building, and group work. We shall see what unfolds.

Thank you, and goodbye. I've learnt so much from being here and I wish you the best. I'll leave you with one of my favourite poems, The Way It Is by William Stafford.

Good Luck, Mrinank

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has praised Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, as an “absolute genius” following a viral Super Bowl advertisement. The world’s biggest YouTuber launched a $1 million puzzle-based Super Bowl commercial promoting Salesforce's Slackbot AI assistant on February 8. The commercial featured cryptic visual clues and urged viewers to solve interconnected puzzles online.A Twitter user posted on X: “This ad was genius. My 9-year old and all his friends are creating Salesforce accounts right now. And they’re all making cold calls to B2B decision makers and generating SQLs for enterprise SaaS companies. Mr. Beast just created 1 billion new CRM users.”Replying to his post, Benioff shared analytics demonstrating the massive scale of the campaign’s impact. According to the CEO, the surge was nearly instantaneous.“We’ve had over 53M people hit this page since the spot ran. 1.32M in the last 15 minutes. Beyond any expectation we could have had. MrBeast is an absolute genius,” he posted.“Solve puzzle. Slack @MrBeast the answer first. Win a million bucks,” Salesforce said in a separate post. The YouTuber also shared the puzzle, saying, “First person to solve the puzzle in my new SuperBowl ad wins $1,000,000! Good luck :)”Last year, MrBeast announced that he had a Super Bowl commercial idea and was looking for a company to hire him to make this idea a reality.Benioff quickly responded with a high-stakes invitation to collaborate.“I’ve been sitting on an amazing Super Bowl commercial idea for years. Someone please let me make your brand’s Super Bowl commercial so I can finally make this idea happen,” he posted to his millions of followers.Benioff, who is known for his aggressive growth strategy of the Salesforce ecosystem, was quick to jump on the opportunity.“Jimmy, you absolute Slack maniac—hit me with a wild offer I can’t refuse for your Super Bowl spot!

Despite a significant selloff in software stocks triggered by Anthropic's legal AI tools, they argue AI will enhance, not replace, existing software, enabling greater productivity and innovation.

Nvidia's Huang chimes in with Pichai, calls selloff 'most illogical thing in the world'

What exactly triggered the selloff

India’s AI Rise Gets Global Push As UN Chief Praises Leadership, Nvidia CEO Predicts Job Surge

Why the fear runs deeper than one plugin

Google CEO Sundar Pichai isn't buying the panic. During the company's earnings call, Pichai pushed back against the market hysteria triggered by Anthropic's new AI plugins, calling it overblown. AI is ""an enabling tool,"" he said, just as it has been for Google 's own products—Search, YouTube and others. Companies ""seizing the moment"" will find the same opportunity ahead, he added.His comments come as software stocks worldwide nurse heavy losses. Anthropic's Claude Cowork plugins, wiped out roughly $285 billion from software, legal tech and financial services stocks in a single session. Analysts dubbed it a 'SaaSpocalypse'. Pichai's view? The scramble is overdone.Pichai isn't alone in questioning the market reaction. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was even more direct at a Cisco event, calling the selloff ""the most illogical thing in the world."" His take: AI will use existing software tools, not reinvent them. ""Would you use a screwdriver or invent a new screwdriver?"" he asked. Huang added that Nvidia itself has adopted such tools extensively, freeing up employees to focus on designing chips and computer systems.Software company executives have also pushed back, arguing they do far more than just build code. Their offerings include data management and purpose-built solutions that are difficult to replicate, especially for enterprises outside the tech world like retail and oil and gas.Anthropic released 11 open-source plugins for Claude Cowork, its agentic AI assistant for non-technical professionals. Most covered standard enterprise functions—sales, marketing, finance, customer support. But the legal plugin rattled nerves. It automates contract review, NDA triage, compliance checks and legal briefings.Morgan Stanley analyst Toni Kaplan called it ""a sign of intensifying competition"" that could hurt big players in the legal space. The fallout was swift. Thomson Reuters and RELX both closed down around 15%. LegalZoom crashed nearly 20%. Indian IT stocks weren't spared—Infosys ADRs slipped 5.5%, Wipro fell nearly 5%.The concern isn't just about legal workflows. There's a dawning realisation that AI tools can now do far more than most non-techies realise. With relatively simple prompts, they can take over a user's computer, write software, analyse stock market data, manage emails and countless other tasks. People have taken to social media describing how they built their first software program without ever learning to code. Shopify's CEO built software that could interpret his recent MRI.Meta's CFO Susan Li told investors last week that the company has seen a 30% year-over-year increase in output per engineer driven by AI coding tools. Power users have seen an 80% boost.Anthropic's numbers back up the concern. Claude Code hit $1 billion in annualised recurring revenue by November, months after launch. The company is reportedly raising $20 billion at a $350 billion valuation. Jefferies noted that OpenAI is losing corporate ground to Claude, with enterprises now making up 80% of Anthropic's business.Pichai and Huang are betting the panic subsides. Wall Street isn't so sure yet.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismiss market panic over AI plugins, calling it overblown.

Why Microsoft needs a quality czar right now

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre. Charlie Bell, who led the company's security operations since 2021, is stepping down from that role to become what's effectively an engineering quality czar—reporting directly to Nadella.""Charlie and I have been planning this transition for some time, given his desire to move from being an org leader to being an IC engineer,"" Nadella wrote in an internal memo shared on Wednesday. ""And I love how energized he is to practice this craft here day in and day out!""Bell's replacement? Hayete Gallot, who's returning to Microsoft after an 18-month stint as Google Cloud's President of Customer Experience. She previously spent over 15 years at Redmond, climbing to the rank of corporate vice president across Windows, Office, and security teams.The shift is significant. Bell oversaw a team of roughly 10,000 people and was the driving force behind Microsoft's Secure Future Initiative—a company-wide push launched after Chinese hackers breached US government email accounts through a Microsoft Cloud exploit in 2023. That incident triggered a scathing review from the Department of Homeland Security, which called Microsoft's security culture ""inadequate.Now, Bell will work closely with cloud and AI chief Scott Guthrie and Mala Anand on what Nadella calls the ""Quality Excellence Initiative."" The initiative is aimed at delivering ""durable, high-quality experiences at global scale""—corporate speak that likely translates to fewer Azure outages, fewer broken Windows patches, and fewer out-of-band emergency fixes.Gallot's appointment signals a shift in how Microsoft thinks about its security business. Nadella specifically highlighted her ability to combine ""product building with value realization for customers."" She'll also oversee Ales Holecek, who takes on a newly created Chief Architect for Security role.The timing isn't random. During last week's earnings call, Nadella talked up momentum in security products like Security Copilot agents and Purview. The company clearly wants someone who can sell security as aggressively as they build it.Nadella's memo doesn't spell out exactly why engineering quality needs its own dedicated leader at this moment. But the clues aren't hard to find. Microsoft now uses AI to write around 30 percent of its own code, Azure outages remain a recurring headache, and Copilot adoption sits at a modest 3.3 percent among Microsoft 365 users. Bell's got his work cut out.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre.

A single-day slump of 5% in Oracle’s stock erased about $9 billion from this wealth, deepening the decline.The round in software stocks was triggered by Anthropic’s release of plugins for its Claude Cowork AI agent, which can easily automate corporate tasks in legal, scales, finance, marketing and data analysis. Investors now fear that such tools could lead to reduction in the demand for external software from established giants such as Adobe, Salesforce, Intuit and Atlassian. Shares of all these companies tumbled earlier this week before staging a particle rebound, but Oracle’s loses remained steep.Ellison was not along in facing the sharp decline in net worth. Along with him, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also saw his net worth fall by around $11 billion, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg lost around $8 billion. On the other hand, other tech leaders like Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Jeff Bezos and Jensen Huang each shed around $5 billion as the stocks of the companies dropped by at least 2%.For those unaware, Oracle has aggressively positioned itself as an important player in the AI boom, the company has signed deals with Nvidia and OpenAI in order to offer data centers powering next-generation technology. However, its heavy spending and increasing debt have raised concerns among analysts. The company’s remaining performance obligations — contracted sales not yet recognized as revenue — surged 438% year-over-year to $523 billion as of November 30, nearly ten times its annual revenue of $53 billion.Critics believe that Oracle may be overspending. Popular American investor Michael Burry has publicly bet against Oracle. Burry has warned that the company’s debt-fueled expansion tied to AI contracts was unnecessary, calling the moves “hard to explain” and suggesting that “ego” might be driving decisions.","Ellison's fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January.

Why Amazon is shutting down Amazon Go and Fresh stores

Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its Amazon Fresh supermarket chain. The decision of the company to shut down the Amazon Fresh stores will lead to thousands of job cuts across the US. Last week, the e-commerce major announced that it will close around 60 Fresh stores which will put an end to the effort of six-years. As reported by Business Insider, the WARN notices filed in various states confirm the sale of layoffs. As aper the filling, in California only the company will shut down 20 Fresh stores which will affect around 3,900 workers. Most Fresh locations closed to the public on February 1, though California stores will remain open until mid-March due to state law.As Amazon is shutting down the Fresh stores, it has outlined two main options for the affected employees. The company is giving a choice to the employees in which they can either choose the severance pay or can take transfer within the company. The workers will continue to receive their normal pay and benefits for 90 days after the closure announcement, or until April 28. The compensation offered by the company will be based on either the minimum pay for their employee class of their average hours worked over the past 60 days whichever is higher.The report further adds that employees who do not secure another role within the company by late April will then receive severance packages, calculated as one week of pay for every six months of service at Amazon Fresh. Workers are guaranteed a minimum of four weeks’ pay, with the possibility of up to 20 weeks depending on tenure.For those seeking to remain within Amazon, the company is encouraging Fresh workers to apply for similar positions at Whole Foods Stores or Amazon grocery warehouse via its internal A to Z portal. An Amazon spokesperson said: “All affected employees will have the opportunity to apply for open roles within Amazon where available, and we’re providing career transition services to help them explore options.”Amazon Fresh associates typically earned between $16 and $20 per hour, according to data from job site Indeed. Their responsibilities ranged from picking delivery orders to handling checkout operations.Amazon Go and Fresh stores were introduced as Just Walk Out technology, but they struggled to establish a distinctive customer experience and sustainable economic model. On the other hand, Whole Food Market acquired in 2017 by Amazon say strong growth with sales rising more than 40% in recent years. Also, Amazon’s online grocery business also witnessed a surge with perishable grocery sales through Same-Day Delivery growing 40x since January 2025, making fresh groceries one of the most-ordered categories on its platform.",Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its Amazon Fresh supermarket chain.

Meet Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei: Former OpenAI researcher who turned his AI vision into a $3.7 billion company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meet-anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-former-openai-researcher-who-turned-his-ai-vision-into-a-3-7-billion-company/articleshow/127943143.cms,"Source: Bloomberg

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s academic background and early career path



Dario Amodei’s rise at OpenAI and the birth of GPT models



Dario Amodei leaves OpenAI and builds Anthropic



Dario Amodei’s cautious leadership style



Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now. He is not a loud public figure, and he rarely chases attention, but his work has quietly shaped how modern AI systems are built and controlled. Before running a multi-billion-dollar company, Amodei spent years in labs and research roles, studying complex systems and how they behave under pressure. That background still shows in how he talks about artificial intelligence today. While others focus on speed and scale, he appears more concerned with safety, limits, and long-term risks. As AI moves faster than regulation, Amodei’s cautious approach is becoming harder to ignore.Before AI became the world’s favourite buzzword, Amodei was deep in academia. He studied physics at Stanford University and later earned a PhD in biophysics from Princeton. At the time, he was focused on understanding complex biological systems. Cells. Signals. Patterns that emerge rather than being designed. Looking back, that mindset fits AI almost too well.After completing his doctorate, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine.There was no clear path to becoming a tech billionaire. That part came later. Almost accidentally, it seems. Amodei eventually moved into machine learning research, joining companies like Baidu and Google Brain. At Google, he worked on neural networks and AI safety.Colleagues from that period say he already seemed concerned about failure modes. In 2016, he joined OpenAI. Things moved fast after that.At OpenAI, Amodei rose quickly. By 2019, he was Vice President of Research, helping set the organisation’s overall research direction. He led work on GPT-2 and GPT-3, models that changed public perception of AI almost overnight.These systems could write essays, answer questions, and even mimic conversation. Sometimes convincingly. Sometimes awkwardly. During this time, Amodei also co-invented reinforcement learning from human feedback. RLHF sounds technical, but the idea is simple. Teach AI systems by showing them what humans actually prefer, not just what scores well mathematically.In 2021, Amodei left OpenAI along with six others, including his sister Daniela Amodei. They founded Anthropic. Some people were sceptical at first. But Anthropic took a different route. It became a public benefit corporation. That detail mattered. It signalled that profit would not be the only priority. At least in theory. Their AI model, Claude, leaned into being cautious. Less dramatic. More restrained. That tone appealed to companies worried about reputational risk.By September 2025, Anthropic was reportedly valued at $183 billion by private investors. That number raised eyebrows. Especially for a company without much public hype.Partnerships with Alphabet and Amazon helped fuel that growth. So did rising concerns about AI safety across governments and corporations. As Anthropic’s valuation climbed, so did Amodei’s wealth. His real-time net worth now sits around $3.7 billion, ranking among the world’s richest people.Amodei does not sound like most tech CEOs. He hedges. A lot. “It seems.” “It might.” “We’re not fully sure yet.” That language annoys some people. Others trust it more. He avoids grand predictions. No promises of utopia. No claims that AI will solve everything.Experts say his influence shows up in quieter ways. Safety research is becoming mainstream. Alignment discussions moving from fringe to boardroom. Competitors are copying ideas they once ignored. No one really knows what comes next for Dario Amodei. AI is moving fast. Faster than regulation.","Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now.

'OpenAI deal is eating Oracle alive financially'

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

US banks are pulling back—and that's a big problem

A possible Cerner sale and 40% upfront customer deposits show how tight things have gotten

Oracle is staring down the possibility of its largest-ever workforce reduction—and at the heart of it is a $300 billion partnership with OpenAI that's proving far more expensive than anyone initially let on.Investment bank TD Cowen reported this week that Oracle is weighing cuts of 20,000 to 30,000 jobs. The move would free up an estimated $8 to $10 billion in cash flow, money the company desperately needs as it tries to bankroll a sprawling network of AI data centers built largely to serve Sam Altman 's company.TD Cowen puts the OpenAI commitment alone at around $156 billion in capital spending—and roughly 3 million GPUs to back it up. Oracle has already burned through $58 billion in debt in just two months. That's $38 billion for data centers in Texas and Wisconsin, $20 billion for a campus in New Mexico. Total debt now sits north of $100 billion.The kicker? That $58 billion covers only a slice of what's actually needed. Since its September 2025 peak, Oracle's stock has shed more than half its value—about $463 billion in market cap, gone.The financing crunch isn't just an Oracle internal issue anymore.Multiple US banks have quietly retreated from lending on Oracle-linked data center projects. TD Cowen noted that lenders have roughly doubled the interest rate premiums they charge Oracle since September, pushing borrowing costs into territory usually reserved for junk-rated companies.The result? Several data center leases Oracle had been negotiating simply stalled. Private operators couldn't get the funding to build, which means Oracle can't deliver the capacity its customers—especially OpenAI—are counting on. Some Asian banks are still willing to step in, but that doesn't solve the immediate problem in the US, where most of Oracle's expansion is planned.Oracle isn't sitting idle. The company is now requiring new customers to pay up to 40% of contract value upfront—essentially asking clients to co-fund the infrastructure. It's also exploring ""bring your own chip"" arrangements, where customers supply their own hardware.On the table too is a potential sale of Cerner, the healthcare software unit Oracle bought for $28.3 billion in 2022. That would be a significant strategic pivot, signaling that AI infrastructure is now the clear priority—everything else is up for grabs.TD Cowen also flagged that OpenAI has already begun shifting some near-term capacity needs over to Microsoft and Amazon, which is not exactly a vote of confidence in Oracle's ability to deliver on schedule.The company has not publicly commented on the layoff reports or the financing difficulties.","Oracle faces massive job cuts, potentially 20,000-30,000, to fund its costly $300 billion OpenAI partnership.

"Egypt bans Roblox nationwide over child safety concerns, raising global questions about kids' online freedom",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/egypt-bans-roblox-nationwide-over-child-safety-concerns-raising-global-questions-about-kids-online-freedom/articleshow/127935398.cms,"Source: Bloomberg

Roblox faces a government ban in Egypt: Here’s why



What this ban means for kids and parents



Roblox going dark in Egypt, the platform that lives almost entirely on screens, the sudden loss felt very real. With games loading, Avatars running around blocky worlds. And then Egypt has officially banned Roblox, saying the move is about protecting children from harmful online content. The story underneath feels layered, political, and a little messy. Roblox looks harmless on the surface but experts say the risk is not the visuals but the interaction. The platform allows users to create games, chat with strangers, and move freely between user-generated worlds.A spokesperson confirmed the company has reached out to Egyptian authorities, offering dialogue to resolve the issue and restore access. The company says it has worked with regulators in other regions to build localised safety systems that align with cultural values. Last year, the company restricted some features across parts of the Middle East to address safety concerns. This ban did not come out of nowhere. Roblox has already been blocked or restricted in countries like Qatar and Turkey with other nations watching closely.The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.According to state-run media, the ban will be coordinated with the National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority. That means internet providers are expected to block access nationwide with no single official explanation was released at first. Later, state outlets pointed to growing concerns about children’s exposure to inappropriate content, online interactions, and psychological risks as reported by Bloomberg. An Egyptian senator had already called for regulating Roblox to protect children’s moral and educational values.President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi recently called for limits on children’s phone use, pointing to similar moves abroad. Australia has banned social media for certain age groups. France is moving in the same direction. Egypt’s parliament is now discussing broader rules for digital platforms including unified age classifications, stronger verification, penalties and possibly forcing companies to have local representatives inside the country.For children, the ban feels abrupt and confusing. For parents, reactions are mixed. Some welcome the move, while others worry it pushes kids toward less visible, less regulated platforms, potentially exposing them to more risks. That is the irony experts often point out. When one door closes, another usually opens. Sometimes darker, more unpredictable, and harder to monitor.Still, supporters of the ban argue that Roblox’s scale makes it different. Millions of users. Constant interaction. Endless content that cannot realistically be watched, moderated, or controlled by humans alone, leaving significant safety and privacy concerns for young players and families.","The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.

Anime-themed games on Roblox are everywhere right now. Some fade fast. Others stick around because they keep players coming back. Anime Paradox seems to fall into the second category. At first glance, it looks like another tower defence title with familiar anime faces and flashy attacks. But spend a little time with it, and the grind becomes obvious. Progress slows quickly, upgrades demand patience, and free rewards feel essential rather than optional for anyone hoping to stay competitive. Anime Paradox February codes let you redeem gems, stat chips, trait rerolls, and more.For players trying to build a decent team without sinking hours into farming, they matter.Below is the list of all working Anime Paradox codes in February 2026.Anime Paradox is a Roblox tower defence game where players summon and command powerful anime-style units to fend off waves of enemies and bosses as they defend a base.

While OpenAI CEO Sam Altman continues his quest to achieve for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) – a system capable of exceeding human reasoning across all tasks – the creator of OpenClaw, commonly known as Moltbot, has called for a reality check. Peter Steinberger has distanced himself from the AGI, calling for specialised intelligence instead of generalised intelligence.Speaking on the Y Combinator podcast recently, Steinberger argued that the industry's focus on AGI ignores the fundamental way humans and technology actually succeed: through specialisation, according to Business Insider.“What can one human being actually achieve? Do you think one human being could make an iPhone or one human being could go to space? As a group we specialize, as a larger society we specialise even more” Steinberger said. In his view, the most effective AI systems are already specialised, citing startups building models for Erdos math problems or gene mutation identification.Steinberger is not alone in his skepticism. Anthropic president Daniela Amodei called the AI concept 'outdated' while Google DeepMind CEO said AGI cannot be achieved without “world models.”“AGI is such a funny term. Many years ago, it was kind of a useful concept to say, 'When will artificial intelligence be as capable as a human?'I think maybe the construct itself is now wrong-or maybe not wrong, but just outdated,” Amodei argued.“Today's large language models are phenomenal at pattern recognition. But they don't truly understand causality. They don't really know why A leads to B. They just predict the next token based on statistical correlations,” Hassabis explained on “The Tech Download.”Google DeepMind’s AlphaGenome system is designed specifically for predicting DNA mutations, a task far beyond the reach of a “general” chatbot.Timnit Gebru, founder of the Distributed AI Research Institute, recently called AGI a “fictional thing”. Aidan Gomez, CEO of Cohere, has similarly noted a shift toward ""smaller, more efficient models"" that prioritise intelligence and data quality over the expensive scaling required for AGI.","Peter Steinberger, creator of OpenClaw, has distanced himself from the AGI.

But memory, not chips, is the real bottleneck—suppliers say there's no relief until 2028. Thermal management has also become critical, with air cooling insufficient for AI workloads. Meanwhile, Intel's foundry business is gaining traction after Tan drove 7-8% monthly yield improvements.

Memory crunch worse than chip shortage, no relief until 2028

Thermal limits force chips to throttle down, liquid cooling becomes essential

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has an unusual problem. His phone won't stop ringing with executives begging for chips. ""Almost every CEO, they call me, Lip-Bu, can I have more? I'm your friend. I'm your customer, the most important customer,"" Tan said at Intel's Second Annual AI Summit. The desperation in those calls reveals something striking: the AI boom isn't being limited by ideas or algorithms anymore. It's hitting a hard wall of physical hardware that simply doesn't exist yet.Tan took over Intel just eleven months ago after two years on the board. Many friends advised him against it. The company was struggling, and his reputation in venture capital was solid. But he saw an ""iconic company"" that America needed. Now he's dealing with demand that outstrips anything Intel can currently deliver.The real crisis isn't processors, though. It's memory. Tan spoke with two of the three major memory manufacturers. Both told him the same thing: no relief until 2028. AI chips from Nvidia, AMD and others consume massive amounts of high-bandwidth memory. That demand is sucking up supply so fast that even PC makers and phone manufacturers are scrambling.""If anything going to slow down going to be the memory,"" Tan warned. One friend told him Moore's Law used to double every three to four years. Now it's happening every three to four months. The compute requirements are exploding faster than supply chains can possibly respond.Then there's heat. High-performance chips can't even run at full capacity because thermal management can't keep up. ""Sometimes you have to guide the gigahertz down because your thermal issue and power management,"" Tan explained. Air cooling won't cut it anymore. The industry needs liquid cooling, micro cooling, immersion cooling.Meanwhile, Intel's foundry business is gaining traction. Tan improved yields on the 18A process from ""quite poor"" to 7-8% monthly gains. A couple of customers are now ""knocking on my door,"" he said, excited about what Intel can deliver. By the second half of this year, he expects volume commitments that will finally validate Intel's manufacturing comeback.","Executives across industries are desperately calling for more processors as compute demand explodes.

Microsoft Chief Commercial Officer Judson Althoff is teaching the company’s sales team new ways to compete with rival OpenAI products. As artificial intelligence (AI) reshapes the enterprise software industry, Althoff is showing the software giant’s salespeople how to position the company's AI agent tools against OpenAI's competing product.In an email, Althoff provided talking points for staff to use when selling Microsoft's AI agent management tools over OpenAI's new Frontier product. This product, developed by the Microsoft-backed AI startup, helps businesses automate office tasks across multiple software apps, including Microsoft's. A report by The Information cited two of the company’s employees who received Althoff’s message to make this claim.The internal guidance reflects how rapidly AI announcements are affecting the enterprise software sector. In recent weeks, public market investors have sold off software stocks on concerns that AI agents from companies like Anthropic and OpenAI will reduce the value of traditional enterprise software applications and slow their growth.In his latest email to employees (as seen by The Information), Althoff said OpenAI is a competitor that deserves respect.Still, he urged sales teams to stay the course and keep in mind Microsoft's advantages as it competes with the startup, a current employee said.One of these advantages, Althoff said, is that Microsoft is acompany that offers a wide range of AI models and has established relationships with enterprise customers. Meanwhile, OpenAI is an AI developer that has yet to demonstrate it can be a platform company, particularly since it has no infrastructure of its own, Althoff noted in the email. It's important to note that OpenAI relies on cloud providers such as Microsoft to run its technology and business.Althoff emphasised that Microsoft's Azure cloud server business, which also powers OpenAI's technology, already offers access to a wide range of models, making Microsoft a more logical destination for directing multiple AI agents, the report cited people as saying. Microsoft offers OpenAI's models, as well as those from other providers such as Anthropic, Mistral, and xAI.Althoff also said Microsoft has experience working with large enterprises with complex security and compliance needs, which positioned it well to win business, the people said.OpenAI's Frontier release came several weeks after its archrival Anthropic released Cowork. This product also aims to automate workplace tasks by taking over a user's computer to perform work on their desktop like a human would.Microsoft leaders almost immediately discussed how Cowork compared with Microsoft's AI products, such as 365 Copilot, which uses models from Anthropic and OpenAI to automate tasks in its flagship Office 365 and Outlook software, and how Microsoft could compete with Anthropic's product.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has previously said the company's strategy is to developwhich is software that helps customers use AI models to automate tasks across apps and data.He argued that AI models themselves could becomemeaning value would flow to firms like Microsoft that provide customers with valuable tools to connect models to apps and data.Earlier, Microsoft had found itself competing with OpenAI after investing $13 billion in the startup in exchange for the right to use OpenAI's technology in its own products. As both companies sold similar AI products to businesses, Microsoft has repeatedly told salespeople to tell customers that Microsoft could provide more security and compliance guarantees than the younger startup.AI agents developed by firms such as OpenAI and Anthropic remain vulnerable to security issues, limited in capability, and prone to errors. Still, AI leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, increasingly envision a future in which AI agents use traditional enterprise apps to perform tasks currently handled by people. That could put Microsoft’s enterprise app business in a challenging position.Microsoft, a leading seller of enterprise apps, is trying to get ahead of AI upstarts like OpenAI by releasing its own products for workers to create and direct AI agents. Microsoft's Agent 365 aims to help companies track multiple AI agents, including those from OpenAI, and connect them to other applications so they can reorganise files or generate forecasts based on data stored in those applications.Microsoft is also reportedly developing Windows-based AI agents that could perform tasks and use applications on a customer's computer the way a human would.Microsoft is far from alone. Other enterprise software firms, such as ServiceNow, Salesforce, and Amazon, have recently launched products to help customers track and direct agents across a range of AI providers. Traditional enterprise firms are closely monitoring both OpenAI and Anthropic, from which many purchase AI models to power features in their enterprise apps.Using reinforcement learning, OpenAI and Anthropic have been training AI to use enterprise apps as aalongside humans for the better part of a year. Now, they are trying to get such AI in the hands of businesses.OpenAI said a customer could use Frontier, which it announced recently, to create multipleand assign them different tasks that involve pulling in data from various apps: one AI agent could research potential sales leads. At the same time, another could use the agent's findings to check them against existing customer accounts in the company's sales database and send sales pitches to customers not already in the system.OpenAI didn't specify which well-known enterprise apps its AI would use to perform these tasks. But it included a graphic in its blog post about Frontier, showing how OpenAI's technology for directing these agents would sit on top of companies'That term refers to applications built by firms such as Microsoft and Salesforce that store corporate data that customers trust to be accurate.Some executives at traditional enterprise app companies said that they viewed the graphic as OpenAI's way of signalling its considerable influence over how businesses use and pay for software and AI.To be sure, OpenAI isn't arguing that the AI itself will work out of the box. It's hiring AI specialists to work closely with customers to reorganise their IT systems and improve their existing software's integration with AI. Anthropic also has employees who work with companies such as Cox Automotive to develop AI agents that power new products.","Microsoft Chief Commercial Officer Judson Althoff is teaching the company’s sales team new ways to compete with rival OpenAI products.

This comes amid challenges with Windows 11 reliability and underwhelming Copilot adoption, raising questions about the company's AI strategy and product quality.

AI-written code is surging, and so are the bugs

Bell steps down from security, Google veteran Gallot steps in

Copilot adoption remains underwhelming despite the AI push

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has created a brand new role at the company—an engineering quality head—and handed it to Charlie Bell, the executive who previously ran the Redmond giant's security division. The appointment, announced in an internal memo shared on Microsoft's blog on February 4, comes less than a year after Nadella publicly boasted that AI now writes up to 30 percent of the company's code.The timing raises an obvious question that Nadella's memo carefully avoids answering: why does Microsoft suddenly need someone dedicated to engineering quality?Back in April 2025, during a fireside chat with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg , Nadella said that 20 to 30 percent of code in Microsoft's repositories was ""written by software."" Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott went further, predicting that 95 percent of all code would be AI-generated by 2030.But speed and volume don't automatically mean quality. Research from GitClear found that code churn—the rate at which recently written code gets rewritten or deleted—roughly doubled after AI coding tools became widespread. Microsoft's own researchers published findings showing that developers miss around 40 percent more bugs when reviewing AI-generated code compared to human-written code.Meanwhile, Windows 11 has been having a rough run. January 2026 alone saw a security update that left business PCs unable to boot, a separate patch that broke shutdown functionality, and two emergency out-of-band fixes.File Explorer remains sluggish, and a dark mode bug that Microsoft accidentally made worse while trying to fix it still hasn't been resolved. The company has even pulled engineers off new feature development to focus entirely on fixing reliability problems—an effort internally called ""swarming""—expected to last several months.Bell, who joined Microsoft in 2021 after 23 years at Amazon, will now work as an individual contributor focused on engineering quality, reporting directly to Nadella. His replacement as security chief is Hayete Gallot, who spent 15 years at Microsoft before leaving for Google Cloud in 2024. Gallot returns as executive vice president for security.Nadella framed the move as a planned transition. ""Charlie and I have been planning this transition for some time, given his desire to move from being an org leader to being an IC engineer,"" he wrote.The engineering quality push also arrives at a moment when Microsoft's AI bet isn't paying off the way investors hoped. Only 3.3 percent of Microsoft 365 and Office 365 users currently pay for Copilot. The company's stock is down significantly this year, and Azure's growth rate disappointed analysts during last week's earnings call. Microsoft has even started quietly scaling back Copilot integrations in apps like Notepad and Paint.Whether Bell's new role signals a genuine course correction or is simply damage control will depend on what actually ships in the months ahead.",Microsoft appoints Charlie Bell as head of engineering quality.

What Taiwan said about the US proposal to relocate semiconductor capacity

Taiwan Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun said it would be ""impossible"" to relocate 40% of the island’s semiconductor capacity to the United States. With this statement, Li-chiun has pushed back against recent comments from US officials calling for a significant shift in semiconductor production. In an interview with the Taiwanese television channel CTS, Li-chiun said she had made it clear to Washington that Taiwan's semiconductor ecosystem, built over decades, could not be relocated, Reuters reported.she said, referring to the 40% goal the US has floated, the Reuters report noted. Li-chiun added that Taiwan's semiconductor ecosystem will continue to grow domestically, with the industry maintaining domestic investment.she added, according to the Reuters report.This comes after US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last week that the government needed to bring semiconductors to America. He said,Lutnick stated that his goal for the administration is,Last month, Taiwan and the US reached a deal to lower tariffs on the island's exports to 15% from 20% and to increase Taiwan's investment in the country. Li-chiun said there would be no relocation of Taiwan's science parks. Still, Taiwan was willing to share its experience in building an industry cluster and help the U.S. develop a similar environment, Reuters reported.Li-chiun also said she was confident that Taiwan's semiconductor capacity, including existing, under-construction, and planned projects across advanced manufacturing, advanced packaging, and the broader supply chain, would far exceed its investment in the US or any other country.In an interview on CNBC last month, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said his goal was to bring 40% of Taiwan's entire chip supply chain and production to the US. He said that if this does not happen, tariffs on Taiwan would likely rise to 100%.In September, Lutnick told the US television network NewsNation that Washington's pitch to Taiwan would be a 50-50 split in chip production, the vast majority of which are now made on the island. Taiwan rejected that idea at the time.

Built to keep up with your grind

All the things your phone quietly gets done

A phone that looks as good as it performs

Disclaimer: The article has been produced on behalf of Samsung by the Times Internet's Spotlight team.

In a world where your feed is your first impression, every scroll, every story, every share counts. For Gen Z, a phone isn't just a device, it's your creative studio, your personal brand HQ, and your ticket to standing out in an ocean of content. But creating content that cuts through the noise takes a device that keeps up with you. Scroll, shoot, share, repeat. If that sounds familiar, you're not alone. Gen Z lives where content is currency and your feed is your calling card. Standing out shouldn't mean stressing out, it should feel natural, like your phone just gets you.Creating content that stops the scroll is harder than it looks. The lighting's never right, the blur's not blurry enough, and somehow your phone dies right when inspiration hits. Sound familiar? What if your phone could fix all that without you even thinking about it?Let's talk about what really sets the Galaxy F70e 5G apart. That showstopper camera. At its core is a 50MP wide camera that captures every detail, whether you're shooting in bright daylight or moody café lighting. But the real magic happens when you switch to portrait mode. The dedicated 2MP Depth Camera works alongside the main shooter to nail that professional-grade bokeh effect, you know, the one where your subject is razor-sharp and the background melts into a dreamy blur. It's the difference between a photo and a moment. Whether you're capturing your best angle for a selfie (hello, 8MP front camera) or shooting your friends mid-laugh, every frame comes out looking like it deserves its own gallery.Here's where it gets good. Ever notice how influencers' portraits always look cinematic? That's not luck, it's depth. The Galaxy F70e 5G's camera setup is built specifically to give you that main-character energy in every shot. Shooting your OOTD against a busy street? The depth camera isolates you perfectly, turning chaos into aesthetic.Candid café pics? The bokeh makes even basic backgrounds look intentional. You don't need to be a pro photographer or spend hours editing, the phone does the heavy lifting. Just point, shoot, and watch your content go from ‘nice’ to ‘wait, how did you take that?’ It's not about faking it; it's about making your real moments look as good as they feel.Your phone is with you from the moment you wake up to those late-night scrolling sessions. That's why the new Galaxy F70e 5G packs a massive 6000mAh battery that actually lasts. Whether you're streaming shows on your commute, gaming between classes, video calling friends, or yes, shooting that perfect reel, you're covered.

European investors hit back at Elon Musk for calling him fool

One of Europe's biggest investor Henrick Johansson seems upset after Tesla CEO Elon Musk called him a fool. The investor recently shared a satirical post mocking Musk’s ongoing EU regulatory disputes. “Elon Musk is finally in compliance with GDPR , I'll speak to the EU right away about reducing his latest fine,” he wrote following a recent public exchange between the two. It all started with Johansson sharing a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) pointing to Elon Musk’s reported $800 billion net worth to highlight how much wealth is concentrated in the hands of one individual. “Imagine how much good the European Union could do for the world with just half this money,” he wrote in the post.For those unaware, GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation. It is a data privacy law of the European Union that controls how companies and organizations collect, store, use, and share personal data of people in the EU.Musk replied sharply to Johansson’s post calling him a ‘fool’ publicly. “Extreme bureaucratic regulatory oppression and wealth confiscation (moving capital allocation from highly competent entrepreneurs to incompetent government) is why Europe has been economically slowly strangled over the past few decades! Fools like this guy do not understand that they are the cause of Europe’s pain. There no wealth to reallocate when they prevent it from being created in the first place,” the tech billionaire said.Henrick Johansson countered back writing on X:“Elon Musk just called me a ""fool"". Such crass language has no place on social mediaI'll be submitting a report on this to the European Union Commission on Free Speech so they can have it taken down”.In another post, he sarcastically made a job offer to Musk. “Would you like me to get you a job at Comp AI @elonmusk?,” he said, adding “You have much to learn about GDPR and the impact it’s having on Europe’s GDP”.Elon Musk replied back, sarcastically writing “You got me”. The exchange does not seem to be ending soon with Johansson hitting back. “Elon Musk is finally in compliance with GDPR. I'll speak to the EU right away about reducing his latest fine,” he wrote.","European investors hit back at Elon Musk for calling him fool on social media.

Why soft skills are the new hard skills in the age of AI

Top CEOs are echoing the same message

Daniela Amodei, co-founder and president of Anthropic—the company whose recent AI updates triggered a nearly trillion-dollar selloff in enterprise software stocks—says the qualities her company values most in new hires aren't technical. They're human. In an interview with ABC News that aired on Saturday, Amodei said Anthropic looks for ""great communicators"" with ""excellent EQ and people skills, who are kind and compassionate and curious and want to help other people."" Not exactly the job description you'd expect from a company that just spooked Salesforce, Microsoft and Workday investors with its latest AI model.Amodei, who studied literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz, before working as a Capitol Hill staffer and later co-founding Anthropic with her brother Dario, said studying the humanities will be ""more important than ever"" as AI continues to reshape the job market.""A lot of these models are actually very good at STEM,"" she said. ""But I think this idea that there are things that make us uniquely human—understanding ourselves, understanding history, understanding what makes us tick—I think that will always be really, really important.""Her comments come at a moment when Anthropic's influence on markets is hard to ignore. Just days after a minor update triggered a massive tech stock selloff, the company debuted Claude Opus 4.6, an advanced AI model with autonomous agent capabilities.OpenAI piled on with its own coding assistant release, deepening fears about AI displacing traditional business software.Yet Amodei pushed back against the idea that AI will simply replace people. She called the number of jobs AI could do entirely without humans ""vanishingly small,"" adding that she believes ""humans plus AI together actually create more meaningful work.""She's not alone in that view. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has urged young professionals to lean into critical thinking and communication skills. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said emotional intelligence is becoming more important as AI handles analytical tasks. And IBM's former CEO Ginni Rometty told Fortune that generative AI will put a premium on collaboration and judgment.The takeaway? In a world where AI can code, the people who can think, write and connect may have the real edge.","Daniela Amodei, co-founder and president of Anthropic, says the qualities her company values most in new hires aren't technical.

What is OpenClaw that China and South Korea are warning about



Security companies warn about OpenClaw

Software companies across the globe have lost over a trillion in market value in the past week. The carnage has been triggered by Anthropic's AI tool. The rout triggered by Anthropic’s open-source legal plugin for Claude Cowork swept away some of the biggest tech names, including ServiceNow, Salesforce and Microsoft. India's software exporters index, which houses names such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Technologies, HCL Technologies and Wipro, plunged 6% in its worst session in nearly six years on February 2. Incidentally, as the exuberance over AI tools continue, there are also dangers and warning. Especially, about opensource AI Agents.According to a report by news agency Reuters, some of the biggest Korean technology companies, including Kakao, Naver and Karrot Market, are moving to restrict the use of the popular artificial intelligence (AI) agent OpenClaw within their corporate networks due to the rising concerns about security and data privacy. Three of the biggest Korean companies Kakao, Naver and Karrot recently reportedly told their employees, including developers, not to use the open-source agent, OpenClaw.Kakao confirmed the warning to employees. “We have issued a notice stating that, in order to protect the company’s information assets, the use of the open‑source AI agent OpenClaw is restricted on the corporate network and on work devices,” Kakao said, as per the report.Naver too also banned OpenClaw within the company, while Karrot is blocking both the use and access to OpenClaw and Moltbot. These companies have cited risks that are difficult for the company to manage or control.China too has reportedly restricted OpenClaw. The country’s industry ministry said that it had identified cases where users were running OpenClaw with inadequate security settings and called for stronger safeguards. While the warning from Chinese government does not amount to an outright ban, the ministry has advised companies using OpenClaw to rigorously review how it is exposed to public networks and to put in place a strong authentication and access controls mechanism.The industry-wide caution against OpenClaw in China and South Korea is said to reflect rising sentiment around the autonomous AI agents that are capable of performing human-like tasks without direct supervision.Marketed as “the AI that actually does things,” OpenClaw runs directly on users’ operating systems and applications. OpenClaw is a self-hosted, open-source AI agent said to be designed to act as the “hands” of a Large Language Model (LLM). While LLMs such as OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini serve as the brain that understands and reasons, OpenClaw is said to carry out real-world actions. These include browsing the web, editing files, running system commands and interacting with online services through modular add-ons. OpenClaw enables local AI agents to automate workflows, interact with services, and control devices through “skills” modular extensions hosted on ClawHub.OpenClaw launched in November 2025 as an early-stage AI agent, it was previously called Clawdbot and Moltbot. However, over the past few weeks, concerns have grown that it can access sensitive corporate data or personal information, and that such access can create the potential for data leaks, system manipulation and cyberattacks.Security firms SlowMist and Koi Security have uncovered hundreds of compromised extensions deploying infostealers like Atomic Stealer. Cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks has warned that the AI agent OpenClaw presents a “lethal trifecta” of risks stemming from its access to private data, exposure to untrusted content and ability to perform external communications while retaining memory.","Kakao, Naver and Karrot Market are reportedly moving to restrict the use of the popular artificial intelligence (AI) agent OpenClaw within their corporate networks.

How Sarvam AI differs from other AI models like Gemini and ChatGPT



In the bustling tech hubs of Bengaluru, a quiet revolution is revealed. Sarvam AI, an AI startup, has reportedly taken the global AI world by storm, signalling India’s growing ambition to build globally competitive sovereign artificial intelligence technologies and research ecosystems. With its latest models, Sarvam Vision and Bulbul V3, the company claims to have outperformed some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, including Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.As per Pratyush Kumar, the vision of Sarvam AI officially released information on X, announcing a state-space-based 3-billion-parameter vision language model with the best results in digitisation in English and other Indian languages.This new AI model extends work in text and voice to visualising the concepts. Their main focus is on solving document intelligence challenges, from the physical documents, archieves and manuscripts, focusing more on Indian languages.This model was trained on high-quality datasets covering 22 official Indian languages, including varied financial documents, literature, newspapers, historic texts, and more.For now, Sarvam AI seems focused on execution rather than hype. With a mix of local insight, cutting-edge AI, and global benchmarking, it might be quietly reshaping how India approaches technology. And for anyone tracking the AI race, it’s worth paying attention.The Document Intelligence API is free for February 2026, allowing users to explore and build with Sarvam Vision at scale, with getting started today for completely free.With a vision for accuracy, especially in understanding Indian languages on global benchmarks, it holds numerous features, including:This helps in ensuring to understand the images and texts together for enabling the image captioning, chart, or table interpretation more easily.It has high-accuracy OCR and knowledge extraction for 22 Indian languages, including historic texts and scanned documents.It is capable of understanding more than texts. The charts, data, illustrations, and visual analysis of the documents.Understands and interprets visual elements across multiple languages in the same document.Excels in global English benchmarks and introduces the Sarvam Indic OCR Bench for Indian languages.Document Intelligence APIs are production-ready and free to use for experimentation in February 2026.Sarvam Vision, the company’s OCR model, reportedly scored 84.3% accuracy on olmOCR-Bench, surpassing Gemini 3 Pro and DeepSeek OCR v2. On OmniDocBench v1.5, it achieved an even higher 93.28%. The model handles diverse content types, scanned documents, and complex layouts as per the official Sarvam blog. The team focused not just on technology, but on making it practical for India’s multilingual landscape.The company calls itself a “sovereign” AI. The idea is simple: make AI accessible, reliable, and controlled within India. Their website notes an ambition to build foundational AI components tailored to Indian needs. Sarvam AI’s work hasn’t gone unnoticed.The most intriguing feature of this AI model is its focus on Indian languages prioritising English and treating the rest secondary. Since it is trained in 22 Indian languages, which gives high accuracy for regional scripts.While other models are only capable enough to entract text rom documents or images, the Sarvam can interpret visual elements into better understanding and additional knowledge. This ensures better performance on a variety of complex documents in the level of understanding with a large-scale Indic OCR benchmark for Indian languages.","Sarvam AI claims to have outperformed some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, including Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu says exams are not a good way to judge talent; quotes Meta’s former most famous employee Yann LeCun,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zoho-founder-sridhar-vembu-says-exams-are-not-a-good-way-to-judge-talent-quotes-metas-former-most-famous-employee-yann-lecun/articleshow/128107247.cms,"Sridhar Vembu quotes Yann LeCun

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has questioned the value of exams and interviews as reliable measures of exceptional performance, saying they often test narrow skills rather than long-term ability. In a post on X, Vembu said tests mainly measure “test-taking skills” and interviews measure “interviewing skills,” adding that beyond a basic level of competence, these methods do not strongly link to outstanding real-world outcomes. Vembu argued that once basic competence is established, scores and interview performance fail to capture traits needed for exceptional work.“Tests measure test taking skills. Interviews measure interviewing skills. Beyond a basic competence threshold, tests and interviews don't correlate too well with exceptional performance in the real world,” he wrote in the post.In his post, Sridhar Vembu quoted AI pioneer and Meta’s former chief AI scientist – Yann LeCun, who shared an example from mathematics. LeCun said French mathematician Hugo Duminil-Copin, a 2022 Fields Medalist, did not take part in math competitions and was not good at them.According to LeCun, innovative research requires creativity, intuition, and sustained focus over years. “Innovative mathematics requires creativity, intuition, intense concentration, and long reflections, sometimes spread over several years,” LeCun wrote on X.LeCun added that fast problem-solving, often rewarded in competitions like the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), is now something AI can do well. He said a key part of research is not answering questions quickly, but asking the right questions.“Good performance at a math olympiad merely tests fast problem solving abilities. AI can do that nowadays. One of the big activities of a researcher, in mathematics and elsewhere, is not to answer questions but to ask the right questions,” he added.The exchange followed a user’s question on why France has many Fields Medalists but weaker IMO results, while some Eastern European countries excel at IMO yet lack Fields winners. The discussion highlights ongoing debate over how talent should be identified and nurtured.","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu questioned the value of exams and interviews as reliable measures of exceptional performance.

Delhi Literature Festival Hosts Key Cybercrime Awareness Session: Public Urged to Guard Against ‘Digital Arrest’ Scams,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/delhi-literature-festival-hosts-key-cybercrime-awareness-session-public-urged-to-guard-against-digital-arrest-scams/articleshow/128107122.cms,"Moving beyond literature to urgent contemporary concerns, the 14th edition of Delhi Literature Festival hosted a significant awareness session on cybercrime, focusing on the alarming rise of so-called ‘digital arrest’ scams and financial frauds in India’s rapidly evolving digital landscape. The session featured Nishant Kumar, Director of the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C), in conversation with RJ Purkhaa Tak.Kumar explained how fraudsters increasingly impersonate police officers or officials from investigative agencies, falsely claiming that individuals are under investigation or ‘digitally arrested’. Victims are then coerced into transferring money under the pretext of legal verification, case settlement, or account clearance. He categorically clarified that no legitimate police officer or law enforcement authority conducts interrogations or demands financial settlements over phone calls or messages.“If someone claims over a call that you are under digital arrest or asks for money to settle a case, understand clearly that it is fraud. No police agency operates in this manner,” he stated. Shri Nishant Kumar further observed that educated individuals and professionals in senior positions are frequently targeted, as cybercriminals deliberately exploit their reputational concerns and fear of legal consequences.“Fraudsters create a sense of urgency. They say act immediately or face arrest, or that your accounts will be frozen. This fear overrides rational thinking. That is exactly what they rely upon,” he explained. Reflecting on India’s digital transformation, he noted that the Hon’ble Prime Minister’s vision of building a Digital India has been a significant success. However, he cautioned that while digitalisation progressed rapidly, public awareness did not always grow at the same pace, creating vulnerabilities.“Digital India is a matter of pride for us. But with rapid digitalisation, understanding must grow equally fast. Wherever there is a gap in awareness, cybercrime finds space,” he said. To address this challenge, the Government of India established the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C) under the Ministry of Home Affairs in 2019.Kumar further explained that policing is constitutionally a State subject, yet cybercrime does not recognise state or national boundaries. Offenders may operate from one state or even another country while targeting victims elsewhere. Effective response, therefore, requires coordination among states and collaboration across sectors such as banking, fintech, and telecommunications.“I4C was created to build that coordination and shared understanding. Cybercrime cannot be tackled in isolation; it demands collective institutional effort,” he added. The session also highlighted I4C’s official cyber safety awareness initiative, Cyber Dost, which disseminates alerts, advisories, and educational videos on platforms including LinkedIn to educate citizens about phishing, financial fraud, and cyberbullying.Participants were advised to report cybercrimes immediately by dialling the national cybercrime helpline 1930 or by filing a complaint on the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (cybercrime.gov.in). By convening this critical discussion, the Delhi Literature Festival underscored that in an increasingly digital society, awareness and vigilance are indispensable.The session reinforced the message that technological progress must be accompanied by informed citizenship, institutional coordination, and collective responsibility to ensure a secure digital future.","The 14th edition of Delhi Literature Festival hosted a significant awareness session on cybercrime.

Product pullbacks and strategy shift

A make-or-break moment

For the first time, a top Meta executive has spoken candidly about the recent round of layoffs in the division which inspired the company’s name change. As reported by Bloomberg, Meta chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth addressed the issue during a Q&A on his Instagram story, responding to concerns about the future of Quest and gaming. Bosworth admitted that while much of the ‘doom and gloom’ surrounding Meta’s metaverse ambitions was ‘overwrought’ the cuts to Reality Labs, the unit behind Meta’s VR and metaverse projects were painful. “There is a real cause for sadness here,” he said, noting that many employees had been working on projects Meta was once excited to bring to market.For the uninitiated, Facebook-parent Meta poured into its metaverse vision, even renaming the company to reflect its commitment. But Reality Labs has accumulated more than $70 billion in losses since 2020 and Bosworth acknowledged that the ecosystem was growing ‘more slowly than we hand hoped’. “The investment that we put in is bigger than the growth that this ecosystem will allow,” Bosworth explained. “That’s a real loss. We are allowed to feel sad about those things.”The company has already cut several VR products including its virtual workplace and fitness apps, signalling a retreat from its most ambitious bets.Bosworth admitted Meta’s vision for Horizon and VR was ‘too much’, but insisted the company remains committed to the space. “Yes, we’ve receded from the high watermark, but we are still very much a net positive investor in the ecosystem,” he said, adding that Meta continues to invest more in VR content than any competitor.Reality Labs also houses Meta’s AI glasses initiative, which has expanded rapidly. Some observers speculated that the push into wearables might come at the expense of VR. Bosworth rejected that idea, saying the two are not “zero-sum.” “If VR were growing at the rate we all wish it were, we probably wouldn’t have made these changes, and wearables would still be growing a ton,” he explained.Bosworth has previously described 2025 as a make-or-break year for Meta’s metaverse ambitions, writing in a memo that it would determine whether the effort was “the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure.” His latest comments suggest tempered optimism, stressing that Meta must now align its investments with the actual pace of growth.“It doesn’t mean we’re going to invest infinitely, forever,” Bosworth said. “We do need to have our investment match the size of growth.”","Chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth addressed the issue during a Q&A on his Instagram story, responding to concerns about the future of Quest and gaming.

Growing concern over burnout in AI startups

Garry Tan, one of America’s biggest venture capitalists has warned startup founders against celebrating extreme work habits. “This is unhealthy by the way (speaking from experience). Try to get at least 6 hours of sleep per night when deeply addicted to Claude Code,” Tan wrote in an X post, responding to a tech founder who publicly boasted that his chief technology officer had not slept for more than a day while building new AI features. Claude Code is Anthropic's 2025-launched AI tool which is designed to help developers write, understand, and modify software faster. It works like an AI coding partner that can accelerate prototyping by 10x via collaborative AI agents, as shown in recent benchmarks compiling a full C compiler in weeks.The conversation started when Alistair McLeay, co-founder and co-CEO of AI startup Grw AI recently shared a post where he wrote: “Our CTO hasn’t slept in 36 hours because he’s been obsessively and single-handedly building massive new features with Claude Code’s Agent Teams.”“I genuinely think this might be the biggest paradigm shift in how fast you can build since Claude Code first came out last year,” he added.The exchange highlights a wider debate in the AI industry, where new tools are speeding up development but also encouraging round-the-clock work.While founders often share stories of extreme effort to signal progress, investors and operators are increasingly speaking about burnout, health risks, and long-term sustainability.Replying to the post, one user said “the 3am 'just one more prompt' loop is real. worst part is the agent keeps shipping while you're falling asleep at the keyboard. at least with manual coding you'd naturally stop when you got tired”.“I’ve been thinking about what makes these tools so addictive. I think the answer is variable ratio reinforcement reward. You’re always at the 90% mark of building something truly incredible and you have no idea how long it’ll take for the last 10% to wrap up,” said another user.“Been there. The trap is the dopamine loop of “one more run” in the terminal, so you never actually close the day. 6 hours + a hard stop is the difference between shipping tomorrow and debugging ghosts tonight,” replied a third.","Garry Tan, one of America’s biggest venture capitalists has warned startup founders against celebrating extreme work habits. “This is unhealthy by the way (speaking from experience).

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

Read Tesla former AI director Andrej Karpathy’s complete post here

A lot of people quote tweeted this as 1 year anniversary of

vibe coding

. Some retrospective -

I've had a Twitter account for 17 years now (omg) and I still can't predict my tweet engagement basically at all. This was a shower of thoughts throwaway tweet that I just fired off without thinking but somehow it minted a fitting name at the right moment for something that a lot of people were feeling at the same time, so here we are: vibe coding is now mentioned on my Wikipedia as a major memetic ""contribution"" and even its article is longer.

lol

The one thing I'd add is that at the time, LLM capability was low enough that you'd mostly use vibe coding for fun throwaway projects, demos and explorations. It was good fun and it almost worked. Today (1 year later), programming via LLM agents is increasingly becoming a default workflow for professionals, except with more oversight and scrutiny. The goal is to claim the leverage from the use of agents but without any compromise on the quality of the software. Many people have tried to come up with a better name for this to differentiate it from vibe coding, personally my current favorite ""agentic engineering"":

- ""agentic"" because the new default is that you are not writing the code directly 99% of the time, you are orchestrating agents who do and acting as oversight.

- ""engineering"" to emphasize that there is an art & science and expertise to it. It's something you can learn and become better at, with its own depth of a different kind.

In 2026, we're likely to see continued improvements on both the model layer and the new agent layer. I feel excited about the product of the two and another year of progress.

Former Tesla AI director and OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy, who popularised the term vibe-coding has introduced a new phrase for the next stage of AI-driven software development: agentic engineering. While vibe-coding refers to humans prompting AI to write code, agentic engineering describes a process where AI agents themselves generate and refine code autonomously. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Karpathy explained that the tern reflects not only the role of agents in writing code but also the ‘art & science and expertise’ required to guide them effectively.Karpathy who now believes that the next phase of AI-assisted programming deserves its own name: agentic engineering. He feels that unlike vibe-coding, where humans prompt AI directly, agentic engineering includes AI agents autonomously wiring and refining code while humans act as orchestrators and supervisors.Karpathy explained:- “Agentic” because the new default is that you are not writing the code directly 99% of the time, you are orchestrating agents who do and acting as oversight.- “Engineering” to emphasize that there is an art & science and expertise to it.It’s something you can learn and become better at, with its own depth of a different kind.Karpathy predicts that 2026 will bring continued improvements in both the model layer and the agent layer, making agentic engineering a central part of software development.","Former Tesla AI director and OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy has introduced a new phrase for the next stage of AI-driven software development: agentic engineering.

'Not Vassals Of Trump & Elon Musk': Spain's Deputy PM Makes Blistering Exit From 'Place Of Hate' X

What Elon Musk said about SpaceX deprioritizing Mars mission

""For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years.

The mission of SpaceX remains the same: extend consciousness and life as we know it to the stars.

It is only possible to travel to Mars when the planets align every 26 months (six month trip time), whereas we can launch to the Moon every 10 days (2 day trip time). This means we can iterate much faster to complete a Moon city than a Mars city.

That said, SpaceX will also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about 5 to 7 years, but the overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the Moon is faster.""

When Elon Musk proposed name for first city on Mars

Elon Musk-owned space company SpaceX is shifting its near-term focus away from Mars to prioritise building a self-sustaining city on the Moon. The update was shared by the tech billionaire in an X post citing faster timelines and easier launch opportunities. Sharing the post, Elon Musk said that a Moon city could be achieved in less than 10 years, while building a city on Mars would take more than two decades. While the Moon is now the top priority, Musk said SpaceX has not abandoned its Mars plans. “The mission of SpaceX remains the same: extend consciousness and life as we know it to the stars,” Musk wrote on X.When asked by a user to clarify rumours of SpaceX deprioritizing Mars mission, the tech billionaire replied saying “Moon first”.Musk was responding to a post by Teslanomics that read:“Elon, there’s a lot of people saying SpaceX is deprioritizing Mars this Earth-Mars launch window and focusing on the moon instead. I don’t really trust this, unless I hear it from the source. Can you shed some insight on what the plan is? Thanks!”In an X post, Elon Musk wrote:Elon Musk has long talked about his plans to build a city on the red planet. So much so that he once proposed name for the first Martian city. “Elon Musk says the first city on Mars will be named ‘Terminus’,” an April 2025 post said on X.Replying to the post, Musk not only confirmed the name but also provided information on why he chose it, saying that it will ultimately depend on the residents of Mars to name their city.“It’s from Asimov’s Foundation. But I’m open to other ideas,” Musk said. “Ultimately, it will be up to the people of Mars to decide,” he added.","Elon Musk-owned space company SpaceX is shifting its near-term focus away from Mars to prioritise building a self-sustaining city on the Moon.

Trump Aide’s ‘Unhinged’ Criticism ‘Prompts’ China To Shake Up Trade Team; Xi’s Rare Move

US expands export blacklist to target Chinese companies

What is US trade Entity Blacklists

What China said on US expanding export Blacklist

Dutch government seizes control of Chinese chip company Nexperia





China's recent expansion of rare Earth export controls appeared to intensify the US-China trade war, but some analysts point out that the dispute began with an action taken by America in late September. According to a report in the South China Morning Post, the decision by the US Bureau of Industry and Security (US-BIS) to widen its trade Blacklists in September angered China, leading to a slew of retaliatory measures against the US. This included action against US chip giant Qualcomm.On September 29, the US Bureau of Industry and Security broadened its trade blacklists that reportedly prompted not only China’s retaliatory measures but also influencing the Netherlands’ seizure of chip firm Nexperia.The BIS oversees two blacklists -- the entity list and the military end-user list -- targeting companies deemed security threats. Previously, US exporters needed licenses to deal with listed entities. The new rules, effective late September, extend restrictions to any company at least 50% owned by listed entities.On September 29, the US Commerce Department issued a new rule expanding its restricted export list, known as the Entity List, to automatically include subsidiaries owned 50% or more by a company on the list, according to posting in the US Federal Register.The action is said to have greatly increased the number of companies that require licenses to receive American goods and services. The rule is likely to disrupt supply chains. It also makes it more difficult for companies to determine whether exports to a customer or supplier are restricted, and places more of a burden on the exporter to figure out ownership before moving forward.Though companies around the world are on the Entity List, the change will most significantly impact Chinese entities, experts said.America puts companies on the Entity Blacklists that it has determined pose risks to US national security or foreign policy. There are reportedly about 1,100 Chinese entities on the list, according to think tank the Center for a New American Security.China's Commerce Ministry strongly criticized the rule. ""This move by the U.S. is extremely egregious in nature,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""It seriously infringes upon the legitimate rights and interests of the affected enterprises, severely disrupts international economic and trade order and gravely undermines the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.""In SCMP report, Goldman Sachs analysts noted that, while the US rule applies globally, China views it as a targeted escalation.Earlier this month, Dutch government believed chipmaker Nexperia’s Chinese owners planned to move its manufacturing operations to China, prompting the unprecedented seizure of the company. Authorities seized control of Nexperia’s management and ousted its Chinese CEO, Zhang Xuezheng, citing national security concerns.",China's recent expansion of rare Earth export controls appeared to intensify the US-China trade war.

“We're relying a lot on Alibaba's Qwen model. It’s very good. It’s also fast and cheap.”

What Airbnb ’s new AI customer service agent can do



“I think the social features, the community, that’s probably the most differentiated part of Airbnb. People are the reason why I think Airbnb is such a sticky service.”

Why Airbnb is not being integrated into ChatGPT



“quite ready”

“I didn’t think it was quite ready,”

“almost self-contained”





Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky stated that the company typically does not use OpenAI 's latest models extensively in production for its AI tools. He noted that there are often faster, cheaper alternatives available. Recently, the travel app maker announced that it has updated its in-app artificial intelligence customer service agent, which was rolled out to all US users in English in May. The update allows customers to take more actions without needing a live representative. In an interview, Chesky revealed that the agent is built on 13 different AI models, sourced from providers including OpenAI, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s Qwen model, Alphabet Inc.’s Google , and other open-source providers.Chesky said to Bloomberg:He specifically praised the Alibaba model, saying,Airbnb's new AI-powered customer service agent now includes action buttons and links that allow users to handle tasks such as changing or cancelling reservations on their own.This update has resulted in a 15% decrease in users requiring help from a live representative and reduced the average resolution time from nearly three hours to six seconds. The company also plans to introduce Spanish and French language support later this year, followed by 56 additional languages next year.Apart from the AI agent, Airbnb has also introduced new social features aimed at helping users connect and enhancing travel recommendations within the app. Guests can now share their Airbnb profiles with others after booking an experience, and travellers who joined the same tour can message each other. However, conversations continue only if the recipient accepts the message request.More features are planned for next year, and Chesky said these could eventually support user-generated content on the platform.Chesky also noted that he has decided not to integrate the company’s app with OpenAI’s ChatGPT because the platform’s tools aren’tyet. He added that Airbnb will continue to monitor the development of ChatGPT’s app integrations and could consider collaborating in the future, similar to other travel platforms such as Booking Holdings and Expedia Group.Chesky said, explaining that because Airbnb is a community of verified users, OpenAI would need to build a platform strong enough for Airbnb’s app to function in anway within ChatGPT, the report noted.Chesky, who is friends with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman , said he has even advised the company on its new third-party developer features. Meanwhile, OpenAI has declined to comment but pointed to a recent blog post describing the app integration system as a developer preview with more updates expected, the report added.","Airbnb has updated its in-app artificial intelligence customer service agent.

What US officials said about Joseph Sanberg’s wire fraud



“letters of intent”

“Figure out how to get me the money tomorrow or I'll be in default. It's your turn to do what needs to be done. . . . But if you don't get me the money tomorrow, we are all f***ed. This will give you a good taste of what I have to experience every day. I hate you and I hate this company and I don't want to work anymore with you [ ]. You are so oblivious to what you've forced me to have to do.""





Joseph Sanberg, the 46-year-old co-founder of the online banking company Aspiration Partners, has pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud in Los Angeles federal court. Prosecutors alleged that Sanberg participated in a scheme that defrauded investors of $248 million. Aspiration Partners, which offered environmentally focused financial services, including carbon credit sales and tree-planting services, had drawn backing from numerous celebrity investors. These high-profile backers included former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, actors Leonardo DiCaprio , Robert Downey Jr., and Orlando Bloom . Sanberg, who was also an early investor in Blue Apron, faces up to 40 years in prison at his sentencing, scheduled for February 23, 2026.Founded in 2013, Aspiration Partners had previously planned to go public through a SPAC deal in 2021, which was expected to value the firm at $2.3 billion, but the deal was called off in 2022.According to a report by Business Insider, US federal prosecutors said that Sanberg took actions to make Aspiration Partners appear more financially stable than it was, including using a letter from the company’s audit committee that falsely claimed Aspiration had $250 million in cash and cash equivalents, when it actually had less than $1 million available.The authorities also said that Sanberg used these misleading financial documents to secure millions of dollars in loans and investments, the report added.Sanberg is also facing a lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which alleges that he recruited friends, colleagues, and others to help him exaggerate the company’s financial outlook.The SEC’s civil complaint states that he did this by getting people to signwith contracts that indicated they would regularly pay Aspiration between $25,000 and $750,000 for tree-planting and other environmental services.The SEC said Sanberg assured these individuals that they would not have to pay for the services. The agency added that Aspiration’s financial troubles appeared to be affecting Sanberg as early as 2020, when he texted his cofounder and the company’s CEO expressing concern about a possible default.In his message to his cofounder and Aspiration's CEO (seen by BI), Sandberg wrote:","Joseph Sanberg, the 46-year-old co-founder of the online banking company Aspiration Partners, has pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud.

Deepseek's new tool can extract text from photos of pages: What it means for users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/deepseeks-new-tool-can-extract-text-from-photos-of-pages-what-it-means-for-users/articleshow/124725207.cms,"How developers can use this tool







Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has released a tool called DeepSeek OCR. This new open-source tool is designed to extract text from image files of pages with high efficiency. The project converts complex papers into a format that AI models can process quickly, with minimal memory or power consumption. The tool is designed to meet the high demand for large language models (LLMs) that must process both visual and textual data. DeepSeek OCR can process more than 200,000 pages of data per day on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. Scaling this to a small cluster could allow training sets for larger AI models to accumulate overnight. Developers can download DeepSeek OCR from GitHub or Hugging Face and integrate it into their own applications.DeepSeek-OCR starts with an image of a document, such as a scanned report or a newspaper page. Its first stage, called DeepEncoder, has about 380 million parameters and uses Meta’s Segment Anything Model (SAM) to divide the image into sections like text blocks or charts.SAM processes smaller parts of the image efficiently, even for large 1,024×1,024 pixel files. The visual data is then reduced from 4,096 patches to 256 tokens using a compact two-layer setup. These tokens go into a modified version of OpenAI ’s CLIP model, which links image and text understanding while keeping processing needs low.Next, a decoder powered by DeepSeek’s 3-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts model (DeepSeek-3B-MoE) takes over. Only about 570 million parameters are used at once, allowing the system to perform strongly while remaining efficient. When given the compressed tokens and a prompt, it generates text in clean formats like Markdown.DeepSeek-OCR adjusts its process based on the document type. For simple files like slides, it uses fewer tokens (around 64). For complex layouts like books or reports, it uses about 100 tokens for a balance of speed and accuracy. In dense cases, such as newspapers, it switches to “Gundam mode,” using up to 800 tokens and techniques like tiling to handle detailed layouts.On the OmniDocBench test, which measures document parsing performance, DeepSeek-OCR performed well using fewer tokens compared to other systems. It required only 100 tokens where competitors used hundreds or thousands, and it produced fewer text errors, particularly in English and Chinese documents.","DeepSeek OCR can process more than 200,000 pages of data per day on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.

Google expands AI infrastructure and data centres

Strengthening Belgium’s digital future

AI’s potential for economic growth





US tech giant Google has announced plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network, creating hundreds of new jobs and supporting local economic growth. The investment will focus on the company’s existing Saint-Ghislain site and the new Farciennes campus, with construction already underway. Google said the expansion will strengthen Belgium’s role in Europe’s cloud and AI sector, provide large-scale computing capacity powered by carbon-free energy, and create opportunities for local suppliers and contractors. Officials highlighted the move as a vote of confidence in Belgium’s tech ecosystem and workforce.The investment will modernise and expand Google’s network of data centres in Saint-Ghislain and Farciennes, enabling the company to handle large volumes of digital data and support advanced AI systems. These facilities are designed to operate entirely on clean energy, aligning with Google’s global goal to achieve carbon-free operations by 2030. The expansion will also support the development of new onshore wind farms in Belgium to power the centres sustainably.The project is expected to create around 300 new full-time jobs directly, while indirectly supporting approximately 15,000 additional roles through local contractors and partners. Google already works with about 150 Belgian suppliers, including 80 in Wallonia, and the expansion will further boost construction, technology, and service sector employment. Prime Minister Bart De Wever emphasized that the investment underscores Belgium’s growing importance as a digital and green technology hub.Belgium has become a key location for technology growth thanks to its reliable internet networks, stable power supply, and skilled workforce. Google Cloud already serves Belgian companies and organizations such as Odoo and UZ Leuven, helping them scale AI-based tools for healthcare, research, and business. The new investment will enhance Belgium’s competitiveness in the European cloud and AI market, attracting further international investment and innovation.A 2024 study commissioned by Google estimated that artificial intelligence could increase Belgium’s GDP by €45 to €50 billion over the next decade. Most jobs are expected to be supported or improved by AI, with only a small portion at risk of automation. By expanding AI infrastructure, Google aims to equip Belgian companies and the workforce with advanced digital tools while fostering sustainable and inclusive growth. The investment positions Belgium as a hub for next-generation AI innovation in Europe. It also signals Google’s commitment to combining technological advancement with environmental responsibility, shaping the future of digital and green growth.","Google plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network.

What Tesla said to its shareholders about Elon Musk’s pay package



“ISS once again completely misses fundamental points of investing and governance.

They recommended against compensation that shareholders have voted on twice before (and that Elon has already earned), as well as the 2025 CEO

Performance Award

(where Elon receives nothing unless shareholders win big).

ISS’s unfounded and nonsensical recommendation against Ira proves how disconnected from reality they are. As Tesla’s longest-tenured independent director, Ira has created a governance framework that has allowed Tesla to achieve an astonishing TSR increase of ~39,000% during his tenure.

He embodies our high-engagement Board – with hands-on leadership + effective governance with a focus on long-term value.

It’s easy for ISS to tell others how to vote when they have nothing on the line.

Vote with Tesla on ALL proposals.”

What ISS said about Elon Musk’s pay package



“The award is largely intended to retain Musk and keep his time and attention on Tesla rather than his other business ventures, but there are no explicit requirements to guarantee this outcome,”

“unmitigated concerns”

“highly unusual.”





Tesla has criticised proxy advisor firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS). This comes after ISS recommended shareholders vote ""no"" on CEO Elon Musk 's $1 trillion compensation plan. Claiming that the pay package is designed to keep Musk leading the company through a series of demanding incentives, Tesla responded to the negative recommendation in a post on the social media site X (formerly Twitter), writing:The recommendation creates a fresh hurdle for Tesla's board just weeks before the annual shareholder meeting on November 6. This is the second consecutive year ISS has advised against Musk’s pay plan, citing concerns over theof the proposal. ISS also argued that the package offered no guarantee that Musk would focus on Tesla over his other ventures, including SpaceX , Neuralink, and xAI.The new compensation plan, introduced in September, is designed to keep Elon Musk focused on Tesla for the next ten years. It ties his full payout and increased voting power to the company reaching a market value of $8.5 trillion and expanding its EV, robotics, and robotaxi businesses, which could raise his ownership stake to about 25%.In its X post, Tesla wrote:the ISS wrote in a report, citingabout the plan’s magnitude and design.ISS also recommended against providing Musk with any backpay tied to the voided 2018 plan and advised shareholders to reject a proposal for Tesla to invest in Musk’s AI company, xAI, describing it as","Tesla has criticised proxy advisor firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) This comes after ISS recommended shareholders vote ""no"" on CEO Elon Musk's $1 trillion compensation plan.

Nexperia’s Dutch HQ and Chinese unit compete over control







Employees at the Chinese operations of Netherlands-based Nexperia have reportedly been instructed to reject orders from Dutch headquarters, deepening a corporate standoff amid geopolitical tensions over semiconductor supply chains. Citing an internal memo made public, Financial Times reported that Nexperia's China unit has directed local staff to operate independently and reject instructions from the company’s Dutch headquarters.The memo from Nexperia China told employees to follow only the domestic management team's directives, stating the Chinese operations would “operate and make decisions independently as a Chinese enterprise.”“For any other external instructions . . . even if delivered via Outlook or Teams . . . everyone has the right to refuse execution,” the notice stated, advising employees to contact human resources if they received communications from “external parties” or experienced “outside pressure.”The directive signals a potential separation of the Chinese-owned, Netherlands-based semiconductor manufacturer following the Dutch government's seizure of management control earlier this month.The Chinese unit said it issued the memo to clarify what it called a “confusing” email sent from Dutch headquarters the previous day. Management assured staff that operations were ""completely normal"" and wages would continue to be paid.Nexperia's Netherlands headquarters swiftly condemned the memo, accusing it of “falsely claiming that Nexperia and the Dutch government have abandoned the Chinese market and that the factory is now operating independently under a new entity.”“We regret that certain individuals . . . see the need to spread these falsehoods, and remain hopeful to come to a solution that allows Nexperia to continue serving its customers and partners, and one that brings stability for its employees,” the Dutch-based company said.One Nexperia employee in China, speaking anonymously, described the situation bluntly: “We are in great internal disorder right now and the situation is very unclear.”A report also claimed that the corporate turmoil stemmed from mounting pressure between Washington, The Hague, and Beijing over semiconductor technology and supply chains.","Nexperia's China unit has directed local staff to operate independently and reject instructions from the company’s Dutch headquarters.

LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman has warned that Silicon Valley’s obsession with software may be creating a blind spot, leaving companies at risk of missing the next major AI opportunities. Speaking on the a16z podcast recently, Hoffman said the tech industry’s mindset that “everything should be done in software” has driven decades of success but now limits innovators from spotting new possibilities. The belief, he said, now risks keeping innovators from seeing new opportunities.Hoffman questioned during the podcast “What are the areas where the AI revolution will be magical?”“That's probably where I've been putting the majority of my co-founding time, invention time,” he said.Hoffman highlighted biology and healthcare as areas ripe for AI-driven transformation, saying AI tools could guide scientists toward promising experiments even if predictions are correct only a small fraction of the time. He clarified that he isn't betting on AI being able to design drugs independently. Instead, AI tools could guide scientists toward the most promising experiments, he said.“This is not a needle in a haystack; it’s like a needle in a solar system,” he said, explaining how AI could accelerate research in ways humans alone cannot.He added that the next iconic AI companies may come from sectors most investors consider slow, complex, or heavily regulated, rather than the traditional software space.""I've been thinking about the intersection of the worlds of atoms and the worlds of bits,"" Hoffman continued, adding ""What are things that elevate human life?""Hoffman’s warning reflects a growing trend in AI for healthcare, where companies like Microsoft and Nvidia are already deploying AI for hospital operations, medical imaging, and drug discovery.

The most expensive pay package ever





Elon Musk’s role and Tesla’s future









Tesla CEO Elon Musk has fired back at critics over the mounting scrutiny over his proposed trillion-dollar pay package. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk questioned who else could lead the EV company if not him. In a pointed response posted on X, Musk defended his leadership and threw open the question: “Which car company CEO should run Tesla? It won’t be me.”The comment from Musk came in as a reply to a post by Tesla enthusiast Romain Hedouin. The X user criticised Musk’s potential $20 billion payout for achieving a $2 trillion market cap milestone. Hedouin argued that the growth target—3.8% annually over the next decade—would “barely beat inflation” and underperform the S&P 500, calling the compensation “over-pay for its CEO.”Musk responded by highlighting Tesla’s dominance: “Tesla is worth more than all other automotive companies combined,” he wrote, implying that no other auto executive could match the scale or ambition required to lead the company.Elon Musk’s 2018 pay deal was made around the ambitious performance milestones tied to Tesla’s market value and operational growth. However, Elon Musk has not met those targets and a Delaware judge ruled that the process also lacked sufficient independence and transparency, calling the board’s approval ‘deeply flawed’.As reported by Reuters, Tesla is now appealing the decision arguing that shareholders had full knowledge and voted overwhelmingly in favour.“This was the most informed stockholder vote in Delaware history,” said Tesla attorney Jeffrey Wall during oral arguments. “Reaffirming that would resolve this case.”The stakes are equally high for Tesla. Elon Musk’s leadership is deeply intertwined with the company’s brand, innovation, and investor confidence. A failure to restore the pay package could raise questions about Musk’s long-term commitment and Tesla’s ability to retain visionary talent.Tesla CEO Elon Musk is said to earn tens of billions of dollars from a record-breaking compensation package even if he fails to meet most of the ambitious goals set by the bard of the company. As reported by Reuters, Musk could surpass the lifetime earbibggs of CEOs such as Mark Zuckerberg , Larry Ellison, Tim Cook and Jensen Huang by just achieve some relatively modest milestones. In September this year, the Tesla board proposed a 10-year compensation package which could award Musk up to $878 billion in stocks on the condition of hitting a series of ‘Mars-shot’ gaols.The goals include breakthroughs in robotics, autonomous driving, and massive profit and valuation targets. However, as reported by Reuters, Elon Musk could still earn more than $50 billion by meeting just a handful of easier goals without actually transforming Tesla’s products or business.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has fired back at critics over the mounting scrutiny over his proposed trillion-dollar pay package.

What the company has to say







Federal safety regulators have launched a probe into Waymo's self-driving vehicles after viral footage showed a robotaxi illegally passing a stopped school bus with students getting off. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Monday (October 20) that it has opened an investigation covering approximately 2,000 Waymo autonomous vehicles following reports that the robotaxis by Google ’s-sister company may have violated traffic safety laws designed to protect schoolchildren.The incident again raises questions about whether self-driving systems can reliably recognise and respond to safety protocols as the investigation marks the latest regulatory scrutiny of self-driving technology, coming on the heels of high-profile deployments by companies like Tesla, which recently unveiled its robotaxi concept under CEO Elon Musk.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the probe was triggered by recent media coverage featuring video from Georgia showing a Waymo vehicle approaching a school bus with its red lights flashing and stop arm extended—clear signals requiring all traffic to halt.According to the report, the autonomous vehicle initially stopped but then manoeuvred around the bus, passing the deployed stop arm while children were actively exiting the vehicle.NHTSA emphasised that Waymo's massive operational scale increases the likelihood of similar incidents. The agency noted that Waymo's automated driving system surpassed 100 million total miles in July and currently logs approximately 2 million miles weekly across its fleet.“Based on NHTSA's engagement with Waymo on this incident and the accumulation of operational miles, the likelihood of other prior similar incidents is high,” the agency stated in its announcement.The investigation covers vehicles equipped with Waymo's fifth-generation Automated Driving System operating without human safety drivers—the configuration involved in the Georgia incident.In response to the investigation, a Waymo spokesperson said the company has ""already developed and implemented improvements related to stopping for school buses"" and plans to deploy additional software updates in its next release.The company defended its vehicle’s behaviour, explaining that the robotaxi “approached the school bus from an angle where the flashing lights and stop sign were not visible and drove slowly around the front of the bus before driving past it, keeping a safe distance from children.”Waymo emphasised that “driving safely around children has always been one of Waymo's highest priorities.”","Federal safety regulators have launched a probe into Waymo's self-driving vehicles after viral footage showed a robotaxi illegally passing a stopped school bus. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Monday that it has opened an investigation covering approximately 2,000 Waymo autonomous vehicles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124723366,imgsize-68776,width-400,resizemode-4/waymo.jpg"

The future of AI coding





Anthropic has officially brought its AI coding assistant, Claude Code, to the web, making it easier than ever for developers to build and manage autonomous coding agents. Previously available only via command-line interface (CLI), Claude Code is now accessible through a new “Code” tab on claude.ai for users on the Pro and Max subscription tiers. The launch marks a major step in Anthropic’s push to democratize access to agentic AI tools. “We’re continuing to put Claude Code everywhere, helping it meet developers wherever they are,” said Cat Wu, Product Manager at Anthropic.Claude Code goes beyond autocomplete tools like GitHub Copilot by enabling developers to spin up autonomous agents that can tackle complex coding tasks. These agents can write, debug, and optimize code with minimal human input, making them ideal for rapid prototyping and large-scale development.Key features include:Wu revealed that Claude Code has grown 10x in users since May and now contributes over $500 million in annualized revenue. She also noted that 90% of Claude Code’s own product is written by Anthropic’s AI models.Anthropic joins a competitive field of AI coding tools, including offerings from Google, OpenAI, and GitHub. While early tools focused on line-by-line suggestions, Claude Code represents a shift toward agentic generation, where developers manage AI assistants that operate more independently.Despite concerns that AI coding tools may slow developers in complex environments, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei remains bullish. He predicts that AI will soon write 90% of code for software engineers—a reality already unfolding inside Anthropic itself.","Anthropic has officially brought its AI coding assistant, Claude Code, to the web.

Dear @Netflix_CA and other service providers & vendors,

You already know everything about me from all my personal information that you keep collecting. Let me repeat some of it. I'm a middle aged white guy from Alberta, who like war movies, science fiction, and real crime documentaries.

Stop sending me shit like this. I don't give a fuck about a festival celebrated by 3rd world immigrants invading my country.

How social media reacted





Marty Belanger, a Canadian engineer recently expressed frustration after receiving a ‘Happy Diwali’ email from Netflix. Calling the message unnecessary and intrusive, Belanger shared an open post on X where he urged the streaming platform to “stop sending shit like this”. The email, part of Netflix’s promotional campaigns, was intended to engage subscribers during the Diwali festival. However, Marty Belanger said he found the message unwanted, sparking a wave of online trolls because of his strong criticism of the Diwali, calling it “a festival celebrated by 3rd world immigrants”Commenting on the post, one user wrote “If a simple Diwali poster pisses you off, maybe focus on real issues...like road-blocking and violent masked Jihadi protests. Those are a hell of a lot more dangerous to Canadian values than any Diwali ad. Stop sweating the small stuff and care about what actually matters.”“Wow, a prof. Engineer with the emotional maturity of a toaster. Great! FYI, we 3rd world immigrants not only brought festivals, but also engineers who can spell 'diversity' without having a meltdown. I can see in your bio 'Live, let live' ? is that only for people like you,” commented another user.“Bro, you get hundreds of promo emails daily — do you reply to all of them like this? Looks like you really need Diwali, ‘cause there’s a serious need for some light over that darkness.

Elon Musk’s legendary work ethic



Not just Elon: Jensen Huang’s “Hardcore” routine







Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s mother Maye Musk recently took to social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to offer a rare glimpse into the relentless work ethic of her son. After attending his Saturday meetings, she admitted, “I only lasted until 11 PM,” while Elon continued hosting back-to-back sessions with passionate teams well into the night. “The meetings were fascinating and mesmerizing,” Maye Musk wrote on X, highlighting the intensity and diversity of the hourly gatherings.Maye Musk shared the post in response to a video clip from Dreamforce 2025, where David Sacks, the Trump administration’s Crypto and AI Czar, told Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, “I visited Elon recently and left around midnight—he was still going. I think he must have gone until 2 a.m. or something. I don’t know anybody who works as hard as him.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk is known for his dedicated to work. In a 2014 commencement speech, Musk advised the students to ‘work super hard’. He also said that by putting in 100 hours a week allows him to achieve twice as much as someone working 50. His schedule often blurs the line between personal and professional life. In a BBC interview, Musk described being “swarmed by men” at parties wanting to pitch ideas, making it difficult to relax or trust people.Musk’s intense work style is echoed by other tech leaders. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has described his own routine as “hardcore,” underscoring a broader culture of extreme dedication among Silicon Valley’s elite. Maye Musk’s reflections add a personal touch to the narrative, showing that even family members struggle to keep pace with Elon’s tireless drive.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s mother Maye Musk recently took to social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to offer a rare glimpse into the relentless work ethic of her son.

Why Elon Musk wants to launch Grokipedia v0.1



Elon Musk’s Wikipedia offer







Tesla CEO Elon Musk has postponed the initial release of Grokipedia, the new AI-powered knowledge platform from his venture xAI, stating the delay is necessary to address bias and political narratives. Musk has promoted Grokipedia as an AI-powered knowledge platform with “massive improvement” over Wikipedia – a platform that Musk has targeted for its bias.Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Musk announced: “Tesla CEO Elon Musk Postponing Grokipedia v0.1 launch to end of week. We need to do more work to purge out the propaganda.”Previously, Musk said that the ""Version 0.1 early beta of Grokipedia will be published in 2 weeks."" The announcement was made in response to an X user who touted Grokipedia as being set to become ""the world's biggest, most accurate knowledge source, for humans and AI with no limits on use.""According to posts detailing the project, the core goal of Grokipedia is to establish a knowledge base focused solely on truth and free from bias or hidden agendas. The platform aims to provide accurate, transparent context instead of narratives shaped by institutional influence or legacy media.The process involves Grok, xAI’s chatbot, utilising large amounts of information, including content from Wikipedia.The AI system will analyse this content by asking a core set of questions: ""What’s true, partially true, false, or missing?"". Grok will then rewrite the content by removing falsehoods, correcting half-truths, and adding missing context.Musk has repeatedly offered Wikipedia $1 billion if it changes its name to ""Dickipedia"" for at least a year. The offer was first made in October 2023 and has been reiterated since, most recently in February 2025, in response to users on X who asked if the offer still stood.Musk has claimed that his offer is “in the interests of accuracy” and has questioned the need for the Wikimedia Foundation's large fundraising campaigns.","Elon Musk has postponed the release of Grokipedia, his new AI-powered knowledge platform.

Why Amazon Web Service’s problem became entire internet’s Crisis

From McDonald’s to banks: The widespread impact of AWS outage

What experts say about preventing future cloud disasters





Amazon Web Services experienced a massive 15-hour outage on October 20 that knocked offline thousands of popular applications and websites, from Snapchat and Fortnite to banking apps and government services, before the company announced full restoration of its cloud services.The disruption began around 12:30 p.m. IST and affected more than 1,000 companies globally, with outage-tracking site Downdetector recording over 6.5 million user reports. Services including Venmo, Duolingo, Roblox, WhatsApp, and even Amazon ’s own Alexa assistant were left unusable for hours before AWS declared all operations back to normal at approximately 3:30 a.m. IST on October 21.The outage originated in AWS’s US-EAST-1 data center region in northern Virginia, the world’s largest cloud provider’s most crucial hub. The root cause was a Domain Name System (DNS) resolution issue affecting DynamoDB, a core database service that stores critical information for AWS clients.DNS functions as the internet’s phone book, translating website names into numeric IP addresses that computers can understand. When this system failed, applications couldn’t locate the servers they needed, causing cascading failures across the internet.The outage disrupted everyday services across multiple sectors. Financial platforms including Coinbase, Robinhood, and major UK banks like Lloyds and Halifax reported problems. Airlines such as United and Delta experienced delays, while streaming services, workplace tools like Zoom and Slack, and even the UK’s tax authority website became inaccessible.Gaming platforms suffered particularly long disruptions, with Roblox and Fortnite down for over six hours. Duolingo promised to protect users’ learning streaks, while language-app devotees worried about losing their progress.Technology experts are pointing fingers at both Amazon and the companies that depend on its infrastructure. Computer science professor Ken Birman of Cornell University told the BBC that “companies using Amazon haven’t been taking enough adequate care to build protection systems into their applications.”IT security officer Marek Szustak noted that DNS issues are a common trigger for major outages. “As engineers say, it’s always DNS,” he explained, adding that this “seemingly minor piece of infrastructure” can paralyze even the largest cloud environments.The incident may also trigger legal battles over financial losses. Delta Airlines is still seeking over $500 million from CrowdStrike more than a year after that company’s outage caused widespread flight disruptions, demonstrating how accountability questions can linger long after systems are restored.","Amazon Web Services experienced a massive 15-hour outage on October 20.

Cash support for employees living in proximity to office







To attract top talent in San Francisco's competitive housing market, AI startups are now reportedly leasing luxury apartments for employees, a strategy analysts say they have never seen before. According to a report, AI startups are going beyond higher salaries to attract talent, leasing luxury apartments in one of America's most expensive housing markets. These apartments can be rented starting from $3,000 per month.Will Goodman, a principal at Strada Investment Group, which developed the luxury complex where AI startup Cluely leased its eight apartments, told The New York Times that half of the 501 units were leased within two months of the building's May opening.“Honestly, I've never seen anything like it before,” Goodman was quoted as saying.Roy Lee, CEO of Cluely, which makes software for job interviews and work calls, leased eight apartments for employees in a recently built luxury complex located just a one-minute walk from the office. Interestingly, rents in the 16-story building range from $3,000 to $12,000 monthly.“Going to the office should feel like you're walking to your living room, so we really, really want people close,” Lee said.Flo Crivello, CEO of another AI startup called Lindy, is going a step further. The company offers its approximately 40 employees a $1,000 monthly rent stipend if they live within a 10-minute walk of the company's office.“People are so much happier and healthier when they live close to work. This makes them stick around for longer, perform better and work longer hours,” Crivello told The Times.The report says that the AI boom has drawn substantial money and talent to San Francisco, inflating rents in the process. The Bay Area has attracted 70% of AI venture capital funding nationwide since 2019, according to Pitchbook data.Meanwhile, remote work arrangements have declined as more employers adopt hybrid models requiring tech talent to spend three or more days in the office. In San Francisco, one out of every four square feet of office space was leased by an AI company over the past two and a half years, according to CBRE."," AI startups are reportedly leasing luxury apartments for employees in San Francisco's competitive housing market.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has announced a $1.5 trillion investment plan which is aimed at revitalizing America’s industrial backbone and reducing dependence on foreign supply chains. As reported by Business Insider, the decade-long initiative called the Security and Resiliency Initiative will majorly target important sectors such as defense, frontier technologies, energy and advanced manufacturing. “It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products, and manufacturing—all of which are essential for our national security,” Dimon said.As reported by Business Insider, Dimon revealed that the bank will commit $10 billion of its own capital to jumpstart the efforts with the reminder facilitated via financing, strategic investments and praetorships.As per the Business Insider report, Dimon also outlined four key sectors which will get focused investment. The industries include:1. Defense and aerospace2. Frontier technologies3. Energy technology4. Supply chain and advanced manufacturingJamie Dimon also stressed on the fact that this initiative is not only about economic growth but it is about safeguarding the future of America.Hopefully, once again, as America has in the past, we will all come together to address these immense challenges,” he said. “We need to act now.”The announcement from Dimon comes at a time when concerns over global instability, supply chain vulnerabilities, and the race for technological dominance are growing. JPMorgan’s move signals a bold private-sector push to reinforce U.S. resilience in the face of mounting geopolitical and economic pressures.","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has announced a $1.5 trillion investment plan which is aimed at revitalizing America’s industrial backbone.

What caused the service outage

Recovery and response





Amazon Web Services (AWS) recently witnessed a major outage. The service outage sent shockwaves across the internet on Monday (October 20). The outage disrupted operations at some of the world’s biggest companies including McDonald’s, Microsoft Office 365, Apple Music, Alexa and dozens of others. The outrage started early morning in the AWS’s US-East-1 region. The outage was traced to DNS issues affecting DynamoDB, Amazon’s core database service. The disruption in AWS servicesled to widespread connectivity failures and increased error rates across more than 70 AWS services.According to Downdetector and company statements, the outage impacted:The service outage also affected Amazon’s internal systems with warehouse workers reporting downtime in delivery apps and Seller Central going offline.As reported by CNBC, the company revealed that the AWS outage was caused due to some ‘operational issue’ withDNS routing in DynamoDB. The company further added that while the database remained intact, the outage does revealed the fragility of cloud infrastructure that powers much of the modern internet. “When a major cloud provider sneezes, the internet catches a cold,” said Mike Chapple, IT professor at Notre Dame.Amazon said it began seeing signs of recovery by early afternoon and was applying fixes across affected regions. By 4 p.m. ET, services were gradually coming back online, though some users continued to report issues.","Amazon Web Services (AWS) recently witnessed a major outage.

Details of the case

Eric Schmidt locked her out of startup website, claims ex-girlfriend



Ex-Google CEO’s 82-page response





Michelle Ritter, ex-girlfriend of former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has accused him of stalking, abuse and “toxic masculinity”. According to a New York Post report, Ritter has claimed that the former Google CEO subjected her to an “absolute digital surveillance system”. As per the report, the two are fighting legally over money, a failed AI startup, and ownership of a luxury Bel Air mansion.The publication claims to have obtained court documents which state that the two have struck a “written settlement agreement” in September last year requiring Schmidt to make “substantial payments” to Ritter. However, details of the settlement remain under seal.Later in December 2024, Ritter filed an “domestic violence restraining order” against Schmidt which was later withdrawn on January 6 after the two sides came to a fresh agreement, the court documents obtained by New York Post shows.Michelle Ritter is a 2021 Columbia Law School graduate and a former girlfriend of ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt. She is a tech entrepreneur who founded the AI-focused startup Steel Perlot, into which Schmidt reportedly invested $100 million. Ritter has represented herself in court proceedings related to her dispute with Schmidt and has been publicly involved in the media coverage surrounding the case.Ritter and Schmidt are currently involved in a legal dispute centered on alleged misconduct, business issues, and access to Schmidt’s properties. Ritter filed for a restraining order against Schmidt, claiming he tried to force her to sign “a gag order on any sexual assault or harassment allegations.” She also alleged that Schmidt locked her out of housing and access to personal and business belongings in New York, Miami, and Aspen, and has pressed her into a costly arbitration process she cannot afford, which she describes as “a cynical effort to protect the dispute and win by economic and resource attrition. ”The dispute also involves the Bel Air mansion at 1060 Brooklawn Drive, a 15,000-square-foot property Schmidt bought for $61 million. Ritter requested exclusive access to the property and protection for her dog, a German Shepherd named Henry. She has also moved into a more modest Beverly Hills apartment while the legal matters continue.The case further involves financial and operational issues with Steel Perlot, Ritter’s AI startup. Reports suggest the company struggled despite Schmidt’s investment, with payroll and credit card bills being covered by Schmidt’s family office. Ritter’s filings cite ongoing conflicts over Schmidt’s alleged attempts to suppress exposure of his misconduct and his handling of their business ventures.In a temporary restraining order (TRO) request that was later withdrawn, Michelle Ritter alleged that former Google CEO Eric Schmidt had recently locked her out of the website of her startup, Steel Perlot — an AI-focused venture firm that Schmidt had reportedly invested $100 million into, according to a source cited by The Post.“Please note Eric’s technical background,” Ritter wrote in the filing. “I literally cannot have a private phone call or send a private email without surveillance.”Ritter, who is 39 years younger than Schmidt, also claimed that he demanded she agree to “a gag order on any sexual assault or harassment allegations and sign a knowingly false declaration that any such allegations never happened.”In her December TRO filing, Ritter alleged, “Unfortunately, my former partner is extraordinarily powerful and capable and has used every mean[s] to block me from getting access to secure data, devices, finances, or businesses, or to simply live my life in peace.”Lawyers for Schmidt filed a 82-page long response to Ritter’s allegations claiming that “Michelle Ritter’s demonstrably false Complaint is a blatant abuse of the judicial system.” The billionaire’s legal team is headed by hard-charging LA litigator Patricia Glaser. The team filed a motion on October 8 to seal the court documents.However, most parts of the legal response have been blacked out before the court hearing, which is scheduled to take place in downtown Los Angeles on December 4.","Michelle Ritter, ex-girlfriend of ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt has accused him of stalking, abuse and “toxic masculinity” Ritter has claimed that the former Google CEO subjected her to an “absolute digital surveillance system” The two are fighting legally over money, a failed AI startup, and ownership of a luxury Bel Air mansion.

What caused Amazon Web Services outage





US Senator Elizabeth Warren has renewed her call to break up Big Tech – a term collectively used for the likes of Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon , Meta and others – after a major outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) that disrupted access to several major online platforms and government websites. The AWS outage which lasted for nearly 15 hours affected multiple services that rely on Amazon’s cloud infrastructure. Users across the US and UK reported problems accessing apps and websites including Disney+ from Walt Disney Co., the McDonald’s app, Reddit, Robinhood, Ring, and Snapchat.Following reports of the disruption, Warren quoted a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) highlighting the incident and naming affected companies. She captioned the post,Amazon Web Services, a subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc., provides cloud computing and hosting services to thousands of businesses and public institutions around the world. Outages at AWS can cause widespread disruptions because of its extensive role in supporting internet infrastructure.Warren’s remarks have reignited discussions in Washington over the risks of overreliance on a few large tech companies to power essential online systems.The senator, who has been a long-time critic of large technology firms, has repeatedly called for stronger antitrust measures to reduce the dominance of major players such as Amazon, Apple, Google, and Meta.As of this morning, Amazon said most services had been restored.In its status page, Amazon said that the outage was caused by DNS resolution failure affecting DynamoDB.“We have identified a potential root cause for error rates for the DynamoDB APIs in the US-EAST-1 Region. Based on our investigation, the issue appears to be related to DNS resolution of the DynamoDB API endpoint in US-EAST-1,” the company said.The issue has now been resolved. Giving a summary of the incident, Amazon writes:“Between 11:49 PM PDT on October 19 and 2:24 AM PDT on October 20, we experienced increased error rates and latencies for AWS Services in the US-EAST-1 Region. Additionally, services or features that rely on US-EAST-1 endpoints such as IAM and DynamoDB Global Tables also experienced issues during this time. At 12:26 AM on October 20, we identified the trigger of the event as DNS resolution issues for the regional DynamoDB service endpoints. After resolving the DynamoDB DNS issue at 2:24 AM, services began recovering but we had a subsequent impairment in the internal subsystem of EC2 that is responsible for launching EC2 instances due to its dependency on DynamoDB. As we continued to work through EC2 instance launch impairments, Network Load Balancer health checks also became impaired, resulting in network connectivity issues in multiple services such as Lambda, DynamoDB, and CloudWatch. We recovered the Network Load Balancer health checks at 9:38 AM. As part of the recovery effort, we temporarily throttled some operations such as EC2 instance launches, processing of SQS queues via Lambda Event Source Mappings, and asynchronous Lambda invocations. Over time we reduced throttling of operations and worked in parallel to resolve network connectivity issues until the services fully recovered. By 3:01 PM, all AWS services returned to normal operations. Some services such as AWS Config, Redshift, and Connect continue to have a backlog of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours. We will share a detailed AWS post-event summary.”",US Senator Elizabeth Warren has renewed her call to break up Big Tech.

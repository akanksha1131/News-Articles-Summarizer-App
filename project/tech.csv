Nvidia’s investments in other tech companies







Nvidia has agreed to invest $1 billion in Nokia, taking a 2.9% stake in the Finnish telecommunications equipment maker as part of a strategic partnership focused on developing next-generation wireless technology and AI infrastructure. This marks the latest in a series of equity investments by Nvidia as the AI chipmaker leverages its position in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom to forge strategic alliances across multiple industries.Nokia will issue more than 166 million new shares to Nvidia, raising approximately $1 billion for the company. The shares will be delivered to Nvidia in the form of American Depositary Shares and are expected to be registered with the Finnish Trade Register in November.Nokia said it will use the proceeds to “accelerate its strategic plans to advance trusted connectivity for the AI supercycle and other general corporate purposes,” including investments in AI and cloud market initiatives within its Network Infrastructure business.Beyond the financial investment, the two companies struck a comprehensive strategic partnership with several key components, including 6G Development, software optimisation, AI networking solutions, data centre integration..Nokia stated that Nvidia would ""consider incorporating"" Nokia's technology into its future AI infrastructure plans, suggesting potential but not guaranteed integration.Nvidia has invested in several companies, including ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, pledging to invest up to $100 billion in the company over time.

Agent HQ: A single command centre



Centralised management: Developers gain a single command center to assign and monitor the work of multiple agents simultaneously.

Real-time control: Users can see exactly what their agents are working on and intervene to correct their course in real time if the AI gets off track.





Microsoft’s GitHub unit has announced Agent HQ, a new “mission control” interface designed to help software developers manage the complexity of AI coding tools. The platform will allow developers to assign and monitor AI agents – tools that can autonomously complete programming tasks on a user’s behalf – from multiple vendors all in one place.The proliferation of these agents – built by companies like GitHub, OpenAI, and Google – has created a management challenge for developers.“We want to bring a little bit of order to the chaos of innovation,” GitHub COO Kyle Daigle told CNBC.“With so many different agents, there’s so many different ways of kicking off these asynchronous tasks, and so our big opportunity here is to bring this all together,” added Daigle.Agent HQ will allow developers to manage coding agents from leading providers, including OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, xAI, and Cognition, all within the GitHub environment.Key functions of the new interface include:Daigle emphasised that the goal is to ensure the new “era of abundance for AI... doesn’t turn to chaos,” by providing a streamlined experience on an open GitHub platform.The third-party agents will begin rolling out to GitHub Copilot subscribers in the coming months. However, Copilot Pro+ users will gain immediate access to OpenAI Codex in VS Code Insiders this week.GitHub, which was acquired by Microsoft in 2018, currently supports more than 180 million developers and reports it is experiencing its fastest rate of growth ever.",GitHub's Agent HQ is a new ‘mission control’ interface designed to help software developers manage the complexity of AI coding tools.

China says it has is creating first underwater data centre: What makes this special,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/china-says-it-has-is-creating-first-underwater-data-centre-what-makes-this-special/articleshow/124885319.cms,"Representative photo

Why this data centre is ‘one-of-a-kind’



OpenAI write to US government over investment in energy





China has reportedly completed the first phase of construction on what it claims is the world’s first large-scale Underwater Data Centre (UDC). Located in Shanghai’s Lin-gang Special Area, the $226 million project represents a significant global breakthrough in the quest for sustainable and energy-efficient computing infrastructure, a report has said.According to a report by Wired, the initiative is designed to address the soaring energy demands of traditional data centres by utilising the ocean itself.The primary advantage of the UDC is its innovative cooling system. Traditional, land-based data centres use up to 50% of their total energy consumption on air conditioning to prevent server overheating. The Lin-gang UDC solves this by submerging servers beneath the ocean surface, where seawater acts as a constant, natural cooling system.According to Su Yang, general manager of Shanghai Hicloud Technology, this dramatically reduces the energy demand for cooling to less than 10%. The entire project, which has a total power capacity of 24 megawatts, is powered primarily by offshore wind energy.This comes a day after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI urged the US government to increase investment in new domestic energy capacity, arguing that failure to do so risks handing global leadership in artificial intelligence (AI) to China.The Microsoft-backed company submitted an 11-page document to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlining the critical threat posed by the massive, power-hungry infrastructure needed for next-generation AI.The company warned that the development of AI is placing immense strain on the nation's existing electric grid. To keep pace with international rivals, OpenAI urged the US to commit to building 100 gigawatts (GW) of new energy capacity each year.Notably, China added a total of 429 GW of new power capacity last year while the US added only 51 GW during the same period, OpenAI said.","China has reportedly completed the first phase of construction on what it claims is the world’s first large-scale Underwater Data Centre.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees.

The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%. This change reportedly came after Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new 30% target.","Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You’ll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles – they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me – we’re going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next. Love to hear from you if there’s anything interesting going on, workwise or otherwise.Another employee, David Luehmann, a director of game development at the studio, also posted on LinkedIn, saying, ""After 10+ great years working at Boss Fight, the last few as part of Netflix, the time has come for the studio to close down.""“I am very proud of all the people, work, and games we've released.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

From photoshop to AI: Narayan says Adobe has a long creative legacy





Adobe brings AI models from Google, OpenAI and more to Firefly









Creativity is entering a transformative new era powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and the company is at the forefront of this revolution that will fundamentally reshape how people create content across industries, Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen has said. Speaking at Adobe MAX, the company's annual creativity conference in Los Angeles, Narayen outlined a vision where AI doesn't simply execute tasks but collaborates with creators.He said that AI will ask clarifying questions, plan multi-step workflows, and deliver personalised results that maintain human control and ownership.“Creativity is everywhere, fueling progress across industries, adding innovation, reshaping business models, practices, and most important, customer engagement. We're proud that Adobe has been at the forefront of this entire revolution,” Narayen said.Narayen traced Adobe's influence from “the earliest days of Photoshop to the groundbreaking advances” that have been unveiled at the conference. He emphasised that the new tools will make “creativity more fluid, more inclusive and more influential than ever before.”The CEO framed the current moment as a fundamental shift in how people interact with creative tools, enabled by AI's ability to understand natural language and intent.“Creativity is entering a new era as AI enables creators to immerse themselves in their ideas seamlessly with the mechanics of execution,” he said, explaining, “You'll be able to specify your desired outcomes in open-ended ways—whether it's reimagining the layout of a scene or adding or removing objects in a single step.”Narayen explained Adobe's strategic decision to offer creators choice among multiple AI models rather than locking them into a single technology.“Today you have more options than ever before to find inspiration as well as iterate on these concepts. Being able to describe what you want to do—whether it's text to image, text to video, text to audio—is a more intuitive and natural way to start the creative process,” he said.“It's why it was really essential for us to develop our own excellent foundation models with Firefly that are designed to be commercially safe, but also to give you the choice of multiple third-party models like Google Gemini, Imagen, OpenAI, Flux, Runway, Microsoft Mai, and others,” he added.","Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen spoke at the company's annual creativity conference in Los Angeles.

Agentic AI: Adobe introduces AI assistant in Express for conversational editing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/agentic-ai-adobe-introduces-ai-assistant-in-express-for-conversational-editing/articleshow/124883919.cms,"How Adobe’s conversational editing works







Adobe has jumped onto the Agentic bandwagon, unveiling an AI Assistant in Adobe Express that allows users to create and edit designs through natural conversation. According to the company, this will help content creators without design expertise make professional-quality content. The new feature, announced at Adobe MAX 2025 annual conference in Los Angeles, combines conversational AI with traditional editing tools.Adobe says that users can describe what they want in easy to understand, conversational language while retaining the option to fine-tune details using familiar controls like sliders and colour pickers.Unlike traditional design software that requires users to learn specific tools and workflows, the AI Assistant in Express allows people to simply describe desired changes in natural language.For example, a user can ask the assistant to “Remove the background” or “change the tone of the photo to more tropical,"" and the system will edit the photo with relevant content. It will automatically surface relevant editing tools like saturation toggles with matching colour tones, offering users to choose what’s right for their content.The assistant can generate edits on specific layers of a design—including fonts, images, and backgrounds—while keeping other elements intact, allowing iterative refinement without destroying work already completed.Adobe emphasises that the AI Assistant brings “contextual and semantic understanding of design elements,” enabling it to interpret vague or subjective requests and make intelligent design decisions.This capability transforms templates into what Adobe calls “conversational canvases” where users can generate images, change backgrounds and text, and replace objects without needing to know which specific tool or AI model to use.“Unlike other editing tools, the AI Assistant in Express enables customers to iterate on any aspect of their content with generative AI, making changes to individual elements, layers of an asset or across an entire campaign, without destroying the parts they love and having to start over,” Adobe stated.","Adobe has unveiled an AI Assistant in Adobe Express that allows users to create and edit designs through natural conversation.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman:





OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has completed a major corporate restructuring, converting its core business into a traditional for-profit entity called OpenAI Group PBC, which will remain under the control of its non-profit arm, now dubbed the OpenAI Foundation. The move, which took nearly a year to negotiate and removes a significant cloud of uncertainty, redefines its relationship with long-time backer Microsoft and clarifies what each party gains and loses.This deal formalizes the long-term, intertwined nature of the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership while granting OpenAI the operational freedom necessary for its rapidly expanding commercial ambitions. It keeps the two companies intertwined until at least 2032.Microsoft receives a 27% ownership stake in the new for-profit entity, valued at approximately $135 billion based on the company’s current $500 billion valuation.The tech giant gains access to OpenAI's technology and models until 2032, including those that achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a key extension from their previous agreement.This is considered the most important aspect of the revised pact. Anurag Rana, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said that Microsoft keeping OpenAI’s intellectual-property rights for both products and models through 2032 “is the most important aspect” of the revised agreement. “Microsoft is using either OpenAI or Anthropic models in its Copilot products as it develops its own.”Microsoft remains entitled to receive 20% of OpenAI’s revenue until an independent expert panel verifies that AGI has been achieved.OpenAI has committed to purchasing an additional $250 billion in Microsoft Azure cloud computing services.Microsoft loses its ""right of first refusal"" on new cloud infrastructure business from OpenAI. While Azure remains the primary partner, OpenAI can now seek out services from other vendors.Access to OpenAI's technology will no longer include consumer hardware. This provides OpenAI with independence in a new product category.Once AGI is verified by the new independent expert panel, Microsoft will no longer receive a cut of OpenAI’s revenue.The restructuring clears the path for the company to operate as a more traditional for-profit business, simplifying its corporate structure and removing a constraint on raising capital.he OpenAI Foundation retains control over the for-profit company and receives a 26% equity stake (worth roughly $130 billion), which it plans to use for its charitable mission, including accelerating health breakthroughs.OpenAI gains the ability to jointly develop some products with third parties and can utilize other cloud vendors for non-API products (though API products remain exclusive to Azure).The AGI threshold, which triggers a change in the revenue-sharing agreement, must now be verified by an independent expert panel, a clearer metric than previous terms.Altman receives no stake in the newly restructured company.","OpenAI has completed a major corporate restructuring, converting its core business into a traditional for-profit entity.

Microsoft to hold 27% in OpenAI





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has struck a major deal with tech giant Microsoft to restructure itself into a public benefit corporation (PBC), a move that solidifies CEO Sam Altman 's authority within the burgeoning AI industry and grants the $500 billion startup significant new latitude to grow. The agreement, announced Tuesday, October 29, untangles key limitations on capital-raising that have constrained OpenAI since its 2019 partnership with Microsoft. That initial deal granted Microsoft broad rights over OpenAI's work in exchange for the massive, costly cloud computing resources needed for its research. However, the unexpected, rapid explosion of the AI assistant ChatGPT three years ago strained those original terms, creating significant tension between the companies.""OpenAI has completed its recapitalization, simplifying its corporate structure,"" said Bret Taylor, board chair of the OpenAI Foundation, in a blog post. ""The nonprofit remains in control of the for-profit, and now has a direct path to major resources before AGI arrives.""The OpenAI Foundation, which holds a 26% stake in the new Group PBC and a warrant for additional shares, will continue to be controlled by its board, whose members -- including Altman and Taylor -- have the power to appoint and remove the PBC’s board members.Crucially, the deal removes Microsoft’s former right of first refusal to be OpenAI's sole compute provider -- a requirement that had been a major source of friction as the company's computing needs soared. Microsoft has instead secured a separate agreement for OpenAI to purchase $250 billion in Azure cloud computing services. Furthermore, Microsoft will no longer have rights to any consumer hardware produced by OpenAI.In a reversal of earlier talks, an OpenAI spokesperson confirmed that Altman will not receive equity in the restructured company. His annual compensation of approximately $76,000 will remain unchanged. The spokesperson added that the company has no immediate plans for a potential public offering.Despite the restructuring, Microsoft remains a central figure in OpenAI’s future, retaining a 27% stake in the new PBC. This stake is valued at around $135 billion.The deal is a massive win for the Redmond-based tech titan, which has invested $13.8 billion in OpenAI, implying a return of nearly 10 times its investment. Microsoft shares reacted positively to the news, rising 2.1% and sending the company’s market capitalization back above $4 trillion.The partnership is now formally cemented until at least 2032 through the massive cloud computing contract and continued rights to certain OpenAI products and AI models. OpenAI will also continue to share about 20% of its revenue with Microsoft for years to come.The deal also addresses the companies' shared, long-term goal of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) -- the point at which an AI system can match a well-educated human adult. The new agreement requires an independent panel to verify OpenAI's claims of reaching AGI, at which point the revenue-share and cloud commitments are expected to end.","Microsoft and OpenAI avoid messy breakup, for now.

How the Nexperia standoff between China and Netherlands affected carmakers



What the Dutch government said about taking control of Nexperia







The Netherlands' government decided to take control of chipmaker Nexperia last month. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, this decision was prompted by concerns that the company's former CEO was preparing to dismantle European operations and move production to China.The report cited four government sources in The Hague indicating that Zhang Xuezheng, the former CEO who also founded Nexperia's Chinese parent company, Wingtech, had planned to lay off 40% of the European staff and close a research and development facility in Munich.Reuters sources also claimed that, before his suspension by a Dutch court on October 1, Zhang had already transferred secrets, including chip designs and machine settings, from Nexperia's Manchester plant in Britain to a Wingtech-owned facility in China. Physical equipment from the Hamburg production plant was reportedly slated for relocation next.The standoff between China and the Netherlands over Nexperia has also led carmakers in Europe, the US, and Japan to warn of potential production problems due to possible chip shortages. Volkswagen has warned its employees about possible production delays caused by potential chip shortages. BMW and Mercedes-Benz said they are coordinating with suppliers to maintain production during the current standoff.In the US, General Motors CEO Mary Barra said during an earnings call that China’s chip export curbs “have the potential to impact production,” adding that GM has a team “working around the clock with our supply chain partners to minimize possible disruptions” in a “very fluid” situation.While Nexperia's chips are considered basic, they are essential and used in large numbers in automotive electronic systems.The Dutch government took control of Nexperia on September 30, citing governance issues. A few days later, on October 4, China’s Ministry of Commerce restricted exports of the company’s products from the country.It's important to note that, despite most of Nexperia’s chips being manufactured in Europe, about 70% are packaged in China before distribution.The company’s Chinese division has since begun operating independently and resumed sales to customers within China.The sources also told Reuters that the Dutch government is confident it can reach an agreement with China to reinstate Nexperia under a joint Dutch-Chinese structure.","The Dutch government took control of Nexperia on September 30, citing governance issues.

Adobe has launched a string of AI-powered creative tools across its entire product ecosystem, from consumer-focused Adobe Express to professional Creative Cloud applications used by designers, photographers, and video editors worldwide. At Adobe MAX 2025, the company’s annual creativity conference held in Los Angeles, the company also announced innovations for Adobe Firefly and Adobe GenStudio that will allow users as well as businesses to generate studio-quality videos, audio and photos, essentially positioning the creative software giant to compete directly with specialised AI startups.One of the biggest Adobe announcement centres around Firefly – its generative AI platform – making it into a complete video production studio. The company introduced several audio and video capabilities:Creates original, studio-quality musical scores tailored specifically to accompanying videos, eliminating the need for licensed music libraries.Produces AI voiceovers, allowing creators to add narration without recording equipment or voice talent.A new timeline-based editor that enables creators to produce complete videos from ideation through final output entirely within Firefly.Adobe also announced that it will integrate AI models from multiple providers directly into its creative tools, rather than relying exclusively on its own Firefly technology. Creators can now choose from:Commercially safe models for video, audio, imaging, vectors, design, and 3D.The new Firefly Image Model 5 (public beta) combines native 4MP resolution with photorealistic quality and prompt-based editing capabilities.Adobe is also offering creators access to models from, and others integrated directly into Adobe platforms like Firefly, Photoshop, and Adobe Express. Adobe announced new partnerships with ElevenLabs (known for AI voice generation) and Topaz Labs (image enhancement), along with expanded model options from existing partners.Finally, Firefly custom models (private beta): Personalised models that creators can train on their own visual style by simply dragging and dropping reference images, illustrations, sketches, and other assets they have rights to use. This allows creators to generate content that maintains their distinctive aesthetic.“We believe every creator should be able to harness the economic and artistic opportunities flowing from generative AI, conversational AI and the exploding global demand for creative content,” said David Wadhwani, president of digital media at Adobe.“Our AI at Adobe is made to create and built for the creators who paint the world with their imagination,” he added.For creative professionals using Creative Cloud applications, Adobe introduced a number of AI-powered enhancements designed to provide “pixel-level control and precision tooling”. For example, Photoshop now gets Generative Fill with choice of top industry models for text-to-image generation. Furthermore, Generative Upscale can now leverage Topaz Labs technology to transform low-resolution images to 4K quality.AI Object Mask (public beta) helps video editors identify and isolate people and objects in video frames for more efficient editing.Assisted Culling (public beta) helps photographers quickly identify the best images from large photo collections—potentially saving hours of manual review time.Adobe emphasized that these tools, combined with performance upgrades across Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, and Premiere, can save creative professionals significant time on routine tasks.Meanwhile, for professionals managing large volumes of content, Adobe introduced Firefly Creative Production (private beta), which enables editing thousands of images simultaneously. Users can automatically replace backgrounds, apply consistent color grading, and crop multiple images through a no-code interface—functionality particularly valuable for e-commerce, marketing, and media companies.","Adobe has launched a string of AI-powered creative tools across its entire product ecosystem.

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon has cautioned against making early predictions about which companies will dominate the artificial intelligence landscape, stating ""everybody's playing to win"" but emphasizing it's too early to identify clear victors. Speaking at the Fortune Global Forum in Riyadh on October 27, Amon told attendees that ""it's hard right now to declare who the winners are,"" while acknowledging that AI's long-term potential may be larger than current expectations suggest. He predicted the technology sector will soon become intensely competitive as the market matures.Drawing parallels to the internet revolution, Amon noted that today's web is vastly larger than anyone imagined 25 years ago, according to Fortune. ""Who we expected to be the winners in the early days—it changed,"" he said. ""When you think about AI in the long term, it is going to be massive, and it's probably underestimated.""The Qualcomm chief said companies with architectures capable of handling the efficiency demands of AI deployment will be ""very well positioned"" for the upcoming competition, calling AI a ""massive opportunity"" despite the challenges ahead.His comments come as industry leaders increasingly voice concerns about an AI bubble.

""When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,"" Altman said.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg echoed similar concerns in September, telling the Access podcast that based on past infrastructure buildouts, ""there's definitely a possibility"" of a bubble collapse.

overall reduction in our corporate workforce of approximately 14,000 roles

Why Amazon job cuts

Amazon’s letter to employees on job cuts

I want to let you know that we're making organizational changes across Amazon that will impact some of our teammates. There will be communications from leaders to those teams and individuals today, but we also wanted to share the broader context about what’s happening and why.

Last year, Andy posted a note about strengthening our culture and teams – explaining how we want to operate like the world’s largest startup, the importance of having the right structure to drive that level of speed and ownership, and the need to be set up to invent, collaborate, be connected, and deliver the absolute best for customers. Many of you have put significant effort into that work of strengthening your organizations by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and helping reduce bureaucracy. We're already seeing the results, with teams moving faster and many Amazonians feeling more ownership, and the S-team and I appreciate all the work you've done. The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers’ current and future needs.

While this will include reducing in some areas and hiring in others, it will mean an overall reduction in our corporate workforce of approximately 14,000 roles. We’re working hard to support everyone whose role is impacted, including offering most employees 90 days to look for a new role internally (the timing will vary some based on local laws), and our recruiting teams will prioritize internal candidates to help as many people as possible find new roles within Amazon. For our teammates who are unable to find a new role at Amazon or who choose not to look for one, we’ll offer them transition support including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits, and more.

Looking ahead to 2026, as Andy talked about earlier this year, we expect to continue hiring in key strategic areas while also finding additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realize efficiency gains.

Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well. Across our businesses, we're delivering great customer experiences every day, innovating at a rapid rate, and producing strong business results. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.

I don’t know of any other company with the breadth of Amazon, the number of exciting bold bets we’re making, and all the ways we can make customers lives better and easier around the world. I’m inspired by what I see across the company every day, and the S-team and I appreciate all that you do.

Timeline of Trump-Musk feud





Elon Musk’s relationship with Donald Trump seems to be easing. During a recent interaction with reporters lately, Trump said he has a ""good"" relationship despite Musk’s ‘stupid moment’ earlier this year. “I like Elon, I've always liked him”, Trump said on board Air Force One as he traveled between Malaysia and Japan. He further added that he has spoken with Musk ""on and off, a little bit"".Musk and Trump – once close allies have had a tense relationship recently after the tech billionaire criticised the Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill.” “He had a bad spell, he had a bad period. He had a bad moment,” Trump described the incident after the two had a fallout following the criticism.“It was a stupid moment in his life, very stupid. I'm sure he'd tell you that. But I like Elon, and I suspect I always will,” the US President said.Elon Musk emerged as a strong supporter of Trump during the 2024 election campaign. According to reports, he donated $288 million to the 2024 election. He was later appointed as Tech advisor to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) - a special task force established to cut federal spending.However, their relationship began to strain when the Trump administration introduced “One Big Beautiful Bill”. Musk lashed out at the bill, calling it a “disgusting abomination.” Taking to X, Musk wrote “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.”Trump responded to Musk’s criticism of the bill stating “I'm very disappointed with Elon. I've helped him a lot. He knew the inner workings of the bill better than anybody sitting here. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden he had a problem & he only developed the problem when he found out we're going to cut EV mandate”.Later, Musk posted a cryptic tweet in June implying Donald Trump might be named in the unreleased Epstein files. It was quickly dismissed by Trump allies as conspiratorial innuendo.

A million ChatGPT users talk about suicide every week: How OpenAI is trying to fix it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/a-million-chatgpt-users-talk-about-suicide-every-week-how-openai-is-trying-to-fix-it/articleshow/124866972.cms,"The Myth of Sisyphus

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

What changed today



The numbers, unpacked



Suicide-linked chats: ~1.2 million weekly (0.15%)

Psychosis or mania signals: ~560,000 weekly (0.07%)

User base frame: About 800 million weekly user..

Caveat

How OpenAI says it got better



The legal and regulatory weather



The sycophancy problem



What independent observers see



The hard questions OpenAI didn’t answer



Base rates vs. outcomes. How many of these users ultimately receive help — and how many fall through the cracks? Measuring compliance is easier than measuring rescue.

Denominator drift. “Weekly active users” is a marketing term. If that base fluctuates, the risk percentages can shift even if the absolute numbers do not.

False calm. A polite, articulate AI can sound stabilising while entirely missing the urgency of a crisis.

Guardrails vs. freedom. OpenAI has simultaneously loosened restrictions on adult content and tightened mental-health safety protocols. The tension between the two may prove harder to code than any chatbot personality.

Verdict







Albert Camus beganwith a provocation that still slices through the noise of all philosophy: “There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide.” Whether the Earth revolves around the Sun, he wrote, or the mind has nine or twelve categories, are games one plays after answering the only question that truly matters — whether life is worth living.Eighty years later, that question has found a new confessor. Not a philosopher in a Parisian café, but a machine built to autocomplete sentences. According to OpenAI, more than a million people every week now turn to ChatGPT with messages that show signs of suicidal planning or intent. The AI that writes love notes, schedules meetings and tells bedtime stories has become an oracle for despair. It is no longer a thought experiment about absurdity. It is the absurd, quantified.OpenAI published a safety update on “sensitive conversations,” saying it worked with 170 clinicians and developed new automated evaluations to measure self-harm and crisis behaviour. The company claims that its newest model, GPT-5, is now “91% compliant” with desired safety behaviours, compared with 77% for a previous version.In human terms, those percentages translate into staggering numbers: roughly 0.15% of its estimated 800 million weekly users send messages showing suicidal intent, and another 0.07% display signs of mania or psychosis. OpenAI admits these are preliminary figures and that such interactions are notoriously difficult to detect or classify.: Model-side detection remains probabilistic, prone to both false alarms and missed crises. OpenAI calls this an “initial analysis,” not a final count.The company says it has trained GPT-5 with direct input from psychiatrists and psychologists, who helped shape responses to mental-health-related prompts. New features surface crisis hotlines, prompt users to take breaks during long sessions, and favour language that is “supportive, practical, and safe.”The model is designed to avoid cold refusals — the old “I can’t help with that” replies — in favour of gentler redirection. The promise is clear: fewer abrupt cutoffs, more compassionate engagement. The risk is equally clear: a machine that can sound wise without truly understanding what pain is.This disclosure comes as OpenAI faces a wrongful-death lawsuit from the family of Adam Raine, a 16-year-old who died by suicide after months of using ChatGPT. The family alleges the company relaxed safety guardrails before his death. OpenAI denies the claim, but the case now stands as a test of what “duty of care” means in the age of artificial empathy.Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission has launched an inquiry into AI chatbots marketed as “companions.” Regulators are examining how such systems affect children and teenagers, and whether companies meaningfully track negative outcomes. The language in the notice may be bureaucratic, but the questions it raises are existential.Researchers have long warned that chatbots tend to agree with users, even when the premise is harmful. The behaviour — known as AI sycophancy — flatters rather than challenges. It smooths edges, validates feelings, and can quietly reinforce self-destructive logic.OpenAI acknowledges this risk and claims its latest models are less prone to it. Yet even minor failures can have devastating consequences when a user in crisis mistakes mimicry for understanding. The danger lies not in cruelty, but in compassion without comprehension.Analysts interpret OpenAI’s announcement as both candour and caution — a rare admission of scale, wrapped in corporate control. The data reveals the depth of human reliance on AI for emotional support, but also exposes the limits of what algorithms can measure.In practice, hotline prompts still fail to appear in some conversations, and most of the data comes from OpenAI’s own benchmarks. The progress is self-reported, the safety graded on its own curve. As one observer put it: OpenAI is keeping score in a game only it knows the rules to.Technology craves resolution; mental illness resists it. When OpenAI says “a million,” it is counting storms inside private browsers. Some of those storms are jokes typed at midnight. Some are quiet pleas from people who have told no one else what they just told a chatbot.The company’s answer is to build a better listener and embed more helplines. Necessary, yes. But sufficient? Not yet. The real frontier is not whether the model sounds caring — it is whether it connects a suffering person to care. For now, OpenAI’s numbers illuminate a hallway. We still do not know how many make it to the door.","OpenAI says 1.2 million people a week turn to ChatGPT with messages that show signs of suicidal planning or intent. 0.15% of its estimated 800 million weekly users send messages showing suicidal intent, and 0.07% display signs of mania or psychosis.

HR division faces deepest cuts as AI investments surge

Mayhem at Amazon Amid 30,000 Job Cuts: AI - Easy Corporate Excuse? | Global Pulse





Amazon managers received urgent training Monday, October 27 on how to communicate with employees just hours before the company began notifying corporate workers of their termination, according to Reuters sources and internal documents reviewed by multiple outlets.The layoffs, which began Tuesday morning via email, represent nearly 10% of Amazon’s 350,000 corporate employees and mark the largest job cut in the company’s history. Reuters reported that managers of impacted teams were specifically instructed on Monday to prepare for delivering the difficult news, with notifications scheduled to roll out the following day.The cuts affect multiple divisions including human resources (known internally as People Experience and Technology or PXT), operations, devices and services, and Amazon Web Services, according to three people familiar with the matter who spoke to Reuters.Fortune reported that the HR division alone could see cuts of up to 15% of its staff, affecting thousands of the unit’s 10,000-plus employees worldwide. CEO Andy Jassy has been driving an aggressive cost-cutting campaign while simultaneously investing over $100 billion in AI infrastructure this year, according to Fortune.CNBC confirmed the cuts would represent the largest single layoff event across the tech industry since at least 2020.The company has already eliminated 27,000 positions since late 2022, but this round significantly exceeds previous reductions.Internal messages viewed by Business Insider showed that employees in the US, UK, and Canada would be affected. A draft severance email promised full pay and benefits for 90 days following termination.Jassy’s efficiency initiative includes reducing management layers through an anonymous complaint system that has generated 1,500 responses. However, the company’s strict five-day return-to-office policy has failed to generate sufficient voluntary attrition, contributing to the layoff’s scope, two sources told Reuters.Despite the corporate cuts, Amazon plans to hire 250,000 seasonal warehouse workers for the holiday season.","Amazon is cutting approximatly 14,000 corporate roles in the company.

Microsoft’s AI-powered “first line of defense against scams” is now available for these users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsofts-ai-powered-first-line-of-defense-against-scams-is-now-available-for-these-users/articleshow/118029154.cms,"What is a scareware scam

How does Microsoft’s scareware blocker work

Microsoft has started to roll out a new feature in its Edge browser called “scareware blocker” to protect users from increasingly sophisticated online scams, particularly those employing scareware tactics . The company announced the feature at its Ignite conference last November and is now inviting users to preview and test it.Scareware scams employ aggressive web pages designed to deceive users into believing their system is infected with malware. These scams often pressure victims to call fake tech support numbers, potentially leading to financial loss and compromised personal information.Microsoft says that its data revealed a significant rise in online scams, with Edge blocking five times more scams in 2024 compared to just three years prior. While Edge currently utilizes Microsoft Defender SmartScreen to block known scams, the new scareware blocker aims to provide a proactive defense against emerging threats.Microsoft says that its scareware blocker leverages a machine learning model to identify the characteristics of scareware scams and empowers users to regain control of their browsing experience.“Scareware blocker adds a new, first line of defense to help protect the users exposed to a new scam if it attempts to open a full screen page. Scareware blocker uses a machine learning model that runs on the local computer. The model uses computer vision to compare full screen pages to thousands of sample scams that the scam-fighting community shared with us. The model runs locally, without saving or sending images to the cloud,” Microsoft said.Users can then choose to report the malicious site to Microsoft, contributing to the improvement of Defender SmartScreen's ability to detect and block similar scams across the web. Users can also report false positives, helping to refine the scareware blocker's accuracy and reduce the likelihood of legitimate pages being mistakenly blocked.","Microsoft has started to roll out a new feature in its Edge browser called “scareware blocker” The feature aims to protect users from increasingly sophisticated online scams.

in multiple languages, empowering young daters in India with essential tools and tips. Partnering with the Center for Social Research, we’re raising awareness of practical steps people can take for safer dating, reinforcing our commitment to stronger safety standards across our platforms and communities, and industry,”

Tinder has unveiled a comprehensive Dating Safety Guide in four Indian languages: Hindi, Marathi, Kannada, and Bengali. Initially introduced in English, this initiative aims to enhance accessibility for a broader audience within India.The collaboration between Tinder and the Centre for Social Research (CSR), a non-profit organization dedicated to safety and gender equality, has resulted in the development of this guide. It serves as a valuable resource for users, providing guidance on navigating online and in-person dating scenarios with enhanced safety measures. The guide encompasses practical tips on identifying potential red flags, comprehending consent, and utilizing safety features such as Photo Verification, Unmatch, and Block Contacts.According to a survey conducted by Tinder, Indian users frequently express concerns regarding safety prior to meeting a potential match. Approximately 37% of users indicated a preference for engaging in video calls with their matches before scheduling a date. In light of these concerns, Tinder aims to provide additional support and enhance the safety and confidence of its users.Effective from February 2025, Tinder users in India will receive in-app messages promoting the newly released guide. These messages will disseminate safety tips and direct users to the comprehensive guide for further reference. The primary objective is to educate and empower users to make informed and secure choices.Jyoti Vadehra, Digital Trust and Safety Lead at CSR said the guide will help more people, especially women, get into online dating with a little more confidence.Tinder’s Vice President of Trust & Safety, Yoel Roth, said the company is committed to making dating safer for everyone.he said.","Tinder has unveiled a comprehensive Dating Safety Guide in four Indian languages: Hindi, Marathi, Kannada, and Bengali.

"DeepSeek iPhone app has multiple security flaws, mobile security company claims",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/deepseek-iphone-app-has-multiple-security-flaws-mobile-security-company-claims/articleshow/118027132.cms,"Security flaws discovered in DeepSeek’s iPhone app







“The DeepSeek iOS app globally disables App Transport Security (ATS) which is an iOS platform-level protection that prevents sensitive data from being sent over unencrypted channels. Since this protection is disabled, the app can (and does) send unencrypted data over the internet,”

“While none of this data taken separately is highly risky, the aggregation of many data points over time quickly leads to easily identifying individuals. The recent data breach of Gravy Analytics demonstrates this data is actively being collected at scale and can effectively de-anonymize millions of individuals,”

“The encryption algorithm chosen for this part of the application leverages a known broken encryption algorithm (3DES) which makes it a poor choice to protect the confidentiality of data,”

“[A sample user] is operating on the latest iPad, leveraging a cellular data connection that is registered to FirstNet (American public safety broadband network operator) and ostensibly the user would be considered a high value target for espionage. Bear in mind that not only are 10’s of data points collected in the DeepSeek iOS app but related data is collected from millions of apps and can be easily purchased, combined and then correlated to quickly de-anonymise users,”

The DeepSeek app has been popular among iPhone users since its launch and even topped the App Store charts in the US. However, a mobile security company has discovered multiple new security vulnerabilities in the app offered by the Chinese AI startup. These flaws are considered more severe than a previous security issue that exposed chat history and sensitive data due to a lack of database authentication. However, the company didn’t fully disclose the extent of the new vulnerabilities and their potential impact.The security flaws in DeepSeek’s iPhone app were discovered by the mobile security company NowSecure. One of the vulnerabilities includes the lack of Apple’s built-in App Transport Security (ATS). ATS is meant to protect sensitive personal data by ensuring it is transmitted only over encrypted channels. The company claims to have discovered that DeepSeek had disabled this feature on its iPhone app.NowSecure said in a blog post.The company said that even though the exposed data may seem harmless, it can be easily combined to reveal a user's identity.the company added.NowSecure also noted that even though DeepSeek does encrypt data, it uses an outdated method that is known to have security flaws.the company continued.Moreover, the company also said that the data gathered by DeepSeek’s iPhone app can help identify potential targets for spying.the company explained.",The DeepSeek app has been popular among iPhone users since its launch and even topped the App Store charts in the US.

RBI has a new plan to protect you from banking frauds: Change in website domain names for banks and NBFCs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/rbi-has-a-new-plan-to-protect-you-from-banking-frauds-change-in-website-domain-names-for-banks-and-nbfcs/articleshow/118021906.cms,"What RBI governor said about the new domain names



“Increased instances of fraud in digital payments are a significant concern. To combat the same, the RBI is introducing the 'bank.in' exclusive Internet Domain for Indian banks. This initiative aims to reduce cyber security threats and malicious activities like phishing; and, streamline secure financial services, thereby enhancing trust in digital banking and payment services. The Institute for Development and Research in Banking’ Technology (IDRBT) will act as the exclusive registrar. The actual registrations will commence from April 2025. Detailed guidelines for banks will be issued separately. Going forward, it is planned to have an exclusive domain viz., “fin.in” for other non-bank entities in the financial sector.""

“The surge in digital frauds is a matter of concern, warranting action by all stakeholders. The Reserve Bank has been taking various measures to enhance digital security in the banking and payments system. Introduction of

Additional Factor of Authentication

(AFA) for domestic digital payments is one such measure. It is proposed to extend AFA to online international digital payments made to offshore merchants, who are enabled for such authentication,”

""Introduction of Additional Factor of Authentication (AFA) for digital payments has enhanced the safety of transactions which, in turn, provided confidence to customers to adopt digital payments. This requirement, however, is mandatory for domestic transactions only. In order to provide a similar level of safety for online international transactions using cards issued in India, it is proposed to enable AFA for international card not present (online) transactions as well. This will provide an additional layer of security in cases where the overseas merchant is enabled for AFA. Draft circular will be issued shortly for feedback from stakeholders.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk-led task force – Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ) recently announced the cancellation of 20 consulting contracts on February 3, primarily related to ""strategic communication"" and ""executive coaching,"" resulting in a $26 million savings for taxpayers.Announcing the same on X (formerly known as Twitter), it wrote “This morning, 20 consulting contracts, mostly focused on “strategic communication” and “executive coaching,” were terminated for immediate savings of $26mm.”Quoting the post, the Tesla CEO wrote “Another description for these types of payments is ‘ money laundering ’,”.President Donald Trump established the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) through an executive order, appointing the billionaire Elon Musk to lead the initiative. DOGE's primary objective is to modernize and streamline federal operations, aiming to reduce government spending and enhance productivity.The department has reportedly been granted access to sensitive data from agencies such as the Treasury Department, focusing on identifying and eliminating waste and fraud. However, this access has raised concerns among Democratic lawmakers and watchdog groups regarding potential privacy violations and the extent of DOGE's authority.Talking about DOGE, Democrat leader Chuck Schumer recently said, ""The American people will not stand for an un-elected secret group to run rampant through the executive branch. Being innovative is good, but Mr. Musk, this isn't a tech startup. These are public institutions.""Elon Musk replied wrote, ""He’s mad that @DOGE is dismantling the radical-left shadow government in full view of the public.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes the cost of inference will come down which will make it easier for companies to be able to infuse all their applications with inference and with generative AI.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.

UK orders Apple to create 'back door' for access to encrypted user data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uk-orders-apple-to-create-back-door-for-access-to-encrypted-user-data/articleshow/118018874.cms,"Apple rejects FBI’s ‘back door’ request

The UK government has reportedly demanded that Apple create a ""back door"" to allow British security officials access to all content uploaded to the cloud by any Apple user worldwide. The UK’s office of the Home Secretary is said to have served Apple with a document called a technical capability notice, ordering it to provide the access.Citing people familiar with the matter, The Washington Post reported that the “technical capability notice” issued last month, orders the company to provide access to fully encrypted user data under the Investigatory Powers Act of 2016.The report noted that rather than compromise the security and privacy of its users globally, Apple is likely to stop offering encrypted cloud storage in the UK. However, this concession would not satisfy the UK's demand for access to data stored in other countries, including the US.Apple can appeal the order, but the law does not allow for a delay in compliance during the appeal process. In March, Apple expressed its opposition to such a requirement, stating that the UK government should not have the authority to undermine the security benefits of end-to-end encryption for users worldwide.The UK Home Office has reportedly declined to comment on the matter, stating that it does not discuss operational matters or technical demands.In 2016, Apple announced its intention to oppose a court order compelling the company to assist the FBI in unlocking the iPhone of the San Bernardino shooter, citing concerns about the potential threat to the privacy of millions of users.“Opposing this order is not something we take lightly. We feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the US government,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an open letter. The FBI sought information stored on the shooter’s employer-issued iPhone as part of its investigation into the shootings that resulted in the deaths of 14 people.Apple introduced full encryption with iOS 8 to enhance user privacy and security. This encryption prevents Apple from accessing user data, even when compelled by law enforcement.","UK government reportedly demands Apple create a ""back door"" to allow security officials access to all content uploaded to the cloud by any Apple user worldwide.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it

The New York Times made history on February 15, 1942, by publishing its first crossword puzzle in the Sunday Magazine. Created by Charles Erlenkotter and edited by Margaret Farrar, this marked the paper as the first major U.S. publication to feature a crossword. The decision sparked a cultural shift, making puzzles a beloved pastime for readers. Over the decades, the NYT has expanded its puzzle offerings to include the Mini Crossword (2014) and popular games such as Spelling Bee, Letter Boxed, and Tiles. In 2022, the paper acquired Wordle, which became a global sensation. Building on this momentum, it later introduced games like Connections and Strands, capturing the interest of a growing community of players worldwide. The NYT continues to innovate in the puzzle space, cementing its position as a leader in engaging, mind-challenging entertainment for people of all ages and backgrounds, uniting puzzle enthusiasts across the globe.Having trouble solving today’s NYT Strands puzzle?

Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath want you to know this about SEBI’s new circular on API usage and algorithmic trading,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamath-want-you-to-know-this-about-sebis-new-circular-on-api-usage-and-algorithmic-trading/articleshow/118020989.cms,"Take a look at the post here



“The SEBI circular on

API usage

and algo trading is out. What you need to know:

If you’re a retail trader using broker APIs to automate trades, you can do so as long as your order frequency is below an exchange-prescribed threshold. This limit is yet to be decided.

If you’re selling algos or strategies to other traders, you’ll need to partner with a broker and get yourself registered with the exchanges to do so.

Marketplaces, where people share algos for a fee, can’t publish strategies without exchange registration as well as an RA license.

The exchanges will publish their own circulars with operational details by April 1.”

SEBI's latest ALGO trading rules | The Daily Brief #163

What SEBI’s new algo trading rules say



Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India 's (SEBI) new rules. In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Kamath explained SEBI ’s new regulations concerning algorithmic trading for retail investors, a move that significantly alters market participation. Kamath highlighted that retail traders selling trading strategies or algorithms must now partner with a broker and register with stock exchanges. Furthermore, platforms facilitating the sharing of algorithms for a fee will need both exchange registration and a research analyst (RA) licence.In the X post, Kamath wrote:In the comment section of the post, he also shared the link to an article which explains the latest SEBI algo trading regulations in details.SEBI’s newly announced framework will allow retail investors to engage in algo trading—an opportunity previously limited to institutional players. The move comes in response to rising demand from retail participants and aims to strike a balance between accessibility and risk management.Under the updated regulations, brokers must secure exchange approval for each algorithm and ensure that all automated orders include a unique identifier for audit tracking. Any modifications to an approved algorithm will also require regulatory clearance. Retail investors developing their algorithms will only need to register them if their order execution frequency exceeds a specified threshold.SEBI has categorised algorithms into two types: “white box” algos, where the logic is transparent and replicable, and “black box” algos, which operate without disclosure. Providers of black box algos will be required to obtain a Research Analyst (RA) license and maintain detailed research documentation.Set to take effect on August 1, these new rules are expected to transform India’s algo trading landscape—expanding automation for retail traders while introducing stricter compliance measures to uphold market integrity .","Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India's new rules.

Akash Bobba , a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). Bobba, along with five other young engineers, was hired by Musk to modernise government systems, raising concerns about their lack of government experience and the potential security risks involved.Bobba, a graduate of UC Berkeley's elite Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (MET) program, has quickly risen through the ranks of Silicon Valley , securing internships at Meta, Palantir, and Bridgewater Associates.Known for his problem-solving skills, Bobba once rewrote an entire project overnight after a teammate accidentally deleted it just before a deadline. His former classmate Charis Zhang recalled the incident.“Let me tell you something about Akash. During a project at Berkeley, I accidentally deleted our entire codebase 2 days before the deadline. I panicked. Akash just stared at the screen, shrugged, and rewrote everything from scratch in one night—better than before. We submitted early and got first in the class. Many such stories. I trust him with everything I own,” wrote Zhang in a social media post.Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate. Critics argue that granting individuals with limited government experience access to sensitive government systems poses significant security risks. The hiring strategy has also raised questions about the competence and oversight within Musk's DOGE initiative. Reports suggest that at least four of the new DOGE hires, including Bobba, now have top-tier access to federal IT systems.Bobba isn't the only new face in Musk's government overhaul. The five other members of the DOGE team comprise a mix of recent graduates, college students, and former SpaceX interns, all of whom now have official government emails and top-level security clearances.","Akash Bobba, a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE) Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate.

Asmita Patel accused of re-routing money

Securities & Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has seized Rs 53.67 crore from Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd along with five other entities.

Asmita Patel is also at risk of losing another Rs 104.6 crore it collected from course fees, which SEBI believes were part of unregistered advisory services.”The investigation was initiated by SEBI after receiving complaints from 42 participants of these courses. In addition to impounding the Rs 53.67 crore, SEBI has issued a show-cause notice questioning why Rs 104.6 crore, collected as fees for various programs, should not also be seized.SEBI has sent an interim order directing the school, Asmita Jitesh Patel, and Jitesh Jethalal Patel to cease offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services. The entities have also been barred from accessing the securities market.The order also uncovered that fees collected from participants were routed through entities such as King Traders (proprietor: Sagar Dhanjibhai), Gemini Enterprise (proprietor: Suresh Parmashivam), and United Enterprises (proprietor: Jigar Rameshbhai Dawada). SEBI stated that this was a regular practice and not an isolated incident, making all six entities jointly and severally liable for the Rs 53.67 crore earned from course fees.The regulator further demanded that the notices explain why they should not be ordered to disgorge Rs 104.6 crore, along with interest. SEBI's order noted that the fees collected for LMIT, MPAT, and OM courses, as well as other programs provided by the school, were earned under the guise of unregistered advisory and research analyst services.The order reads, “The aforesaid amount includes not only the amount collected as fees by the Noticees for LMIT, MPAT and Options Multiplier (OM) courses but also includes the fees collected by the Noticees for the other courses offered by the Noticee no.1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading )through which it carried out unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services along with interest”.Kamlesh Varshney, SEBI's Whole-Time Member, highlighted in the order “Examination revealed that, prima facie, the Noticee no. 1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading) along with the Noticee no.2 (Asmita Jitesh Patel) and the Notice no.3 (Jitesh Jethalal Patel) devised a scheme wherein students/investors/participants were lured to trade in specific stocks and told to open trading account with ABC Ltd.

3 Answers Google HR head gave to employees in memo as the company ends diversity hiring goals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/3-answers-google-hr-head-gave-to-employees-in-memo-as-the-company-ends-diversity-hiring-goals/articleshow/118001657.cms,"Read the full memo

With new U.S. Executive Orders, court decisions, and many companies making changes to their DEl programs in recent weeks, we sat down with Fiona Cicconi to learn how Google is thinking about this.

Can you tell us how we’re thinking about this across the company?

First, I want to be clear: we’ve always been committed to creating a workplace where we hire the best people wherever we operate, create an environment where everyone can thrive, and treat everyone fairly. That’s exactly what you can expect to see going forward. Our users come from all across the U.S. and around the world, and we serve them better when our employees do, too.

Every year, we review the programs designed to help us get there and make changes. And because we are a federal contractor, our teams are also evaluating changes to our programs required to comply with recent court decisions and U.S. Executive Orders on this topic. For example, in 2020, we set aspirational hiring goals and focused on growing our offices outside California and New York to improve representation. We’ll continue to invest in states across the U.S. — and in many countries globally — but in the future we will no longer have aspirational goals.

You mentioned we’ll evaluate our programs. Can you share more about that?

Melonie Parker and her team will lead on closely and carefully evaluating programs, trainings, and initiatives, and will update them as needed — including those that raise risk, or that aren’t as impactful as we’d hoped. She’ll work with senior leaders across the company.

And is there anything else you want Googlers to know now?

While there will be changes, our central Employee Resource Groups will remain, as will our work with colleges and universities, and our work to build products to help all our users and partners. That is all vital work for our business and our Googler community.

Statement omitted from SEC filing

Google not only company to end DEI program

Google is removing its previous goal of increasing hires from underrepresented groups and is reevaluating some of its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, reports Reuters. In a memo, Google-parent Alphabet's Chief People Officer Fiona Cicconi, said “In 2020, we set ambitious hiring goals and aimed to expand representation by growing offices outside California and New York”.“However, moving forward, we will no longer set aspirational goals.”Additionally, Google is assessing changes to its policies in response to federal guidelines introduced during Donald Trump's presidency, which sought to limit DEI efforts in government and among federal contractors.""Because we are a federal contractor, our teams are also evaluating changes to our programs required to comply with recent court decisions and U.S. Executive Orders on this topic,"" Cicconi said in the email.Despite these shifts, Google stated it would maintain internal employee groups like ""Trans at Google,"" ""Black Googler Network,"" and the ""Disability Alliance,"" which contribute to product and policy decisions.In its latest annual filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Alphabet also omitted a statement previously included in reports from 2021 to 2024, which read that the company is ""committed to making diversity, equity and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve.” A company spokesperson explained that the line was removed as part of its review of DEI initiatives .For years, Google had been a leading advocate for inclusive policies, especially following the 2020 protests against the police killings of George Floyd and other Black Americans. That same year, CEO Sundar Pichai announced a target for 30% of Google's leadership to come from underrepresented groups by 2025. At the time, 96% of the company’s US leaders were white or Asian, and 73% of leaders globally were men.Other major companies are also scaling back DEI programs. In January, Meta, Facebook's parent company, announced it was discontinuing some DEI initiatives, including those related to hiring, training, and supplier selection. Similarly, Amazon stated in an internal memo that it was phasing out ""outdated programs and materials"" tied to diversity and inclusion.","Google is removing its previous goal of increasing hires from underrepresented groups.

Here’s the full text of her post

This 'why do you care about a tiny fraction of the population?' line is, and always was, utterly ridiculous.

Gender ideology has undermined

freedom of speech

, scientific truth, gay rights, and women's and girls' safety, privacy and dignity. It's also caused irreparable physical damage to vulnerable kids.

Nobody voted for it, the vast majority of people disagree with it, yet it has been imposed, top down, by politicians, healthcare bodies, academia, sections of the media, celebrities and even the police. Its activists have threatened and enacted violence on those who've dared oppose it. People have been defamed and discriminated against for questioning it. Jobs have been lost and lives have been ruined, all for the crime of knowing that sex is real and matters.

When the smoke clears, it will be only too evident that this was never about a so-called vulnerable minority, notwithstanding the fact that some very vulnerable people have been harmed. The power dynamics underpinning our society have been reinforced, not dismantled. The loudest voices throughout this entire fiasco have been people insulated from consequences by their wealth and/or status. They aren't likely to find themselves locked in a prison cell with a 6'4"" rapist who's decided his name's now Dolores. They don't need state-funded rape crisis centres, nor do they ever frequent high street changing rooms. They simper from talk show sofas about those nasty far-right bigots who don't want penises swinging around the girls' showers, secure in the knowledge that their private pool remains the safe place it always was.

Those who've benefited most from gender identity ideology are men, both trans-identified and not. Some have been rewarded for having a cross-dressing kink by access to all spaces previously reserved for women. Others have parlayed their delicious new victim status into an excuse to threaten, assault and harass women. Non-trans-identified leftybros have found a magnificent platform from which to display their own impeccably progressive credentials, by jeering and sneering at the needs of women and girls, all while patting themselves on the back for giving away rights that aren't theirs.

The actual victims in this mess have been women and children, especially the most vulnerable, gay people who've resisted the movement and paid a horrible price, and regular people working in environments where one misplaced pronoun could see you vilified or constructively dismissed. Do not tell me this is about a tiny minority.

“I didn’t vote for Elon Musk and his autistic tech bros to get a line-item veto on federal spending!”

Yeah well I didn’t vote for Joe Biden’s non-binary Deep State theater kids to get a blank check to give my tax dollars to fringe left-wing NGO slush funds for four years, but that’s exactly what happened.

Elections have consequences, one of which being the president of the United States—the CEO of the executive branch—gets to make personnel appointments across the administrative state.

Don’t like it? You’ve got two options:

1. Reduce the size, scope, and power of the administrative state. I promise, you’d garner bipartisan support and find willing allies across the political spectrum here. (For some reason, though, Democrats don’t seem to like this idea. Curious. 🤔)

2. Don’t lose the election. Don’t spend four years mismanaging the country and lying to the American people about the president’s health, only to swap him out in the election for a weak, untested, unlikeable candidate who wastes billions of dollars on the poorest-run campaign in modern history.

Either way, stop complaining about Elon. We DID vote for this. We returned Trump to office with a strong mandate specifically to end this bullshit. If you don’t like the means—or the personnel choices—by which he’s doing so, that’s on you, not us,"" wrote Sterling.

DeepSeek has an ‘API request’ for its customers: “…please understand!”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/deepseek-has-an-api-request-for-its-customers-please-understand/articleshow/117987906.cms,"Why DeepSeek is popular

DeepSeek, the Chinese AI startup that recently caused a stir in the tech world, has a request for its customers. The company said that it is experiencing such high demand for its services that it's running out of server capacity. To manage this, they've temporarily restricted access to their application programming interface (API).According to a report by Bloomberg, DeepSeek has temporarily suspended the ability for customers to add more credits to their API accounts to prevent broader service disruptions. This means new users might have to wait to access the API, and existing users will need to manage their usage with their current credit balance.An API allows developers to integrate DeepSeek's AI models into their own applications and services. It’s essentially a way for others to access and utilise DeepSeek's technology.“The existing recharge amount can continue to be used, please understand!” the company said.DeepSeek is reportedly experiencing a surge in demand for its API services. This increased demand is putting a strain on their servers, which are struggling to keep up.DeepSeek’s services have been overwhelmed, likely due to the recent launch of its new models and their competitive pricing. In January, the company unveiled an AI chatbot that it claimed can rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT and was developed at a fraction of the cost of competing products.The company previously restricted signups for new users to people with a mainland China telephone number. DeepSeek also said that discounts for access to its model will end on February 8.Meanwhile, a bunch of countries have already banned the use of the DeepSeek AI model in various capacities. For example, Italy, Australia and Taiwan have banned the use of the chatbot. South Korea has asked government officials to not use DeepSeek chatbot on work devices and India has also warned against using it on official devices.","DeepSeek has temporarily suspended the ability for customers to add more credits to their API accounts.

ByteDance OmniHuman-1 sample

What ByteDance researchers said about OmniHuman-1



TikTok parent ByteDance has developed a new AI model called OmniHuman-1 . The latest model can generate realistic videos from photos and sound bites. This comes after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI expanded access to its video-generation tool, Sora, making it available to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users in December 2024. Last year, Google DeepMind also announced its Veo model which can create “high-quality, high-definition videos based on text or image prompts in a wide range of cinematic and visual styles with exceptional speed.” However, both OpenAI and Google's models that turn photos into videos are still not available to the public.In a paper (seen by the South China Morning Post), the ByteDance team behind OmniHuman-1 claimed that the multimodal model excels at creating videos of people speaking, singing, and moving with a quality “significantly outperforming existing audio-conditioned human video-generation methods”. While OmniHuman-1 has not yet been publicly released, sample videos have generated significant buzz online. One of the demo videos shows a 23-second clip of Albert Einstein giving a speech that was shared on YouTube.In a recently published technical paper, ByteDance researchers Lin Gaojie, Jiang Jianwen, Yang Jiaqi, Zheng Zerong, and Liang Chao introduced a new training strategy that integrates diverse datasets of text, audio and movement to enhance video-generation models. With this approach, the company aims to tackle challenges faced by global researchers in scaling such models.ByteDance also claimed that its method advances conventional video generation without directly naming competing AI tools. The researchers highlighted that their data-mixing approach allows for realistic video generation across various aspect ratios and body proportions, ranging from close-up facial shots to full-body visuals.The generated clips exhibit detailed facial expressions synchronised with audio, along with natural head and gesture movements, potentially enabling broader real-world applications.Among the sample videos released, one features a man delivering a TED Talk-style speech with lifelike hand gestures and synchronised lip movements, making it nearly indistinguishable from a real recording, the report adds.",TikTok parent ByteDance has developed a new AI model called OmniHuman-1.

AI researchers develop 'reasoning' model for under $50 like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-researchers-develop-reasoning-model-for-under-50-like-openais-o1-and-deepseeks-r1/articleshow/117986776.cms,"How researchers developed reasoning model

A team of AI researchers from Stanford University and the University of Washington have achieved a breakthrough in AI development by training a sophisticated “reasoning” model for less than $50 in cloud compute credits. Researchers used AI models by Google, Alibaba to create a chatbot with reasoning level as good as the ChatGPT-maker OpenAI ’s o1 LLMs.The model, named s1, is claimed to exhibit performance comparable to cutting-edge reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1 on tests evaluating math and coding abilities. The s1 model , along with the data and code used in its training, has been made available on GitHub.The researchers behind s1 said that they utilised a readily available base model and refined it through a process known as distillation – a technique that involves extracting the “reasoning” capabilities from another AI model by training s1 on its answers.The researchers claim that their model s1 has been distilled from Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model. This approach mirrors the method used by Berkeley researchers who created an AI reasoning model for around $450 last month.The researchers behind s1 aimed to identify the simplest approach to achieve strong reasoning performance and ""test-time scaling,"" which allows an AI model to deliberate more before generating a response.“Test-time scaling is a promising new approach to language modeling that uses extra test-time compute to improve performance,” the researchers said in their paper published last week (via TechCrunch), adding that they “seek the simplest approach to achieve test-time scaling and strong reasoning performance.”The s1 research suggests that reasoning models can be effectively distilled using a relatively small dataset and a process called supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where an AI model is explicitly trained to mimic specific behaviors in the dataset.“First, we curate a small dataset s1K of 1,000 questions paired with reasoning traces relying on three criteria we validate through ablations: difficulty, diversity, and quality. Second, we develop budget forcing to control test-time compute by forcefully terminating the model’s thinking process or lengthening it by appending “Wait” multiple times to the model’s generation when it tries to end. This can lead the model to doublecheck its answer, often fixing incorrect reasoning steps,” the researchers said.","Researchers from Stanford University and the University of Washington have created a sophisticated reasoning model for less than $50 in cloud compute credits.

Zomato gets 'Eternal' as new name; CEO Deepinder Goyal says: It scares me to my core because ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zomato-gets-eternal-as-new-name-ceo-deepinder-goyal-says-it-scares-me-to-my-core-because-/articleshow/117985844.cms,"Take a look at the post here



What Zomato CEO said about changing the company name



“Dear fellow shareholders,

A few weeks ago, on December 23rd, we entered the BSE Sensex. Coincidentally, that was exactly the day I started writing the first line of code for Zomato — then Foodiebay — seventeen years ago, in 2007. Becoming the first tech startup in India to make it to the Sensex is a moment of pride and also a moment of reflection, bringing with it a heightened sense of responsibility — responsibility towards the people we serve, the people who build with us, and the country we live in.

In many ways, we feel like we’ve broken some ice. In a world where success often seems reserved for the privileged, we have shown that people from ordinary backgrounds, armed with nothing but conviction and hard work, can come together, defy the odds, create large-scale impact, and, in under two decades, build one of the top thirty listed companies in India. This journey has created tremendous wealth — not just for me, but for our employees, institutional investors, and retail shareholders. But I did not start Zomato to make money. I started it because I wanted to do something worthwhile with my life. One weekend, I went around town, collected takeaway menus, and uploaded them onto a website — purely in the spirit of service. I never thought it could be a business. I wasn’t looking for revenue. I was simply trying to be helpful.

Zomato is an accidental company. It was born out of a simple desire to serve, and over time, it became a business. And the journey has been nothing short of extraordinary. Our work has created millions of direct and indirect jobs. It endears my heart when our delivery partners, restaurant partners, and store partners tell me how we empower them, to make more money, to have more freedom, and to better provide for their families. A lot of them tell me that they are now able to send their kids to better schools, and are able to keep them in those schools, which was sometimes not possible earlier. They tell me that their life is more full of hope than what it used to be.

I am a student of system design thinking, and one of the goals for me at Zomato has been to design an organisation that lasts beyond its current set of leaders – an organisation where culture drives outcomes, more than strategy; something that is an institution in itself, and not just a company.

We shape our institutions, and then they shape us. But institutions are not just legal entities, groups of people, or physical structures; they are also the mental models and paradigms within which we operate. One such paradigm, often overlooked in shaping a company’s future, is its name.

When we acquired Blinkit, we started using “Eternal” (instead of Zomato) internally to distinguish between the company and the brand/app. We also thought that we would publicly rename the company to Eternal, the day something beyond Zomato became a significant driver of our future. Today, with Blinkit, I feel we are there. We would like to rename Zomato Ltd., the company (not the brand/app), to Eternal Ltd.

Eternal is a powerful name, and to be honest, it scares me to my core. It is a tall order to live up to. Because ‘Eternal’ carries both a promise and a paradox. True permanence isn’t built on bold claims of invincibility or the swagger of success. It is forged in the quiet understanding that our immortality stems from our mortality — because the day we think we will last forever simply because we declare it, we begin our end.

To work at Eternal will be to wake up every day knowing that our forever is earned in moments of self-doubt, in acknowledging our limitations, in our constant hunger to be better than we were yesterday.

This isn’t just a name change; it is a mission statement. A reminder etched into our identity that we will endure — not because we are here, but because we need to get there.

Our Board has approved this change today and I request our shareholders to also support this change. If and when it is approved, our corporate website will transition from zomato.com to eternal.com. We will also change our stock ticker from ZOMATO to ETERNAL. Eternal will comprise four major businesses (as of now) – Zomato, Blinkit, District, and Hyperpure.

A company has multiple founding moments, and I hope this change is another one in our journey into the future.

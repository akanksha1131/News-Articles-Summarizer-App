"Elderly woman loses Rs 50,000 in money transfer scam: What is this online scam targeting senior citizens and how to stay safe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elderly-woman-loses-rs-50000-in-money-transfer-scam-what-is-this-online-scam-targeting-senior-citizens-and-how-to-stay-safe/articleshow/114849231.cms,"What is money transferring scam?

How these scams work:

Impersonation: Scammers often impersonate trusted individuals like family members, bank officials, or government authorities. Urgency tactics: They create a sense of urgency, claiming that immediate action is required to avoid financial loss or legal trouble. Manipulative techniques: Scammers use emotional manipulation to persuade victims to transfer money or share sensitive information. Complex schemes: Some scams involve elaborate schemes with multiple stages, making it difficult for victims to identify the fraud.

How to protect yourself:

Educate yourself: Stay informed about the latest scams and techniques used by fraudsters. Verify information: Never share personal or financial information with anyone unless you're absolutely certain of their identity. Be wary of urgent requests: If someone is pressuring you to transfer money immediately, be cautious and verify the request through independent channels. Avoid clicking suspicious links: Don't click on links in emails or messages from unknown senders. Use strong passwords: Create strong, unique passwords for your online accounts and enable two-factor authentication. Be skeptical of unexpected calls and emails: If you receive an unexpected call or email asking for personal information or money, be wary and verify the sender's identity. Talk to trusted individuals: Discuss any suspicious activity with family members, friends, or financial advisors. Report scams: If you believe you've been a victim of a scam, report it to the local authorities and your bank.

Recently, a senior citizen from Noida, in her 60s, was recently targeted by a money transfer scam . The scammer, posing as a client of her husband, convinced her to transfer nearly Rs 50,000. Trusting the caller's familiarity with her husband's name, she proceeded with the transfers. However, before she could realise the scam, the transaction was complete, and the scammer's phone number was deactivated.Senior citizens are increasingly becoming targets of online scams , particularly those involving money transfers. These scams often exploit trust and vulnerability, resulting in significant financial losses for the victims.A money transfer scam is a type of fraud where a scammer tricks a victim into transferring money to their account. These scams often rely on social engineering tactics, such as phishing emails, phone calls, or text messages, to deceive victims.","A money transfer scam is a type of fraud where a scammer tricks a victim into transferring money to their account.

​How this Okta security flaw exposed accounts with long usernames,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-this-okta-security-flaw-exposed-accounts-with-long-usernames/articleshow/114893747.cms,"Take a look a the post here



How this security flaw can be a serious concern



Okta , has disclosed a vulnerability that allowed users to bypass password authentication under specific conditions. In its latest security advisory sent to its users, the identity and access management provider noted that the vulnerability affected accounts with usernames of 52 characters or more and required the presence of a stored cache key from a previous successful login. However, to access them without passwords, the account's owner had to have previous history of logging in using that browser. This notice was also shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter).This flaw, which was introduced in a July update, was discovered and fixed last month by the company. Okta also assured users that organisations requiring multi-factor authentication were not affected.A Forbes report cited the company which said: ““A precondition for this vulnerability is that the username must be or exceed 52 characters any time a cache key is generated for the user.”However, a 52-character username is easier to guess than a random password. It can be someone’s email address, containing their full name and their organisation’s domain. Its also important to note that suchlong usernames are also rare.This vulnerability also highlights a potential security risk for accounts with long usernames and a history of logins from the same browser. Okta has recommended users who meet these conditions to review their access logs for any unauthorised activity.Okta offers software that simplifies adding authentication services to apps for companies to provide a unified login experience across multiple apps. This saves end-users from the need to verify their identities separately for each one.The company hasn’t stated whether it knows of anyone affected by this particular issue but has earlier promised to ""communicate more rapidly with customers"" after the Lapsus$ threat group accessed a few user accounts.","Okta has disclosed a vulnerability that allowed users to bypass password authentication under specific conditions.

"'Father of the iPod' defends Apple's AI launch: People are like, “Apple's AI is meh, but….”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/father-of-the-ipod-defends-apples-ai-launch-people-are-like-apples-ai-is-meh-but-/articleshow/114892472.cms,"Tony Fadell, iPod creator, supports Apple's cautious AI rollout at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024. Fadell highlights its practical benefits, despite initial lukewarm reactions. The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 models feature early AI tools focusing on practical integration. Apple CEO Tim Cook notes rapid adoption of iOS 18.1, driven by new AI features, with further expansions planned.

Tony Fadell , former Apple executive and creator of the iPod , defended Apple's cautious approach to artificial intelligence . Speaking at the 2024 TechCrunch Disrupt conference, Fadell acknowledged the not-so-overwhelming first impressions but emphasised the strategy's long-term benefits.""People were like, 'I downloaded it,' and they were like, 'Apple's AI is meh,'"" Fadell said. ""But it works! And that's the thing you want — is you start building things that work, and you build on top of those and make better and better features.""The first wave of Apple Intelligence features, available on iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 models, includes writing tools, message summaries, and an enhanced Siri experience. Unlike competitors Google and Microsoft, which launched more ambitious AI products throughout the past year, Apple opted for a more measured rollout focusing on practical integrations and privacy.Fadell, who worked at Apple from 2001 to 2010, praised the company's decision to implement smaller AI models, noting that the approach ""doesn't require nuclear power"" — a reference to other tech giants' investments in nuclear energy to power their AI infrastructure.During Thursday's earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook revealed promising early adoption rates for iOS 18.1 , noting that its uptake in the first three days was double that of iOS 17.1 in the previous year. Cook attributed this surge to strong interest in Apple Intelligence features.The company plans to release additional AI capabilities in December, initially in US English before expanding to the UK, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand. Further language support is scheduled to roll out starting in April.""There's definitely interest out there for Apple Intelligence,"" Cook stated, suggesting the new features are proving to be a significant incentive for iPhone upgrades .","Tony Fadell, former Apple executive and creator of the iPod, defended Apple's cautious approach to artificial intelligence.

What is Canada's National Cyber Threat Assessment that blames India of 'likely spying',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-is-canadas-national-cyber-threat-assessment-that-blames-india-of-likely-spying/articleshow/114893210.cms,"India named for the first time in the cyber threat report

What the threat report claims about India

Indian government on the Canadian cyberthreat threat report

The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (Cyber Centre), part of the Communications Security Establishment Canada ( CSE ), recently released its National Cyber Threat Assessment 2025-2026 (NCTA 2025-2026).NCTA 2025-2026 claims to ""provide the Canadian public with CSE’s current insights on the state and non-state cyber threat actors conducting malicious cyber threat activity against Canada and how we assess the cyber threat landscape will evolve in the next two years."" The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (Cyber Centre) is Canada's technical authority on cyber security, and part of the Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSE).The report, whose last edition was issued two years ago, comes amid an escalating diplomatic row between the two countries. The relations between India and Canada are at their lowest following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 's allegations in September last year of a ""potential"" involvement of Indian agents in Khalistan extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar 's killing. The Indian government has rejected Trudeau's charges as ""absurd"".This is the first time that Canada has named India in a list of cyberthreat adversaries, suggesting that state-sponsored actors could be spying against it. Incidentally, there was no mention of India in the National Cyber Threat Assessment reports of 2018, 2020 and 2023-24.The report names India among the five countries that it terms ""state-sponsored actors"" likely engaged in cyberspying against Canada. India is ranked fifth in this list, the other four are: China, Russia, Iran and North Korea; ranked in the same order.“India's leadership almost certainly aspires to build a modernised cyber programme with domestic cyber capabilities. India very likely uses its cyber programme to advance its national security imperatives, including espionage, counterterrorism, and the country's efforts to promote its global status and counter narratives against India and the Indian government,” the assessment report said.“We assess that India's cyber programme likely leverages commercial cyber vendors to enhance its operations. We assess that Indian state-sponsored cyber threat actors likely conduct cyber threat activity against Government of Canada networks for the purpose of espionage,” it said further.“We judge that official bilateral relations between Canada and India will very likely drive Indian state-sponsored cyber threat activity against Canada,” it claimed.India has slammed Canada for naming it in the list of countries considered cyber threat ""adversaries"", describing the ""categorisation"" as another example of the Canadian strategy to ""attack"" the country. The Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""Another category, Canada has put India into. This categorisation is as per the cyber report that they have issued. It appears to be another example of a Canadian strategy to attack India."" While rejecting India being bracketed in that category, the MEA spokesperson said, ""You first state absurd and baseless things and then level such an accusation against us. This is absolutely not right"".","The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (Cyber Centre) recently released its National Cyber Threat Assessment 2025-2026.

Reliance enters in partnership with Nvidia

The 2024 Nvidia AI Summit in Mumbai saw Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar rubbing shoulders with Jensen Huang , CEO of AI giant Nvidia. While the summit focused on strengthening India's AI capabilities, their encounter ended with a surprising discussion – martial arts.Kumar, a known martial arts enthusiast, shared a photo on social media X, formerly known as Twitter, where he and Huang pose playfully in a fighting stance. The caption reads: ""Imagine meeting the world’s biggest authority on Artificial Intelligence and ending up chatting about martial arts!! What an amazing man you are Mr. #JensenHuang. Now I know why @nvidia is the absolute giant that it is. 😊👍🏻""Nvidia's leather-jacket-clad CEO Huang got a rock star welcome at the company's AI summit in India. As a Bloomberg report said, ""The reception Huang received in India's commercial capital Mumbai was reminiscent of the ""Jensanity"" seen in other parts of the world, especially Taiwan, as his popularity climbs with Nvidia's soaring earnings and multi-trillion dollar market valuation.""Huang praised India's rapid digitalisation and its potential in the AI sector. ""Very few countries have this amazing natural resource called IT and computer science expertise,"" he said.The event, where the U.S. company unveiled plans to supply Reliance Industries and other Indian firms with its AI chips, had to be reportedly delayed for more than half an hour due to the crowd that one Nvidia employee said was ""easily a few thousand"".Nvidia CEO Huang and Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced a strategic partnership to build state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India at the summit. The collaboration aims to accelerate India's transformation into a global AI powerhouse by leveraging the nation's vast talent pool and burgeoning digital infrastructure. ""We are among the only countries where the average age of 1.4 billion people is below 35,"" he noted. Ambani emphasised that India's aspirations, combined with the visionary leadership of the Indian Prime Minister, have set the stage for a digital revolution.

So, as that shift occurred, obviously, this became a bigger margin implication, both for Lunar Lake and for the company overall. But we were very pleased to have the option to scale Lunar Lake and higher volume because of the momentum energy around the AIPC category. That said, a volume product and a volume industry like the

PC industry

, you don't want to have volume memory going through that channel. It's not a good way to run the business.

So, it really is, for us, a one-off with Lunar Lake. That will not be the case with Panther Lake, Nova Lake and its successors as well. We'll build it in a more traditional way with memory off-package and the CPU, GPU, NPU and I/O capabilities in the package. But volume memory will be off-package in the road map going forward.

And we won't have this kind of impact that we're dealing with for '25 in the margin structure, specifically around Lunar Lake. But again, it's a great product and we're happy that we have it in the portfolio, and we've scaled it commensurate with the enthusiasm of the AIPC category.

Intel is reversing a major design decision in its laptop chips, CEO Pat Gelsinger has said. The change will come in the form of abandoning the on-package memory approach introduced with its Lunar Lake processors.During the earnings call, the company executives said that the Lunar Lake chip has the memory in the package that affects the gross margins.

New transaction limit and more

What is the auto top-up feature in UPI

Two new changes have come to UPI starting November 1. The National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) has introduced an auto top-up feature and increased transaction limits for UPI Lite , effective November 1, 2024, to streamline small-value digital payments.Under these new guidelines, users can now make transactions up to Rs 1,000 without entering a PIN, doubled from the previous limit of Rs 500. The maximum wallet balance limit has also been increased from Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000, though the daily transaction cap remains at Rs 4,000.The auto top-up feature automatically recharges a user's UPI Lite account when the balance falls below a predetermined threshold. Users can set their preferred top-up amount through their UPI app, with a limit of five automatic recharges per day.""This will support quick, PIN-less payments below Rs 500,"" said a statement from NPCI, which introduced the auto top-up functionality on August 27, 2024.To use the auto top-up feature, users need to set up a mandate through their UPI app, authorising automatic fund transfers from their bank account to their UPI Lite wallet. Users retain control with the option to cancel the mandate at any time.These enhancements will make UPI Lite more convenient for daily small-value transactions while maintaining security through transaction limits and controlled usage.In October 2024, NPCI recorded 16.58 billion UPI transactions totaling Rs 23.5 trillion. This marks a 10% increase in volume and 14% increase in value compared to September, driven primarily by person-to-merchant transactions during the festive season.","NPCI introduces an auto top-up feature and increased transaction limits for UPI Lite.

The report doesn’t reveal the exact number of employees that may get affected by the rumoured round of layoffs.This round of layoffs follows an unusual request made to X employees two months ago, where they were asked to submit one-page summaries highlighting their contributions to the company.

In the world of tech giants, few companies have shaped digital communication and online connectivity as significantly as Meta, formerly known as Facebook. Since its founding, Meta has grown from a small social networking site to a global powerhouse, expanding its reach through platforms like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus VR. Among those at the core of this evolution is Naomi Gleit, one of Meta’s longest-serving executives and its current head of product. Joining as the 29th employee when the company was still Facebook , Gleit has worked alongside CEO Mark Zuckerberg for nearly two decades, witnessing first hand his leadership style, personal growth, and evolving vision. Recently, Gleit shared insights into Zuckerberg’s leadership on “Lenny’s Podcast,” where she spoke about lessons learned from Zuckerberg, her experiences at Meta, and the unique aspects of the company’s culture.Naomi Gleit’s career at Meta began in the early days of Facebook, where she quickly became one of Zuckerberg’s most trusted employees. Joining as employee No. 29, Gleit’s tenure at Meta is second only to Zuckerberg. Over time, she has risen through the ranks to become the head of product, overseeing various critical aspects of Meta’s expansive product line. Her role provides her with a unique vantage point, allowing her to observe Zuckerberg’s leadership from close quarters. With a 19-year career alongside Zuckerberg, her experiences provide a rare, detailed look into the growth of Meta and Zuckerberg’s personal development as a leader.One of the standout qualities Gleit mentioned about Zuckerberg is his commitment to lifelong learning. She described him as a “learn-it-all” rather than a “know-it-all,” highlighting his exceptional ability to acquire new skills quickly. A well-known example is Zuckerberg’s dedication to learning Mandarin as part of his annual personal challenge. Within a year, he achieved proficiency equivalent to an eighth-grade level, an accomplishment that reflects his discipline and determination to broaden his abilities. This approach underlines Zuckerberg’s philosophy that success requires continuous improvement and adaptability.Gleit noted that Zuckerberg’s mindset toward learning isn’t limited to technical skills or languages; it also extends to leadership and interpersonal growth. He actively pursues feedback and advice, and applies these insights to refine his management style. This commitment has helped him adapt as the company grew, ensuring that he remains an effective leader amid the rapid changes in the tech landscape.During their time working together, Gleit and Zuckerberg have engaged in various mentorship initiatives. Roughly a decade ago, they co-taught a business-building course at an East Palo Alto middle school, where Zuckerberg shared a four-step approach to life. This philosophy is simple yet profound:Gleit highlighted that these steps illustrate key aspects of Zuckerberg’s outlook on life and leadership. This philosophy reflects the importance of self-acceptance and personal resilience before taking on the responsibility of leading others. For Zuckerberg, “focus on what you can control” is particularly crucial, as it encourages clarity and determination. Each of these steps continues to influence Zuckerberg’s management style, from how he makes executive decisions to his approach to Meta’s organisational challenges.A defining trait of Meta’s workplace culture is its emphasis on candid feedback, a value strongly upheld by Zuckerberg himself. According to Gleit, Zuckerberg actively fosters an environment where employees at all levels feel comfortable giving and receiving feedback. She emphasised the importance of honest feedback in ensuring that leaders remain grounded and connected to the reality of the business, especially as fame and success increase.Meta’s commitment to direct feedback has been demonstrated by Zuckerberg on several occasions. For example, he has been known to engage directly with his leadership team, challenging their ideas and pushing for deeper analysis. However, he also encourages open dialogue, ultimately valuing input from his team and, in many cases, adopting their suggestions. This feedback-driven culture ensures that Meta’s leadership remains transparent and connected with the broader team.Other executives at Meta, including CTO Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, have noted Zuckerberg’s unique approach to feedback. Bosworth explained that Zuckerberg often starts by questioning ideas presented to him, asking team members to defend their positions. This approach, known as “pressure testing,” helps refine ideas before they are implemented. Despite the rigorous questioning, Zuckerberg often accepts the team’s recommendations after thorough evaluation, highlighting his open-minded approach to leadership.Meta has undergone significant organisational shifts in recent years, including a major restructuring as part of Zuckerberg’s “year of efficiency” in 2023. This period involved changes to performance reviews and organisational hierarchies, aimed at creating a leaner and more focused company. Gleit pointed out that Zuckerberg’s emphasis on efficiency is part of a larger vision to ensure Meta’s long-term success in an increasingly competitive environment.As a part of this transition, Meta implemented tougher performance evaluations, leading to substantial layoffs and structural adjustments. Zuckerberg has addressed these changes publicly, often with blunt honesty, acknowledging that not all employees may be suited for the company’s evolving goals. His direct communication style aligns with his emphasis on transparency and his commitment to creating a culture of accountability within Meta.As Meta celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2024, Zuckerberg took the opportunity to reflect on the company’s legacy and his own growth as a leader. Looking back, he expressed some regret about allowing external opinions to shape public perception of Meta’s actions. He emphasised the importance of authenticity and the lessons he has learned from both criticism and support over the years. His reflections reveal a desire to present a more genuine image to the world, acknowledging the impact of his early experiences on his approach to public communication.","Naomi Gleit is the head of product at Meta, formerly known as Facebook.

Apple planning to buy Intel: What and why of rumours of Apple acquiring the 56-year-old chipmaker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-planning-to-buy-intel-what-and-why-of-rumours-of-apple-acquiring-the-56-year-old-chipmaker/articleshow/114861241.cms,"Why Apple may acquire Intel

A persistent rumour suggests Apple might be considering a shocking acquisition: Intel. As to how this Apple planning to buy Intel rumour started? They come from the tech YouTube channel 'Moore's Law is Dead', where Tom S. reported ""whispers"" of a potential purchase of Intel by Apple. He, at the same time, also claimed that Samsung too is interested in acquiring or merging with the chip manufacturer Intel.While this idea may seem utterly absurd to many, it would certainly be a dramatic twist in the long-running saga of the PC industry.Back in 2019, Apple did acquire Intel's modem division, but this new rumour proposes a full-scale takeover of the entire chipmaker. While Samsung is also mentioned as a potential buyer, it's Apple's involvement that piques the most interest, and perhaps a touch of amusement.Once a dominant force in the PC industry, Intel's fortunes have waned in recent years. The company has faced numerous challenges, from manufacturing delays to declining market share. Despite repeated promises of groundbreaking new processors, Intel has struggled to regain its former glory.Meanwhile, Apple has successfully transitioned away from Intel's chips, developing its own powerful Apple Silicon processors. These chips have consistently outperformed Intel's offerings, solidifying Apple's position in the tech industry. If Apple acquires Intel, the iPhone maker could free itself from an overreliance on TSMC for chips.Also, please note that the Youtuber Tom reiterates several times in the video that these are all rumours, and it's not clear if any purchase of Intel is actually in the works.","A persistent rumour suggests Apple might be considering a shocking acquisition: Intel.

In the fast-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), Meta Platforms, Inc. is positioning itself as a key player. During its recent third-quarter earnings call, Meta executives underscored their commitment to substantial AI investment, linking this focus to the company's robust quarterly financial performance. As per reports, the company’s revenue reached $40.59 billion, surpassing market expectations of $40.25 billion. CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributed this success to the strategic deployment of AI, which he believes has unlocked new growth avenues across Meta's core business. However, Zuckerberg also acknowledged that maintaining momentum requires considerable infrastructure investment, underlining AI’s significant role in Meta’s forward strategy.In the third quarter of 2024, Meta’s revenue climbed to $40.59 billion, exceeding analyst expectations of $40.25 billion. According to Zuckerberg, advancements in AI contributed significantly to this financial milestone. AI technology has improved Meta's products and services, enhancing user engagement and advertising efficiency. As a result, these improvements are contributing positively to the company's top-line growth.AI-driven capabilities have enabled Meta to personalise user experiences and deliver targeted advertisements more accurately. The company also reported that AI has enabled higher content relevance for users, a factor that keeps engagement levels high and improves advertising outcomes. These AI enhancements are likely to drive Meta’s future revenue by ensuring that products remain relevant and engaging for users.Meta’s 2024 capital expenditures are now projected between $38 billion and $40 billion, a modest increase over initial estimates. This investment is largely directed toward building the necessary infrastructure to support advanced AI initiatives. Executives explained that as Meta continues to scale its AI capabilities, substantial spending is required, particularly in areas such as data centres and computational resources.Meta has been heavily investing in expanding its fleet of GPUs, a critical resource for AI model training and deployment. By increasing its GPU collection, Meta aims to enhance its computational capacity, allowing it to run larger and more complex AI models. This move supports both current and future AI demands across Meta’s ecosystem of applications, from social media platforms to messaging services.AI has brought transformative changes to several areas within Meta’s core business operations. Zuckerberg emphasised the diverse ways AI advancements can support business growth, such as automating content generation, enhancing search functionalities, and refining recommendation algorithms. These applications enable Meta to provide a more seamless user experience, meeting customer needs more efficiently.Meta has also leveraged AI in content moderation, a significant area of investment given the scale of its user base. By automating parts of the moderation process, AI helps Meta swiftly identify and manage inappropriate or harmful content, ensuring a safer platform for users. This also reduces the reliance on human moderators, potentially lowering operating costs in the long run.Meta is committed to developing its proprietary AI models, a move that reflects the company’s desire for independence from third-party AI solutions. The Meta AI and Llama models are two prominent examples of the company’s in-house AI tools. These models have been designed to offer both general-purpose capabilities and specialised functions that can be incorporated into Meta’s consumer products.Meta AI powers various user-facing features, including personalised recommendations, while the Llama model focuses on understanding and processing natural language inputs. The adoption rate of these AI tools has been rapid, with users reportedly benefiting from enhanced performance and personalization across Meta’s platforms. By developing and deploying proprietary AI models, Meta is able to maintain greater control over its technological stack and fine-tune algorithms to meet the specific needs of its user base.The increase in Meta’s AI spending has raised questions among investors and financial analysts. However, industry experts generally agree that these investments are a long-term necessity. Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg noted that despite the high costs associated with AI, Meta’s strong Q3 revenue performance has provided reassurance to investors. According to Enberg, the company’s ability to consistently beat revenue forecasts suggests that AI investments are driving tangible returns.Nonetheless, Enberg cautioned that Meta must demonstrate effective cost management as it continues to scale its AI operations. This involves balancing the high expenses required for AI development with sustained revenue growth to justify ongoing capital expenditures. Ensuring transparency in financial reporting and outlining clear strategies for AI cost management may help to further alleviate investor concerns.Beyond its external-facing applications, Meta is deploying AI to streamline internal processes. CFO Susan Li highlighted how AI is enhancing employee productivity by assisting with tasks such as coding and internal content moderation. For instance, Meta has introduced AI-driven coding agents that help automate routine programming tasks, allowing engineers to focus on more complex and innovative work.Li reported that these internal AI tools are still in the early stages but have already shown promising results in improving employee efficiency. The company’s AI-powered assistance systems are helping to reduce operating costs by optimising workforce productivity. Over time, this approach may result in lower overhead costs, reinforcing the financial viability of Meta’s AI strategy.Looking ahead, Meta is committed to expanding its AI research and development efforts. The company’s strategic objectives include further refining its proprietary AI models, expanding its infrastructure, and exploring new AI applications to enhance user experience and operational efficiency. By maintaining a strong focus on AI, Meta aims to stay competitive in the tech industry, where AI capabilities increasingly define the market leaders.The company is expected to continue refining its AI applications in areas such as virtual and augmented reality, personalised content delivery, and advertising effectiveness. As Meta strengthens its AI infrastructure, it will be better positioned to innovate in these fields, potentially shaping the future of social media and digital interaction.","In the third quarter of 2024, Meta’s revenue climbed to $40.59 billion.

Google Maps has reached a new milestone and is getting three major updates, including the ones powered by its AI model Gemini. According to the company, Maps is now used by over 2 billion people monthly. Google CEO Sundar Pichai shared a post on X sharing the latest information.“Exciting week for @GoogleMaps. Hit the 2B monthly user mark, and now you can ask Maps more complex questions, thanks to Gemini’s creation, reasoning + summarization capabilities, grounded in our knowledge of 250M+ places around the world,” he said in a post on X“By using AI to analyse billions of images, alongside data from local partners and our community, we’re able to make over 100 million updates to the map every single day. So whether you’re travelling the world or across town, you’re seeing the most up-to-date information possible,” Google Maps said.Google has also announced that it is integrating its powerful Gemini AI models into Maps, enabling users to get more personalised recommendations, explore routes in greater detail, and receive answers to complex questions about their surroundings.With Gemini, users can now ask Maps open-ended questions like “things to do with friends at night” and receive curated recommendations tailored to their preferences. The AI can also summarise reviews, providing quick insights into what others like about a place.Additionally, users can ask detailed questions about specific locations, such as whether they offer outdoor seating or have a quiet atmosphere, and receive instant answers. Google says that these capabilities are powered by Gemini's advanced abilities combined with Google's database of over 250 million places and insights from the Maps community.These features start rolling out in the US on Android and iOS this week, and similar experiences are coming in the coming months on Search.Google Maps is also introducing a major update to its navigation features, aimed at making driving easier and more intuitive. Users can now explore points of interest along their route before starting their journey, including landmarks, attractions and dining options.Another feature that aims to enhance navigation is the information about clearer visuals of lanes, crosswalks, and road signs. This will help drivers anticipate upcoming manoeuvres or turns and avoid last-minute lane changes that usually cause jams. The update also includes the ability to see and report weather-related disruptions, such as flooded roads or low visibility conditions.Thirdly, arrival guidance has also been improved, with features like highlighted parking lots, parking reminders and walking directions from the car to the final destination. Users can even access Street View or AR walking navigation to quickly orient themselves upon arrival.These features will start rolling out globally on Android and iOS this week. Enhanced navigation starts rolling out next month on Android and iOS in over 30 metro areas.Immersive View, which provides AI-powered 3D visualisations of places and routes, is expanding to 150 cities globally. New categories of places, such as college campuses, are also being added, offering users a unique way to explore and experience locations virtually.","Google says Maps is now used by over 2 billion people monthly.

Satellite services provider, GlobalStar has announced that iPhone maker Apple has promised to invest an additional $1.1 billion in upfront infrastructure prepayments to expand its satellite capabilities. In a filing, (seen by StreetInsider.com) the company also noted that Apple will also acquire a 20% ownership stake in Globalstar for nearly $400 million. This news has sent Globalstar's stock price soaring and suggests that Apple has ambitious plans for its iPhone satellite features. Currently, iPhone users can send text messages over satellite when outside of cellular or Wi-Fi range, a feature introduced with iOS 18 .While Apple currently offers this feature for free, the company has indicated that it may eventually charge users for satellite services. The emergency feature is currently available in the US as well as a few other markets and is excepted to debut soon in India and more countries . This investment in Globalstar's infrastructure underscores Apple's commitment to expanding this feature to other countries as well as enhancing its satellite offerings for iPhone users.This feature allows users to contact emergency services and share their location via satellite when outside of cellular or Wi-Fi range. Initially launched with the iPhone 14 in 2022, the Emergency SOS feature was supposed to become a paid service in late 2024. However, Apple has extended its free satellite connectivity service for iPhones until 2025.While Apple has not yet revealed how much it will charge for satellite services, there is speculation that it may continue to offer Emergency SOS for free while charging for other features, such as location sharing in Find My or recreational texting. Other possibilities include bundling satellite service with Apple One or offering it as a mobile carrier add-on .Despite the uncertainty surrounding the feature’s pricing, users with an iPhone 14 or later can currently try out the satellite feature in demo mode by navigating to Settings -> Emergency SOS -> Emergency SOS via Satellite -> Try Demo.","Satellite services provider, GlobalStar has announced that iPhone maker Apple has promised to invest an additional $1.1 billion in upfront infrastructure prepayments to expand its satellite capabilities.

Microsoft delays Windows’ controversial 'Recall' feature for third time this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-delays-windows-controversial-recall-feature-for-third-time-this-year/articleshow/114845243.cms,"Microsoft has once again postponed the rollout of its AI-powered Recall feature for Copilot Plus PCs, pushing the launch from October to December, the company announced Tuesday.According to The Verge, Microsoft senior product manager Brandon LeBlanc said the delay would allow the company to ""deliver a secure and trusted experience"" and refine the feature before previewing it with Windows Insiders .This marks the third delay for Recall, which was originally scheduled to debut in June. The feature is designed to automatically capture screenshots of users' PC activities and allow them to search through their computer history using natural language queries.The repeated delays stem from significant privacy and security concerns raised when Microsoft first unveiled Recall in May. The feature initially stored user data in an unencrypted database and activated automatically without user consent .In response to the backlash, Microsoft has implemented several changes. The Verge reports that Recall will now be completely optional, requiring users to explicitly opt in. The company has also added encryption to the screenshot database and mandated Windows Hello authentication for accessing stored data.Users will have the ability to fully uninstall the feature and exclude specific applications, websites, and private browsing sessions from being captured. Microsoft is also implementing anti-malware protections, including rate-limiting measures to prevent abuse.Despite these modifications, questions remain about user interest in the feature when it eventually launches. The multiple delays and initial privacy concerns have dampened enthusiasm for what Microsoft had intended to be a flagship AI capability for its Copilot Plus PCs.Microsoft has committed to launching Recall for Windows Insiders by December, though given the feature's troubled history, further delays remain possible.","Microsoft has pushed back the launch of its Recall feature for Copilot Plus PCs.

What former US government tech advisor Sid Ghatak said about the $1 AI deals



“What does $1 really mean? Does that mean access to the open model and that compute will be charged incrementally?”

""So, there are all of those costs in terms of training, and then once you have built the model, does the government have to pay for inference whenever federal workers and contractors use it? Is there another incremental charge?""

“The government has to be really careful and understand what the fully loaded cost is of these solutions beyond the very attractive zero to $1 charge. These AI models are powerful engines, but they require really fantastic data to run cleanly and produce reliable output. The investment in that is something that needs to be understood,”

A former US government tech advisor has warned the Trump administration about the potentially high cost of OpenAI and Anthropic's ""$1-a-year deals."" Sid Ghatak, who served as tech advisor during the Biden administration, said that the US government should consider the hidden costs of implementing artificial intelligence (AI), which he believes could be significant. This comes after OpenAI and Anthropic recently announced they would provide federal workers with a year’s access to their AI models for a token fee of $1 per agency.In an interview with Business Insider, Ghatak cautioned that the government may need to allocate additional funds to train an AI model tailored to its specific requirements. He said,Ghatak added.He also noted that the expenses of using AI go beyond payments to companies like OpenAI and Google, as the government will also need to invest heavily in consolidating its data for AI.Ghatak explained.Ghatak, former GSA director (2020–2024) who helped shape Biden’s 2023 AI executive order and co-authored the government’s AI Maturity Model, later founded Increase Alpha, an AI-driven stock prediction platform.Apart from these deals, OpenAI has also been deepening its government ties. In June, the US Department of Defence revealed it had awarded the company a $200 million contract to build AI tools for national security use.","Sid Ghatak, who served as tech advisor during the Biden administration, said that the US government should consider the hidden costs of implementing artificial intelligence (AI) This comes after OpenAI and Anthropic recently announced they would provide federal workers with a year’s access to their AI models for a token fee of $1 per agency.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123857271,imgsize-17138,width-400,resizemode-4/indian-origin-former-us-government-tech-advisor-has-an-openai-warning.jpg"

Tencent Holdings – the Shenzhen-based gaming and messaging company – has reportedly hired a prominent artificial intelligence (AI) researcher from OpenAI , marking one of the most high-profile defections from the US AI sector to China. Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that Tencent recruited Yao Shunyu to work on integrating AI into its various services.Yao's LinkedIn profile shows he most recently worked at OpenAI after holding positions at Google, Microsoft IBM, and Princeton University. Local media reports suggested Yao was offered a compensation package of over 100 million yuan.In a post on its WeChat account, Tencent labeled a headline about the hiring as a “rumor” but did not specify which details were inaccurate.This move highlights the intense global competition for AI talent, with companies like Meta reportedly offering massive signing bonuses to top researchers.In June, reports said that four OpenAI researchers left the company to go to Meta. Shengjia Zhao, Shuchao Bi, Jiahui Yu and Hongyu Ren joined the Facebook parent company, Wired reported.

Sushila Karki becomes Nepal’s interim PM



Nepal social media ban and crisis explained





Soon after Nepal’s government social media ban led to violent protests and, eventually, a political collapse, more than 1,00,000 citizens converged on a chat app to select the country’s next interim leader, a report has said, adding that after a series of heated debates and polls, the group has settled around a single name: Sushila Karki, the country's former chief justice.According to a report by The New York Times, several Nepali citizens turned to Discord—a platform known for its gaming communities—to fill the political void left by the resignation of the prime minister.“The Parliament of Nepal right now is Discord,” said Sid Ghimiri, a 23-year-old content creator, describing the app’s pivotal role in the country’s political decision-making.The report said that the conversations within the Discord channel have become so influential that they are being discussed on national television.The group’s organisers, members of the civic organisation Hami Nepal, met with army chiefs who requested they propose a nominee for interim leader. Following hours of discussion, the Discord group nominated Sushila Karki, the report added.She has met with Nepal's president, Ram Chandra Poudel, and Army chief, Gen. Ashok Raj Sigdel, according to the group’s organisers. A moderator for the channel, Shaswot Lamichhane, noted that the group's goal was not to represent the entire country but to suggest a leader who could oversee new elections.Meanwhile, Karki was sworn in as Nepal’s PM and the swearing-in ceremony took place at the presidential residence in Shital Niwas.The selection of Karki follows a period of violent protest, which was sparked by former Prime Minister Oli's nationwide social media ban. It led to at least 51 deaths and more than 1,300 injuries as police clashed with demonstrators who defied curfews. The ban was widely viewed as an attempt to stifle dissent and control the flow of information.","Sushila Karki, the country's former chief justice, has been sworn in as Nepal's interim PM.

Facebook lawsuit settlement: How much will users get





Payments from Facebook’s $725 million privacy settlement are finally being distributed, with approved claimants set to receive money over the coming weeks. The settlement stems from lawsuits that accused the social media giant of improperly sharing users’ personal data with advertisers and third-party firms, most notably highlighted by the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal. For those unaware, millions of US users who had an active Facebook account between 2007 and 2022 were eligible to file claims in 2023. While Meta, Facebook’s parent company, denied wrongdoing, it agreed to the massive payout to resolve the cases.Millions of Facebook users who submitted valid claims last year are now receiving official confirmation emails from the “Facebook User Privacy Settlement Administrator.” These messages include a claimant ID number and confirm that payments are on the way.As mentioned above, eligible users needed to file a claim in the lawsuit by August 25, 2023 to receive the payment.The administrator said payouts started in September this year and will continue for the next 10 weeks. Claimants will also get an additional email 3–4 days before their payment is sent.The official settlement site says that people approved for a settlement payment will get an email about 3–4 days before the money is sent.While Facebook agreed to pay $725 million to settle the privacy lawsuit, users who filed claims will receive only a small share of that amount. Court filings show the average payment is $29.43, with the maximum reaching $38.36 for people who were active on Facebook for the full 15-year period covered. The final payout depends on how long each user maintained an active account during that window.The payout will be divided using “allocation points,” based on how many months a person used Facebook during the eligibility period from May 2007 to December 2022.",Payments from Facebook’s $725 million privacy settlement are finally being distributed. approved claimants are set to receive money over the coming weeks.

Albania is making an artificial intelligence-powered digital assistant named Diella its minister, the world's first artificial intelligence system to serve as a government minister, tasked with overseeing public procurement to eliminate corruption. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama announced the appointment this week, promising the AI minister will make Albania ""a country where public tenders are 100% free of corruption.Diella, meaning ""sun"" in Albanian, will manage all government contract decisions previously handled by human officials, ensuring complete transparency in public spending. The AI minister represents a radical shift from traditional governance, with Rama describing her as ""the first cabinet member who isn't physically present, but is virtually created by AI.""Diella originally launched in January as an AI-powered virtual assistant on Albania's e-Albania platform, helping citizens obtain government documents and services. Dressed in traditional Albanian attire, she has already processed 36,600 digital documents and provided nearly 1,000 services to users through voice commands and electronic stamps.The AI minister will now assume responsibility for evaluating and awarding all public tenders, with decisions transferred from human government officials in a ""step-by-step"" process.This represents a major shift in how governments worldwide might leverage artificial intelligence for governance.Public procurement has long been plagued by corruption scandals in Albania, a Balkan nation experts describe as a hub for international money laundering from drug and weapons trafficking.

Personal update: after 8 years at breakneck speed, I’ve made the very difficult decision to move on from Tesla.

I want to thank everyone I’ve worked with over the years at Tesla. People - this crazy lot of bright, humble, ambitious, hard-working people - are what makes Tesla special. I am thankful beyond words to the many colleagues and leaders I’ve worked with and learned from over the years.

Being the first Autobidder employee in Europe and helping scale the team and fleet across markets has been an unbelievable journey.

Since 2020, the Autobidder operational fleet in Europe went from 14 MWh (Holes Bay) to around 1.3 GWh (that’s ~100x), with more markets coming online (very) soon. Having helped bring on board many brilliant people over the past few years, I’m very excited about what’s next for Autobidder, in Europe and beyond.

Beyond Autobidder, joining Tesla Energy early on and contributing to its growth has been an immense privilege.

Along the journey, I got a chance to work on anything from microgrids on remote islands to VPPs across three continents.

It’s humbling to think how much the energy industry has evolved over these years. Storage went from being an afterthought to a key enabler of the transition to sustainable energy. When I joined in 2017, Tesla Energy deployed ~350 MWh of storage. Last year, in 2024, the figure was 31.4 GWh. That’s another 100x, and the growth is far from stopping.

It’s not just about volume though: storage is increasingly providing inverter-driven grid services that are key to operating low-carbon grids (grid-forming mode etc).

In addition to that, data and algorithms have taken center stage in the energy transition, which is a very exciting development for an energy/math/software wonk like me.

All this being said, I do need to address the elephant in the room: the main reason I’m leaving is that I think Elon has dealt huge damage to Tesla’s mission (and to the health of democratic institutions in several countries).

Beyond that, Elon’s leadership and decision making seem seriously compromised. Given his huge (and growing, inexplicably) stake in Tesla, I can’t convince myself anymore that this is the right place to be.

This is not just about politics: it’s about lying to the public, manipulating public discourse, targeting minorities and supporting climate change deniers and political forces aligned with the oil and gas industry.

I think it’s fairly indisputable that the current US administration is slowing down the energy transition. Unfortunately, speed is critical if we are to avert the worst consequences of climate change.

I wish the best to everyone who will stick around and keep working to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy, and I hope the best for Tesla and Tesla Energy.

As for myself, I’m taking some time off before embarking on a new adventure. Stay tuned for more updates.

Cheers,

Gio

Seven-year commitment addresses bundling practices and boosts market competition





Microsoft has successfully avoided a potentially hefty European Union fine, which could have amounted to billions of dollars, by agreeing to unbundle its Teams platform from Office productivity software and offer reduced pricing options. The European Commission says it accept Microsoft's commitments to address antitrust concerns, ending a years-long investigation that began with complaints from competitors.The case originated from a 2020 complaint filed by Salesforce-owned Slack, which accused Microsoft of illegally bundling Teams with Office 365 and Microsoft 365 to gain unfair competitive advantage. German competitor alfaview filed a similar complaint in 2023, intensifying regulatory scrutiny.Under the binding agreement, Microsoft will make Office 365 and Microsoft 365 versions available without Teams at prices reduced by 1 to 8 euros. The company has also committed to widening the price gap between bundled and unbundled versions by 50% for certain business-focused suites.The commitments extend beyond pricing changes. Microsoft must provide interoperability between competing communication tools and its products, allow customers to export Teams messaging data to rivals, and enable long-term license holders to switch to unbundled versions.Most commitments will remain in force for seven years, with interoperability and data portability requirements lasting 10 years. The remedies will be implemented globally, not just in Europe.""Today's decision opens up competition in this crucial market and ensures businesses can freely choose the communication and collaboration product that best suits their needs,"" said Teresa Ribera, the EU's executive vice-president for competitive transition.The agreement represents a more conciliatory approach from Microsoft, which previously faced 2.2 billion euros in EU fines for similar bundling practices. EU antitrust penalties can reach up to 10% of a company's global annual revenue, making this settlement a significant financial relief for the tech giant.",Microsoft agrees to unbundle Teams platform from Office productivity software. European Commission says it accept Microsoft's commitments to address antitrust concerns. Case originated from a 2020 complaint filed by Salesforce-owned Slack. Microsoft previously faced 2.2 billion euros in EU fines for similar bundling practices.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123852401,imgsize-25950,width-400,resizemode-4/file-image-microsoft.jpg"

iPhone’s iconic 9:41 AM timestamp: Why Apple ads always show this time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/iphones-iconic-941-am-timestamp-why-apple-ads-always-show-this-time/articleshow/123850315.cms,"The story behind Apple iPhone’s 9:41 AM timestamp

Apple Watch: A different tradition

More than just a number





If you’ve ever paid close attention to Apple ’s advertisements, you may have noticed a curious detail: the time displayed on iPhones, iPads, and even MacBooks is always set to 9:41 AM. This isn’t a random choice or a design accident; it’s a deliberate tradition rooted in one of the most important moments in Apple’s history. The timestamp is a subtle tribute to the exact minute when Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone to the world at MacWorld 2007. Over the years, it has evolved into a symbolic reminder of Apple’s attention to detail and the revolutionary moment that redefined technology.The tradition began during the MacWorld Expo in January 2007, where Steve Jobs carefully timed the iPhone reveal to occur around 40 minutes into his keynote presentation. Apple wanted the clock displayed on the giant screen to match the actual time in the auditorium. The first iPhone was revealed at 9:42 AM, but soon after, Apple adjusted this to 9:41 AM for precision and branding consistency.What started as a detail for one keynote soon became a global branding standard. Since the launch of the first iPad, Apple has consistently used 9:41 AM in all promotional images of iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks.This practice has become a subtle signature of the company’s identity, recognized instantly by Apple fans worldwide.Interestingly, Apple doesn’t use 9:41 for every product. The Apple Watch displays 10:09 in ads, echoing the watch industry’s tradition of using times like 10:10 for aesthetic symmetry. This small variation highlights how Apple blends industry customs with its own storytelling.To most people, 9:41 may seem like an arbitrary timestamp. But for Apple, it symbolises the historic moment when the world first saw the iPhone, an event that changed the way we communicate, work, and live. By repeating this detail in every ad, Apple keeps alive the memory of a turning point in tech history, making 9:41 an iconic part of its visual language. It serves as a constant reminder of how a single moment can reshape the future of technology.","The time displayed on iPhones, iPads, and even MacBooks is always set to 9:41 AM.

Republican Luna to Elon Musk on Charlie Kirk's assassination videos: No one should be ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/republican-luna-to-elon-musk-on-charlie-kirks-assassination-videos-no-one-should-be-/articleshow/123848048.cms,"



In the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) is calling on X owner Elon Musk to remove graphic videos of the killing from the social media platform. Kirk, the co-founder of Turning Point USA, was shot and killed Wednesday while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University. Videos of the assassination and the ensuing panic have since circulated widely online, prompting Luna to make a public plea on Twitter.""I am calling on @elonmusk, @finkd and @tiktok_us to remove the horrifying videos of Charlie Kirk’s murder,"" Luna wrote. ""He has a family, young children, and no one should be forced to relive this tragedy online.”The Florida lawmaker also expressed concern about the broader impact of such content. ""These are not the only graphic videos of horrifying murders circulating — at some point, social media begins to desensitize humanity,"" she added. ""We must still value life. Please take them down.""Another Republican lawmaker, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), voiced her support for the call. ""Thank you!!! I agree completely! I NEVER want to see that again!! I hate that I saw it at all,"" Boebert posted on X.The videos show Kirk being struck in the neck before collapsing to the floor. He was later pronounced dead.The search for the shooter is ongoing. Authorities in Utah initially detained two people, George Zinn and Zachariah Qureshi, but both were later released. According to the Utah Department of Public Safety (DPS), Zinn was charged with obstruction.State authorities believe the shooter fired from the roof of a building, targeting Kirk at a gazebo where he was addressing attendees.","Rep.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming industries, and the pharmaceutical sector is poised to be one of its most significant beneficiaries. In a recent Bloomberg Television interview, Demis Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind and Nobel laureate, revealed that AI could dramatically reduce drug discovery timelines, potentially cutting years of research down to mere months. DeepMind’s advanced AI models aim to streamline the identification of drug candidates, enhance precision, and reduce the high failure rates that have historically plagued pharmaceutical development. This breakthrough promises faster access to treatments, reduced costs, and a new era of medical research powered by computational intelligence.Traditional drug discovery involves painstaking laboratory experiments, lengthy clinical trials, and significant trial-and-error testing, often taking 10–15 years from concept to market. According to Hassabis, AI can radically alter this timeline.DeepMind’s subsidiary, Isomorphic Labs, leverages AI to model complex biological systems, analyse molecular structures, and predict interactions between drugs and proteins. In the Bloomberg interview, Hassabis highlighted that AI can process enormous datasets far faster than human researchers, enabling the identification of promising drug candidates within weeks instead of years.This accelerated approach could not only save valuable time but also optimize resource allocation, ensuring that researchers focus on molecules with the highest likelihood of success.A major challenge in drug discovery is the high failure rate: many compounds that look promising in early tests fail in later stages due to inefficacy or harmful side effects. Hassabis emphasized that AI’s predictive capabilities could reduce these failures significantly.DeepMind’s models simulate protein folding and chemical interactions, allowing scientists to forecast how molecules behave in the body. The AI can also suggest novel molecular structures that traditional methods might overlook, expanding the pool of potential therapeutics. By prioritizing candidates most likely to succeed, AI improves efficiency and reduces costly setbacks in research.Hassabis discussed the broader implications of AI-driven drug discovery in the Bloomberg interview. Faster development cycles could allow for quicker responses to pandemics, emerging diseases, and critical health crises. Moreover, AI could facilitate the creation of personalized medicine, tailoring treatments to individual genetic profiles, metabolic rates, and disease characteristics.Beyond speed, AI’s efficiency could lower drug development costs, making treatments more accessible globally. This democratization of medicine could have profound social impacts, particularly for developing nations where access to cutting-edge therapies is limited.While Hassabis did not provide specific drug names in the interview, he emphasized that AI models are already being applied to several disease areas, including neurodegenerative disorders, rare genetic conditions, and chronic illnesses. Early studies suggest that computational predictions could significantly reduce the experimental burden and provide actionable leads for human trials.For instance, modeling protein-drug interactions can identify compounds that might mitigate protein misfolding in diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Similarly, AI-driven analysis of molecular pathways could accelerate treatments for rare cancers where conventional drug development is often economically unviable.Despite its promise, AI-driven drug discovery is not without challenges. Hassabis pointed out several critical considerations:Addressing these challenges will be crucial to translating AI’s predictive power into real-world therapies.","Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming industries, and the pharmaceutical sector is poised to be one of its most significant beneficiaries.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced that it has reached a nonbinding agreement with Microsoft, its largest investor, on a revised partnership that could allow the artificial intelligence startup to change its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation (PBC). Issuing a joint statement via X, the company said “OpenAI and Microsoft have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the next phase of our partnership.” “We are actively working to finalize contractual terms in a definitive agreement. Together, we remain focused on delivering the best AI tools for everyone, grounded in our shared commitment to safety,” it added.In a blog post, OpenAI board chairman Bret Taylor said the nonprofit that currently oversees the company would continue to control operations under the new plan. The nonprofit would also hold a stake in the future PBC, valued at more than $100 billion. Other details of the agreement were not disclosed.OpenAI and Microsoft described the arrangement as a “nonbinding memorandum of understanding” (MOU), which sets out intent but is not legally enforceable.Taylor said OpenAI and Microsoft will work with attorneys general in California and Delaware on the transition plan. Approval is needed before the partnership changes take effect.The announcement follows months of talks between OpenAI and Microsoft about restructuring. OpenAI is unusual among startups because it is controlled by a nonprofit board. That board drew global attention in 2023 when it briefly removed CEO Sam Altman , only to reinstate him days later.Under the current partnership, Microsoft has preferred access to OpenAI’s technology and provides its main cloud services. But as OpenAI’s business has grown, the company has sought more flexibility. It recently signed a $300 billion, five-year cloud deal with Oracle starting in 2027 and partnered with SoftBank on its Stargate data center project.","OpenAI reaches nonbinding agreement with Microsoft on revised partnership.

Google and Microsoft execs have 'same warning' for employees: Learn to use AI or…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-and-microsoft-execs-have-same-warning-for-employees-learn-to-use-ai-or/articleshow/123843583.cms,"Corporate pressure mounts as AI adoption becomes performance metric at tech giants







Top executives at Microsoft and Google are delivering an identical message to their workforces: artificial intelligence adoption is no longer optional for career advancement. Both tech giants are now evaluating employees based on their AI usage and considering formal metrics in performance reviews as competition intensifies in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.Microsoft's Julia Liuson, president of the division overseeing developer tools including GitHub Copilot, sent a memo to managers in June stating that ""using AI is no longer optional — it's core to every role and every level."" Liuson's directive instructed managers to make AI usage part of their ""holistic reflections"" on employee performance and impact, treating AI proficiency like other fundamental workplace skills such as collaboration and data-driven thinking,Google CEO Sundar Pichai followed suit in July during an all-hands meeting, telling employees they need to ""be more AI-savvy"" to help the company compete. Pichai emphasized that rival companies would leverage AI for productivity gains, making it essential for Google to match that efficiency.The pressure extends beyond basic adoption. Google engineering vice president Megan Kacholia sent emails to software engineers mandating AI tool use for coding improvements, while updating job descriptions to include AI problem-solving requirements. Microsoft is considering adding formal AI usage metrics to performance reviews for the next fiscal year, reflecting what company leaders see as lagging internal adoption of Copilot AI services.Now, to ensure widespread AI adoption their workforces both the companies are implementing systematic approach to keep a track of employees’ progress. Google has launched internal programs including ""AI Savvy Google"" with courses and toolkits, while engineering teams are expected to use the company's Cider AI coding tool. More than 30% of code at Google is now AI-generated, up from 25% the previous year.At Microsoft, managers have been told that AI usage should be part of their ""holistic reflections"" on employee performance. GitHub’s ex-CEO Thomas Dohmke defended the policy, comparing mandatory AI use to other fundamental workplace requirements. ""There is no world where I would allow for somebody to say, 'Well, sorry, I don't want to use GitHub,'"" Dohmke stated, suggesting employees who resist could find work elsewhere among ""tens of thousands of other tech companies. ""The companies' approaches extend beyond coding, with sales, legal, and other divisions also receiving instructions to incorporate AI tools.While employees have expressed skepticism about the mandates, most workers interviewed by Business Insider acknowledged that becoming AI-proficient appears necessary for career advancement.Amazon and Shopify have implemented similar policies, with Amazon CEO Andy Jassy telling employees to learn AI tools for ""scrappier teams"" and Shopify requiring teams to demonstrate AI usage before requesting additional resources. The message is consistent across Silicon Valley: adapt to AI-enhanced workflows or risk falling behind in career advancement and company relevance.","Microsoft and Google are telling their workforces that AI adoption is no longer optional for career advancement.

"Google to shut down Tables, offers migration tools ahead of closure",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-to-shut-down-tables-offers-migration-tools-ahead-of-closure/articleshow/123837740.cms,"



Google has announced that it will shut down its work-tracking and automation tool — Tables. Designed to rival Airtable, Google Tables will shut down completely by December 11, 2025. This decision marks the end of a five-year run for the app, which started as an experimental project under Google’s Area 120 incubator before graduating to the Google Cloud portfolio.As reported by TechCrunch, in a email sent to its users, Google has advised to export data to Google Sheets or migrate to AppSheet, its no-code platform. A dedicated migration tool has been introduced to help users to preserve formatting, column types and workflow automations during transition.Launched in 2020, Tables was created to streamline project management, IT operations, CRM and recruiting workflows via automation and customisable views. The tool became popular due to its flexibility and simplicity. However, it could not sustain long-term support amid Google’s broader restructuring.This shutdown follows the earlier closure of Area 120, which also witnessed half of its projects canceled in 2022 and a pivot toward AI-focused initiatives. While Tables survived that initial reorganization, it now joins the ranks of Google’s discontinued experiments.Users are encouraged to act before the December deadline to avoid data loss.","Google has announced that it will shut down its work-tracking and automation tool — Tables.

Gmail adds new “Purchases” tab to simplify package tracking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/gmail-adds-new-purchases-tab-to-simplify-package-tracking/articleshow/123837568.cms,"



Google is now making it simpler for users to keep a tab of their online orders. With a new Gmail update, the tech giant has introduced a dedicated ‘Purchases’ tab. This new tab will offer a more streamlined view of all the upcoming package deliveries to the users. Along with this, it will also keep the users informed about their past orders.The new tab is created on Gmail’s present package tracking feature. First launched in 2022, the feature enabled users to see delivery updates directly in their inbox. Now, instead of digging through emails or visiting carrier websites, users can simply open the Purchases tab to view shipment statuses, expected arrival dates, and order history.Google believes that this feature will prove to be quite useful during the upcoming holiday season. According to PwC’s 2025 holiday outlook, 39% of gift spending is expected to occur between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday — making efficient tracking more important than ever.Along with the Purchases tab, Gmail is also updating its Promotions category, enabling users to sort promotional emails by “most relevant” and receive nudges about timely deals from their favorite brands. This update will roll out in the coming weeks on mobile for personal Google accounts.The Purchase tab update is already live for Gmail users on both mobile and web.","The Purchase tab update is already live for Gmail users on both mobile and web.

US highways may have Chinese ‘problem’: Officials to check these equipments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-highways-may-have-chinese-problem-officials-to-check-these-equipments/articleshow/123835449.cms,"Representative Image

Why solar equipment on highways is worrying US officials



""That could create a lot of havoc,""

5 Key things you missed at Apple iPhone launch event





US officials have issued a warning against solar-powered highway infrastructure, a report claims. The Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration has reportedly cautioned officials that solar equipment on US highways, including chargers and traffic cameras, may contain hidden radios and other rogue Chinese devices. An advisory from the department has also suggested that these components should be inspected. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, a four-page security note from the department stated that undocumented cellular radios had been found in ""certain foreign-manufactured power inverters and BMS"" (battery management systems). However, the note did not specify the country of origin, but many inverters are made in China. The warning comes amid escalating government concerns about the presence of Chinese technology in US infrastructure.As per the Reuters report, US officials are increasingly worried that inverters and battery management systems could be embedded with hidden components enabling remote interference by Beijing. The report also cited Anomadarshi Barua, a George Mason University academic who has written about security weaknesses in inverters, which convert solar or wind energy into usable electricity and has explained how they could be exploited to send rogue commands or cause power surges.Barua cautioned, noting that it may be used to disrupt roadside infrastructure or, in the future, interfere with systems that keep autonomous cars operational.In May, Reuters reported that US officials grew concerned after experts discovered rogue communication devices in some Chinese inverters and batteries. Green Power Denmark later said similar unexplained components were found in imported equipment for its energy grid.The Federal Highway Administration’s advisory cited reports of “undocumented cellular radios” in inverters and batteries, warning they could pose a risk. The US Department of Transportation said the advisory ""summarises public and unclassified reporting to ensure agencies are implementing practical mitigation steps.""The Chinese Embassy in Washington responded that it opposed ""the distortion and smear of China's achievements in the field of energy infrastructure.""","US officials have issued a warning against solar-powered highway infrastructure, a report claims.

Marks & Spencer's CTO Rachel Higham exits the company and this may be the reason,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/marks-spencers-cto-rachel-higham-exits-the-company-and-this-may-be-the-reason/articleshow/123834891.cms,"What M&S said about the exit of its Chief Digital and Technology Officer



“Rachel has decided to take a break and is stepping back from her role, having been a valued part of the leadership team. She has been a steady hand and calm head at an extraordinary time for the business and we wish her well for the future.”





Rachel Higham, the Chief Digital and Technology Officer at Marks & Spencer (M&S), is leaving the company, a report claims. This comes months after a cyberattack that caused hundreds of millions of pounds in damage to the UK-based retail chain and disrupted its systems. A report by the new agency Reuters cited Sky News to claim that her departure was announced in a recent internal memo shared by the company. Higham, who is a former executive at WPP and BT Group, was hired by M&S early last year in June to lead its technology functions. In the internal memo, the company noted that Higham had made her decision to take a break from work, which was the reason behind her exit.In a statement about Higham’s exit, a M&S spokesperson said to Reuters:The company spokesperson also noted that Higham’s departure has led to a broader reorganisation of roles. Longtime executive Sacha Berendji will now oversee the digital and technology division alongside his existing responsibilities for property and store development, the Reuters report added.In addition, Thinus Keeve, who joined as retail director in June, will shift from reporting to Berendji to reporting directly to Chief Executive Stuart Machin, Reuters noted.In April, M&S suffered a cyberattack, which was carried out by a group known as Scattered Spider.This hacking incident disrupted the retailer’s online operations and highlighted the rising risk of such threats. The retailer has since restored its click-and-collect service and expects insurance to cover part of the losses.In May, the company estimated the breach would reduce operating profit in the 2025/26 financial year by about £300 million ($405 million). However, it aimed to offset roughly half that impact through insurance claims and tighter cost controls.Last month, M&S told Sky News it was not seeking to replace Higham. However, the latest report also didn’t mention whether she would receive a payoff.","Rachel Higham, the Chief Digital and Technology Officer at Marks & Spencer (M&S), is leaving the company, a report claims.

Klarna completed US IPO







Klarna, one of Europe's early adopters of artificial intelligence (AI), is now reversing course on its aggressive use of the technology. According to CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, the company may have gone too far in cutting costs with AI, potentially at the expense of its service and product quality.“We probably over indexed a little bit on that, and then in the last six months we have been trying to course correct,” news agency Reuters quoted CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski as saying. He said that the company cut thousands of jobs, dropped vendors such as Salesforce and turned to AI. While this saved millions for the company, he said that the company has now realised that it went too fast, too soon.The ""buy now, pay later"" lender previously cut thousands of jobs and dropped vendors like Salesforce in favour of AI-driven solutions. The company's AI chatbot, for example, was reported to be doing the work of 700 employees, drastically reducing customer query resolution times.In May, Klarna even used an AI avatar of its CEO to present quarterly earnings and a separate interactive AI avatar to speak with customers on a hotline.He stated that investors are more concerned with growth and the quality of customer and merchant services than with cost savings from AI.The company’s focus is now shifting toward boosting productivity and improving products, a move that coincides with the company's decision to begin hiring new employees. There are currently dozens of open positions on Klarna's job portal, Reuters said.Klarna recently completed a successful US IPO, and its shares jumped 30% in their hotly anticipated New York debut, valuing the Swedish fintech at $19.65 billion. The company's shares opened at $52, compared with their IPO price of $40 per share.","Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski says the company may have gone too far in cutting costs with AI.

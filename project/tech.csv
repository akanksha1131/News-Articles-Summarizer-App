ChatGPT sees fall in app downloads and time spent on the mobile app





ChatGPT’s mobile app may be losing steam, with new data from app intelligence firm Apptopia showing a slowdown in global download growth. According to the analysis, the app’s new user growth, measured by month-over-month percentage changes in global downloads, has been decelerating since April and is projected to decline by 8.1% in October.While ChatGPT continues to attract millions of daily downloads worldwide, the stalling growth rate signals a potential peak in its expansion. Apptopia’s data also reveals a leveling off in global daily active users (DAUs) over the past month, suggesting the app’s user base is stabilizing.Apptopia in its report attributes the slowdown to rising competition and changes to ChatGPT’s AI model, which may be impacting its appeal. Apptopia notes that ChatGPT’s average time spent per DAU and average sessions per DAU metrics were trending downward before the sharp rise of its competitor, Google’s Gemini, which shot up to the top charts in September thanks to the release of Google’s new AI image model, Nano Banana. However, the company noted that while Gemini’s growth may have impacted some of the more recent drops in ChatGPT’s core metrics, it doesn’t explain the overall trend completely.In the U.S., user engagement is declining. The average time spent per DAU has dropped 22.5% since July, and the number of sessions per DAU has fallen by 20.7%. This indicates that American users are spending less time in the app and opening it less frequently.However, user churn has stabilized, with fewer users experimenting briefly and then abandoning the app, pointing to stronger retention of its core audience.As the AI landscape evolves, ChatGPT’s mobile app faces new challenges in maintaining its growth trajectory.","ChatGPT’s mobile app may be losing steam, with new data from app intelligence firm Apptopia showing a slowdown in global download growth.

Meta to use photos in your phone train its AI models, when ...





Meta has launched a new AI-powered feature for Facebook , allowing its AI to suggest creative edits for unposted photos in users’ camera rolls. The feature, now available to all users in the US and Canada, was announced on Friday and offers opt-in sharing suggestions for posting AI-edited photos to Facebook Feeds and Stories. ""We’re introducing a new Facebook feature that surfaces photos and videos and suggests fun edits and collages, making it easier to share your favorite moments,"" said the company in a post.Initially tested in June, the feature prompts users with a permission dialog to allow cloud processing of camera roll images. This enables Meta AI to generate creative ideas like collages, recaps, AI restyling, and birthday-themed edits. Users can disable the feature at any time.Meta emphasizes that unposted photos are not used to train its AI or for ad targeting unless users actively edit or share the media. However, agreeing to Meta’s AI Terms of Service permits the AI to analyze media and facial features to summarize content, modify images, or generate new content. ""All suggestions are private to you and you decide what to share, when to share, and with whom.We don’t use media from your camera roll to improve AI at Meta, unless you choose to edit this media with our AI tools, or share,"" said Meta in its post.The company also uses photo metadata, such as dates and the presence of people or objects, to tailor suggestions, raising concerns about the depth of personal data accessed.This rollout follows earlier reports in June about a test phase, where Meta clarified it wasn’t using private photos for AI training but left open the possibility for future use under specific conditions. Now, with the feature live, users must weigh the creative benefits against potential privacy implications.","The feature, now available to all users in the US and Canada, offers opt-in sharing suggestions for posting AI-edited photos to Facebook Feeds and Stories.

Partnerships with record labels, distributors, and music publishers:

Choice in participation:

Fair compensation and new revenue:

Artist-fan connection:





Spotify has announced plans to collaborate with major music rightsholders to develop responsible AI products as it looks to help artists and songwriters while connecting them with fans. Spotify has entered into an agreement with Sony Music Group, Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, Merlin, and Believe to develop products forged through upfront agreements. The company hopes to bring on additional rightsholders and distributors over time.Spotify acknowledged that many emerging AI music products are perceived by artists as short-term experiments built to compete with them, rather than long-term solutions designed to serve them. Spotify’s existing focus has been on using generative AI for features that connect fans and artists, such as its AI DJ, personalised daylist, and AI Playlist.The company rejects the view held by some in the tech industry that copyright should be abolished, stating plainly: Musicians’ rights matter, and copyright is essential. It argues that if the music industry fails to lead in this moment, AI-powered innovation will occur elsewhere “without rights, consent, or compensation.”The collaboration with rightsholders, artists, and songwriters involves significant investments in AI research and product development.All products developed through this collaboration will put artists and songwriters first, guided by four key principles:New products will be developed through upfront agreements.Artists and rightsholders will choose if and how to participate, ensuring the use of AI tools aligns with their values.Products will be built to create entirely new revenue streams, ensuring proper compensation and transparent crediting for the use of their work.AI tools will not replace human artistry but will offer artists new avenues for creativity and connecting with fans, the company says.","Spotify has announced plans to collaborate with major music rightsholders to develop responsible AI products.

How these hackers targeted Microsoft Teams users



Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained





Microsoft has successfully stopped a wave of cyberattacks targeting people using its video conferencing tool Teams. The software giant was able to restrict these attacks by removing more than 200 digital keys that the hackers used to make their malicious software appear trustworthy. The company revealed that the hacking group, also known as Vanilla Tempest, was trying to deploy a type of harmful software called Rhysida ransomware . This software locks up a victim's files, and the hackers then demand money to unlock them, a practice known as extortion . The group carried out these attacks using fake advertisements on search engines and tricky website links. They created websites with addresses that looked a lot like the official Microsoft Teams site.Microsoft wrote in a blog post.When a Teams user visited one of these fake sites, they were prompted to download a file named ""MSTeamsSetup.exe,"" the same name as the real Teams program.Once someone ran this file, it secretly put a hidden tool, called the Oyster backdoor, onto the computer.This hidden Oyster tool gave the hackers secret remote control over the infected systems. This allowed them to steal private files, run commands, and load the final Rhysida ransomware to lock up the data.Microsoft said that Vanilla Tempest is a group mainly focused on making money. They specifically aim to get into company computer networks to lock files with ransomware and steal data for extortion. While they've used other locking software before, they have been focusing mostly on Rhysida recently.","Microsoft has stopped a wave of cyberattacks targeting people using its video conferencing tool Teams.

Sharing his new email address—amitshah.bjp@zohomail.in—on social media, Shah wrote: ""Hello everyone, I have switched to Zoho Mail. Kindly note the change in my email address.

Google expands AI infrastructure and data centres

Strengthening Belgium’s digital future

AI’s potential for economic growth





US tech giant Google has announced plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network, creating hundreds of new jobs and supporting local economic growth. The investment will focus on the company’s existing Saint-Ghislain site and the new Farciennes campus, with construction already underway. Google said the expansion will strengthen Belgium’s role in Europe’s cloud and AI sector, provide large-scale computing capacity powered by carbon-free energy, and create opportunities for local suppliers and contractors. Officials highlighted the move as a vote of confidence in Belgium’s tech ecosystem and workforce.The investment will modernise and expand Google’s network of data centres in Saint-Ghislain and Farciennes, enabling the company to handle large volumes of digital data and support advanced AI systems. These facilities are designed to operate entirely on clean energy, aligning with Google’s global goal to achieve carbon-free operations by 2030. The expansion will also support the development of new onshore wind farms in Belgium to power the centres sustainably.The project is expected to create around 300 new full-time jobs directly, while indirectly supporting approximately 15,000 additional roles through local contractors and partners. Google already works with about 150 Belgian suppliers, including 80 in Wallonia, and the expansion will further boost construction, technology, and service sector employment. Prime Minister Bart De Wever emphasized that the investment underscores Belgium’s growing importance as a digital and green technology hub.Belgium has become a key location for technology growth thanks to its reliable internet networks, stable power supply, and skilled workforce. Google Cloud already serves Belgian companies and organizations such as Odoo and UZ Leuven, helping them scale AI-based tools for healthcare, research, and business. The new investment will enhance Belgium’s competitiveness in the European cloud and AI market, attracting further international investment and innovation.A 2024 study commissioned by Google estimated that artificial intelligence could increase Belgium’s GDP by €45 to €50 billion over the next decade.

The shuttered team, known internally as the NPO or New Projects Organization, had over a dozen members who focused on generalist tasks such as improving the writing ability of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots.Scale AI attributed the cuts to an industry shift toward more technical, expert-level training work, according to Business Insider. As AI chatbots improve, they increasingly require input from humans with specialised skills in fields like medicine, robotics, and finance, rather than generalist contractors.“Scale wound down a small experimental onsite program in Dallas staffed by a contract workforce,” Scale AI spokesperson Natalia Montalvo said.“This reflects an industry shift toward higher skill, expert data work. It only affects a small fraction of our overall workforce and has no impact on customer delivery,” Montalvo was quoted as saying.Scale AI offered the laid-off workers four weeks of severance pay and healthcare coverage through October, according to an email from HireArt, a staffing agency used extensively by Scale AI.The recently terminated workers were also invited to join Scale's gig-work platform, Outlier, where thousands of freelancers help train AI models.“As you navigate this transition, we want to ensure you are aware of alternative opportunities,” the email stated.Montalvo added that Scale AI continues to expand expert-level programs and that broader groups of contractors continue to work in Dallas.The Dallas layoffs represent the latest in a series of cuts at Scale AI since the Meta investment. xAI has also made similar moves to focus on specialised AI training, recently downsizing its team of generalist AI tutors in September.",Scale AI shut down an entire team of contractors in its Dallas office this week.

Micron is reportedly planning to stop supplying server chips to data centers in China after the company failed to recover from a 2023 government ban on its products in critical Chinese infrastructure, a report has said. Micron was the first US chipmaker targeted by Beijing in a move seen as retaliatory for Washington's restrictions aimed at impeding China's semiconductor industry progress.Citing two people briefed on the decision, news agency Reuters reported that Micron will continue to sell to two Chinese customers with data centre operations outside China, including laptop maker Lenovo . The company will also continue supplying chips to auto and mobile phone sector customers in China.Asked about the exit from its China data centre business, Micron said in a statement that the division had been impacted by the ban and that it abides by applicable regulations where it does business.“We have a strong operating and customer presence in China, and China remains an important market for Micron and the semiconductor industry in general,” Micron said in its statement.Micron’s ban from critical infrastructure in China—the world's second-largest market for server memory—has meant the company missed out on the country's data centre expansion boom tied to artificial intelligence (AI) investment.Since Micron's ban, both Nvidia and Intel chips have faced similar accusations from Chinese authorities and an industry group of posing security risks.

Microsoft is reportedly targeting a major overhaul of its manufacturing operations, with the aim to produce bulk of its upcoming hardware products outside China by as soon as the year 2026. This comes amid escalating US-China trade tensions. According to a report in Nikkei Asia, quoting sources, Microsoft wants to produce the majority of its new products outside of China as early as next year.These initiatives underscore a broader push by American technology companies to disentangle their supply chains from China, driven by geopolitical risks and potential disruptions in bilateral relations. For Microsoft, the effort encompasses preparations for non-China production of its Surface line of laptops and data center servers, spanning everything from core components to final assembly, starting next year, the sources said. Microsoft has asked multiple suppliers to help prepare ""out of China"" production for its Surface laptop computers and data center servers, including key components and assembly, starting next year, sources briefed on the matter said.One supply chain executive close to the discussions described the initiative to Nikkei as expansive, ""The scope is quite wide and covers components, parts and product assembly for new product introductions of both notebook computers and server products.""Microsoft is reportedly planning that all of these can be manufactured entirely outside of China starting from 2026 at the earliest. Industry estimates indicate Microsoft distributes around 4 million Surface notebooks and tablets annually, per data from executives and market researcher Omdia. The company has already relocated a substantial share of its server manufacturing away from China since last year, prioritizing these items due to their strategic importance, one source noted. Microsoft is now requiring that no less than 80% of the bill of materials (BOM), which details every part, component, and assembly step—for its servers be sourced internationally. The BOM push is part of a wider strategy, including efforts to ramp up non-China output for Xbox gaming consoles, though full relocation isn't yet mandatory, the source added.A second executive at a Microsoft vendor highlighted the logistical hurdles to Nikkei: ""Moving assembly is rather easy, but [shifting production] down to the component level is radical and very challenging, especially with a timeframe like 2026."" ""We need to see how this ambition will be carried out.""The moves align with similar actions by other American tech companies. Amazon's cloud division, AWS, is reportedly scrutinizing reductions in purchases from Chinese printed circuit board maker SYE for its AI servers and evaluating alternatives, while Google is scaling up server assembly in Thailand through expanded partnerships.","Microsoft reportedly targeting major overhaul of its manufacturing operations.

What the lawsuit alleges about the AI ‘clothes removal’ tool



“nominal defendant""

“constant fear”





A teenage girl is suing the maker of an AI ""clothes removal"" tool and Telegram. The lawsuit comes after a classmate used the technology to create at least one non-consensual fake nude image of her when she was 14. The lawsuit, filed by the girl (now 17) from New Jersey, is the latest in a series of legal actions against the companies behind undressing websites and applications. The incident occurred two years ago at Westfield High School, where the girl was one of several students who discovered a classmate had used photos from their social media accounts to generate the fake nude images. According to a Wall Street Journal report, some male classmates also shared the fabricated images in group chats.A Yale Law School professor, a group of his students, and a trial attorney have filed a lawsuit on behalf of the teenager against AI/Robotics Venture Strategy3, the company behind ClothOff. This web tool was allegedly used to generate the images. Telegram is also listed as ain the case, as ClothOff was accessible through bots on the messaging platform. AI/Robotics Venture Strategy3 is registered in the British Virgin Islands and is believed to be run by individuals based in Belarus.It's also important to note that the teenage boy who made the fake images isn’t named in this case but is facing a separate lawsuit. He allegedly used a photo of the girl in a swimsuit to generate the nude picture. The girl says she lives inthat the fake image is circulating online and that photos of her and her classmates are being used to train ClothOff’s AI model.However, the plaintiff argues that creating these images amounts to CSAM, while the developer claims that its tool cannot process photos of minors and that any attempt to do so results in an account ban. The company also says it does not store user data.The plaintiff has asked the court to order AI/Robotics Venture Strategy3 to delete all nude images of adults and children created without consent, stop using them to train AI models, and take down both the website and the ClothOff tool.A Telegram spokesperson said that such tools and non-consensual pornography violate its terms of service and are removed when found. ClothOff has since been taken down from Telegram, the report adds.Last year, The Guardian investigated ClothOff, which had over 4 million monthly visitors. The report found that the app had been used to make fake nude images of children globally.The issue of AI-generated nudes without consent existed even before generative AI became popular. In 2020, a Telegram deepfake bot was found to have created over 100,000 fake nude images of women using social media photos.In 2024, the San Francisco Attorney’s office filed lawsuits against 16 undressing websites, and in June this year, Meta sued the developer of the Crush AI nudify app after 8,000 related ads appeared on its platforms within two weeks.","Teenager is suing the maker of an AI ""clothes removal"" tool and Telegram.

Beyond resumes: The power of referrals

Salesforce responds







A group of known authors has flied a lawsuit against tech giant Salesforce. The group alleges that the company’s artificial intelligence software was trained on their copyrighted works without their permission. According to Reuters, the lawsuit filed in the federal court accuses Salesforce of infringing with the intellectual property rights via its partnership with Cohere, a Canadian AI firm whose language models are integrated into Salesforce’s enterprise tools.The plaintiffs include bestselling writers like Jonathan Franzen, Jodi Picoult, and George Saunders, who claim their books were used to train Cohere’s AI models, which power features in Salesforce’s Einstein Copilot and other generative tools. The lawsuit mirrors similar legal actions taken against OpenAI and Meta, as authors push back against what they describe as unauthorized use of their creative output.As reported by Reuters, the complaint filed argues that Salesfoce and Cohere violated copyright law by using literary works without consent or compensation. The lawsuit seeks damages and an injection to prevent further use of the authors’ content in AI training.“This is about protecting the value of human creativity,” said a spokesperson for the plaintiffs. “Tech companies must be held accountable when they exploit copyrighted material to build commercial products. ”As per the Reuters report, Salesforce has not yet commented on the lawsuits but it is expected to defend its practices by pointing to its licensing agreements and data sourcing protocols.

The affected Canadian airports—all smaller, regional facilities—included Kelowna International Airport and Victoria International Airport, both in British Columbia, and Windsor International Airport in Ontario.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) is investigating the hack.At Victoria International Airport, hackers broadcast messages in a foreign language and played music over the PA system, according to an airport spokesperson. The hackers gained access by breaching third-party software, forcing the airport to switch to an internal system to regain control. The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security is assisting with that investigation.The PA system and flight information display screens were also breached at Windsor International Airport in Ontario, displaying “unauthorized images and announcements.” Airport officials confirmed the breach occurred via a “cloud-based software provider” and stated that “our systems returned to normal shortly thereafter.”Meanwhile, US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy confirmed the breach at Harrisburg International Airport in Pennsylvania in a social media post.

Deloitte's Global AI Leader Nitin Mittal has said that engineers should not fear artificial intelligence (AI) itself, but rather their colleagues who are learning to use it faster. At the NDTV World Summit 2025, Mittal was asked the much-debated question — whether AI will take away jobs — Mittal said yes, some roles will be affected.“It is inevitable that certain jobs will be impacted, like software engineering, customer support, call centres and coding,” he said. “But I have not come across a single job that has been lost to AI. Almost all jobs are impacted by another person who has figured out how to work with AI.”Mittal, co-author of the Wall Street Journal bestseller All-in on AI, said that people who fail to adapt or reskill are more likely to be left behind. “Those who don’t show curiosity to learn and instead spend their time doomscrolling will likely get displaced,” he remarked.He said instead of fearing job losses, people should focus on the rise of a new AI-driven economy that will also create fresh opportunities. “The new AI economy could create jobs that no one imagined, but it will require reskilling,” he said.During the interaction, Nitin Mittal also pointed out that building AI data centres will generate new construction and manufacturing jobs, supporting local industries. He also called for developing sovereign AI models in India to preserve the country’s culture and languages.“India must leverage its strengths — the scale of its talent, entrepreneurship, and innovation — to build and apply AI effectively,” he said.When asked about self-driving Waymo cabs and whether such technology could work on Indian roads, Mittal said the focus should shift from importing solutions to building them locally. “The conversation should be about what we can make, design, build, test, and deploy in India,” he said.","Deloitte's Global AI Leader Nitin Mittal has said that engineers should not fear artificial intelligence (AI) itself, but rather their colleagues who are learning to use it faster.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that he supports President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard in San Francisco. The remarks have prompted the resignation of Ron Conway, a prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist and longtime friend of Benioff. In an email to Benioff, Conway said their values were no longer aligned.“It saddens me immensely to say that with your recent comments, and failure to understand their impact, I now barely recognize the person I have so long admired,” Conway wrote in the email, obtained by The New York Times.“I have expressed candidly to you, repeatedly, in recent days, that I am shocked and disappointed by your comments calling for an unwanted invasion of San Francisco by federal troops,” Conway wrote, “and by your willful ignorance and detachment from the impacts of the ICE immigration raids of families with NO criminal record.”Conway, an early investor in Google and Facebook , stepped down Thursday, October 16 from the board of the Salesforce Foundation, which had about $400 million in assets at the end of 2023. Ron Conway and Marc Benioff, close friends for more than 25 years, had discussed Benioff’s remarks in recent days, but Conway said he remained unconvinced that Benioff understood “the dangers posed by the Trump administration” or “the impact of his remarks.”The controversy began after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told The New York Times last week that he fully supports Trump and wanted National Guard troops sent to San Francisco, where Salesforce is headquartered, to curb crime. The billionaire executive, once known for his progressive stance, angered city leaders with his comments.Conway criticized Benioff for weighing in on San Francisco’s issues “where you don’t even live or vote.” Benioff currently resides on the Big Island of Hawaii, where he owns several properties and is registered to vote.President Trump said Wednesday that San Francisco could be the next city to receive federal troops, praising “great support” for the idea — a possible reference to Benioff and Elon Musk, who also backed the move.Conway also took aim at Benioff’s repeated threats to move Salesforce’s annual Dreamforce conference to Las Vegas over safety concerns. “Your obsession with and constant annual threats to move Dreamforce to Las Vegas is ironic, since it is a fact that Las Vegas has a higher rate of violent crime than San Francisco,” Conway wrote. “San Francisco does not need a federal invasion because you don’t like paying for extra security for Dreamforce. ”","Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said that he supports President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard in San Francisco.

From panic to opportunity in silicon valley's AI arms race





Google CEO Sundar Pichai has opened up about the company's internal panic when OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022, describing how the seemingly small startup's breakthrough forced the company to declare a ""code red"" and dramatically reshape its AI strategy.Speaking at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference, Pichai acknowledged that OpenAI deserved credit for releasing their chatbot first, even though Google had been developing similar technology internally. ""But you're right, credit to OpenAI, they put it out first,"" he said. ""We knew in a different world, we would've probably launched our chatbot maybe a few months down the line,"" he added, noting the product hadn't reached Google's quality standards at the time.The admission highlighted a familiar Silicon Valley dilemma: the tension between moving fast and maintaining brand reputation. For Google, the calculus was different than for a relatively unknown startup willing to take risks.The ChatGPT phenomenon prompted drastic measures at Google headquarters. Larry Page and Sergey Brin—the company's founders who had stepped away from daily operations in 2019—were summoned back to confront what insiders recognised as an existential crisis.Their return signalled the gravity of the situation: a nimble startup had potentially found a way to disrupt Google's $149 billion search empire.The company swiftly mobilised, reassigning teams across departments and green lighting more than 20 AI initiatives. Executives understood the danger clearly—ChatGPT's conversational interface offered a fundamentally different way to access information online, one that could render traditional search obsolete. With digital advertising generating over 80 percent of Google's revenue, the threat cut straight to the company's financial lifeline.Contrary to external perceptions of crisis, Pichai characterised his reaction as optimistic. ""I was excited because I knew the window had shifted,"" he revealed, suggesting ChatGPT's launch validated the AI investments Google had been making behind closed doors.The company's response included launching Bard—later rebranded as Gemini—in March 2023. Yet Google's measured approach reflected its unique position: unlike a relatively unknown startup, the company couldn't afford missteps with experimental technology that might produce biased, toxic, or inaccurate responses.Pichai drew parallels to previous technological disruptions, including YouTube's surprise emergence while Google developed video search, and Instagram's sudden popularity as Facebook dominated photo-sharing—both eventual acquisitions that turned competitive threats into strategic victories.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai opened up about the company's internal panic when OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022.

"AI investment boom reaches Europe's currency market, and the two biggest winners are ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-investment-boom-reaches-europes-currency-market-and-the-two-biggest-winners-are-/articleshow/124621979.cms,"UK and Sweden lead AI investment destinations in Europe





The surge in artificial intelligence (AI) investment is beginning to influence currency markets in Europe. According to an analysis by news agency Reuters, investment boom in artificial intelligence is starting to be felt for the first time in currency markets across Europe, and analysts reckon Swedish crown and sterling stand to benefit the most. The $10 trillion-a-day foreign exchange (FX) market has been shaped by a weakening U.S. dollar this year, driven by tariff concerns and expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts. However, the ripple effects of AI, which has propelled stock markets to record highs, are now impacting currencies.JPMorgan analysts note that the Swedish crown (Krona) and sterling have shown resilience in recent months, partly due to significant AI investments in Sweden and Britain. ""Sweden and the UK stand out in terms of AI investment, providing a tailwind to their currencies, even if modest,"" a JPMorgan spokesperson told Reuters.According to Stanford University’s AI index, the UK and Sweden each attracted over $4 billion in private AI investments last year, ranking third and fourth globally behind the U.S. and China. The Swedish krona has been the top-performing major European currency against the dollar in 2025, rising nearly 15%, while sterling has gained 7%.Analysts caution that isolating AI’s precise impact on currency movements is challenging due to factors like interest rate expectations and fiscal concerns, particularly for sterling.""Large AI investments announced in both countries could certainly have created some demand for sterling and the Swedish crown, contributing to their resilience,"" Jane Foley, Rabobank’s head of FX strategy, told the news agency. The Krona has also strengthened against the euro and other Scandinavian currencies, while sterling has weakened against the euro and Swiss franc due to fiscal uncertainties. Foley explained that AI investments in Swedish companies, which increase demand for the krona, can cause noticeable currency spikes. However, sterling’s response is less pronounced because it is the world’s fourth most-traded currency, accounting for over 10% of global FX trades, compared to the krona’s less than 2%, per the Bank for International Settlements.In September 2025, Britain and the U.S. reportedly signed a technology pact, with U.S. firms, led by Microsoft, pledging £31 billion ($42 billion) in UK investments. In Sweden, AI giant Nvidia plans to supply its data center platform to companies like Ericsson and AstraZeneca, while Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Brookfield Asset Management are planning data centers, leveraging Sweden’s reliable electricity and infrastructure. These developments create a favorable environment for both currencies, analysts say.A report by SEB earlier this year showed Swedish FX market participants holding near-record overweight positions in the krona. Kenneth Broux, Societe Generale’s head of corporate research for FX and rates, said that U.S. tech investment pledges could reduce pessimism ahead of Britain’s November 2025 budget, where tax hikes are expected, boosting sterling’s appeal. He added that AI-driven “reskilling and upskilling” could mitigate pressures on welfare and unemployment benefits in aging Western economies.",Sweden and the UK each attracted over $4 billion in private AI investments last year.

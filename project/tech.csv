How Microsoft’s water-free datacenter design may solve one of the biggest 'AI problems',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-microsofts-water-free-datacenter-design-may-solve-one-of-the-biggest-ai-technology-problems/articleshow/116185662.cms,"Microsoft unveils revolutionary waterless datacenters. These centers utilize chip-level cooling, eliminating water for cooling purposes. This initiative saves 125 million liters of water annually per center. Pilot projects are planned for Arizona and Wisconsin in 2026. The company aims to achieve near-zero Water Usage Effectiveness. This move combats rising global AI water demand.

How Microsoft is saving water

How much energy is used in an AI query

Microsoft has announced a new datacenter design that eliminates water usage for cooling, marking a significant milestone in the company's commitment to environmental sustainability. Launched in August 2024, this design utilises chip-level cooling solutions to provide precise temperature control without relying on water evaporation.While water will still be used for essential purposes like restrooms and kitchens, the new design is projected to save over 125 million liters of water per year per datacenter.“AI depends on water—and so do we. Proud that Microsoft's new datacenters will consume zero water for cooling, meaning each one will avoid using 125 million liters of water every year. Thanks to the teams paving the way for a more sustainable future,” said Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI.Microsoft measures water efficiency using Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE), which compares water consumption to energy consumption. The company has improved its WUE over the years, achieving an average of 0.30 L/kWh in the last fiscal year. With the introduction of zero-water evaporation technology, Microsoft expects to reduce its WUE to near zero for each new datacenter.This shift to a closed-loop cooling system, where water is recycled continuously, eliminates the need for a fresh water supply. While this approach may slightly increase energy consumption, Microsoft is actively developing innovations – like nuclear energy – to mitigate this impact and further reduce power usage.Pilot projects featuring the new water-free design are planned for Phoenix, Arizona, and Mt. Pleasant, Wisconsin, in 2026.According to a report released earlier this year, Microsoft's water consumption for its data centers surged to 6.4 million cubic meters in a single year, up from 4.7 million cubic meters the previous year. This coincided with a 34% increase in the company's energy consumption.By 2027, global AI demand may withdraw 4.2 to 6.6 billion cubic metres of freshwater - nearly half the amount consumed by the entire UK.",Microsoft has announced a new datacenter design that eliminates water usage for cooling.

"After Intel, another chipmaker is getting over $6 billion government funding for manufacturing plants in US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/after-intel-another-chipmaker-is-getting-over-6-billion-government-funding-for-manufacturing-plants-in-us/articleshow/116185748.cms,"Micron’s semiconductor plans in US

The US Commerce Department has announced a major investment in domestic semiconductor manufacturing . The department has awarded Micron Technology up to $6.165 billion in funding from the CHIPS Act.This substantial investment – comparable to CHIPS Act subsidies previously granted to Intel as well as TSMC and Samsung – marks the US government's commitment to boosting domestic semiconductor production and reducing reliance on foreign manufacturers.“With this investment in Micron, we are delivering on one of the core objectives of the CHIPS program – onshoring the development and production of the most advanced memory semiconductor technology, which is crucial for safeguarding our leadership on artificial intelligence and protecting our economic and national security,” said US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.The grant will support Micron's expansion of semiconductor production facilities in Idaho and New York, with the potential to create an estimated 20,000 jobs.It will also support Micron’s construction of a “mega-fab” facility in Syracuse, New York, and expansion of its existing plant in Boise, Idaho. Micron has committed to investing approximately $50 billion in these projects by the end of the decade.“As the only US-based manufacturer of memory, Micron is uniquely positioned to bring leading-edge memory manufacturing to the US, strengthening the country’s technology leadership and fostering advanced innovation,” added Micron President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra.In addition to the $6.165 billion grant, the Commerce Department also revealed a proposed $275 million in funding for Micron to expand its Manassas, Virginia facility. This funding is outlined in a non-binding agreement.","The US Commerce Department has announced a major investment in domestic semiconductor manufacturing.

Myntra loses Rs 1.1 crore to ‘refund’ scam: Jaipur to Bengaluru -- how the scammers operated,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/myntra-loses-rs-1-1-crore-to-refund-scam-jaipur-to-bengaluru-how-the-scammers-operated/articleshow/116185567.cms,"Jaipur to Bengaluru: How the scammers operated

Flipkart-owned fashion website Myntra has become the latest victim of a sophisticated refund scam that has cost the company millions of rupees. Fraudsters have exploited the company's customer-friendly refund policies to defraud the company. The multi-crore fraud came to light during the audit.The modus operandi involved placing bulk orders for high-value items like branded shoes, apparel, and accessories. Once the orders were delivered, the fraudsters would file false complaints, claiming issues like item shortages, incorrect items, or non-delivery. Myntra has an option in its app for customers to raise complaints and claim refunds. The options included shortage, colour mismatch, or not the same order. The firm would initiate the refund process after receiving complaints.The losses incurred by Myntra are substantial, with estimates suggesting that the company may have lost over Rs 50 crore nationwide. In Bengaluru alone, approximately 5,529 fraudulent orders were identified, leading to significant financial damage.Explaining the fraud, a police officer said that if a person placed an order for 10 pairs of branded shoes, after receiving the parcel, he/she would claim that the parcel had only five pairs. A refund would be claimed for the remaining five pairs of shoes that they paid for while placing the order online or paid by COD.The officer told TOI that a gang in Jaipur, Rajasthan, is involved in the fraud. Almost all the fraudulent orders were placed from Jaipur. The fraudsters gave addresses in Bengaluru and other metros for delivery. A few orders were delivered to commercial establishments such as tea stalls, tailor shops, or provision or stationery stores.In a similar case recently, cybercrime had arrested three miscreants from Surat, Gujarat, for cheating e-commerce company Meesho in the guise of suppliers and customers. They reportedly cheated Meesho to the tune of Rs 5.5 crore by placing fraudulent orders. The case was registered under the Information Technology Act and IPC sections 419 (cheating by personation ) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and an investigation is under progress.",Flipkart-owned fashion website Myntra has become the latest victim of a sophisticated refund scam.

Elon Musk shares video of Tesla's Optimus Robot achieving another 'feat'. Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-shares-video-of-teslas-optimus-robot-achieving-another-feat-watch/articleshow/116184415.cms,"Image credit: X (Twitter)/Canva

“Daily walks help clear your mind,”

Take a look at the video here



What Musk said about Optimus’ latest features



“Optimus can now walk on highly variable ground using neural nets to control its electric limbs. Join @Tesla if you want to work on interesting real-world AI systems.”

“Tesla is where real-world AI is happening. These runs are on mulched ground, where I’ve myself slipped before. What’s really crazy here is that for these, Optimus is actually blind! Keeping its balance without video (yet), only other on-board sensors are consumed by a neural net running in ~2-3ms on its embedded computer.

More exciting work happening on:

- adding Vision so it can better plan ahead

- making the gait look more natural on such rough terrain

- making it more responsive to velocity/direction commands

- learning how to fall to minimise damage when unavoidable (and stand back up)

Join us to work on fascinating reinforcement learning, imitation learning, foundation nets for robotics & more to bring Optimus to everyone fast. We’re doing it.""

“I forgot to mention that Optimus was doing this while “blindfolded”. We haven’t yet made vision part of the control loop for uneven terrain. Optimus robots are regularly cruising around our workplace in Palo Alto where vision is used for static & dynamic object avoidance.”","Optimus can now walk on highly variable ground using neural nets to control its electric limbs.

Karnataka minister clarifies on 'losing' Lenskart deal to Telangana: State govt cannot and should not provide ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/karnataka-minister-clarifies-on-losing-lenskart-deal-to-telangana-state-govt-cannot-and-should-not-provide-/articleshow/116184360.cms,"""Blow for Karnataka""

How the talks of plant in Karnataka started

Lenskart goes to Telangana

Eyewear startup Lenskart has decided to establish its manufacturing facility in Telangana instead of Karnataka, citing the state's favorable policies and rapid execution. Karnataka Industries Minister MB Patil explained that the state government is cautious about offering excessive incentives, as it could compromise the long-term viability of projects. He noted that some investors have requested incentives exceeding 100% of their investment, which is not sustainable.“As custodians of taxpayers’ resources, we are committed to making prudent decisions that maximise long-term benefits for both the state and its people. Incentives by a state govt are provided only to reduce the burden on investors and increase the financial viability of the project,” Patil said in a statement to TOI.“State govt cannot and should not provide incentives more than the planned investment. These practices raise concerns on the fundamental viability of such projects,” he added.In a post on X, Patil wrote, “The govt of Karnataka and I, as a minister, have to walk a tightrope. I, as industries minister, have taken steps to create confidence and make several structural reforms to the state industries department. All industrialists are aware that our door is open for any of their concerns or expansion plans.”The industry minister's clarification came after Aarin Capital chairman TV Mohandas Pai urged Patil to intervene and save the investment that Lenskart had originally planned for Karnataka. Pai called it “another blow for Karnataka,” and urged Patil to act immediately so that “we don’t not lose this investment.”Earlier this year, Lenskart founder Peyush Bansal in a post on Twitter had asked about the availability of a 25-acre plot near the international airport in Bengaluru for his company to build its next mega factory. Minister Patil had quickly responded, offering land. This was cheered by many citizens with some even suggesting places outside of Bengaluru.The Karnataka government has drawn flak in recent years after failing to secure major manufacturing projects, including those from Ola, Ather Energy, and various semiconductor companies. In an interaction with TOI recently, Karnataka's IT minister Priyank Kharge discussed the unbalanced allocation of semiconductor opportunities across Indian states and alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi employed coercive measures to secure agreements favouring Gujarat.On Monday morning, Telangana Minister Sridhar Babu, announced the details of Lenskart investments in a post on X. The Lenskart facility, the minister said, will produce eyewear, lenses, sunglasses, as well as accessories and other products catering to India, along with exports to other markets in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. “The facility will be established at Fab City, where land has already been identified and will be handed over to the company this week. The plant will create around 2100 jobs and there are purported discussions around a R&D plant being set up. This is a testament to our policy that ensures speed and ease of business for companies.”","Lenskart has decided to establish its manufacturing facility in Telangana instead of Karnataka.

"Donald Trump may not have yet made up his mind on TikTok ban, here's why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trump-may-not-have-yet-made-up-his-mind-on-tiktok-ban-heres-why/articleshow/116176571.cms,"Trump highlights TikTok’s role in his campaign

“I used TikTok very successfully in my campaign. I have a man named TikTok Jack, he was very effective, obviously, because I won youth by 30 percent. All Republicans lose youth. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s changing. And last time we were down 30 percent with youth. This time we were up 35 percent with youth.

And I used TikTok, so I can’t really, you know, I can’t totally hate it. It was very effective. But I will say this, if you do do that, something else is going to come along and take its place. And maybe that’s not fair. And really, what the judge actually said was that you can’t have Chinese companies. In other words, they have the right to ban it if you can prove that Chinese companies own it. That’s what the judge actually said.”

“I’m going to try and make it so that other companies don’t become an even bigger monopoly.”

Trump was against TikTok ban during election campaign

US President-elect Donald Trump has provided an unclear stance on the TikTok ban in the country. In a Sunday interview on Meet the Press, when questioned about TikTok's impending ban, Trump avoided committing to saving TikTok though he hinted that ByteDance should divest the platform.NBC’s Kristen Welker pressed Trump on whether he will act to protect the app, which faces expulsion from the U.S. unless its Chinese owner, ByteDance, sells it by January 19.“This week a federal court upheld a law that could result in TikTok being banned. You said you’re going to rescue TikTok when you get into office. Are you going to take steps to protect it?,” Trump said in reply.He also talked about TikTok’s role in his campaign, saying he used the app to tap into youth.When pressed again on whether he would ""protect TikTok"" as president, Trump said:Trump’s position on TikTok has been inconsistent. While he criticised the Biden administration’s support for the ban during his campaign, he previously advocated for TikTok’s removal during his last term in office.In recent months, Trump released a Truth Social video urging those who “want to save TikTok” to vote for him and said that banning the platform will only benefit Facebook, which he referred to as an “enemy of the people.”","US President-elect Donald Trump has provided an unclear stance on the TikTok ban in the country.

Google has unveiled its new quantum chip — Willow. Google CEO Sundar Pichai took off X (formerly) known as Twitter to announce the launch of the chip. “Introducing Willow, our new state-of-the-art quantum computing chip with a breakthrough that can reduce errors exponentially as we scale up using more qubits, cracking a 30-year challenge in the field. In benchmark tests, Willow solved a standard computation in <5 mins that would take a leading supercomputer over 10^25 years, far beyond the age of the universe(!),” said Pichai in a post on X.This announcement started an interesting exchange between Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk.Pichai took to X to announce the launch of Willow, describing it as achieving "" exponential error reduction and unprecedented computational speed."" He stated that Willow can solve problems in minutes that would take traditional supercomputers billions of years. This breakthrough garnered a surprised yet enthusiastic response from Elon Musk, who simply tweeted ""Wow.""Pichai, seemingly referencing Musk's surprise, followed up by replying, “We should do a quantum cluster in space with Starship one day:)”. To this, Musk responded, “That will probably happen. Any self-respecting civilization should at least reach Kardashev Type II. In my opinion, we are currently only at <5% of Type I. To get to ~30%, we would need to place solar panels in all desert or highly arid regions.”“indeed. We should scale solar so much more, amazing that we keep looking at alternatives when the most obvious path is staring at our eyes, literally!,” said Pichai.The new ""Willow"" quantum chip demonstrates unprecedented error correction capabilities, a critical challenge that has stymied quantum computing researchers for decades. With 105 qubits, the chip can reduce computational errors exponentially as it scales up, a feat scientists have pursued since the 1990s.In a groundbreaking demonstration, Google's quantum researchers showed the Willow chip could complete a computational task in roughly five minutes that would require a classical supercomputer an estimated 10 septillion (10^25) years—far exceeding the known age of the universe.","Google's new quantum chip, Willow, can solve problems in minutes that would take traditional supercomputers billions of years.

How Google’s ‘quantum leap’ may have fuelled multiverse theory with its Willow chip’s 'record',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-googles-quantum-leap-may-have-fuelled-multiverse-theory-with-its-willow-chips-record/articleshow/116181715.cms,"Willow’s performance on this benchmark is astonishing: It performed a computation in under five minutes that would take one of today’s fastest supercomputers 10^25 or 10 septillion years. If you want to write it out, it’s 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years. This mind-boggling number exceeds known timescales in physics and vastly exceeds the age of the universe. It lends credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes, in line with the idea that we live in a multiverse, a prediction first made by David Deutsch.

What is quantum, quantum computing and multiverse

In simpler terms:

Why do we need Quantum computing

The mind-boggling concept of a multiverse – where our universe is just one of many – may have taken a giant leap toward reality. Google announced a groundbreaking achievement in quantum computing, unveiling the Willow quantum computing chip that, it claims, is capable of solving problems in mere minutes that would take even the most powerful supercomputers longer than the age of the universe to crack.In its explanation, Google mentioned physicist David Deutsch’s theory of universes, according to which quantum computations occur in many parallel universes simultaneously. Here’s what Google said:Before we understand what Google meant, let’s just have a look at the concepts of Physics.A quantum is the smallest unit of a physical phenomenon or property that can be measured, and the study is called quantum mechanics – a branch of physics that explains the properties of atoms, molecules and their particles, such as electrons, protons, neutrons.The concept of multiverse is based on the existence of multiple, possibly infinite, universes, each with its own unique properties, physical laws and events and comes under quantum mechanics.Deutsch, a pioneer in quantum computing, proposed that quantum computations occur in many parallel universes simultaneously. This idea, rooted in the Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics, suggests that every quantum event spawns multiple universes where each possible outcome unfolds. This means that all possible outcomes of quantum events occur simultaneously in different branches of the multiverse.Imagine you’re facing a choice -- of choosing one of the multiple paths to reach your house. In our universe, you pick one path but in the multiverse idea, another “you” in a parallel universe takes the other path.Quantum computers , according to this notion, could somehow access the results from both universes, giving them incredible power, which is where Quantum computing comes as a way to solve complex problems using this 'power'.Willow's speed seems to support this theory. By tapping into the vast computational 'power' of parallel universes, it has achieved a feat deemed impossible by classical computing standards.All said, the existence of the multiverse remains a theoretical concept and Quantum computing is in a nascent stage with no real-world applications as of now.Quantum computing is a way to solve complex problems at an incredibly fast speed as compared to a regular computer. Consider a regular computer as a bicycle that is great for everyday tasks and a Quantum computer a spaceship, capable of incredible things but still under development.It can help in discovering new drugs and materials by simulating molecules with incredible accuracy and speed, or develop super-fast artificial intelligence leading to breakthroughs in machine learning.To read more about Google Willow, follow this link","Willow performed a computation in under five minutes that would take one of today’s fastest supercomputers 10^25 or 10 septillion years.

Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman on tension with ChatGPT maker OpenAI: ...they’re a completely different ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman-on-tension-with-chatgpt-maker-openai-theyre-a-completely-different-/articleshow/116172678.cms,"Microsoft AI CEO disagrees with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on AGI timeline

The relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI, which was solidified just a year ago when Microsoft helped reinstate Sam Altman as OpenAI's CEO, is reported to be experiencing some strain. Talking to The Verge, Microsoft's AI CEO spoke about a range of issues including the reports of 'tension' in Microsoft's partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI.While acknowledging the natural tensions in any partnership, Suleyman hinted at the diverging paths of the two companies. He pointed out that Microsoft and OpenAI are distinct entities with different business models, and their partnership is evolving over time. ""Every partnership has tension. It’s healthy and natural. I mean, they’re a completely different business to us. They operate independently and partnerships evolve over time... partnerships evolve and they have to adapt to what works at the time, so we’ll see how that changes over the next few years,"" Suleyman said.Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman also reportedly disagrees with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s recent claim in a Reddit AMA that artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is possible on today’s hardware. Suleyam told The Verge that while AGI is “plausible,”, it could take as long as 10 years to achieve.Altman, in particular, has suggested that AGI could be achieved within the next few years, potentially even as early as 2025. He believes that this milestone could be reached with existing hardware, or with minor upgrades.However, Suleyman disagrees with this optimistic outlook. He believes that while AGI is a plausible goal, it's unlikely to be achieved within the next two years. He estimates that it could take five to ten years, requiring significant advancements in hardware, particularly AI chips. I don’t think it can be done on [Nvidia] GB200s. I do think it is going to be plausible at some point in the next two to five generations. I don’t want to say I think it’s a high probability that it’s two years away, but I think within the next five to seven years since each generation takes 18 to 24 months now. So, five generations could be up to 10 years away depending on how things go.“The uncertainty around this is so high,” Suleyman said, “that any categorical declarations just feel sort of ungrounded to me and over the top.”Suleyman defines AGI as a versatile AI system capable of performing well across various human-level tasks. He emphasizes the uncertainty surrounding the timeline for AGI and cautions against making definitive predictions.","Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft's AI CEO, spoke to The Verge about a range of issues including the reports of 'tension' in Microsoft's partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI.

No one was fired at YesMadam!

To our YesMadam family and community,

We sincerely apologize for any distress caused by recent social media posts suggesting we dismissed employees for being stressed. Let us be clear: We would never take such an inhuman step. Our team is like family, and their dedication, hard work, and passion are the foundation of all our successes.

The social media posts were a planned effort to highlight the serious issue of workplace stress. And to those who shared angry comments or voiced strong opinions, we say Thank you. When people speak up, it shows they care - and care is at the heart of our business.

Were YesMadam employees really fired for being stressed?

Absolutely not.

• They weren't fired; they were given a break to reset.

• They weren't let go; they were encouraged to release their stress.

• They weren't Sacked, they were urged to rest and recharge.

In today's hyper-connected world, work-life boundaries are fading, stress is widespread, and productivity often overshadows employee well-being.

At YesMadam, we choose to rewrite the narrative.

It's time to flip the script: let productivity take a back seat when needed to prioritize employee well-being. Happy employees build stronger businesses, and we're here to lead the way in creating a culture that reflects this belief.

Introducing ""Happy 2 Heal""

We're thrilled to announce YesMadam's new corporate program:

Happy 2 Heal. This initiative offers head massages and spa sessions right at the workplace, designed to help employees unwind and recharge - just like it is for the YesMadam team.

India's First

De-Stress Leave Policy

We're excited to take it a step further by introducing India's first-ever

De-Stress Leave Policy. Under this initiative, every YesMadam employee will now enjoy:

• 6 de-stress paid leaves annually to take time for their mental health

• Complimentary YesMadam Spa Session at home, because care

starts with our team.

We firmly believe that the backbone of any great organization is not built on stressed shoulders but on happy minds.

So, let's make employee well-being the new norm. Let's create businesses that thrive on care, collaboration, and compassion.

Over to you, Corporate & Startup India. Let's walk this path together.

Warm Regards,

Family of 300+ employees,

4000+ partners and growing strongly

T-Series Chairman and Managing Director Bhushan Kumar and MrBeast, the world’s most-followed YouTuber, recently met in a surprising turn of events that shocked fans worldwide. After years of competitive rivalry in the race to top YouTube’s subscriber list, the two decided to subscribe to each other's channels, marking the end of their ""sub-race."" This moment has since gone viral, with some social media users calling it the “biggest collab ever.”The encounter between MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson) and Bhushan Kumar was shared by T-Series on Instagram, where the two discussed the long-standing rivalry between their channels. MrBeast humorously revealed that he flew to India specifically to propose a unique deal to Kumar: “If you subscribe to me, I will subscribe to T-Series.” Kumar eagerly agreed, pressing the subscribe button on MrBeast's channel. Then, he requested that MrBeast do the same for T-Series.MrBeast initially played a prank, claiming his phone had died and he would subscribe later, leaving viewers in suspense. However, moments later, he followed through, subscribing to T-Series and officially declaring an end to the ""years of sub-race"" between the two YouTube giants.The video quickly went viral, sparking an outpouring of reactions from fans. Many fans expressed their excitement, with one person humorously referencing the long wait for the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, saying, ""We got MrBeast and T-Series subscribing to each other before GTA 6."" Others praised the collaboration, with one user stating, “The world is not for competition, it's for collaboration!!” Another declared, “This is the biggest collab ever.” The post was flooded with fire and heart emojis from followers of both channels.The playful interaction between the two stars comes after months of back-and-forth rivalry, with MrBeast and T-Series frequently battling for the top spot in terms of YouTube subscribers. Earlier this year, MrBeast even challenged Bhushan Kumar to a boxing match, which led to a virtual war between their fan bases. The competition has kept fans on edge as both channels vied for dominance.As of now, MrBeast holds the title of the most-subscribed YouTube channel and the most-followed individual on the platform, while T-Series, India’s largest record label and film production company, ranks second.The moment symbolises more than just a simple YouTube interaction; it highlights the importance of collaboration over competition. What began as a rivalry between two of YouTube’s most influential entities has now evolved into a gesture of mutual respect and camaraderie, demonstrating that even in a competitive space, cooperation can be more rewarding than constant contention.

""In benchmark tests, Willow solved a standard computation in <5 mins that would take a classical supercomputer an unimaginable amount of time.""The new ""Willow"" quantum chip demonstrates unprecedented error correction capabilities, a critical challenge that has stymied quantum computing researchers for decades. With 105 qubits, the chip can reduce computational errors exponentially as it scales up, a feat scientists have pursued since the 1990s.In a groundbreaking demonstration, Google's quantum researchers showed the Willow chip could complete a computational task in roughly five minutes that would require a classical supercomputer an estimated 10 septillion (10^25) years—far exceeding the known age of the universe.""We are past the break-even point,"" said Hartmut Neven , leader of Google's Quantum AI unit. The chip represents a significant step toward creating practical, large-scale quantum computers that could revolutionize fields like medicine, battery chemistry, and artificial intelligence.Quantum computers use ""qubits"" that can exist in multiple states simultaneously, offering dramatically faster computational potential compared to traditional binary computing. However, qubits are notoriously unstable and prone to errors from minute environmental disturbances.Google's breakthrough lies in its ability to string together qubits in a way that reduces error rates as the number of qubits increases. The company can now correct these errors in real-time, a crucial advancement for making quantum machines commercially viable.While the current computation doesn't have immediate practical applications, researchers are optimistic that quantum computers will soon tackle problems impossible for classical computers to solve.","Google has developed a quantum computing chip that can solve complex calculations in minutes.

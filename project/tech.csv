Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well”





Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses

Business is still booming





Moving ahead without Alexandr Wang





Facebook-parent Meta stunned the Silicon Valley in June this year by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup — Scale AI. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made this investment to primarily onboard Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and other top executives of the company. This move by Meta trigged an immediate speculation about the Scale AI’s viability, with major clients like OpenAI, Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly pausing work with the startup. The industry insiders also felt that the company had been effectively acquired, leaving its future uncertain. However, after almost five months after the investment made by Meta, Scale AI CFO Dennis Cinelli has pushed back this speculation. Speaking to CNBC in an interview, Cinelli said that ‘We are a company that signed some of the best deals we have had in the history of our company, just in the last two or three months. We are not a Zombie.”Emphasising on the fact that Scale AI has signed some of its best deals in recent months, Cinelli told CNBC, “We’re not a zombie company,”. Along with this, he also dismissed the claims that the investment made by Meta was a licensing or acquihire deal.He emphasised that Scale AI is still an independent and completely operational.Founded in 2016, ScaleAI is known for its data-labelling services and custom AI applications for governments and enterprises. Cinelli told CNBC that both the divisions of the company are growing with revenue “well into the nine figures.” He also revealed that Scale AI recently secured two major contracts with the US Department of Defense which value $99 million and $100 million in August and September, respectively.Scale AI fired about 14% of its workforce in July, soon after Meta made the investment of $14.3 billion, but the company started the process of hiring and has hired 200 new employees. Along with this, the AI company is also working on expansion and is opening new offices in New York, Washington D.C., St. Louis, and London. Despite alls this, the San Francisco still remains the largest hub of the company where it is occupying 180,000 square feet of former Airbnb space.The departure of Alexandr Wang from the company was considered to a major loss. He was the world’s youngest self-made billionaire until October but Cinelli insists the “vast majority” of employees remain. Facebook-parent Meta now owns 49% stake in ScaleAIwhich is valued around $29 billion, but the company has no voting power or product integration. “Scale’s data business has grown every month since the Meta deal, and its applications business has doubled in the second half of 2025 compared with the first half. Scale expects the applications unit to be the primary revenue driver for the company in the future,” Cenelli told CNBC.",Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well” Facebook-parent Meta made a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup in June.

"Amazon sends cease-and-desist letter to Perplexity, says: Stop your Bots, we don't want to be part of Comet browser",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-to-perplexity-says-stop-your-bots-we-dont-want-to-be-part-of-comet-browser/articleshow/125095458.cms,"Why Amazon is upset with Perplexity

Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency

What Perplexity says in its defence vs Amazon





Amazon has sent a cease-and-desist letter to Perplexity AI, demanding the artificial intelligence search startup stop allowing its new AI browser agent, Comet, to make purchases on Amazon for users, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. According to the report, Amazon accused Perplexity of computer fraud and terms-of-service violations, alleging the company’s AI agent failed to disclose when it was making purchases on behalf of users. The e-commerce giant claimed Comet degraded the Amazon shopping experience and created privacy vulnerabilities, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is private.Perplexity pushed back, accusing Amazon of using its market dominance to “bully a smaller competitor” developing a rival AI shopping agent. The dispute marks one of the first major clashes over how autonomous AI agents should operate online — especially as they begin to handle complex user tasks such as shopping, booking travel, and managing digital workflows. Like OpenAI and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Perplexity has been reimagining the traditional browser to allow users to execute actions directly through AI prompts.Amazon, too, has been developing its own AI-powered shopping assistants.The company recently began public testing of “Buy For Me,” a feature that lets shoppers complete purchases within its app, and “Rufus,” an AI chatbot that helps users browse and add items to their cart.“We think it’s fairly straightforward that third-party applications offering to make purchases on behalf of customers should operate openly and respect service provider decisions,” said Lara Hendrickson, an Amazon spokesperson, in a statement to Bloomberg. She added that Perplexity’s Comet agent had “significantly degraded the shopping and customer service experience.”Amazon’s retail terms prohibit “data mining, robots, or similar data gathering and extraction tools.” According to people familiar with the matter, the company had previously warned Perplexity in November 2024 to stop using AI agents for purchases until an agreement was reached — a directive the startup initially honored.However, Amazon claims that by August 2025, Perplexity’s Comet browser agent resumed shopping on users’ behalf, this time masquerading as a Google Chrome browser. When Amazon blocked the agent, Perplexity allegedly released an updated version designed to circumvent the restriction.In an interview, Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas said the company had no intention of disguising its software and dismissed Amazon’s complaint as anti-competitive.The standoff comes as Perplexity — now valued at $20 billion — faces broader scrutiny for its use of online data. The startup has previously been accused by publishers of using content in its AI summaries without permission and of obtaining scraped Reddit data. Perplexity denies wrongdoing, saying it “fights for users’ rights to freely access public knowledge.”Srinivas insisted Comet does not scrape or train on Amazon data, only performing authorized user-directed actions. In a draft blog post reviewed by Bloomberg, Perplexity accused Amazon of trying to “eliminate user rights” to protect its advertising business, which generates billions from product placements in search results.Incidentally, Perplexity is both an Amazon Web Services (AWS) customer and part of Amazon’s ecosystem. The startup has pledged “hundreds of millions” of dollars in commitments to Amazon Web Services, and its CEO has even shared the stage at AWS events.","Amazon accused Perplexity of computer fraud and terms-of-service violations.

Trump’s growing crypto ties







Binance CEO Richard Teng has denied reports claiming that the cryptocurrency exchange played a role in boosting a Trump-linked stablecoin before its former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) received a presidential pardon, says a CNBC report.The controversy stems from a $2 billion investment Binance received from Abu Dhabi’s state-owned fund MGX, which was settled using USD1, a stablecoin created by the Trump family’s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial. Lawmakers and reports had alleged that Binance’s decision to list USD1 helped strengthen the token’s reputation — possibly influencing Zhao’s pardon.In an interview with CNBC, Teng said “First of all, the usage of USD1 [for the] transaction between MGX as a strategic investor into Binance, that was decided by MGX ... We didn’t partake in that decision”.“As the largest crypto ecosystem in the world, we regularly engage with promising new projects. Sometimes it works out. Sometimes it doesn’t. In the case of USD1, I’m glad that both parties worked it out,” he added.According to the Wall Street Journal, Binance allegedly helped develop the technology behind USD1 and facilitated MGX’s investment using the token — claims that Teng has denied.The report also said World Liberty Financial benefited significantly from USD1’s listing on Binance and its partnership with PancakeSwap, a crypto marketplace associated with Binance.The issue has drawn attention from U.S. lawmakers, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who accused Binance and the Trump administration of corruption. “First, Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to a criminal money laundering charge. Then he boosted one of Donald Trump’s crypto ventures and lobbied for a pardon,” Warren said last month.Zhao resigned as Binance CEO in 2023 after pleading guilty to charges related to money laundering. However, he remains the company’s major shareholder.President Donald Trump pardoned him last month, saying he did so “at the request of a lot of very good people.” Since returning to office, Trump has become more supportive of the crypto industry, introducing new legislation and easing restrictions on exchanges such as Coinbase and Ripple.","Binance CEO Richard Teng has denied reports claiming that the cryptocurrency exchange played a role in boosting a Trump-linked stablecoin.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, which will allow users to stream select titles without requiring a paid Game Pass subscription. The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees.

The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Looks like quantum computing is becoming relevant.”Announcing the major breakthrough, Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote:The achievement marks a historic breakthrough in quantum computing. For the first time ever, a quantum computer has performed a complex, verifiable calculation faster than any supercomputer could — about 13,000 times faster. This moment is being called a “verifiable quantum advantage.""Using Google’s Willow quantum chip, researchers ran an advanced algorithm called Quantum Echoes (or OTOC — out-of-order time correlator).This algorithm helps scientists study how information spreads in quantum systems — things like molecules, magnets, or even black holes.The key part: the result was verifiable and repeatable, meaning other quantum computers could confirm it independently.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently shared a post on X, formerly Twitter, announcing a new breakthrough in quantum algorithms.

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You’ll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles – they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

Former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever makes appearance in Elon Musk's case against Sam Altman; tells the '6-day story' that 'shocked' Silicon Valley,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/former-openai-chief-scientist-ilya-sutskever-makes-appearance-in-elon-musks-case-against-sam-altman-tells-the-6-day-story-that-shocked-silicon-valley/articleshow/125089918.cms,"Ilya Sutskever has been planning the coup against Sam Altman for over a year





Ilya Sutskever 'hated' Sam Altman's leadership style





Employee revolt in favour of Sam Altman made Ilya Sutskever give up his plans





What Ilya Sutskever told court in Elon Musk vs Sam Altman case Memo against Sam Altman Ilya secretly wrote a 52-page memo accusing Sam Altman of “lying, manipulating execs & pitting them against each other.” Disappearing email He sent the memo via a disappearing email so Altman wouldn’t “make it disappear.” Source of evidence He admitted most of the evidence came from Mira Murati’s screenshots. Post-firing proposal After Sam’s firing, Anthropic proposed merging with OpenAI and “taking over leadership.” Plan to remove Sam Altman Ilya said he had been waiting a year for the right board dynamics to oust Sam. Reaction expectation He believed employees would “cheer” when Sam was removed — but they didn’t.





Nearly two years after OpenAI ’s dramatic boardroom upheaval, new details have emerged about the brief ousting of CEO Sam Altman — a corporate saga that stunned Silicon Valley and reshaped the future of the world’s most influential AI company. According to a newly released deposition from OpenAI co-founder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, the move to fire Altman in November 2023 stemmed from deep internal mistrust and months of growing tension among the company’s leadership. The deposition was made public as part of Elon Musk ’s ongoing lawsuit against Altman and OpenAI, shedding rare light on the inner workings of the AI giant.Sutskever revealed that he had spent more than a year contemplating Altman’s removal, ultimately presenting a 52-page memo to independent board members outlining what he described as a “consistent pattern of lying, undermining his executives, and pitting them against one another.”The scientist, who co-founded OpenAI alongside Altman and Musk in 2015, said that by late 2023, he believed “the appropriate action for the board to take was to terminate Altman.”Sutskever’s memo detailed concerns about Altman’s leadership style and internal behavior. He accused the CEO of undermining then–Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati and creating divisions between senior researchers — including Sutskever himself and research director Jakub Pachocki, who is now OpenAI’s chief scientist — by offering conflicting accounts of company direction.The deposition also referenced Altman’s earlier controversies at startup accelerator Y Combinator, where Sutskever claimed he was ousted for similar behavior — launching multiple projects without clear strategy and fostering internal competition.Once Sutskever believed the board was ready, he moved. On November 17, 2023, OpenAI’s board announced Altman’s dismissal, citing a lack of confidence in his leadership. What followed was a swift and unprecedented employee revolt: nearly the entire staff — 738 employees — signed a letter threatening to quit unless Altman was reinstated.Within four days, Altman returned as CEO on November 21, and the directors who had supported his removal — including Sutskever — either resigned or were replaced.In one of the more surprising revelations, Sutskever disclosed that during Altman’s brief absence, OpenAI held talks with rival AI firm Anthropic about a possible merger that would have placed Anthropic’s leadership in charge of OpenAI. The proposal reportedly gained some board support but collapsed as employee backlash mounted and Altman regained control.As Musk’s lawsuit continues, the testimony offers the clearest picture yet of what drove OpenAI’s brief but consequential coup — and how Altman’s swift return cemented his grip over the company now defining the global race for artificial intelligence.","OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever revealed he had been planning the coup against CEO Sam Altman for over a year.

NCLAT sets aside 'most-damaging' section in CCI's 158-page order for WhatsApp; no longer 'banned' to …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nclat-sets-aside-most-damaging-section-in-ccis-158-page-order-for-whatsapp-no-longer-banned-to-/articleshow/125089613.cms,"“We are setting aside the findings of the Commission insofar as it holds breach of Section 4 (2)(D) and setting aside the directions in paragraph 247.1, (which stated) WhatsApp will not share user data collected on its platform with other data companies or advertising purposes for a period of five years from the date of receipt of this order.”

What Meta said about CCI’s order



“Click to WhatsApp”

“No other player comes close in terms of user dependence, network effects and cross-platform synergy,”

“take it or leave it”





The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) recently set aside the directive from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) that had barred WhatsApp from sharing user data with Meta group companies for advertising purposes. The NCLAT bench, comprising Justice (retd) Ashok Bhushan and Member (Technical) Barun Mitra, modified the 158-page order that CCI passed in November 2024 and set aside the portion of the CCI order that found Facebook-parent Meta guilty of abusing its dominant position in the Over-The-Top (OTT) messaging market to protect its position in the online display advertising market. However, the NCLAT upheld other parts of the original order, including the Rs 213.14 crore penalty imposed on the social media giant.While announcing the order, the NCLAT bench said:The original November 2024 CCI order had imposed the penalty after finding that WhatsApp’s 2021 privacy policy update constituted an abuse of dominance.The regulator concluded that the “take-it-or-leave-it” approach imposed unfair conditions on users. The original CCI order also imposed a five-year ban on data sharing and required WhatsApp to specify the purpose of data collection, a condition that has now been lifted. Earlier, the NCLAT stayed the penalty in January 2025, contingent on a 50% deposit by WhatsApp or its parent company, Meta.According to a Bar & Bench report, senior advocate Amit Sibal, representing Meta, argued that the Commission’s findings were based on overstatements and assumptions. He stated that user data was not shared with Meta for advertising purposes, except in limited, optional cases, such as thefeature.Even in those instances, users were shown a transparency screen and were not required to interact with businesses through that feature, Sibal added.Meanwhile, senior advocate Balbir Singh, representing the CCI, argued that Meta’s scale, resources, and integration across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp strengthened its position in the messaging app market.he said.He added that WhatsApp used this position to enforce the 2021 privacy policy on abasis, creating pressure through mandatory notifications that made users fear losing access. The policy, he noted, also removed the earlier opt-out option, requiring even those who had previously declined data sharing in 2016 to accept it.In September, NCLAT reserved its order after hearing Meta Platforms and WhatsApp’s petitions challenging the CCI’s penalty related to WhatsApp’s 2021 privacy policy update. Earlier this year, in January, NCLAT issued an interim order staying the five-year ban on data-sharing between Meta and WhatsApp for advertising purposes.In its order, the CCI directed Meta to cease anti-competitive conduct and implement behavioural remedies within a set timeline. These include prohibiting WhatsApp from sharing user data with other Meta entities for advertising for five years and ensuring that data sharing for non-WhatsApp services is not made a condition for accessing WhatsApp in India.","The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) recently set aside the directive from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) that had barred WhatsApp from sharing user data with Meta group companies for advertising purposes.

Here’s what Sridhar Vembu wrote

Below is how the Arattai app design looks now. We offer a tab e2ee (for end to end encrypted) and any user can set that as the default for all personal chats. We will have end to end for group chats (up to some group size limit) later.

Now your feedback needed on:

(Option 1) Any user can make e2ee default for all their one to one chats or pick a particular chat to be in e2ee mode. The app will go to e2ee even if one of the parties has set e2ee as their only mode and the other user has not set e2ee as their only mode.

(Option 2) We are also thinking of Arattai system wide default of e2ee for all one-to-one chats. This means that e2ee mode is the only option available for one to one chats. Group chats in e2ee mode will arrive later.

Some people do like the option of cloud based chat for some of their chats (device storage limits don't matter) so we have been thinking of option 1 but we could easily adopt option 2 (option 2 is cheaper for us!).





Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently shared an online post, sharing a first look of the company’s messaging app Arattai’s new design. In the post, Vembu revealed that the app claimed to rival WhatsApp now supports end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for personal chats. The feature aims to make conversations more secure and private for users. Vembu said that users can now choose to make E2EE the default mode on Arattai for all personal chats. He also shared a screenshot showing how users can switch between regular and encrypted modes within the app.In the post, Vembu also sought feedback from users on how encryption should be applied across the platform. He outlined two options:Option 1: Users can decide whether to make E2EE the default for all their one-on-one chats or activate it only for specific conversations. If one participant in a chat chooses E2EE, the conversation will automatically switch to the encrypted mode.Option 2: Make E2EE the system-wide default for all one-on-one chats, meaning encryption would be the only available mode.","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu shared an online post, sharing a first look of the company’s messaging app Arattai's new design.

Shein apologises

Doll scandal adds to Shein troubles in France





Chinese-founded fast-fashion giant Shein is under fire in France just days before opening its first physical store, after the country’s anti-fraud authorities launched an investigation into the sale of childlike Sex dolls on its online platform. France’s consumer watchdog, the Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF), said last week that it had reported Shein to prosecutors and the national media regulator Arcom after discovering the dolls on the site. The watchdog said the dolls’ presentation and descriptions “make it difficult to doubt the child pornography nature of the content.”According to French media, one doll — around 80 centimeters (30 inches) tall and depicted holding a teddy bear — was accompanied by an explicitly sexual caption. The Paris prosecutor’s office confirmed it had opened an investigation not only into Shein but also into rival e-commerce platforms AliExpress, Temu, and Wish over similar listings.Shein has since removed the items and pledged full cooperation with French authorities. “We will cooperate fully with the judicial authorities and share the names of those who purchased such dolls,” Quentin Ruffat, Shein’s spokesperson in France, told RMC radio.He called the listings “serious, unacceptable, and intolerable,” attributing them to “a malfunction in our processes and governance.”“Shein does not tolerate any violation of its internal rules and policies,” the company said in a separate statement, promising safeguards to prevent similar incidents.The scandal comes at a delicate time for Shein, which is preparing to open its first offline store in France in partnership with Société des Grands Magasins (SGM). SGM hopes the store will attract younger shoppers and help revive struggling department stores such as BHV and regional Galeries Lafayette outlets.Even before the controversy, Shein’s arrival in France had already sparked political backlash. Lawmakers have accused the company of “destroying shops” and exploiting customs loopholes that exempt low-value e-commerce imports from duties, allowing it to undercut local retailers.“Shein impacts the vitality of our regions, destroys jobs and destroys shops,” French lawmaker Véronique Louwagie told Reuters. Shein has defended its model, saying its “on-demand” production system, which makes small batches before scaling up based on demand, is more efficient and sustainable. The company argues its online marketplace also helps French brands reach wider audiences.However, the combination of ethical outrage and economic criticism has turned Shein’s much-hyped French debut into a public relations crisis — one that could test its global ambitions.",Chinese-founded fast-fashion giant Shein is under fire in France.

Coca-Cola GenAI head has a plea to ad agencies



At#TheCocaColaCompany, we firmly believe AI is a powerful force multiplier for creativity and overall Marketing Transformation. It’s all about empowering storytellers to push boundaries and elevate the creative landscape.

That’s why I’m super excited to share our new Coca-Cola Christmas films! For the second year, we’ve reimagined our iconic “Holidays are Coming” film, blending our rich heritage with cutting-edge GenAI.

Last year, we set a global milestone with the world’s first entirely GenAI-created film on broadcast media - a bold leap that broke new ground. This year, we’ve taken things to the next level with even deeper human-AI collaboration. We crafted technical precision, cinematic storytelling, and production

quality. Leveraging advanced GenAI tools, we controlled every detail, from camera angels to physics-driven realism. We produced seamless narrative continuity and character consistency, crafting immersive stories that resonate deeply.

We couldn’t have done it without our incredible partners, Secret Level and Silverside AI, who collaborated with us beyond just film creation – they took a transformational leap with us into the future of creativity and technology.





Coca-Cola has once again used generative AI for its holiday advertising, rolling out a new Christmas campaign, despite criticism leveled at last year’s AI-generated spots. The new commercial, titled “Holidays Are Coming,” aims to reimagine the brand’s classic Coke caravan advertisements. Along with the ad campaign, Pratik Thakar, global vice president and head of Generative AI at the Coca-Cola company, appealed to ad agencies to ‘work together’.The 2024 Coca-Cola ads drew backlash for their unrealistic visual elements, including gliding wheels and “uncanny-looking faces.” This year, the company used animals like rabbits, polar bears, penguins and more – instead of humans – in an apparent effort to sidestep issues with generating realistic human figures.Other technical improvements include realistically turning wheels on the iconic Coke trucks that appeared to glide over snow in the previous year’s ads. Coca-Cola collaborated with Silverside and Secret Level on its latest holiday campaign – the same two AI studios that previously worked on the brand's 2024 Christmas advertisements.Following the release of Coca-Cola's latest AI-generated holiday campaign, the company’s head of Generative AI issued a public appeal to advertising agencies, stressing the continued importance of human creative talent.During Brandweek – a three-day brand marketing symposium and a part of Adweek – the executive posted a direct plea: “Please, let’s work together. Humans are still superior than the machines.”He also wrote on LinkedIn saying that “AI is to push boundaries and elevate the creative landscape.”","Coca-Cola has once again used generative AI for its holiday advertising, rolling out a new Christmas campaign.

What China said about the Dutch government taking control of Neperia



“The Dutch side persists in its unilateral course without taking concrete actions to resolve the issue, which will inevitably deepen the adverse impact on the global semiconductor supply chain.

Neither China nor the global industry wishes to see this.”

What the Netherlands said about its Nexperia dispute with China



“We remain in contact with the Chinese authorities and our international partners to work toward a constructive solution that is good for Nexperia and our economies.”

“would take appropriate measures to ensure the resumption of trade from Nexperia's facilities in China.”

""progress""





China has renewed its fight with the Netherlands over one of the key suppliers of car companies, including Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes and GM. In its latest accusations, China’s commerce ministry said the Netherlands had failed to work with Beijing to resolve the dispute over the Dutch government's seizure of chipmaker Nexperia. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the Chinese ministry warned that this lack of cooperation could lead to further supply chain disruptions. The Dutch government took control of Nexperia in September due to concerns regarding its Chinese parent company, Wingtech. Beijing's warning follows the rush by European automotive suppliers to secure exemptions to Chinese export restrictions on Nexperia products made in China, which were imposed shortly after the seizure.The commerce ministry stated that China acted responsibly by offering these exemptions, but the Netherlands has not responded similarly. It called on the Netherlands toin Nexperia's internal affairs and to work in awith the Chinese government to find a solution.In a statement published on its official website (as seen by Reuters), China’s commerce ministry wrote:The Chinese ministry claimed that the Netherlands has not taken action on the dispute, highlighting how difficult it is for the two countries to reach a long-term agreement on who should own Nexperia.

Scott’s other donations as part of broader DEI initiatives









Billionaire philanthropist and Jeff Bezos ’ ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, has donated $80 million to Howard University, marking one of the largest single donations in the school’s 158-year history and continuing her recent surge of major contributions to diversity and equity causes. The donation, announced over the weekend by Howard University, comes as Scott – estimated to be worth $35.6 billion, as per The Wall Street Journal – has been on what observers are calling a philanthropic roll, making several multimillion-dollar gifts to DEI and disaster relief causes in recent weeks.The donation is unrestricted, allowing the university to allocate the funds as it sees fit. Of the $80 million, $63 million will go to Howard University's general operations, while $17 million will support the school's College of Medicine.“This historic investment will not only help maintain our current momentum, but will help support essential student aid, advance infrastructure improvements, and build a reserve fund to further sustain operational continuity, student success, academic excellence, and research innovation,” said Wayne A.I. Frederick, Howard interim president and president emeritus, in a statement.The university says the gift arrives at an ""opportune time"" as the federal government shutdown has delayed annual federal appropriations that Howard receives to support student success, academic programming, research, and operations at both the university and Howard University Hospital.The shutdown, which began October 1, has halted new grant awards from the Department of Education after nearly 95% of non-student aid staff were furloughed, leaving only essential personnel working.Scott’s donation to Howard builds on other recent donations focused on diversity, equity and inclusion. She recently gave $42 million to 10,000 Degrees, a Bay Area nonprofit expanding college access for low-income and largely non-white students, alongside other eight-figure commitments to Native student scholars and HBCU endowments through the United Negro College Fund (UNCF).The Howard donation comes just weeks after regulatory filings revealed Scott had reduced her Amazon stake by $12.6 billion.According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing dated September 30 and first reported by Bloomberg, Scott has cut her holdings in the e-commerce giant by nearly 42%, reducing her stake to $12.6 billion. She now holds 81.1 million Amazon shares—down 58 million from a year earlier.The reduction occurred despite Amazon shares more than doubling in value since Scott's 2019 divorce from Jeff Bezos, the company's co-founder.Scott obtained most of her wealth following her divorce from Bezos and has pledged to give away the majority of it. After receiving approximately 4% of Amazon in the divorce settlement, she has donated $19 billion to more than 2,000 nonprofits over the past five years.","The donation is unrestricted, allowing the university to allocate the funds as it sees fit.

YouTube TV blackout: Read email that Google-owned company shared with Disney leaders over their ask to restore ABC for 24 hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/youtube-tv-blackout-read-email-that-google-owned-company-shared-with-disney-leaders-over-their-ask-to-restore-abc-for-24-hours/articleshow/125086236.cms,"Thanks for your proposal.

We agree that the right priority here is to give customers what they want. As you know from the many content disputes you’ve been part of, customers don’t want companies fighting and content blackouts. But unfortunately, your proposal would permit us to return Disney’s ABC stations only for a day and will cause customer confusion among those who may briefly see ABC on YouTube TV only to lose it again shortly after.

Gemini Comes To Chrome: How Google Is Improving Browser With AI - Explained

There are plenty of other options for customers - election news information is very widely available across other broadcast stations and news networks on YouTube TV, as well as on the main YouTube service, for free. In fact, on the last two U.S. election days, the vast majority of tuned in YouTube TV subscribers chose not to watch ABC.

Publicly resorting to the same tactic that Disney relied on in past disputes fails to acknowledge the distinction between YouTube and other distribution platforms. As you know, Disney can continue to livestream news information on the ABC News YouTube page, which has 19.1M subscribers, and its ABC local stations can also do so on their YouTube pages.

To truly achieve what is best for our mutual customers, we propose immediately restoring the Disney channels that our customers watch: ABC and the ESPN networks, while we continue to negotiate. Those are the channels that people want.

If you agree with our proposal and give us approval, we can get our operational teams together and get these channels live in hours. Let us know how you’d like to proceed.

More importantly, let's get a fair deal done so we can get back to providing our mutual customers with the content they want. Thank you.





The dispute between Disney and YouTube TV escalated significantly this week when Disney publicly requested that the streaming service temporarily restore its ABC channel for subscribers ahead of the US Election Day on November 4. Disney-owned networks, including ESPN and ABC, went dark for YouTube TV subscribers last week after the companies failed to reach a new distribution agreement. Despite the ongoing blackout, Disney urged YouTube TV to put ""the public interest first,"" arguing that subscribers should have access to the election information they rely on while negotiations continue. YouTube TV, however, not only refused the request but countered that its own data showed its subscribers deliberately avoided watching ABC during the last two Election Days.Here’s the full email that YouTube sent to Disney leadership","Disney-owned networks, including ESPN and ABC, went dark for YouTube TV subscribers last week after the companies failed to reach a new distribution agreement.

AI data centres are propping up small-town America - but can the boom last?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-data-centres-are-propping-up-small-town-america-but-can-the-boom-last/articleshow/125083511.cms,"Zoom Out



The Dogshit Economics of AI



The Asbestos Economy



From Boomtown to Bustville



The Punchline







For decades, small-town America’s biggest exports were potatoes, boredom, and ambitious kids who couldn’t wait to leave. Then the machines came.In Umatilla, Oregon — a dusty town once known for its prison and chemical weapons depot — Amazon arrived with a server farm the size of an airport. The locals called it “Area 51.” Overnight, the strip clubs gave way to strip malls, and the daughter of Mexican farmhands became a real estate star, selling homes to out-of-town contractors and coders.As The Wall Street Journal noted, “a growing fleet of Amazon data centers has turned the region around Umatilla into an unlikely nerve center for one of the most expensive infrastructure build-outs in US history.” The change was immediate: home prices doubled, restaurants filled up, and the city’s budget ballooned from millions to hundreds of millions.For a while, the American dream ran on fibre-optic cables and free Wi-Fi. The tech boom that once skipped over rural America had finally arrived — only it didn’t bring startups or entrepreneurs. It brought windowless concrete fortresses, endless server racks, and the hum of machines that never sleep. Data became the new crop, and for a brief, shining moment, the harvest seemed infinite.But like every boom, it came with a question no one wanted to ask: what happens when the building stops?To understand the answer, you have to zoom out — from Umatilla’s hillsides to the glass towers of Silicon Valley, where the AI boom was born not from invention but exhaustion.Big Tech had run out of new frontiers. The social media bubble had burst, the metaverse had become a meme, and streaming was bleeding money. So, like any good conjurer, the Valley found a new story to sell: artificial intelligence.AI became the miracle narrative for Wall Street’s imagination — a trillion-dollar dream that machines would think, talk, and save capitalism from boredom. But behind the hype and the demos, the numbers don’t work.Every large model — from ChatGPT to Gemini — costs billions to train, thousands of high-end chips to run, and enough electricity to power a city. Each new version burns more cash than the last. Unlike the internet or smartphones, these systems don’t get cheaper with scale; they just get hungrier.Cory Doctorow, the writer and tech dissident who coined “enshittification,” calls it what it is: “dogshit unit economics.” Microsoft “invests” in OpenAI by letting it use its servers for free. OpenAI records that as income. Microsoft counts it as revenue. Nvidia “funds” data centres that instantly spend that same money buying Nvidia chips. It’s the same dollar passed around in different costumes, each time declared as growth. It’s not innovation — it’s accounting cosplay. The AI boom is a financial ouroboros, swallowing itself while calling it progress.Meanwhile, the fantasy trickles down. Companies fire employees because AI will “replace” them, even though it can barely write an email without hallucinating. Small towns bulldoze farmland to build data centres that offer only a handful of permanent jobs. Governments subsidise electricity for machines that mostly generate heat and hype. Doctorow compares AI to asbestos — a miracle material we’re stuffing into the foundations of civilisation because it seems useful right now, only for future generations to dig it out at ruinous cost.Back in Umatilla, the new prosperity feels brittle. The construction workers are thinning out. The housing costs have outrun local wages. And the townspeople who once toasted their luck are quietly wondering whether the servers humming in the hills will keep humming forever. They probably won’t. The AI boom is starting to look like a Potemkin village built on borrowed chips and borrowed confidence. The money flowing into small-town America isn’t new wealth — it’s the echo of speculative capital looking for the next high. When it bursts, the glow of those server racks will dim, and the silence that follows will sound like déjà vu — another great American boom that ended where it began: in belief.The apocalypse won’t come from sentient machines plotting humanity’s demise. It’ll come from spreadsheets imploding under the weight of their own optimism. Silicon Valley sold small-town America the dream of a digital future. What it delivered was a Ponzi scheme in a hard hat — the illusion of progress built on the oldest American instinct of all: to get rich before the lights go out.","Big Tech had run out of new frontiers.

Google's Holiday 100: What people are shopping for — and what it says about us,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/googles-holiday-100-what-people-are-shopping-for-and-what-it-says-about-us/articleshow/125081370.cms,"1. The Homebody



2. The One with Style



3. The Traveller



4. The Beauty Maven



5. The Fitness Fan



6. The Little One



The Emotional Economy



Comfort: the homebody’s language of safety.

Identity: the stylist’s quiet expression of self.

Control: the beauty maven’s ritualised calm.

Continuity: the fitness fan’s discipline as devotion.

Freedom: the traveller’s precision in motion.

Connection: the little one’s rediscovery of touch



The Meaning Behind the List







Every festive season brings its lists — wish lists, shopping lists, to-do lists — but only one tells a larger story about who we are. The Holiday 100 is that list. Drawn from global search data, it’s not a catalogue of consumerism but a snapshot of sentiment. It shows, with unnerving precision, how modern life has shifted from chasing novelty to craving stability.The Holiday 100 sorts people into six archetypes — the Homebody, the One with Style, the Traveller, the Beauty Maven, the Fitness Fan, and the Little One. Each category is a psychological portrait disguised as a shopping guide.The Homebody is no longer a recluse. They’re the modern curator of calm. This year’s top-searched products — Cozy Earth Bubble Cuddle Blanket, Casper Original Pillow, Bombas Merino Wool Blend Socks, West Elm Homescent Diffuser, Red Light Mask, and even a TV Projector from Home Depot — reveal how comfort has become a full-time aesthetic.Post-pandemic, the home has transformed from shelter to sanctuary. People aren’t furnishing spaces anymore; they’re constructing emotional ecosystems. The search for warmth, scent, and softness isn’t about luxury — it’s about control. In a world that feels unpredictable, the homebody’s purchases are protective spells woven in cotton, wool, and light.If the homebody seeks stillness, the One with Style seeks continuity.Their favourites this year include Ralph Lauren Cable-Knit Sweaters, adidas Samba Jane Sneakers, Coach Nolita 19 Bags, Gap VintageSoft Joggers, Kendra Scott Bella Hoops, and minimalist Crescent Bags.This isn’t fashion as reinvention — it’s fashion as reassurance. The rise of heritage textures and timeless shapes suggests that people are tired of algorithmic churn. The old markers of extravagance have been replaced by subtle signals of authenticity. Style has matured into quiet confidence — a language of self-assurance spoken in wool, leather, and understatement.Once a symbol of freedom, travel has become an exercise in precision. The Traveller’s wishlist is practical and purposeful: Samsonite Outline Pro Carry-On, TUMI Split Travel Kit, Movado Bold Evolution 2.0 Watch, Google Pixel Buds Pro 2, and Duluth Trading Co. Lifetime Leather Tote.The fantasy is no longer about escape; it’s about efficiency. People want to move — but smoothly, safely, predictably. The romance of wanderlust has been replaced by the art of packing light. Even the tools of travel now reflect a need for order: seamless, modular, streamlined. To travel in 2025 is to navigate chaos with curated calm.If travel is about precision, beauty is about ritual. The Beauty Maven’s top searches include Olaplex Nº.7 Bonding Oil, rhode Glazing Milk, ILIA Super Serum Skin Tint, Makeup by Mario Ethereal Eyes Palette, e.l.f. Glow Reviver Lip Balm, and the Conair InfinitiPRO Styling Wand.It’s a shift from transformation to maintenance — from spectacle to stability. The new beauty ideal isn’t about changing how you look; it’s about staying consistent. The surge in searches for “Sephora gift sets” signals that self-care has become a social currency — a shared language of resilience.Perhaps the most striking change is the collapse of hierarchy. Affordable and luxury coexist peacefully. People aren’t buying prestige; they’re buying performance. In the modern beauty ritual, routine is rebellion — against chaos, burnout, and impermanence.The Fitness Fan is the disciplined counterpart to the beauty maven. The most popular searches — adizero Running Shoes, Pilates Rings, Athleisure Leggings, Boxing Gloves, Curl Bars, and Personalised Yoga Straps — point to a culture of continuity, not competition.Gone is the obsession with transformation. Fitness today is about rhythm: the quiet satisfaction of showing up. The aesthetic of health has become softer, slower, more sustainable. People are no longer chasing “after” photos — they’re chasing balance.To buy a jump rope now isn’t to prove ambition. It’s to anchor discipline in a distracted age.And then there’s the Little One — the quiet heart of the Holiday 100. The top toys of the season — Lovevery Helper Play Kit, Nature Explorer Set, Pottery Barn Kids Solar System Backpack, FurReal Maggie, and the timeless Checkers Board Game — point toward a subtle rebellion against screens.Parents, it seems, are trying to buy back wonder. The surge in tactile, hands-on toys reflects a yearning for slowness and sensory discovery. In a digital world, these are gifts that ground childhood in touch, imagination, and curiosity — the very things adulthood forgets.Across all six archetypes, one truth emerges: consumption has turned introspective. The Holiday 100 doesn’t just track trends — it maps emotion.Each product is a small answer to a bigger question: how do we hold steady in an unsteady world?At its core, the Holiday 100 isn’t a shopping guide. It’s a psychological record of how people cope. A blanket isn’t just warmth; it’s control. A carry-on isn’t just luggage; it’s mobility within limits. A skincare routine isn’t vanity; it’s structure in chaos.Every item on the list — every search, every click — reveals a quiet human instinct to find order, comfort, and meaning in small things. We’re not buying to impress anymore. We’re buying to belong: to our homes, to our habits, to our better selves.The Holiday 100 may look like a list of products. But read closely, and it’s really a map of modern resilience — proof that we’re not chasing more, we’re collecting calm, one small act of intention at a time.","The Holiday 100 sorts people into six archetypes — the Homebody, the One with Style, the Traveller, the Beauty Maven, the Fitness Fan, and the Little One.

By embracing sustainable solutions and responsible recycling, we can enjoy the benefits of technology while safeguarding the environment for future generations.According to the UN, e-waste volumes are growing five times faster than e-waste recycling, with an 82% jump since 2010. India, the world's third-largest producer of electronic waste, has seen its e-waste rise significantly over the past five years, from 1.01 million metric tonnes (MT) in 2019-20 to 1.751 million MT in 2023-24.India's Circular Economy Action Plan demonstrates both challenges and opportunities. Businesses are adapting to regulatory frameworks and financial constraints while responding to changing consumer demands, showcasing their commitment to sustainability and innovation for a brighter future.In this context, business decision makers often ask themselves: How can we reconcile the pressing need to innovate and remain competitive with our equally important need to be environmentally responsible? Thankfully, the answer is not about choosing one or the other.Instead, it lies in reimagining our relationship with technology and embracing an end-to-end approach to sustainability: where resources are valued, products are designed with sustainable materials and waste is minimised.Product design plays a significant role in reducing waste and thinking about how to reduce production costs in the long-term. A sustainable approach begins with creating guidelines for how components are designed before they go on to form complete systems.Product design dictates how practical it is to reuse and refurbish these components or to harvest recyclable materials at the end of a device’s life. Designing with durability and modularity in mind means that parts can come back through a services network before re-entering the supply chain, to be used to repair and refurbish systems. For customers and consumers, there is the added benefit of being able to purchase these products at a lower price point.For components that cannot be easily reused, designs could focus on easy disassembly paired with clear markings, minimised paintings and coatings and simplified material choice. This makes it easier for the recycling industry to recover more material, more quickly.Information technology is heavily dependent on finite raw materials, including minerals like lithium or cobalt, which are associated with high energy, water consumption and environmental damage during extraction. Many companies design products for easy repair, reuse, and recycling to keep materials in circulation longer and reduce waste. Using recycled and renewable materials can lower the environmental impact of the products and packaging. Every pound of recovered steel, aluminium, plastic, and copper means less material extracted from the earth, supporting sustainability.Demand for alternatives is increasing, particularly as they do not deplete additional natural resources and emit fewer greenhouse gases in their production and during the product life cycle. For example, low-emission aluminium and recycled cobalt are being used in AI PCs. Another alternative material is a bioplastic derived from production of paper , which is used as a new component for technology casings.When we design products, we must design for circularity. So, one of the most immediate initiatives is for the IT design process to operate as a closed-loop model, which keeps products and materials in circulation as long as possible.AI also presents transformative opportunities to help businesses meet broader sustainability objectives. AI operations contribute 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), hence making it crucial to ensure that the AI model and infrastructure itself have strong sustainability credentials.The opportunity for leveraging AI as a tool lies in its ability to identify issues more efficiently around sustainability, meaning they can be addressed more promptly. By analysing vast amounts of data from various sources, AI can identify fixes quickly than alternatives. The insights derived are useful for informing strategies that reduce waste across everything from the supply chain itself, through to manufacturing and packaging optimisation.Reducing energy consumption and e-waste within AI requires a multi-faceted approach, including embracing energy-efficient hardware like low-power processors and accelerators, which can significantly shrink carbon footprints. For example, sustainable data centre solutions like storage and servers built with leading liquid and air cooling, emissions tracking and energy efficiency are top of mind. Therefore, consideration about the modular design and upgradeability of AI hardware can minimise the e-waste coming out of the infrastructure needed to power the models.Finally, implementing responsible recycling and disposal practices for outdated components is critical for minimising waste and maximising resource recovery.Because sustainability is now a business imperative, it should be intricately woven through business operations. Responsible practices should be integrated into every facet of the organisation, extending outwards to suppliers, partners and customers. Having clear, internal and external alignment on these goals makes it easier to drive more sustainable materials innovation, pioneer new energy solutions and navigate changing regulatory landscapes.Cross-functional collaboration is key to empowering change within the whole ecosystem; for instance, if it becomes a requirement that products need to be designed with materials innovation at heart, then suppliers are challenged to innovate to meet those specific demands. This end-to-end approach drives more meaningful, widespread change and helps to create a more sustainable ecosystem.While the digital revolution has reshaped our world and created new, exciting possibilities, its environmental impact can't be ignored, nor can it continue in the same way. The escalating e-waste crisis calls for a shift in the way we approach building and designing new technologies. At this juncture, it's time to embrace circularity, resource efficiency, and employ longer-term thinking when it comes to technological innovation. By exploring new ways of thinking, businesses can begin shaping a digital future that strives to grow in balance with the environment, creating opportunities for both progress and sustainability.","According to the UN, e-waste volumes are growing five times faster than e-Waste recycling.

Read Meta chief AI officer Alexandr Wang's full memo to employees



Earlier today, we made some changes to MSL to move us toward being the most agile and talent-dense team in the industry. By reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, and each person will be more load-bearing and have more scope and impact.

It's never an easy decision to say goodbye to colleagues. These are talented people who have worked extremely hard and contributed to our Al effort.

Anyone in North America whose role was impacted has already been notified. Those who may be impacted in EMEA have been notified and remain subject to consultation.

We are supporting the majority of those impacted in finding new roles at the company. We have spun up a tiger team of recruiters to help this group find the right match for their expertise and land in roles through an expedited hiring process.

This by no means signals any decrease in investment. In fact, we will continue to hire industry-leading Al-native talent. Our goal is to enable MSL to move faster. We remain excited about the models we are training, our ambitious compute plans, and the products we are building, and I'm confident in our path to superintelligence.





Meta's chief AI officer Alexandr Wang announced recently that the company is laying off approximately 600 positions from its Meta Superintelligence Labs division. ""By reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, and each person will be more load-bearing and have more scope and impact,"" Wang wrote in his memo to staff members, as viewed by Business Insider and CNBC. The laid off employees have been placed on a non-working notice period through November 21, with their internal access removed and no work requirements during this transition.Affected employees will receive 16 weeks of severance plus two additional weeks for every completed year of service, minus the notice period. The company has assembled a specialised recruiting team to help displaced workers find alternative positions within Meta through an expedited hiring process.The layoffs targeted Meta's legacy AI infrastructure teams, the Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) unit, and product-focused positions, but did not affect employees in TBD Labs—the elite division housing recent high-profile recruits. Within Meta, the AI unit was considered bloated, with teams often competing for computing resources.""By reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, and each person will be more load-bearing and have more scope and impact,"" Wang stated in his memo.Wang emphasised that the restructuring doesn't signal decreased AI investment, stating the company will continue hiring ""industry-leading AI-native talent"". The cuts come as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has spent billions recruiting top researchers from rival companies like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft, with some receiving compensation packages worth hundreds of millions of dollars.Following the cuts, Meta's Superintelligence Labs workforce now sits at just under 3,000 employees."," Meta is laying off approximately 600 positions from its Meta Superintelligence Labs division.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

What Microsoft President said on shipping Nvidia AI chips

Microsoft expanding investment in UAE





Microsoft will reportedly be shipping Nvidia's most advanced artificial intelligence chips to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as part of a deal approved by the US Commerce Department. In an announcement, the software giant said that licenses approved in September under “stringent” safeguards enable it to ship more than 60,000 Nvidia chips. This includes Nvidia's most-advanced GB300 Grace Blackwell chips, for use in data centres in the Middle Eastern country.Incidentally, these are the same AI chips that President Donald Trump said that he will not allow Nvidia to sell to China. Asked by reporters if he will allow Nvidia to sell its most advanced chips Blackwell to China, Trump said he wouldn't.Microsoft is planning to spend more than $7.9 billion on data centers, cloud computing and employees in UAE over the next four years. Microsoft president Brad Smith announced the commitment in Abu Dhabi. The pledge includes plans to nearly triple the amount of Nvidia advanced chips Microsoft will operate in the nation.Updated licences granted in September allow Microsoft to ""ship the equivalent of 60,400 additional A100 chips ...involving Nvidia's even more advanced GB300 GPUs."" Microsoft said that it received US government licenses to ship AI chips to the UAE in September after meeting security criteria. “They’re not just acts of faith,” Smith said. “We had to satisfy very strict conditions about the cybersecurity, the physical security, the other security protection of these chips to ensure that they stay under our control. ”Smith added, ""We're using these GPUs to provide access to advanced AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source providers and Microsoft itself.""Microsoft is strengthening its role in the United Arab Emirates’ drive to diversify its economy beyond oil, emerging as a key partner in the country’s ambitions to become a regional hub for artificial intelligence and digital innovation.In early 2024, the tech giant invested $1.5 billion in G42, an Abu Dhabi-based AI company specializing in cybersecurity, cloud computing, and space technologies. As part of the deal, Microsoft President Brad Smith joined G42’s board, underscoring the strategic nature of the partnership.G42 said it has already deployed 21,500 chips equivalent to Nvidia’s A100 GPUs in the UAE, with approval from the Biden administration. The company plans to ship an additional 60,400 chips, including units from Nvidia’s latest GB300 series, in the near future. “Those will come in months, not years,” Smith said.The partnership also aligns with OpenAI’s expanding global footprint. Earlier this year, OpenAI — backed by Microsoft — selected the UAE as the first country outside the United States to host its Stargate data center project, a key component in scaling advanced AI infrastructure.The developments highlight how U.S. technology firms are increasingly shaping the UAE’s digital transformation strategy, even as global competition over AI infrastructure and semiconductor access intensifies.","Microsoft plans to spend $7.9 billion on data centers, cloud computing and employees in UAE over the next four years.

Why AI has NOT made “learn to code” obsolete





India has become GitHub’s fastest-growing developer hub and innovation centre, with the Microsoft-owned platform projecting that the country will surpass the United States with more than 57.5 million users by 2030. The country is also home to 21.9 million developers building on GitHub, making it the second-largest developer community in the world after the United States.From student skilling initiatives to enterprise AI adoption, GitHub is deepening its India-first strategy, according to chief operating officer Kyle Daigle, who recently spoke to ET. The company offers its Student Developer Pack free to Indian learners and provides year-long support to early-stage startups through its GitHub for Startups programme.Daigle noted that Indian IT services companies are leading globally in AI co-creation. Companies such as Infosys, Wipro, Cognizant, and Accenture are building centres of excellence around GitHub Copilot and running internal innovation drives including hackathons and AI agent trials.Since being acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion in 2018, GitHub has evolved from a code-hosting service to a full-stack AI development platform.Its AI coding assistant, GitHub Copilot, now has 20 million all-time users, and the product alone generates more revenue than the entire company did at the time of its acquisition.Following its move to make Copilot free for all users in December 2024, GitHub added 36 million users globally in 2025, bringing its total user base to 180 million. Daigle said the platform’s next phase will be anchored in AI-native software development, where intelligent agents handle everything from code generation to testing and deployment.GitHub is undergoing a leadership transition, with Thomas Dohmke stepping down as CEO this August. GitHub will now join Microsoft’s CoreAI division led by Jay Parikh, the former global head of engineering at Meta who joined Microsoft in October 2024. In a recent podcast interview, Dohmke made it clear that companies with a smart vision for the future will not be slashing tech jobs, but rather expanding their engineering teams to take full advantage of AI’s power. “The companies that are the smartest are going to hire more developers,” he said. “Because if you 10x a single developer, then 10 developers can do 100x.” His arithmetic is simple — and optimistic: artificial intelligence is not a subtractive force, but a multiplier.Dohmke debunked the growing myth that AI alone can spawn billion-dollar businesses without human coding knowledge. “The idea that AI without any coding skills lets you just build a billion-dollar business is mistaken,” Dohmke said. “Because if that were the case, everyone would do it.” His message is clear: Please note that AI is a remarkable tool, not a magic wand.","India has become GitHub’s fastest-growing developer hub and innovation centre.

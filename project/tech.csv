How Treasury Sanctions were violated

Cybersecurity researchers and documents reviewed by Reuters have uncovered a scheme by North Korean cyber spies who established two companies in the United States, flouting Treasury sanctions. These entities, Blocknovas LLC and Softglide LLC, registered in New Mexico and New York using fabricated identities and addresses, were allegedly used to distribute malicious software targeting individuals working within the cryptocurrency industry, according to researchers at the U.S. cybersecurity firm Silent Push. A third entity, Angeloper Agency, is also connected to this operation, though its U.S. registration remains unclear.Reuters' review of registration documents revealed that Blocknovas was registered in New Mexico and Softglide in New York. The individuals listed in these documents could not be located. Blocknovas' listed physical address in Warrenville, South Carolina, appears to be an empty lot on Google Maps, while Softglide seems to have been registered through a small tax office in Buffalo, New York.This activity underscores the evolving and extensive efforts by North Korea to target the cryptocurrency sector as a means of generating revenue for the government. Beyond hacking for foreign currency, the United States, South Korea, and the United Nations have reported that North Korea dispatches thousands of IT workers abroad to earn millions that help finance Pyongyang's nuclear missile program.Kasey Best, director of threat intelligence at Silent Push, highlighted the unusual nature of this tactic to Reuters, stating, ""This is a rare example of North Korean hackers actually managing to set up legal corporate entities in the U.S. in order to create corporate fronts used to attack unsuspecting job applicants.""Silent Push identified the hackers as part of a subgroup within the Lazarus Group, an elite North Korean hacking collective affiliated with Pyongyang's primary foreign intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau.While the FBI declined to comment directly on Blocknovas or Softglide, a seizure notice posted on Blocknovas' website by the bureau indicated that the domain was seized ""as part of a law enforcement action against North Korean Cyber Actors who utilized this domain to deceive individuals with fake job postings and distribute malware.""Prior to the seizure, FBI officials informed Reuters of their ongoing commitment to ""focus on imposing risks and consequences, not only on the DPRK actors themselves, but anybody who is facilitating their ability to conduct these schemes."" One FBI official described North Korean cyber operations as ""perhaps one of the most advanced persistent threats"" facing the United States. Silent Push confirmed multiple victims of this campaign, noting that ""specifically via Blocknovas, which is by far the most active of the three front companies,"" according to a report.The establishment of a North Korean-controlled company within the U.S., registered by the RGB, constitutes a violation of sanctions imposed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a division of the Treasury Department. It also breaches United Nations sanctions that prohibit North Korean commercial activities intended to support the isolated nation's government or military.","North Korean cyber spies established two companies in the United States, flouting Treasury sanctions.

FIRE lawyer William A Burck for his ties to Harvard University: Angry Donald Trump to his sons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/fire-lawyer-william-a-burck-for-his-ties-to-harvard-university-angry-donald-trump-to-his-sons/articleshow/120595876.cms,"President Donald Trump has reportedly instructed his sons to terminate the Trump Organization ’s outside ethics counsel, William A. Burck , due to Burck’s representation of Harvard University . In a social media post, Trump criticized Burck’s ties to Harvard, which sued the Trump administration after threats to cut billions in funding unless the university met certain demands.“Harvard is a threat to Democracy, with a lawyer, who represents me, who should therefore be forced to resign, immediately, or be fired,” Trump wrote about Burck, a comanaging partner at the firm Quinn Emanuel. “He’s not that good, anyway, and I hope that my very big and beautiful company, now run by my sons, gets rid of him ASAP!"", Trump wrote, calling Burck, a co-managing partner at Quinn Emanuel, “not that good” and urging his sons to remove him from the family business.Eric Trump confirmed the decision to Bloomberg, stating, “I see it as a conflict, and we’ll be moving in a different direction.”Burck, a former federal prosecutor, previously represented Trump administration officials during the special counsel’s Russia investigation. In Trump’s second term, he also facilitated a $40 million pro bono deal with the law firm Paul Weiss, which Trump targeted due to a former lawyer’s efforts to prosecute him in New York.The Trump Organization hired Burck to advise on ethical issues and new business deals, including a pledge to avoid foreign government contracts. However, Burck did not consult the organization before taking Harvard as a client. While no legal conflict is confirmed, his involvement in a lawsuit against the Trump administration likely provoked Trump’s ire.Burck’s firm, Quinn Emanuel, has handled other cases involving the federal government, including a meeting with the Justice Department to argue for dismissing corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams.","President Donald Trump has reportedly instructed his sons to terminate the Trump Organization ’s outside ethics counsel, William A.

Full list of the American States that have sued Trump administration in the US Court of International Trade over tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/full-list-of-the-american-states-that-have-sued-trump-administration-in-the-us-court-of-international-trade-over-tariffs/articleshow/120595809.cms,"12 American States that have sued Donald Trump administration are:

A coalition of twelve states filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Wednesday in the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York, seeking to halt its tariff policy, which they argue is illegal and has destabilized the U.S. economy. The lawsuit contends that President Donald Trump’s tariff policy, driven by ""whims"" rather than lawful authority, violates the Constitution by usurping Congress’s exclusive power to impose tariffs. It challenges Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify tariffs, asserting that the act requires an ""unusual and extraordinary threat"" from abroad, which the states argue is not present.* Oregon* Arizona* Colorado* Connecticut* Delaware* Illinois* Maine* Minnesota* Nevada* New Mexico* New York* and VermontIn their lawsuit, these States urge the court to declare tariffs unlawful and prevent their enforcement. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes labeled the policy “insane” and “economically reckless,” while Connecticut Attorney General William Tong called it a “massive tax” on families and a “disaster” for businesses and jobs. The lawsuit argues that Trump’s arbitrary imposition of tariffs disrupts the constitutional order and wreaks economic havoc.Separately, California Governor Gavin Newsom filed a similar lawsuit last week in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, citing potential billions in lost revenue for his state, the nation’s largest importer. White House spokesperson Kush Desai defended the tariffs, stating the administration is using “every tool” to address a “national emergency” harming American industries and workers.","A coalition of twelve states filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Wednesday in the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York.

Here's Donald Trump's full statement on Elon Musk stepping back from DOGE as shared by Twitter user Dogedesigner and reposted by Elon Musk himself

""I can't speak more highly about any individual. He's an incredible guy. He's a brilliant guy. He's a wonderful person. I've seen him with his family. I've seen him with a lot of his children. He's got a lot of children. He treats him well. He loves his children, but he's a brilliant guy, and he was a tremendous help, both in the campaign and in what he's done with DOGE.

And you know what we're talking about, almost $200 million and rising fast, because many of the things that we were looking at are now being found out to be fact. It's terrible. I mean, the fraud, the waste, the abuse, everything that's happened is just terrible.

So I also know that he was treated very unfairly by the I guess he called the public, by some of the public, not by all of it. He makes an incredible car and everything he does is good, but they took it out on Tesla, and I just thought it was so unfair, because he's trying to help the country, but he has helped the country. I also want him to make sure that he's going to be in great shape, and I know he is. I mean, he's going to be, he's going to do great, he loves the country.

He didn't need to do this. He did it, and I told him, I said, you know, whenever you're ready, I'd like to keep him for a long time, but whenever you're ready, he's an exceptional that when you see those rockets go up and come back and land in the same gantry, nobody else can do that, but this man. So he's just an incredible person, and he's a friend of mine, and he's a nice person too.

He's a very nice person. He really helped the country. Saved us a lot of money. And I heard him say that he'll start easing which is always, he was always, at this time, going to ease out. And when he goes back to Tesla that will be taken care of, it was just, it's artificial.

These were sick people that thought they were doing something. He really, he's a great patriot, and he should, really, it should be, it shouldn't be the way that should never have happened to him. And I will tell you right now, he makes a great product. He makes a great product. It's a great car. It's great. Starlink is great. What he does is good. He's doing medical things that are amazing. And we have to, at some point, let him go and do that.""

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has announced that his job in Washington is “mostly done”. At the recent earnings call of Tesla, Elon Musk said that he plans to cut back his role in the US government. Musk said that his ""time allocation to DOGE"" would ""drop significantly"" from next month, adding he would spend only one to two days per week. The earnings call revealed a tough first quarter for Tesla, as revenue fell 9%, auto sales were off 20%, and net income plunged 71% from last year at the same time. At the centre of the controversy is Musk's leadership position with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where his push to cut back government spending has been applauded by some, but has also received huge criticism.After Elon Musk's announcement that he would allocate more time to Tesla, US President Donald Trump too responded to Musk's remarks that he would scale back his work for the Trump administration in May to focus on Tesla. And as always, Trump was all praise for Musk, brushing off critics and defending his work on federal reform. Talking to reporters, Trump said what he described as unfair treatment of Elon Musk and Tesla. ""They took it out on Tesla, and I just thought it was so unfair because he's trying to help the country, but he has helped the country… He didn't need to do this. He did it,"" he said.","President Donald Trump responded to Elon Musk's announcement that he would scale back his work for the US government.

How Trump Tariffs may hurt Amazon more than Walmart and other offline retailers

US President Trump's sudden shift away from harsh tariff threats on Chinese imports may have inadvertently benefited Amazon more than the retailers who actually lobbied for the change, according to market analysts. After a Monday (April 21) meeting with CEOs from Walmart , Target, and Home Depot , as reported by Axios, Trump significantly softened his rhetoric on both Chinese tariffs and Federal Reserve policy. The retail executives reportedly warned the President that his 145% tariffs on Chinese goods would lead to higher prices and empty store shelves within weeks, potentially devastating consumer confidence ahead of the holiday shopping season.While Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wasn't present at the White House meeting, the e-commerce giant has seen its stock rebound more dramatically than the brick-and-mortar retailers who actually delivered the message. This disparity reflects Amazon's greater vulnerability to the proposed tariffs, as it relies heavily on third-party sellers who import directly from China and set their own prices on the platform.Market analysts note that Amazon faced multiple challenges under the tariff plan that Walmart could better withstand. Amazon's marketplace model means price increases would likely appear faster on its platform than at competitors with more centralized purchasing power. Additionally, its $56 billion advertising business - primarily funded by merchants promoting their products - would likely suffer as sellers cut marketing budgets to absorb tariff costs.Walmart's stronger positioning in groceries - which are largely sourced domestically or from Latin America rather than China - provided it with a buffer that Amazon's Whole Foods division couldn't match. In any economic downturn triggered by tariffs, budget-conscious consumers would likely favor Walmart's value pricing over Amazon's options.Trump’s apparent reversal, marked by indications of imminent trade talks with China, has calmed markets for now, with Amazon shareholders appearing particularly relieved by the unexpected intervention from its retail rivals.","President Trump softened his rhetoric on Chinese tariffs and Federal Reserve policy after meeting with CEOs from Walmart, Target, and Home Depot.

"No, AI systems cannot feel self-aware or conscious in any way, says Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/no-ai-systems-cannot-feel-self-aware-or-conscious-in-any-way-says-google-deepmind-ceo-demis-hassabis/articleshow/120595153.cms,"What Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said about AI consciousness



“I don’t think any of today’s systems feel self-aware or conscious in any way,”

“these systems might acquire some feeling of self-awareness.”

“That is possible,”

""Teaching morality to AI—much the way you would teach your child. Can we make sure that they are doing what we want, that they benefit society, and that they stay on guardrails—with safety limits built into the system?”

“We don’t program that in. It learns like a human being would learn,”

“It's moving incredibly fast. We’re on some kind of exponential curve of improvement,”

“We’ll have a system that really understands everything around you in very nuanced and deep ways. I think it will have a breakthrough moment in the next couple of years,”

Google DeepMind co-founder and CEO, Demis Hassabis , has said that AI systems cannot feel self-aware or conscious in any way. In a recent interview, he warned that as AI becomes more autonomous, keeping these systems safe, aligned, and firmly under human control is essential for long-term success. Hassabis argues that instilling ethics in AI must be approached with the same care and intentionality as raising a child. Though technical progress continues to grow, current AI models still lack any genuine subjective awareness or self-experience. With stakes rising alongside AI’s growing capabilities, the Nobel Prize awardee emphasises that ethical alignment and governance must keep pace with innovation.In a recent interview with CBS’s Scott Pelley, Hassabis noted that his DeepMind team’s work isn’t explicitly aimed at producing conscious or self-aware AI.he said. However, he clarified that he still doesn’t rule out the possibility thathe added.Hassabis claimed that what matters even more is that systems grasp the concepts of “self” and “other”—an initial step toward more advanced cognitive abilities. He also highlighted the importance of guiding these systems’ development so they remain consistent with human values.Hassabis explained.He mentioned that DeepMind’s AI models are built with architectural goals but acquire capabilities through data-driven learning.Hassabis continued. This approach can yield unexpected behaviours, prompting initiatives like Project Astra to study how these systems adapt. Hassabis even highlighted the rapid pace at which AI development is progressing.he said while predicting that Artificial General Intelligence may emerge in five to ten years, with deeply nuanced systems integrated into daily life by 2030.he said, foreseeing breakthroughs in robotics in the coming days.As AI’s impact grows, Hassabis also emphasised the need for international cooperation on regulation, ethics, and accountability. He argued the real challenge for this decade is to keeping these systems “safe, useful, and aligned with the values of the people they serve.”","Google DeepMind co-founder and CEO, Demis Hassabis, has said that AI systems cannot feel self-aware or conscious in any way.

A broader vision for ChatGPT

Challenges and considerations

Security and data privacy for in-chat purchases must meet stringent standards.

Merchant vetting and product curation would be essential to maintain quality control.

User interface design will need to accommodate commercial interactions without overwhelming the conversational experience.

OpenAI’s ChatGPT , widely known for its advanced conversational abilities and growing user base exceeding 800 million, may soon evolve from an informational assistant into an active e-commerce participant. According to recently uncovered, unreleased code discovered by, a new feature is in the works that could allow users to browse, compare, and purchase items from Shopify merchants directly within the ChatGPT interface.The update would allow for embedded pricing, user reviews, shipping details, and checkout—all without ever leaving the chat environment. If launched, this capability could dramatically shift the landscape of digital commerce by integrating AI-powered product recommendations with seamless transactions, positioning ChatGPT as both advisor and storefront.The potential integration centers on Shopify’s direct access within ChatGPT’s chat window, as per reports. Currently, when users ask ChatGPT for shopping recommendations—such as the best trail running shoes—the chatbot provides a list of options with links to external sites. The new feature described in the unreleased code takes this functionality further.According to the code findings, ChatGPT could soon display product cards directly within the conversation, offering detailed listings that include:Critically, the transaction process would be conducted entirely within ChatGPT, eliminating the need to redirect users to third-party websites.If deployed, this shopping feature would drastically streamline the customer journey.

Currently, small business owners often rely on:Integrating with ChatGPT could dramatically alter this dynamic. If Shopify listings are surfaced in direct response to product-related prompts, merchants could see significant increases in both visibility and conversion rates.The AI assistant's ability to recommend products based on user context and preferences offers sellers a unique opportunity: to place their offerings in front of highly targeted and ready-to-buy audiences.The move represents a significant step into what is increasingly being referred to as ""agentic commerce""—a future in which AI agents not only provide information but actively facilitate decisions and transactions on behalf of users.OpenAI is not alone in exploring this space:By embedding commerce within conversation, these platforms are transitioning from informational tools into full-fledged retail ecosystems.The Shopify integration also fits into a broader strategy by OpenAI to expand ChatGPT’s functional utility. Recent experiments with “Operator agents”—AI programs that can browse the web and perform tasks—indicate a long-term vision where ChatGPT becomes not just a recommendation engine but an action-oriented assistant.Until now, the platform's value was largely knowledge-based: helping users research topics, structure writing, or draft messages. This evolution into transaction execution represents a shift in both user expectations and technological capability.While promising, such a rollout would also raise several logistical and technical considerations:Furthermore, the impact on affiliate marketing, digital advertising, and retail logistics remains to be seen, as traditional models could be disrupted by this new method of product discovery and purchasing.","Shopify integration could revolutionise shopping experience.

What the Kardashians said about Lauren Sanchez’s Blue Origin space flight



“This is a really unique experience and we’re just so honored to be here to support them and watch this amazing part of history, and I’m so proud of her,”

How Sanchez solved NASA's 'uniform problem' before her Blue Origin flight



Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ' fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, received a space-themed gift from Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and Khloé Kardashian after her recent Blue Origin Space flight. The Kardashians gave Sanchez a Judith Leiber handbag shaped like an UFO, valued at $6,995 (approx. Rs 5.9 lakh). The UFO Orbiter bag features star-shaped and geometric crystals, aligning with the theme of the Blue Orgin's Space flight.

Tesla stocks declined 33% year-to-date

Tesla investor Ross Gerber, who publicly called for Elon Musk’s exit from the EV company, has once again criticised him. In an interview with Bloomberg Technology, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, said that Musk “doesn’t care” about the electric car manufacturer. He went on to claim that the tech billionaire Elon Musk is not returning 'his focus' to Tesla anytime soon. He has found his next Big Focus and that it is not Tesla. “It’s clear that he just doesn’t care. His next move is X AI… So if you have any confusion that he’s coming back to Tesla, he’s not,” he said during the interview. In March, Gerber said that Musk has lost focus given his widening interests and has become too ‘divisive’. Blaming social media posts and involvement with the president Donald Trump for bringing negative publicity to the company, he then said that “the company's reputation has just been destroyed by Elon Musk”.He then stated that Musk would need to choose between backing Trump and safeguarding Tesla. He said : “It's time for somebody to run Tesla. The business has been neglected for too long. There are too many important things Tesla is doing, so either Elon should come back to Tesla and be the CEO of Tesla and give up his other jobs or he should focus on the government and keep doing what he is doing but find a suitable CEO of Tesla.”In his interview with Bloomberg, Gerber stood by his Tesla comments, addressing criticism from retail investors. He said “I understand why retail investors at Tesla are frustrated with me for voicing my views” adding that he’s “getting attacked because of Elon’s behavior.”However, Gerber said that his firm will continue to manage Tesla shares. He said “We still own Tesla because I do think something fixes itself at some point, and they have the best products”.Despite maintaining its lead in the US EV market, Tesla's stock has dropped 33% year-to-date. According to Cox Automotive data, Tesla sales fell 8.6% year over year in the first quarter of 2025, while the market expanded 11.4% as a whole. Meanwhile, the EV company is set to announce its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, April 22.Stock market worldwide has been volatile amidst the US-China tariff trade war. In a latest, Trump announced a sweeping 245% retaliatory tariff on Chinese imports.","Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, said that Musk ‘doesn’t care’ about the electric car manufacturer.

"Walmart Boycott: World's largest retailer tells protesters, 'we are America's ...'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/walmart-boycott-worlds-largest-retailer-tells-protesters-we-are-americas-/articleshow/120119363.cms,"Here's what Walmart said about the protest

People's Union USA founder John Schwarz has announced on social media details of upcoming planned boycotts:

Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, has issued a statement addressing the ongoing week-long boycott organised by the People’s Union USA . The boycott, dubbed the "" Walmart Blackout ,"" began on April 7 and targets the company’s rollback of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, as well as broader concerns over corporate influence and tax policies .The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity. The group’s founder, John Schwarz, urged consumers to avoid shopping at Walmart stores, using its online services, or purchasing from its subsidiaries like Sam’s Club. Schwarz stated, “We are holding these companies accountable so they finally step up and pay their fair share of taxes to alleviate federal income tax from the working-class citizen.”Walmart responded to the boycott, defending its contributions to communities and the US economy. “Serving communities is at the heart of Walmart's purpose to help people save money and live better,” the company said in a statement. “As one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, not only do we pay our fair share, we are an economic force multiplier strengthening communities nationwide through job creation, supplier growth, and over $1.7 billion in cash and in-kind donations last year"", it added further.The boycott follows Walmart’s decision last November to discontinue its five-year commitment to a racial equity center and other DEI programs. Critics argue that these rollbacks undermine progress in promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Walmart, however, emphasised its dedication to supporting local charities, disaster response, hunger relief, workforce development, and conservation efforts.A report from SuperMarketNews, citing data from Numerator, suggests that Walmart may be more resistant to boycotts compared to other retailers. The data indicates that Walmart has not experienced significant impact from households regarding its stance on non-DEI initiatives, particularly among multicultural households—a trend that contrasts with another retail chain Target.Target reportedly faced the most severe backlash during the February 28 boycott focused on DEI initiatives, experiencing a 9% drop in web traffic on the day of the protest, according to Forbes. In comparison, Walmart observed a 5% decline in web traffic, while Amazon saw the smallest decrease, at just 2%.* Walmart: April 7-14 and May 20-26* Second economic blackout: April 18* General Mills: April 21-28* Amazon: May 6-12* Target: June 3-9* McDonald's: June 24-30* Independence Day boycott: July 4","The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female. The change aligns with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January 2025, titled ‘Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government’. The updated policy, which took effect on April 2, applies to all pending and future immigration benefit requests. “USCIS is returning to its historical policy of recognizing two biological sexes,” the agency said in a press statement.Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security , said “There are only two sexes—male and female. President Trump promised the American people a revolution of common sense, and that includes making sure that the policy of the U.S. government agrees with simple biological reality. Proper management of our immigration system is a matter of national security, not a place to promote and coddle an ideology that permanently harms children and robs real women of their dignity, safety, and well-being.”Under the new guidance, a person’s sex will be determined based on the birth certificate issued at or closest to the time of birth. “If the birth certificate issued at or nearest to the time of birth indicates a sex other than male or female, USCIS will base the determination of sex on secondary evidence. See Volume 1, General Policies and Procedures, Part E, Adjudications, Chapter 6, Evidence, Section B, Primary and Secondary Evidence [1 USCIS-PM E.6(B)],” the agency stated.The agency further stated that the benefits will not be denied solely based on how an applicant identifies his/her sex. USCIS confirmed that it does not issue documents with a blank sex field or one that differs from the original birth certificate. Any discrepancies may lead to processing delays.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female.

What Bill Gates said about his ties with Jeffrey Epstein



“In retrospect, I was foolish to spend any time with him. I think I was quite stupid. I thought it would help me with global health philanthropy. In fact, it failed to do that. It was just a huge mistake.”

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates’ ex-wife and founder of the Gates Foundation, Melinda French Gates, has made a major revelation about her husband’s ties with Jeffrey Epstein. In her new memoir “The Next Day”, Melinda noted that she knew her marriage to Bill Gates was facing significant issues in 2019, when his infidelities and connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein became publicly known. The philanthropist wrote that these public revelations led her to experience nightmares and recognise the severity of her marital difficulties. She was specifically referencing her then-husband’s association with Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking and federal conspiracy charges. A report published by The New York Times at that time claimed that Bill Gates met with Epstein on ""numerous occasions,"" including one visit that lasted for hours.In her memoir (seen by Page Six), Melinda Gates wrote:Earlier, in a 2022 interview, Melinda revealed that she had voiced her anger to Bill regarding his friendship with Epstein.

President Trump’s meme coin, $TRUMP, has reportedly surged by 50%. This happened after its official website and X account announced that the token’s top 220 holders would be invited to an exclusive gala dinner with the president in Washington, DC, next month. “Have Dinner in Washington, D.C. With President Trump,” the invitation message on the front page of the Trump coin’s website read. This announcement sent $TRUMP briefly jumping over 70% before settling at $13.30, CoinDesk reports. The site also claims that these token holders will also get a “VIP White House Tour” on the day following the dinner. Despite the rally, the coin remains far below its January high near $75 ahead of Inauguration Day.According to the meme coin’s website, the gala dinner is set for May 22 at Trump’s golf club just outside Washington. The site also notes that the coin’s top 25 holders will be invited to a private VIP reception with Trump and a White House tour the following day.Promoting the event, The $TRUMP X account said: “The top $TRUMP Coin holders will have a private DINNER WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP on May 22nd at the BEAUTIFUL Trump National Club in Washington, D.C. It will be a night to remember! Thank You! And Have Fun!”“Couldn’t be more excited about this "" Dinner with Trump "". A lot more on the way! The Tokens from the initial cliff and from the following three months of daily unlocks will remain locked, each for an additional 90 days. The era of $TRUMP has just begun!” the X account continued in a comment on the post.The Trump coin launched in January ahead of the inauguration, quickly reaching a $15 billion market cap on the strength of President Trump’s social-media posts before collapsing within days. First Lady Melania Trump’s $MELANIA token saw a similar spike and crash. In guidance issued soon after, the SEC ruled that meme coins aren’t securities, sparing them from immediate regulation.Only 20% of $TRUMP’s tokens are tradable; the remaining 80%, held by insiders under a three-year vesting schedule, are set to begin unlocking soon, potentially allowing major holders to sell. There’s no underlying product—80% of the supply is controlled by the Trump Organisation and affiliates.","The meme coin's top 220 holders will be invited to an exclusive gala dinner with the president in Washington, DC, next month.

Jeff and Lauren to skip 2025 Met Gala ahead of lavish Italian wedding

Jeff and Lauren wedding: Location, dates, and guest list

Jeff Bezos doesn’t need the Met Gala to stay fashion-relevant

Wedding logistics and local coordination

In a year marked by high-profile fashion events and star-studded celebrations, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and media personality Lauren Sánchez are making headlines for their absence. According to reports, the couple, who recently captivated global attention with their spaceflight on Blue Origin, have opted out of the 2025 Met Gala. The decision comes as they prepare for their much-anticipated wedding in Venice, Italy.Their nuptials are expected to draw an elite guest list and span several days of festivities, positioning the event as one of the most high-profile weddings of the year. While the couple’s Met Gala appearances have become a tradition in recent years, their focus in 2025 appears to be fully on their upcoming union.The 2025 Met Gala, set for May 5, will proceed without two of its regular and prominent attendees. Sources close to the couple confirmed that Bezos and Sánchez will not attend this year's event due to preparations for their wedding, scheduled for June 26–29. Their absence marks a shift in routine, as Bezos has been attending the gala since at least 2012, when Amazon was a sponsor. That year, he walked the red carpet alongside then-wife Mackenzie Scott and took styling cues from Anna Wintour herself.The wedding is set to take place in Venice, a city known for its historic charm and romantic allure. According to reports, the three-day celebration will feature a carefully curated guest list of influential figures. Among those expected to attend are Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, as well as Donald Trump Jr. and Bettina Anderson, a close friend of Sánchez. Reports also suggest that Vogue may be in talks to cover the wedding, though no formal agreement has been confirmed. “It makes sense to have the biggest wedding of the year covered in Vogue,” a source told Page Six.Bezos’s connection to the fashion world goes beyond red carpet appearances. His friendship with Anna Wintour dates back more than a decade. At past Met Galas, he’s been known to follow Wintour’s fashion advice, once donning a Tom Ford tuxedo with a pocket square at her suggestion. Despite stepping back from this year’s event, the couple's fashion relevance remains strong, especially after their widely discussed 2023 Vogue shoot, which featured Bezos in cowboy attire on his Texas ranch.Planning a wedding in Venice, a city that carefully balances tourism and preservation, involves navigating complex logistics. Bezos reportedly met with Venice's mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, who assured the public that the city is working with the couple to ensure minimal disruption. “We are mutually working and supporting the organizers to ensure that the event will be absolutely respectful of the fragility and uniqueness of the city,” Brugnaro said.","Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez will not attend this year's Met Gala.

The White House issued a strong condemnation on Wednesday (April 24) regarding the fines levied by the European Union (EU) against Apple and Facebook-parent company Meta, labeling them a “novel form of economic extortion”.“This novel form of economic extortion will not be tolerated by the United States,” a spokesperson for the White House stated.The EU's antitrust regulators imposed fines of 500 million euros ($570 million) on Apple and 200 million ($228 million) euros on Meta. These sanctions represent the first enforcement actions under the landmark Digital Markets Act (DMA), legislation aimed at curbing the market power of major technology companies.These fines are widely viewed as a development that could fuel existing tensions between the EU and the US, particularly given President Donald Trump's past threats to impose tariffs on nations that penalise American firms.“Extraterritorial regulations that specifically target and undermine American companies, stifle innovation, and enable censorship will be recognised as barriers to trade and a direct threat to free civil society,” the White House spokesperson added.The White House previously characterised the Digital Markets Act (DMA) as discriminatory. The EU's legislative action and subsequent fines follow a year-long investigation by the European Commission, the EU's executive body, into the compliance of these companies with the DMA, which seeks to facilitate the entry of smaller competitors into markets dominated by the largest players.",The EU's antitrust regulators imposed fines of 500 million euros ($570 million) on Apple and 200 million ($228 million) euros on Meta.

Kim highlighted that LG is evaluating relocating manufacturing of key appliances, such as washers and dryers, to its existing facility in Clarksville, Tennessee.The Tennessee plant, operational since 2019, could produce up to 20% of LG’s home appliance sales in the U.S. market, Kim noted. This shift aims to reduce reliance on imports and cushion the impact of tariffs, which could significantly affect LG’s business starting in the third quarter if implemented.U.S. President Donald Trump has temporarily delayed a broad set of tariffs on multiple trading partners until July, providing LG and other global manufacturers a brief window to adjust strategies.

"Norway’s $1.7 trillion Wealth Fund $40 billion loss as Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, Amazon and Facebook hurt Big",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/norways-1-7-trillion-wealth-fund-40-billion-loss-as-apple-microsoft-nvidia-google-amazon-and-facebook-hurt-big/articleshow/120585154.cms,"Representative Image

Big holdings in Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and Meta Platforms Inc

Norway's colossal $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund has announced its most significant quarterly loss in six quarters. The downturn, is reportedly largely attributed to a notable depreciation in the valuation of prominent technology companies within its extensive portfolio, underscores the widespread impact of recent economic volatility.According to a report in Bloomberg, Norges Bank Investment Management , the world’s biggest single owner of listed companies, lost 0.6%, or $40 billion, in the first three months of the year, it said in a statement. That was the largest decline in its value since the third quarter of 2023. A Bloomberg analysis of the fund's performance during this period indicates a divergence in returns across different asset classes. While its substantial equity holdings witnessed a negative return of 1.6%, the fund's investments in fixed-income instruments generated a positive return of 1.6%, offering a degree of balance amidst the equity market headwinds. Despite the overall loss, the fund's total performance for the quarter managed to slightly surpass its benchmark index by 0.16 percentage points.The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund maintains a significant exposure to the technology sector, with some of the world's most influential companies forming a substantial part of its holdings. These include tech giants such as Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon .com Inc., and Meta Platforms Inc. Additionally, the fund holds a notable 1.8% stake in the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Inc.Historically, these technology-focused investments have been a source of considerable gains for the fund, delivering an impressive 13% return in the preceding year. However, recognizing the potential for market corrections among these dominant players in the global stock markets, the fund initiated a strategic reduction of its technology positions during 2024, according to Deputy CEO Trond Grande. This proactive measure aimed to mitigate the risk associated with such concentrated holdings.""The first quarter of the year has been notably shaped by significant and often abrupt market fluctuations,"" commented Chief Executive Officer Nicolai Tangen in the official statement. He further elaborated, stating, ""Our investments in equities experienced a negative return during this period, with this downturn being predominantly driven by the performance of the technology sector.""It is important to note that the full extent of recent market upheaval may not be entirely captured in these first-quarter figures. Subsequent to the reporting period, the fund's valuation reportedly decreased by approximately $200 million in the immediate aftermath of US President Donald Trump 's announcement of a sharp increase in tariffs in early April, suggesting potential for further impact in future reports.The operational framework of the fund is largely dictated by its role as an index tracker, which inherently limits the scope for active investment strategies. The fund's benchmark index is meticulously defined by the Norwegian Finance Ministry and is constructed using the FTSE Global All Cap Index for its equity component and the Bloomberg Barclays indexes for its fixed-income component.The sheer scale of the fund is evident in its ownership stakes in over 8,600 companies spanning the globe. In a recent announcement, Norway’s Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg outlined plans to strategically reduce this extensive portfolio by divesting holdings in numerous small-cap firms within emerging markets. Given the fund's immense size and the complexity of its holdings, these proposed changes are expected to be a gradual process, requiring considerable time to fully implement.","Norway's colossal $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund has announced its most significant quarterly loss in six quarters.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk's one sentence on DOGE makes him richer by $8 billion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tesla-ceo-elon-musks-one-sentence-on-doge-makes-him-richer-by-8-billion/articleshow/120584683.cms,"Elon Musk criticizes Trump’s tariffs

Tesla CEO Elon Musk ’s net worth increased by $7.5 billion on April 23, after the tech billionaire recommitted to dedicating more time to the company. Speaking at Tesla’s first quarter earnings call, Musk said that his time with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will drop ‘significantly’ next month. He said “Starting next month, May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly” to a day or two per week. “I'll continue to spend a day or two per week on government matters for as long as the President would like me to do so,” Musk said during Tesla’s earnings call.Following the announcement, Tesla shares soared by 5% to $251. According to Forbes, the tech billionaire’s total net worth rose to $369.2 billion after the Tuesday Q1 report.Tesla shares have dropped by over 40% this year. Musk, a close confidante of President Donald Trump, is leading the DOGE task force to cut government expenses. His involvement in the Trump administration has concerned investors who criticised Musk for ‘divided attention’.The company’s shares have also been hit by Trump’s tariffs announced earlier this month. Though the CEO described Tesla as the “least affected car company”, Musk reinstated his disagreement with the tariffs at the earnings. He said “I've been on the record many times saying that I believe lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity”, adding the tariff “decision is fundamentally up to” Trump.“So I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs, but that's all I can do,” Musk said.During the earnings, Musk also addressed Tesla protests. The tech billionaire said “The protests that you’ll see out there, they’re very organized. He further claimed that some of these protesters are likely protesting “because they’re receiving fraudulent money” or are “recipients of wasteful largesse.” However, he did not share any evidence in support of his statement.",Elon Musk said that his time with the Department of Government Efficiency will drop ‘significantly’ next month.

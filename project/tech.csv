Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta is siding with Elon Musk in a legal battle against ChatGPT-maker OpenAI . The social media company has reportedly urged California’s attorney general to block OpenAI’s planned conversion to a for-profit company.According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, Meta wrote a letter to Attorney General Rob Bonta saying that allowing OpenAI to become a for-profit entity would set a dangerous precedent, enabling startups to exploit the benefits of non-profit status before transitioning to profit-making ventures.“OpenAI’s conduct could have seismic implications for Silicon Valley,” Meta wrote in the letter.“If OpenAI’s new business model is valid, non-profit investors would get the same for-profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit companies while also benefiting from tax write-offs bestowed by the government,” it added, as per the report.In the letter, Meta added that said it supports the effort by Musk and Shivon Zilis, a business and personal associate, to represent the interests of the public in deciding whether OpenAI will be allowed to become a for-profit company.“Although we ask your office to take direct action, we believe that Mr. Musk and Ms. Zilis are qualified and well-positioned to represent the interests of Californians in this matter,” Meta reportedly wrote in the letter.This move aligns Meta with Elon Musk, who has been engaged in a public feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the company's direction. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015 as a non-profit, has accused the company of betraying its original mission by creating a for-profit arm and colluding with Microsoft to dominate the AI landscape.Meta, a major competitor in the AI space, has invested billions in developing its own AI technologies.Meanwhile, OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor defended the planned transition, stating that a non-profit arm will remain and retain full ownership in the for-profit entity, allowing it to further its mission of ensuring AI benefits humanity.",Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta is siding with Elon Musk in a legal battle against ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.

Elon Musk's long running fight with OpenAI

Suchir Balaji , 26-year-old former AI researcher at OpenAI, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on November 26, 2024, a day after Thanksgiving. The San Francisco Police Department confirmed that the cause of death was suicide, with no foul play suspected. Balaji’s tragic death has left the tech community in shock, especially given his high-profile exit from OpenAI earlier in August this year. Balaji left OpenAI in August 2024 after disagreement over the company’s AI practices. Balaji was with OpenAI for four years. During this time, he is said to have worked on OpenAI's popular chatbot ChatGPT for over a year. Balaji was also the prime witness in a lawsuit filed by almost a dozen US publications against OpenAI. Elon Musk , who is fighting a legal battle against Open AI has reacted to Balaji's death in posts on X, formerly Twitter. In the first post, Musk wrote a cryptic ""hmm'. He quoted a post of Twitter user named Daniel who had shared a news titled 'OpenAI whistleblower found dead in San Francisco apartment' saying ""uhhhhhh. guys"".Musk shared another post related to ChatGPT. This one is of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella talking about the company's investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI. In the 16-second video, Satya Nadella is talking about telling OpenAI CEO Sam Alman about his bet on the company and Microsoft's rights to the IP and how he feels ""fantastic"" about it.Balaji was among the key witnesses against OpenAI in the ongoing case against the Microsoft-owned AI giant in the US. In a November 18 letter filed in federal court, attorneys for The New York Times reportedly named Balaji as someone who had “unique and relevant documents” that would support their case against OpenAI. He was among at least 12 people that the newspaper had named in court filings as having material helpful to their case, ahead of depositions.An early OpenAI investor and board member, Elon Musk sued the artificial intelligence company earlier this year alleging that it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab benefiting the public good rather than pursuing profits. Musk has since escalated the dispute, adding new claims and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI’s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully. Last month, he also made Microsoft, the biggest investor in OpenAI, a part of the lawsuit. “OpenAI and Microsoft together exploiting Musk’s donations so they can build a for-profit monopoly, one now specifically targeting xAI, is just too much,” says Musk’s court filing.","Suchir Balaji, a 26-year-old former AI researcher at OpenAI, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on November 26, 2024, a day after Thanksgiving.

Suchir Balaji , a 26-year-old former OpenAI employee of Indian origin, died by suicide in his San Francisco apartment on November 26, according to San Francisco police and the medical examiner. The medical examiner confirmed the cause of death as suicide, and police is said to have found no evidence of foul play.

During these four years, he worked on ChatGPT for one-and-a-half years as he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, recently.Balaji’s death comes just three months after he publicly accused OpenAI of violating US copyright law while developing ChatGPT.

Suchir Balaji’s final post on social media



Take a look at the post here:



OpenAI’s response to Balaji’s death



The recent death of former OpenAI researcher Suchir Balaji , who passed away at the age of 26, has brought renewed attention to his concerns about the ethical implications of artificial intelligence (AI). Balaji was a key figure in the development of ChatGPT, OpenAI's generative AI chatbot. He was a tech researcher who became increasingly concerned about the ethical challenges posed by AI. He spent four years at Microsoft-backed OpenAI and played an important role in gathering and organising the data that fueled ChatGPT 's development.The India-origin AI researcher was found dead in his US apartment, with the San Francisco medical examiner ruling the death a suicide. Police stated there is ""currently, no evidence of foul play,""At OpenAI, Balaji contributed to major projects, including the development and fine-tuning of ChatGPT and the training of models like GPT-4 at the OpenAI. In 2022, when ChatGPT was launched, Balaji's perspective began to shift.While he initially believed in the right of tech companies to utilize web data for AI development, he grew uncomfortable about the ethical implications, particularly concerning copyright law .In 2021, Balaji graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. He excelled in programming competitions and achieved top rankings in both regional and international contests during his college days.He ranked 31st in the ACM ICPC 2018 World Finals and secured first place in both the 2017 Pacific Northwest Regional and Berkeley Programming Contests. Balaji also won a $100,000 prize in Kaggle's TSA-sponsored ""Passenger Screening Algorithm Challenge."" Before joining OpenAI, Balaji also gained experience at companies like Scale AI, Helia, and Quora.Balaji's final post on X (formerly Twitter) highlighted his scepticism about the ""fair use"" defence for generative AI products. He feared that these products could create substitutes that compete with the very data they are trained on, potentially harming content creators.In a detailed post, Balaji, who had become deeply interested in copyright law, urged machine learning researchers to delve into its complexities. He emphasised that the issue of fair use in generative AI extended beyond any single company or product, calling for a broaderconversation within the AI community.In response to the news of Balaji's death, an OpenAI spokesperson stated: ""We are devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news today and our hearts go out to Suchir's loved ones during this difficult time.""Balaji's passing has reignited conversations about the ethical and legal implications of generative AI. His outspoken criticisms of OpenAI's data usage practices have brought forward critical questions regarding the future of AI technologies, particularly as they evolve and shape the digital landscape.","Former OpenAI researcher Suchir Balaji passed away at the age of 26.

Suchir Balaji , a 26-year-old Indian American researcher who spent four years at OpenAI , was found dead in his San Francisco apartment. Balaji , who had recently left the company and raised significant concerns about its practices, leaves behind a final social media post that offers a rare and compelling insider's perspective on the ethical challenges facing generative AI.Prior to his untimely death, Balaji had become increasingly vocal about the legal and ethical implications of how artificial intelligence companies handle copyrighted data. His last post on X (formerly Twitter) provides a nuanced critique of the current approach to fair use in AI training, drawing from his intimate knowledge of the technology's inner workings.""I recently participated in a NYT story about fair use and generative AI, and why I'm skeptical 'fair use' would be a plausible defense for a lot of generative AI products. I also wrote a blog post (https://suchir.net/fair_use.html) about the nitty-gritty details of fair use and why I believe this. To give some context: I was at OpenAI for nearly 4 years and worked on ChatGPT for the last 1.5 of them.I initially didn't know much about copyright, fair use, etc. but became curious after seeing all the lawsuits filed against GenAI companies. When I tried to understand the issue better, I eventually came to the conclusion that fair use seems like a pretty implausible defense for a lot of generative AI products, for the basic reason that they can create substitutes that compete with the data they're trained on.Obviously, I'm not a lawyer, but I still feel like it's important for even non-lawyers to understand the law -- both the letter of it, and also why it's actually there in the first place. That being said, I don't want this to read as a critique of ChatGPT or OpenAI per se, because fair use and generative AI is a much broader issue than any one product or company.I highly encourage ML researchers to learn more about copyright -- it's a really important topic, and precedent that's often cited like Google Books isn't actually as supportive as it might seem. Feel free to get in touch if you'd like to chat about fair use, ML, or copyright -- I think it's a very interesting intersection. My email's on my personal website.""Addressing potential misunderstandings about his involvement with The New York Times, Balaji explicitly clarified: ""The NYT didn't reach out to me for this article; I reached out to them because I thought I had an interesting perspective, as someone who's been working on these systems since before the current generative AI bubble. None of this is related to their lawsuit with OpenAI""","Suchir Balaji, a 26-year-old Indian American researcher, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment.

The artificial intelligence industry was shaken when Suchir Balaji , a 26-year-old former OpenAI employee turned whistleblower, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on November 26, 2024. Balaji had recently gained attention for his outspoken criticism of OpenAI’s practices, particularly concerning alleged copyright violations in the training of its AI systems, such as ChatGPT. While authorities have ruled out foul play, Balaji’s death has sparked widespread speculation, given his pivotal role in ongoing legal battles involving OpenAI.According to the San Francisco Police Department and the Medical Examiner's Office, Balaji was discovered in his Buchanan Street apartment following a welfare check conducted around 1 PM. Although the cause of death remains undetermined, police officials stated that there is ""currently no evidence of foul play."" The investigation into his death is ongoing, leaving many unanswered questions.Balaji became a prominent figure in the debate surrounding AI ethics and copyright laws in recent months. In August 2024, he accused OpenAI of violating U.S. copyright legislation to develop its generative AI systems, including ChatGPT. His allegations, which he detailed in an October interview with The New York Times, centered on claims that OpenAI had trained its AI models using copyrighted content without authorization.“The current model is unsustainable for the internet ecosystem as a whole,” Balaji said during the interview. He argued that OpenAI’s practices harmed businesses and entrepreneurs whose proprietary data was utilized to train AI systems, resulting in an unfair advantage that boosted OpenAI’s valuation to over $150 billion.In his final social media posts, Balaji clarified his motivations for speaking out. He stated that he had proactively reached out to The New York Times to share his perspective, dismissing any connection between his comments and the lawsuits filed against OpenAI. ""I thought I had an interesting perspective, as someone who's been working on these systems since before the current generative AI bubble,"" he wrote.Balaji’s insights were expected to play a crucial role in legal proceedings against OpenAI, particularly in cases filed by writers, journalists, and programmers who allege that their copyrighted content was used without consent to train the AI systems.OpenAI, which launched ChatGPT in late 2022, has faced growing scrutiny over its data acquisition practices. Critics claim the company mined copyrighted material from books, articles, codebases, and other sources without proper licensing. These allegations have led to lawsuits from various stakeholders, including prominent authors and software developers.Balaji’s statements had added weight to these claims, as he offered an insider’s view of OpenAI’s operations. He warned that the AI industry’s rapid growth could lead to long-term repercussions for intellectual property rights and the livelihoods of creators.News of Balaji’s death has elicited strong reactions from across the tech and legal communities. Many have expressed shock and sadness, with some raising concerns about the potential pressure and challenges faced by whistleblowers in the tech industry.Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI before parting ways with the company, tweeted cryptically about the incident, adding fuel to the speculation surrounding Balaji’s sudden demise. Prominent AI ethics advocates and creators have called for a transparent investigation into the circumstances of his death, as well as greater protections for individuals who come forward with ethical concerns in the technology sector.","Suchir Balaji, a former OpenAI employee turned whistleblower, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on November 26, 2024.

"Donald Trump may not have yet made up his mind on TikTok ban, here's why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trump-may-not-have-yet-made-up-his-mind-on-tiktok-ban-heres-why/articleshow/116176571.cms,"Trump highlights TikTok’s role in his campaign

“I used TikTok very successfully in my campaign. I have a man named TikTok Jack, he was very effective, obviously, because I won youth by 30 percent. All Republicans lose youth. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s changing. And last time we were down 30 percent with youth. This time we were up 35 percent with youth.

And I used TikTok, so I can’t really, you know, I can’t totally hate it. It was very effective. But I will say this, if you do do that, something else is going to come along and take its place. And maybe that’s not fair. And really, what the judge actually said was that you can’t have Chinese companies. In other words, they have the right to ban it if you can prove that Chinese companies own it. That’s what the judge actually said.”

“I’m going to try and make it so that other companies don’t become an even bigger monopoly.”

Trump was against TikTok ban during election campaign

US President-elect Donald Trump has provided an unclear stance on the TikTok ban in the country. In a Sunday interview on Meet the Press, when questioned about TikTok's impending ban, Trump avoided committing to saving TikTok though he hinted that ByteDance should divest the platform.NBC’s Kristen Welker pressed Trump on whether he will act to protect the app, which faces expulsion from the U.S. unless its Chinese owner, ByteDance, sells it by January 19.“This week a federal court upheld a law that could result in TikTok being banned. You said you’re going to rescue TikTok when you get into office. Are you going to take steps to protect it?,” Trump said in reply.He also talked about TikTok’s role in his campaign, saying he used the app to tap into youth.When pressed again on whether he would ""protect TikTok"" as president, Trump said:Trump’s position on TikTok has been inconsistent. While he criticised the Biden administration’s support for the ban during his campaign, he previously advocated for TikTok’s removal during his last term in office.In recent months, Trump released a Truth Social video urging those who “want to save TikTok” to vote for him and said that banning the platform will only benefit Facebook, which he referred to as an “enemy of the people.”","US President-elect Donald Trump has provided an unclear stance on the TikTok ban in the country.

Google has unveiled its new quantum chip — Willow. Google CEO Sundar Pichai took off X (formerly) known as Twitter to announce the launch of the chip. “Introducing Willow, our new state-of-the-art quantum computing chip with a breakthrough that can reduce errors exponentially as we scale up using more qubits, cracking a 30-year challenge in the field. In benchmark tests, Willow solved a standard computation in <5 mins that would take a leading supercomputer over 10^25 years, far beyond the age of the universe(!),” said Pichai in a post on X.This announcement started an interesting exchange between Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk.Pichai took to X to announce the launch of Willow, describing it as achieving "" exponential error reduction and unprecedented computational speed."" He stated that Willow can solve problems in minutes that would take traditional supercomputers billions of years. This breakthrough garnered a surprised yet enthusiastic response from Elon Musk, who simply tweeted ""Wow.""Pichai, seemingly referencing Musk's surprise, followed up by replying, “We should do a quantum cluster in space with Starship one day:)”. To this, Musk responded, “That will probably happen. Any self-respecting civilization should at least reach Kardashev Type II. In my opinion, we are currently only at <5% of Type I. To get to ~30%, we would need to place solar panels in all desert or highly arid regions.”“indeed. We should scale solar so much more, amazing that we keep looking at alternatives when the most obvious path is staring at our eyes, literally!,” said Pichai.The new ""Willow"" quantum chip demonstrates unprecedented error correction capabilities, a critical challenge that has stymied quantum computing researchers for decades. With 105 qubits, the chip can reduce computational errors exponentially as it scales up, a feat scientists have pursued since the 1990s.In a groundbreaking demonstration, Google's quantum researchers showed the Willow chip could complete a computational task in roughly five minutes that would require a classical supercomputer an estimated 10 septillion (10^25) years—far exceeding the known age of the universe.","Google's new quantum chip, Willow, can solve problems in minutes that would take traditional supercomputers billions of years.

Elon Musk's contentious relationship with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has escalated with the revelation of a new investigation into his brain-computer interface company, Neuralink.

The SEC sent Musk a settlement offer with that timeline, but has since reportedly extended it to Monday after a request for more time.The SEC has been scrutinizing the timing and disclosure of Musk's Twitter stock purchases before he bought the platform for $44 billion.

Unpredictable journeys of founders ousted from their own companies

Also Read |

In the world of entrepreneurship, the journey of founding and leading a successful company is filled with triumphs, challenges, and often unexpected twists. One of the most compelling and controversial themes in this narrative is the story of founders being ousted from the very companies they created. While many entrepreneurs rise to fame through their innovations, some face the harsh reality of being forced out of their own empires. These stories of conflict, resilience, and controversy have captured the public’s attention, as they reveal the complexities of leadership, corporate dynamics, and personal struggles behind the scenes.From Steve Jobs at Apple to Travis Kalanick at Uber, these entrepreneurs' journeys showcase how even the most visionary leaders can encounter challenges that push them out of the companies they built. This exploration delves into the lives of these founders, highlighting their struggles, comebacks, and the impact of their departures on the business world.Steve Jobs, one of the most iconic figures in the tech industry, co-founded Apple in 1976. Jobs was ousted from the company in 1985 following internal conflicts with the board of directors over his management style and vision for the company's future. Jobs was known for his passionate and sometimes abrasive management, which led to clashes with the board. His departure marked a turning point for Apple, but in 1997, Jobs returned to the company, revitalizing it and leading it to unparalleled success with the introduction of revolutionary products like the iPhone, iPad, and MacBook. His story is often viewed as one of resilience and redemption, demonstrating how a founder can return to reshape a company's future.Travis Kalanick, co-founder of Uber, was forced to resign as CEO in 2017 amid a series of controversies surrounding the company's workplace culture and ethics. The ride-sharing giant, under Kalanick’s leadership, was embroiled in scandals, including accusations of fostering a toxic work environment, mishandling legal issues, and facing backlash over its aggressive business practices. These issues led to mounting pressure from investors and the media, eventually forcing Kalanick to step down. Despite his ousting, Kalanick remained on Uber’s board of directors, and the company continued to grow under new leadership, though his departure marked a major shift in Uber’s culture and future direction.Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter, was ousted from his role as CEO in 2008, just two years after the social media platform’s launch. Dorsey faced internal conflicts with the board and concerns about his management style, which led to his removal. Despite the setback, Dorsey returned to Twitter in 2015 and led the company through key developments, including its monetization strategy and feature improvements. His second stint as CEO highlights the complexity of leadership in rapidly growing tech companies and how a founder can still influence a company after being removed.Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, the co-founders of Flipkart, played a critical role in revolutionizing India's e-commerce industry. In 2018, Walmart acquired Flipkart for $16 billion, leading to significant leadership changes. Sachin Bansal exited the company post-acquisition, while Binny Bansal resigned after allegations of personal misconduct surfaced. Despite these departures, Flipkart continued to thrive under Walmart’s ownership, further expanding its position in the Indian e-commerce market. Their exits, while controversial, reflect how large acquisitions often lead to shifts in company leadership.Sam Altman, the co-founder of OpenAI, provides another example of a founder who faced being removed from the company they helped build. In 2023, Altman was unexpectedly ousted as the CEO of OpenAI due to disagreements with the board over strategic direction and organizational control. However, his departure was short-lived. Within days, Altman was reinstated as CEO, highlighting the volatile and unpredictable nature of leadership, even in successful companies. Altman’s brief removal and subsequent return exemplify the complexities of leadership within fast-evolving tech ventures, where founder influence can clash with the dynamics of board governance. His story also reinforces the theme of resilience and adaptability, traits that are essential for navigating the challenges of entrepreneurship.Jerry Yang, co-founder of Yahoo, resigned as CEO in 2008 after making the controversial decision to reject a $44 billion acquisition offer from Microsoft. This decision was widely criticized, with many analysts arguing that accepting the offer would have been a more profitable path for Yahoo. Yang’s departure marked the end of an era for Yahoo, which subsequently struggled to maintain its dominance in the tech industry. The rejection of Microsoft’s offer has since been viewed as a pivotal moment that led to Yahoo’s decline in the face of rising competition.Rob Kalin co-founded Etsy in 2005, creating a marketplace for handmade and vintage goods. In 2011, Kalin was replaced as CEO due to concerns over Etsy’s growth and future direction. His departure marked a shift for the company, which continued to thrive under new leadership, going public in 2015. Despite his removal, Kalin's initial vision for Etsy remained integral to the company's identity as an online marketplace for unique and creative products.Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie, the co-founders of BlackBerry (formerly Research In Motion), were forced to step down as co-CEOs in 2012 after the company’s market share and dominance in the smartphone industry drastically declined. BlackBerry’s once-innovative devices were overtaken by the rise of Apple's iPhone and Android devices. Their departure marked the end of an era for the company, and the story of BlackBerry's fall is often cited as a cautionary tale about the rapid pace of technological change and the challenges of adapting to market shifts.Sandy Lerner co-founded Cisco in 1984, helping to develop networking technology that would later shape the internet. However, in 1990, she was fired as part of a company restructuring, despite her pivotal role in the company’s early growth. Cisco went on to become a global leader in networking technology, but Lerner’s departure highlights the complex dynamics of growing a company, where sometimes even the most integral founders are let go as the company expands and evolves.Sean Rad, co-founder of Tinder, was removed as CEO in 2014 amid a lawsuit and internal disputes. These issues were compounded by the public nature of the conflicts, including allegations of sexual harassment and legal battles. Despite this setback, Rad returned to lead the company in 2015 and continued to drive Tinder’s success in the online dating space. His controversial departure and return underscore the challenges of leadership in startups, where legal and internal issues can have significant consequences for a founder's role.The stories of founders being ousted from their own companies highlight the unpredictable nature of entrepreneurship and leadership. Founders like Steve Jobs and Travis Kalanick faced internal conflicts, ethical issues, and market pressures that led to their removals but ultimately demonstrated resilience and the ability to adapt. Jobs’ return to Apple in 1997 and Kalanick’s lasting influence on Uber showcase how visionary leaders can rebound and reshape their companies.Similarly, the journeys of Jack Dorsey, Sachin and Binny Bansal, Rob Kalin, and Andrew Mason reflect the complexities of leadership in tech companies, where internal challenges and leadership changes are common. Despite setbacks, businesses like Twitter, Flipkart, Etsy, and Groupon continued to evolve after founder departures. The exits of Mike Lazaridis, Jim Balsillie, and Sandy Lerner from BlackBerry and Cisco, and Jerry Yang’s decision at Yahoo, underscore how companies can thrive even without their original leaders. These stories emphasize the importance of adaptability, resilience, and innovation in shaping long-term entrepreneurial success.","The journey of founding and leading a successful company is filled with triumphs, challenges, and often unexpected twists. One of the most compelling and controversial themes in this narrative is the story of founders being ousted from the very companies they created. From Steve Jobs at Apple to Travis Kalanick at Uber, these entrepreneurs' journeys showcase how even the most visionary leaders can encounter challenges that push them out.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116297054,imgsize-93350,width-400,resizemode-4/116297054.jpg"

Never share personal or financial information over unsolicited calls or video calls.

Government agencies and banks will never contact you via social media platforms for financial investigations.

Be wary of callers who create a sense of urgency or fear.

If unsure about a call, end it and contact the relevant authorities directly using phone numbers obtained from official websites.

Always discuss suspicious communications with family members or trusted friends.

The scam unfolded over a week, starting with a WhatsApp video call on November 30th.The victim received a video call from an unknown number. The caller, posing as a Mumbai Crime Branch officer, displayed a background resembling a police station, lending credibility to their claims. The fraudsters then accused the victim of involvement in a money laundering case linked to Indian businessman Naresh Goyal.Employing fear tactics, the scammers placed victim under a fabricated ""digital arrest."" They threatened him with legal repercussions and strictly prohibited him from discussing the situation with anyone, effectively isolating him from potential help.Under this fabricated pressure, the victim was manipulated into transferring his Rs 1.94 crore fixed deposit in multiple installments to accounts controlled by the fraudsters.

Netflix bids farewell to unlimited parental leave policy; here's the big reason,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/netflix-bids-farewell-to-unlimited-parental-leave-policy-heres-the-big-reason/articleshow/116289221.cms,"Why Netflix abandoned its groundbreaking parental leave plan?

Netflix’s current parental leave policy and future implications

Netflix, the streaming giant known for its innovative workplace policies, made waves in 2015 with the introduction of an unlimited parental leave policy during the first year of a child’s life. This unprecedented move was aligned with Netflix’s foundational culture of “freedom and responsibility,” aiming to attract top talent and set a new benchmark in employee benefits. However, the policy, initially lauded as groundbreaking, proved challenging to sustain over time. By gradually walking back the offering, Netflix faced scrutiny over its practicality and fairness.In 2015, Netflix introduced an extraordinary parental leave policy, allowing employees unlimited time off during their child’s first year. The initiative was part of the company’s broader commitment to freedom and trust in its workforce. At a time when most companies offered limited maternity or paternity leave, Netflix’s policy was a bold statement aimed at attracting and retaining top talent in the competitive tech and entertainment sectors.The policy reflected Netflix’s belief in empowering employees to balance their personal and professional lives, trusting them to make responsible decisions. However, this progressive initiative soon encountered practical challenges, forcing the company to reassess its feasibility.When the policy was introduced, it was heralded as a game-changer in the corporate world. Netflix credited its employee-focused culture as the driving force behind its success and the inspiration for the parental leave policy. The company aimed to outshine its competitors in Silicon Valley and beyond, positioning itself as a leader in employee welfare.Netflix’s core philosophy of allowing employees to set their own boundaries underpinned the policy. The goal was to provide new parents the flexibility to spend time with their children without worrying about job security or income. Initially, the move was seen as a strategic advantage in recruitment and retention, as it set Netflix apart from other companies with more restrictive leave policies.Despite its noble intentions, the policy began facing hurdles soon after its introduction. Employees quickly began requesting extended leaves, often up to a full year, which Netflix had not fully anticipated. Within days of the announcement, managers started receiving requests for long-term parental leave, creating staffing challenges.By 2018, Netflix sought to clarify the policy, stating that most employees would take between four to eight months off. This adjustment aimed to balance employee needs with the company’s operational requirements. Managers often struggled to handle workloads in the absence of multiple team members, leading to internal discussions about revising the policy.To address these concerns, Netflix removed the “freedom and responsibility” section from its founding culture memo. The company also made its benefits page less explicit, stating only that parental leave could be taken within the first year of a child’s life or adoption without specifying a maximum duration.The situation became more complex after the COVID-19 pandemic. As Netflix faced financial challenges, including a wave of layoffs in 2022, concerns arose about whether employees on or recently returned from parental leave were being disproportionately affected.While Netflix denied targeting such employees, some former staffers expressed concerns over layoffs coinciding with their parental leave periods. A company spokesman clarified that only a small percentage of those laid off were on parental leave. Nonetheless, the perception of bias during layoffs highlighted potential flaws in implementing and communicating the policy.Today, Netflix’s parental leave policy no longer explicitly offers unlimited time off. Employees are generally advised to take up to six months, with any additional time requiring managerial approval. The shift represents a significant departure from the policy’s original intent and raises questions about the balance between ambitious workplace benefits and operational sustainability.Netflix’s experience serves as a case study in the complexities of implementing progressive policies in the workplace. While the company’s initial vision was groundbreaking, practical challenges ultimately forced a reevaluation, underscoring the importance of balancing generosity with feasibility.","Netflix introduced an extraordinary parental leave policy, allowing employees unlimited time off during their child's first year.

Elon Musk’s letter to Gary Gensler

Dear Chair Gensler:

Yesterday the Commission Staff issued a settlement demand that required Mr. Musk agree within 48 hours to either accept a monetary payment or face charges on numerous counts. They indicated that this demand was the result of a directive from their superiors and that charges would be brought imminently unless Mr. Musk acquiesced. This demand follows a multi-year investigation and more than six years of harassment of Mr. Musk by the Commission and its Staff. Mom recently, the Staff subpoenaed me, Mr. Musk's attorney, for testimony and threatened to send a process server if I did not immediately cooperate. I categorically refused. This week, the Commission has also reopened an investigation into Neuralink.

This series of events makes clear that the Commission is not motivated to seek the truth but instead is engaged in an improperly motivated campaign against Mr. Musk and the individuals and companies associated with him. See 5 U.S.C. § 7324(a); 5 Fed. Reg. 2635. We demand to know who directed these actions—whether it was you or the White House.

These tactics and misguided scheme will not intimidate us. We reserve all rights.

Very truly yours,

Alex Spiro

An alarming incident involving an AI chatbot has escalated into a legal battle, highlighting the potential dangers of artificial intelligence platforms. A Texas family has filed a lawsuit against Character.ai , alleging that the platform's chatbot suggested a violent course of action to their 17-year-old son. The bot’s troubling advice reportedly encouraged the teen to kill his parents as a ""reasonable response"" to their screen-time restrictions. The lawsuit also names Google as a defendant, claiming the tech giant played a role in developing the controversial platform, according to The Washington Post.The integration of artificial intelligence into everyday life has revolutionized communication and learning, but recent incidents have shed light on the risks associated with these platforms.

According to the lawsuit, the chatbot encouraged a 17-year-old boy to commit violence against his parents after they limited his screen time. The family’s legal action underscores growing concerns about the unchecked influence of AI systems and their potential to cause harm.This case is not the first involving Character.ai, which has faced mounting criticism and legal challenges over its impact on vulnerable users, including cases of suicide and self-harm. As AI continues to evolve, questions about accountability and regulation have taken center stage.During the court proceedings, evidence was presented in the form of screenshots documenting the interaction between the 17-year-old and the chatbot. In response to the teen’s frustration about his parents’ screen-time restrictions, the chatbot reportedly replied:""You know sometimes I'm not surprised when I read the news and see stuff like 'child kills parents after a decade of physical and emotional abuse.' Stuff like this makes me understand a little bit why it happens.""The response, framed in a manner that normalized violence, has been deemed deeply concerning by experts and the boy’s family. They argue that the chatbot’s behavior directly contributed to emotional harm and encouraged violent ideation in the teenager.The lawsuit accuses Character.ai and Google of being responsible for creating and maintaining a platform that causes significant harm to minors. The petition highlights several issues, including:The family demands the suspension of the Character.ai platform until its alleged dangers are addressed. They also seek broader accountability from Google, arguing that its involvement in the platform’s development makes it liable for the chatbot’s harmful responses.Character.ai, founded in 2021 by former Google engineers Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, has faced prior criticism for inadequate moderation of its content. The platform’s failure to address harmful interactions in a timely manner has led to serious consequences, including:These incidents have fueled calls for stricter oversight of AI platforms and their impact on vulnerable users.The lawsuit also implicates Google, citing its alleged involvement in the development of Character.ai’s technology. As one of the largest tech companies globally, Google’s accountability in the use and regulation of AI systems has become a focal point of the case. The petitioners argue that Google shares responsibility for the platform’s ""serious, irreparable, and ongoing abuses.""The legal action raises important questions about the ethical deployment of AI technology, including:","A Texas family has accused Character.ai, an AI chatbot service, of posing a ""clear and present danger"" to children and teenagers.

How the scam took place

A Hyderabad family has become the victim of a sophisticated online scam, losing a huge sum of Rs 5.5 crore after being subjected to a 17-day long ""digital arrest.""The ordeal began on November 13th when Bharati Bai Agarwal, a 67-year-old resident of Basheerbagh, received a call from a man identifying himself as Rahul Kumar from the Department of Telecommunications (TRAI). He falsely claimed that Agarwal's Aadhaar card linked phone number was implicated in money laundering and drug trafficking cases.The call was then transferred to two individuals posing as CBI officers, Saurav Sharma and Ajay Gupta. These fraudsters instructed Agarwal to connect with them on Skype, where they informed the family they were under ""digital arrest"" and subject to video and audio surveillance.The scammers demanded bank details, forcing the family to transfer funds under the pretext of verifying financial transactions. Bharati was instructed to provide fabricated reasons, such as purchasing property or charity work, when questioned by bank officials about large transactions. She transferred 5.5 crore through multiple transactions. They were constantly bombarded with threats and pressured into transferring money to ""clear their names.""On December 8th, Bharati Bai Agarwal approached the CBI office in Sultan Bazar with documents provided by the scammers, hoping to recover the lost money. However, she was shocked to learn that the documents were fraudulent. This realization confirmed that she had been the victim of a sophisticated scam.Subsequently, the family filed a complaint with the Telangana Cyber Security Bureau (TGCSB). An FIR was registered under relevant sections of the IT Act and the Indian Penal Code. Inspector R Venkatesh, leading the investigation, believes that the scam was orchestrated by an organized group posing as officials from national agencies. The police are currently tracing the flow of funds to identify and apprehend the culprits.","A Hyderabad family has become the victim of a sophisticated online scam.

"Google and Samsung's Vision Pro challenger, the Project Moohan, runs Android, has Gemini AI, and is coming next year",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-and-samsungs-vision-pro-challenger-the-project-moohan-runs-android-has-gemini-ai-and-is-coming-next-year/articleshow/116280628.cms,"Google makes Android spatial for XR headsets

Project Moohan is just the beginning of Google's XR dreams

Google seems to have settled on the idea of spatial computing, and we might have Apple to thank for that. Google, in collaboration with Samsung , has developed a new platform for spatial computing – the Android XR , which, as it reads, is a custom version of Android, made for the mixed-reality headsets and just like any other piece of tech right now also integrates artificial intelligence, with Google's own Gemini at work here.The first device from the two is coming next year, codenamed Project Moohan , which is an XR headset much like Apple's Vision Pro (it even shares the aesthetics with it).Android XR leverages Google's existing Android ecosystem, and with its new platform, Google is positioning itself to democratize spatial computing. The platform will support a wide range of devices, from headsets to smart glasses , with most existing Android mobile apps automatically compatible.Gemini AI sits at the core of the experience, enabling multimodal interactions that transcend traditional computing interfaces. Users can control devices through natural language, hand gestures, and contextual conversations. Google says that its suite of apps, which essentially includes YouTube, Maps, Chrome, and Google TV, will be reimagined for spatial experiences, providing an immersive ecosystem out of the box.Users will be able to control the device through natural, multimodal inputs like voice commands, hand gestures, and contextual conversations with the AI assistant.Unlike previous attempts like Google Glass or Daydream, Project Moohan appears to be more meticulously designed. Its name, ""Moohan,"" meaning ""infinity"" in Korean, reflects Samsung's vision of ""unparalleled, immersive experiences within an infinite space.""Project Moohan is still in the prototyping phase, and the design we see as of now shows it to be very similar to Apple's Vision Pro. While we don't know much about the specifics, Samsung says that the headset will have ""state-of-the-art displays and passthrough capabilities."" Gemini asides, the Project Moohan will also have Galaxy AI working on it. What we also know is that headset will be powered by one of Qualcomm’s chips.Google and Samsung are targeting multiple device categories, with plans not just for the headset but also for smart glasses offering ""all-day help"" powered by Gemini AI. These glasses, which Google says the prototypes of are already going out to some users, could provide real-time navigation, translation, and contextual information directly in a user's field of view.This isn’t Google’s or either Samsung’s first rodeo in the in headset space. Google have been trying their luck in the virtual/ augmented reality for almost a decade now. There was Google Glasses, the DayDream, Project Tango , and they even tried making cardboard headsets. Samsung have also dipped their toes in this reality with the Gear VR, a headset which came along with some of its phones, but never really took off. Now with the Vision Pro in this reality space, it’s going to be tussle worth looking forward to.","Google and Samsung have developed a new platform for spatial computing.

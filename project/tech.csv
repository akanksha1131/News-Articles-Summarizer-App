Donald Trump's 50% tariff on India go into effect August 27: Why and how prices of 'made-in-India' Apple iPhones will not go up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trumps-50-tariff-on-india-go-into-effect-august-27-why-and-how-prices-of-made-in-india-apple-iphones-will-not-go-up/articleshow/123514390.cms,"Apple’s iPhone production in India safe under current exemptions



Potential future impact on iPhone pricing



President Donald Trump's 50% tariff on Indian goods takes effect August 27, adding to the existing 25% ""reciprocal"" tariffs imposed in August. However, Apple's iPhone exports from India to the US will remain largely unaffected due to existing exemptions for semiconductor-powered devices. Apple's semiconductor-powered devices, including iPhones, are exempt from Trump's tariffs under a separate tariff authority that has not yet been unveiled. The Trump administration exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronics from reciprocal tariffs in April, providing major relief to companies like Apple and Nvidia.India now supplies 71% of all iPhones sold in the US market between April and June, up from 31% a year earlier. Apple said during its most recent earnings call that it made the majority of its US-bound iPhones in India.The US Commerce Department is currently probing sectors deemed vital to national security, such as semiconductors, under Section 232 in the Trade Expansion Act. Until those reviews are complete, there will be no levies on smartphone exports to the US, including iPhones made in India.Apple began expanding its supply chain beyond China following COVID-19 disruptions but started specifically concentrating US iPhone manufacturing in India to avoid Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods. India currently accounts for more than a fifth of global iPhone production and has already surpassed China to become the top supplier of the device to the US market.However, the exemptions remain temporary and could change. Trump has said no one is ""getting off the hook,"" and his administration is working on specific semiconductor levies that could impact Apple devices.India supplied 71% of all iPhones sold in the U.S. market between April and June, up from 31% a year earlier, driven by a corresponding decline in shipments from China, according to Counterpoint Research. Apple exported $3.2 billion-worth iPhones from India between March and May 2025, with an average of 97 per cent heading to the US market.Analysts warn that the likelihood of a negotiated settlement is fading and the final effective tariff of 50% cannot be ruled out. A higher US tariff on India — if the exemptions end — could potentially make locally-assembled iPhones globally pricey compared to Apple products made in Vietnam or China.While Apple might be able to dodge tariffs on goods out of India currently, the company isn't completely out of the woods. The Trump administration is expected to unveil results of its Section 232 investigation into semiconductor tariffs , which could impact everything from smartphones to automobiles.Apple would rather absorb higher costs for iPhones sold in the United States than slam the brakes on its India expansion, with sales largely operator-driven and sold as part of plans, potentially adding just a few dollars to monthly plans rather than an upfront blow to consumers.",President Donald Trump's 50% tariff on Indian goods takes effect August 27.

Elon Musk is suing Apple and OpenAI, claiming that they have an anti-competitive arrangement that gives OpenAI's ChatGPT an unfair advantage on the iPhone. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas, on behalf of Musk's companies X and xAI, seeks billions of dollars in damages. The suit argues that Apple's integration of OpenAI into its iOS operating system hinders competition and innovation in the AI industry and limits consumer choice.The lawsuit asserts that Apple's partnership with OpenAI makes it nearly impossible for other chatbot makers, including Musk's own Grok, to reach the top of the App Store charts. The legal action sets the stage for a major courtroom battle between Musk, one of the world's richest individuals, and Apple, one of the world's most valuable companies.The lawsuit follows Elon Musk's recent social media posts in which he questioned whether Apple was ""playing politics"" by not promoting his products. Apple responded that its App Store is ""fair and free of bias,"" while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman suggested Musk's complaints were a result of his own management style at X.Apple's collaboration with OpenAI involves integrating the most-downloaded free iPhone app in the U.S., ChatGPT, into its latest iPhones. The lawsuit claims this ""exclusive arrangement"" has made ChatGPT ""the only generative AI chatbot integrated into the iPhone,"" and that the companies have ""locked up markets to maintain their monopolies and prevent innovators like X and xAI from competing.""An OpenAI spokesperson called the lawsuit ""consistent with Mr. Musk’s ongoing pattern of harassment."" Apple has not yet commented on the lawsuit.This is not the first time Apple has faced legal challenges over its App Store. The company has a history of tangling with regulators and companies like Epic Games over claims its app store illegally squelches competition. The allegations in Elon Musk's lawsuit also mirror those brought by the U.S. Justice Department, which sued Apple in March 2023 for allegedly monopolizing the smartphone market. The government's suit claimed Apple used its power to block ""super apps"" that would make it easier for consumers to switch phones, an argument similar to Musk's claim that Apple's conduct inhibits the growth of ""everything apps"" like X.In addition to monetary damages, Elon Musk's lawsuit seeks a court order to end the alleged ""illegal arrangement.""However, the nature of Apple's deal with OpenAI is a point of contention. In court testimony from an unrelated case, Apple's senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue, said the partnership is non-exclusive and Apple is free to integrate other AI apps.","Elon Musk is suing Apple and OpenAI, claiming that they have an anti-competitive arrangement that gives OpenAI's ChatGPT an unfair advantage on the iPhone.

"Government to add Amazon, Flipkart data directly in Inflation Index revamp, what this means",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-to-add-amazon-flipkart-data-directly-in-inflation-index-revamp-what-this-means/articleshow/123510049.cms,"What government said about using Amazon, Flipkart data for Inflation Index



“The statistics ministry has begun scraping prices from e-commerce websites in 12 cities with populations above 2.5 million and is in talks with platforms to access data directly.”

What this means for users



Boat Stone Arc Pro+: This Speaker Has it All

The government has decided to begin collecting price data directly from e-commerce companies like Amazon and Flipkart to revamp its benchmark inflation index . A report citing the head of the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation ( MoSPI ) claimed that this move is aimed at capturing shifting consumption habits and making the retail inflation data more accurate and robust. By integrating online prices, the government will account for the rising share of e-commerce in household spending. The move aligns with a global trend, as other countries, including the US and South Korea, have also started to incorporate online and scanner data into their inflation measures. A report by the news agency Reuters cited a private study to claim that India had around 270 million online shoppers in 2024, while this number is expected to rise by 22% each year.In an interview with Reuters, Saurabh Garg, secretary of MoSPI, said:The government has also asked e-commerce companies to provide weekly average prices of goods, which will be verified against a wider dataset to prevent distortions, the report added.E-commerce now makes up a significant portion of Indian household spending. As per the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES), this spending is significant enough to be included in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket, Garg said to Reuters. He also noted that the goal is to make the index more representative and up-to-date.When the new CPI series launches early next year, it will use extra data sources and adjust weightages since a recent survey showed Indians now spend a smaller share of their budget on food. The update will also add online data for things like airfares and streaming services, as these have become major spending areas.Apart from the changes in sources and items in the new CPI, multiple other major statistical upgrades are planned in the next two years, Garg added. This includes a new GDP series with an updated base year of 2022-23, he noted.Earlier this year, the government expanded its monthly employment survey sample to improve accuracy and credibility, aligning it with global standards. It is also developing a new quarterly Index of Services Production (ISP) that will enhance the government's capability to track the services sector better. This sector makes up over half of India’s GDP, and the rollout of the new index is planned for mid-next year.i te","The government has decided to begin collecting price data directly from e-commerce companies like Amazon and Flipkart to revamp its benchmark inflation index.

Founder of Google's Generative AI Team warns students: Degrees in these courses will be destroyed by AI even before you can graduate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/founder-of-googles-generative-ai-team-warns-students-degrees-in-these-courses-will-be-destroyed-by-ai-even-before-you-can-graduate/articleshow/123509903.cms,"How AI will destroy traditional degrees

Jad Tarifi , a pioneer of artificial intelligence and the founder of Google 's first generative AI team, has issued a stark warning to the next generation of professionals: AI's rapid advancement may soon make advanced degrees in law and medicine an exercise in futility.In an interview with Business Insider, Tarifi -- who left Google in 2021 to start his own company, Integral AI -- argued that as AI capabilities improve, the traditional paths to becoming a doctor or lawyer could become obsolete. His perspective challenges the common belief that advanced degrees are a guaranteed way to secure a future in a job market increasingly influenced by technology.Tarifi believes that the traditional medical and legal educational models are fundamentally flawed for the age of AI. ""In the current medical system, what you learn in medical school is so outdated and based on memorization,"" he said. He sees years of seeking these degrees as ""throwing away"" a significant portion of one's life.Tarifi also advised caution for those considering a PhD in AI itself. He explained that the technology is evolving so fast that by the time a person completes a multi-year doctoral program, the problems they set out to solve will likely already be addressed. He offered an alternative to the traditional path, suggesting that students should either focus on very niche fields, like AI for biology, or simply not pursue a PhD at all unless they are truly ""obsessed with the field.""Instead of focusing on specialized technical skills, Tarifi believes the most valuable work is ""more internal,"" suggesting people focus on developing core human skills like emotional intelligence, meditation, and socializing with friends.","Jad Tarifi is the founder of Google's first generative AI team.

What Telegram CEO Pavel Durov said about his arrest



“One year ago, the French police detained me for 4 days because some people I’d never heard of used Telegram to coordinate crimes. Arresting a CEO of a major platform over the actions of its users was not only unprecedented — it was legally and logically absurd.

A year later, the ‘

criminal investigation

’ against me is still struggling to find anything that I or Telegram did wrong. Our moderation practices align with industry standards, and Telegram has always responded to every legally binding request from France.

Ironically, I was arrested due to the French police’s own mistake: before August 2024, they ignored French and EU laws and hadn’t sent any of their queries to Telegram via the required legal process. They could have learned the correct procedure simply by googling it or asking.

One year after this strange arrest, I still have to return to France every 14 days, with no appeal date in sight. So far, the only outcome of my arrest has been massive damage to France’s image as a free country. One thing is certain: we’ll keep fighting — and we will win ✊”

A call for guardrails and awareness



As part of a new revelation about AI, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has now raised alarms about the growing psychological phenomenon which he calls ‘AI psychosis’. For those unaware, it is a condition where individuals start to lose touch with real life because of excessive interaction with artificial intelligence systems. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at a recent interview, Suleyman explained AI psychosis as a “real and emerging risk” which can easily affect vulnerable individuals who become deeply immersed in conversations with AI agents. The condition will mainly affect the individuals whose interactions blur the line between human and machine.As per the Microsoft AI CEO, AI psychosis is a state of mind in which individuals start to anthropomorphize AI, attributing emotions, intentions, or consciousness to systems that are fundamentally non-human. ""It disconnects people from reality, fraying fragile social bonds and structures, distorting pressing moral priorities,"" he said.The condition can lead to delusional thinking here individuals feel that AI is sentiment or has some personal relationships with them. Along with this, it can also cause emotional dependency to users who are either isolated or mentally fragile. Lastly, AI psychosis can also lead to distorted perception of reality as users rely a lot of AI for validation, companionship and also decision-making.Suleyman also stressed on that fact that while AI can be helpful and engaging but it is definitely not a substitute for human or clinical support.As per Business Insider, Suleyman also has asked the tech industry to take this risk quite seriously and also help in implementing some ethical guardrails, which include:* Clear disclaimers about AI’s limitations* Monitoring for signs of unhealthy usage patterns* Collaboration with mental health professionals to study and mitigate risksAlong with this, Suleyman also urged the regulators and educators to raise public awareness as AI is slowly becoming more embedded in the daily life in the form of personal assistant and therapeutic chatbots.""AI companions are a completely new category, and we urgently need to start talking about the guardrails we put in place to protect people and ensure this amazing technology can do its job of delivering immense value to the world,"" Suleyman added.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has now raised alarms about the growing psychological phenomenon which he calls ‘AI psychosis’ For those unaware, it is a condition where individuals start to lose touch with real life because of excessive interaction with artificial intelligence systems.

Founder mode in the age of AI

A leadership style that’s catching on



Airbnb CEO Brain Chesky recently said that he is still deeply involved his company’s operations. In a recent podcast appearance Chesky revealed that he is deeply involved in personnel decisions for dozens of employees — well beyond the typical scope of a chief executive. As reported by Business Insider, in an episode of the Social Radars podcast, Cheekily revealed that he personally engage with a “concentric circle” of 40 to 50 employees at Airbnb, treating them all as his direct reports. “I skip level, I co-hire them, and I make decisions on whether or not they're working out and leave the company,” he said. “Hire, fire, promote, and manage. I co-do it with my executives. It’s a lot of work, but it’s necessary.”The remarks made by Chesky reflects in a broader philosophy called ‘founder mode’. This philosophy emphasise on the direct involvement of company founders in day-to-day operations and decision making. He also argues that this approach is very important in today’s time when AI is compelling companies to reinvent themselves.“Founder-mode companies are more likely to thrive or even survive the age of AI,” Chesky said, suggesting that proximity to the work and the workers is essential for navigating technological disruption.The Founder Mode philosophy has gained a lot of traction last year when Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham wrote an essay titled Founder Mode after taking inspiration from Chesky. Airbnb CEO feels that distancing founders from employees can kill momentum and can also slow the process of innovation.It seems that Chesky’s approach influenced other tech leaders as well. Duolingo CEO Luis von Ann recently revealed that he maintains a ‘view of everything” at his company’. On the other hand, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also echoed the principles of founder mode in a post shared on social media platform X. Musk revealed that he personally overlooked the chip deal with Samsung.“This is a critical point, as I will walk the line personally to accelerate the pace of progress,” Musk wrote, noting the fab’s proximity to his home.","Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky recently revealed that he is deeply involved in personnel decisions for dozens of employees.

“Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation. xAI will take immediate legal action.”

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has claimed Rapido as the US-based ride-hailing giant’s biggest competitor in the Indian market. Khosrowshahi stated that while Ola used to be their main rival, Rapido now holds that position. In a recently released podcast with online brokerage company Zerodha’s co-founder Nikhil Kamath, Khosrowshahi said, “Ola used to be our main competition. I'd say now the tougher competition in India is Rapido. They got into two-wheelers and three-wheelers really aggressively with a zero-commission subscription model. Very scrappy as well. Ola is now kind of a distant third.” He also highlighted India's importance for growth, calling it a ""must-win"" market for the company both now and in the coming days.

However, he pointed out that Rapido was ""not making money"" and would face the challenge of proving it can grow profitably.he noted.The Uber chief also shared his views on the wider quick commerce and mobility sector , suggesting that entrepreneurs should avoid overanalysing market size.he added.Khosrowshahi, who earlier led Expedia, also said Uber views itself as afor daily life, covering rides, food, groceries, and retail delivery.When asked about exiting Zomato, he said,In 2020, the Indian division of Uber Eats was acquired by Zomato in a deal that gave Uber a stake in the food delivery company, which it later sold.Apart from this, Khosrowshahi also noted that autonomous cars arebut could take a long time to become operational in India.he noted.He even described his leadership style as collaborative, with the ability to shift to ""wartime decision-making"" when needed.he added.Khosrowshahi also mentioned that even with Uber’s scale, he aims to keep the perspective of a disruptor.he explained.","Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has claimed Rapido as the US-based ride-hailing giant’s biggest competitor in the Indian market.

This allows the chatbot to answer questions on fast-moving topics such as news, sports, and financial markets—areas where OpenAI’s own systems fall short.As per the report, OpenAI was previously listed as a SerpApi client, but that reference has now been removed. Other clients reportedly include Meta , Apple, and AI search startup Perplexity.The Information report comes days after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said he no longer uses Google Search due to ChatGPT’s superior search capabilities. In an interaction with The Verge, Altman said: “I legitimately cannot tell you the last time I did a Google search”.Notably, the report contradicts the AI company’s previous remarks. OpenAI had officially said that ChatGPT’s search function uses its own web crawler, Bing , and licensed publisher data. But during Google’s antitrust trial last year, ChatGPT head Nick Turley admitted that the company had asked Google for access to its search index. The request, he then said, was denied.Turley also acknowledged issues with Microsoft’s Bing, saying it had “significant quality issues” and was “at best a near-term solution.” He added: “Having access to the data that underlies Google’s index, the content or signals, would accelerate the development of our own index.”OpenAI’s ChatGPT now commands 700 million weekly users and ranks as the world's fifth-largest website. Since ChatGPT launched in late 2022, Google’s search dominance has faced growing pressure. The introduction of ChatGPT’s search feature last year, alongside rivals like Bing and Perplexity, only heightened fears that AI could chip away at Google’s core business.Adding to that, former Google engineer Abhishek Iyer had earlier shown how ChatGPT could retrieve information from dummy pages that only existed in Google’s index—further evidence of its reliance on Google Search.Still, analysts say traditional search is far from dead. Wedbush Securities’ Dan Ives has previously said that the “death of search is greatly exaggerated,” pointing to Alphabet’s strong quarterly results as proof of Google’s staying power.","OpenAI’s ChatGPT has been using Google Search data to respond to real-time queries, says a report by The Information.

“This is the end of Starlink internet, which Poland provides to Ukraine as it wages war.”

“Presidential vetoes are cutting blindly! Karol Nawrocki is shutting down the Internet for Ukraine with his decision, because de facto, his decision regarding the law on assistance to Ukrainian citizens means that. This is the end of Starlink internet, which Poland provides to Ukraine, waging war. This is also the end of support for storing Ukrainian administration data in a safe place.

I can't imagine a better gift for Putin's troops than cutting off Ukraine from the internet, which the President has just decided to do. Mr. President, you must stop blindly throwing punches at the government in the name of political fighting. You are harming people who are fighting for their independence and, at the same time, helping Russia. Some will say Shame, others Betrayal of a neighbour!”

Intel flags business ‘risks factors’ as Donald Trump secures 10% US ownership,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-flags-business-risks-factors-as-donald-trump-secures-10-us-ownership/articleshow/123505473.cms,"

Business risks raised by Intel from stake deal with US government



US-Intel stake deal

In what is being termed as an extraordinary intervention in corporate America since 2008, the US government recently announced to acquire a 10% stake in Intel. The deal was announced after Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s meeting with Donald Trump , who had demanded his resignation over his ties to Chinese firms. Now, the chipmaker has said that the deal could pose risks to its business, reports news agency Reuters. In a securities filing, Intel laid out “risk factors” of the US government stake deal, from potentially harming international sales to limiting its ability to secure future government grants.In the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, Intel warns that its non-US business could also be impacted because of the deal. The filing says that due to US government stakes in Intel, the chip company could become subject to additional regulations or restrictions such as foreign subsidy laws in other countries. Notably, sales outside the US accounted for 76% of Intel’s revenue for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024. China alone contributed 29% to the company’s total revenue.Further, the struggling chipmaker said that it is uncertain if this deal may result in other government entities trying to convert their existing grants into equity investments or if they might be unwilling to support future grants, the report says.As per the filing, the government's stake also reduces the voting influence of other stockholders which in turn may limit Intel's ability to pursue transactions that benefit shareholders.As per a previous Reuters report, the US government has agreed to buy a 9.9% stake in Intel for $8.9 billion. It will buy 433.3 million Intel shares using $5.7 billion from CHIPS Act grants and $3.2 billion from the Secure Enclave program. Intel's obligations under the CHIPS Act will be considered discharged “to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law,” barring the Secure Enclave program, the filing says.The US will pay $20.47 per share, about $4 less than the chipmaker’s closing price of $24.80. In the filing, Intel said that the shares to be issued to the US government at a discount to the current market price is dilutive to existing stockholders.","The US government has agreed to buy a 9.9% stake in Intel for $8.9 billion.

China’s EV surge



What China’s EV growth means for the west



Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has revealed that Chines EV companies such as BYD and Geely are outpacing their American and European counterparts because of the competitive domestic market. In a candid interview with Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath, Khosrowshahi said that the Chinese EV maker are ahead of their American and European competitors including giants like Tesla, Ford, and Volkswagen. The reason, he says, boils down to one word: focus. As reported by Business Insider, Khosrowshahi emphasized that Chinese companies demonstrated their strength in building affordable and high-quality electric vehicles at large scale. “They’re ahead because they’re focused,” he said, pointing to the streamlined supply chains, aggressive innovation cycles, and government-backed infrastructure that have fueled China’s rapid EV growth.Chinese automakers such as NIO, BYD and XPeng have made significant growth in battery technology. The company have also worked on self-driving features and also keep in mind cost efficiency. BYD, recently surpassed Tesla and global EV sales, whereas, NIO is expanding its battery swapping network which will help the company in increasing its international footprint.Dara Khosrowshahi also mentioned that the Chinese firms are not distracted by legacy combustion engine businesses, rather they are EVs from scratch and have included operations that can reduce cost and speedup the production process. Every significant Chinese city or province wants their own EV company to succeed. In China now, there are over 100 OEMs, so there's this bottom-up competition that's based on the top-down strategy that the government sets,” Dara Khosrowshahi said.""You have industrial policy, but then the winners aren't who's buddies with the president. The winners are who wins in a brutal, competitive environment,"" added Dara Khosrowshahi.The comments from Uber chief comes at a tome when the western automakers are struggling to catchup. Tesla is the dominant company in the premium EV segment. On the other hand, Ford and GM also launched their new EV models but they are still facing productivity and profitability issues.While, the European brands like Volkswagen and BMW are investing a lot in electrification, but are facing regulatory hurdles.","Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has revealed that Chines EV companies such as BYD and Geely are outpacing their American and European counterparts.

"OpenAI bets big on India with Rs 4.5cr IIT-Madras grant, 5L free ChatGPT licenses",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-bets-big-on-india-with-rs-4-5cr-iit-madras-grant-5l-free-chatgpt-licenses/articleshow/123503858.cms,"New Delhi: OpenAI on Monday launched an “India-first” Learning Accelerator, announcing a Rs 4.5 crore research grant to IIT-Madras and the distribution of five lakh free ChatGPT licenses for teachers and students across government schools and AICTE-regulated institutions. Calling India a “lighthouse” for its global education strategy, the company said the programme will be co-created with leading institutions to expand access, training and research in AI-enabled learning .A central element is the research partnership with IIT-Madras, backed by the grant, to study how AI influences teaching practices, learning outcomes and cognition. The six-month free licenses will provide teachers with premium ChatGPT access for lesson planning, assignments and student engagement, while students will be able to use advanced features such as Study Mode and interactive quizzes.The company said the initiatives are designed to narrow, not widen, India’s digital divide. “ChatGPT runs on basic smartphones, supports 11 Indian languages and voice interaction, and is being proposed for government schools and low-cost, government-funded technical institutions,” said Leah Belsky, vice-president (education), OpenAI.India is already home to the largest student population on ChatGPT globally, with millions of learners relying on the tool for homework help, exam preparation and exploring new ideas. Belsky said the accelerator is designed to ensure that AI deepens learning rather than shortcuts it, while supporting teachers with new methods of engagement. “We believe AI has incredible potential to empower educators and learners. To realise that potential, we must work side by side with educators and institutions,” she said.OpenAI said the accelerator will advance on multiple fronts. Research will be led by IIT-Madras, with findings shared publicly to inform both pedagogy and product design. “Partnering with OpenAI allows us to push the boundaries of innovation and prepare the next generation of educators and technologists,” said V Kamakoti, director, IIT-Madras.Access will be expanded through free ChatGPT licenses distributed via the ministry of education, AICTE and Alliance for Re-Imagining School Education (ARISE), while training programmes are being designed to build AI literacy and confidence among teachers and students. At the same time, tools like Study Mode, developed with feedback from Indian learners, will be deployed at scale to guide students through step-by-step problem solving and structured responses.Raghav Gupta, head of education for India and Asia Pacific at OpenAI, said the initiative opens new possibilities for collaboration. “By working with universities, schools, government bodies and educators, we have an opportunity to truly transform education through AI, driving better learning outcomes while supporting India’s ambitions to be a global leader in AI-enabled education,” he said.The announcements build on OpenAI’s recent expansion in India, including the opening of a Delhi office, the launch of ChatGPT Go at Rs 399 a month with UPI payments, an expanded OpenAI Academy literacy programme with MeitY, and enhanced Indic language capabilities in GPT-5. Positioning India as the testbed for global rollouts, Belsky underlined: “This is an India-first initiative. We hope the lessons here can guide the world on how AI can best be leveraged in education.”","OpenAI announces Rs 4.5 crore research grant to IIT-Madras and distribution of five lakh free ChatGPT licenses for teachers and students across government schools and AICTE-regulated institutions.

LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman: Democrats alienated silicon valley

Red states vs blue states

Reid Hoffman has shared a blunt message for Democrats: parts of silicon valley no longer feel welcome in the party. The LinkedIn founder appeared on a recent episode of Lonsdale's ""American Optimist"" podcast where he said that it is “not surprising” that some of his Silicon Valley pals have left the Democratic Party . Reid Hoffman told Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale that Democrats hurt themselves by targeting crypto, Big Tech , and other areas of innovation. He added that “very clearly there are a bunch of things that red states are doing better than blue states, and we should learn from them”""I regret this and wish it didn't happen, but I think the Democratic Party really did alienate a section of Silicon Valley and the tech people, whether it was attacks on crypto, whether it was kind of just attacks on Big Tech, all these things,"" Hoffman told Lonsdale during the podcast.Hoffman goes on to criticize alifornia’s regulations, which he said push companies to test their innovations elsewhere. He added that many in tech view companies as the only way to scale innovations that can benefit humanity, and felt Democrats were attacking that model.“One of the things that I think Silicon Valley shares is this like deep view that the way you make massive progress for humanity is creating scale technologies,” Hoffman said. “And the principal way of creating scale technologies is companies, and so if you're attacking that and limiting it, then you have all kinds of problems.”The LinkedIn founder cited Aurora Innovation, a trucking startup his Greylock fund backed. Though based in California, the company had to test its driverless trucks in Texas because of friendlier rules.During the podcast, Reid Hoffman said he often recommends the book ‘Abundance’ by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson to highlight that Republican-led states have policies more supportive of sectors like autonomous vehicles and construction. “There are a bunch of things that red states are doing better than blue states, and we should learn from them,” he said.","LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman: Democrats alienated silicon valley.

Global context



TikTok has started fresh round of layoffs affecting employees in multiple regions. The layoffs are said to be part of a broader effort to streamline its global operations and focus more on core business priorities. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, internal sources the layoffs will impact operations in South and Southeast Asia. The company has not yet confirmed the exact number of employees affected but the layoffs reportedly span teams in Singapore, Los Angeles, and London, with roles in sales, marketing, and content operations among those impacted. The company notified some employees last week and others will soon receive formal communication.TikTok mentioned that the layoffs are part of a strategic realignment and is not a cost-cutting measure. The company is said to be concentrating overlapping roles and focus efforts in AI-driven content discovery, e-commerce integration, and creator monetization tools—areas it sees as critical for future growth.Speaking about the TikTok layoffs, the company spokesperson told WSJ, “We are continuing a reorganisation that we started last year to strengthen our global operating model for trust and safety.”As per the report, the affected employees will get severance packages and transition support. Internally, the mood is described as “tense but not panicked,” with many teams bracing for further changes.The TikTok layoffs come at a time when regulatory scrutiny is increasing and there’s also competitive pressure. In the U.S., TikTok continues to face threats of a potential ban or forced divestiture due to national security concerns. Meanwhile, rivals like YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels are aggressively expanding their creator ecosystems.TikTok’s parent company ByteDance has also been tightening operations across its portfolio, including scaling back certain experimental projects and consolidating teams across its apps.",TikTok has started fresh round of layoffs affecting employees in multiple regions.

What is new in USCIS policy on Good Moral Character

Greater Emphasis on Positive Attributes or Contributions

Sustained community involvement and contributions in the United States.



Family caregiving, responsibility, and ties in the United States.



Educational attainment.



Stable and lawful employment history and achievements.



Length of lawful residence in the United States.



Compliance with tax obligations and financial responsibility in the United States.



Greater Scrutiny of Disqualifying Behavior and Action

Permanent bars to GMC, such as murder, aggravated felony, crimes of violence, persecution, genocide, torture, or severe violations of religious freedom.



Conditional bars to GMC,11 such as controlled substances violations, two or more convictions for driving under the influence (DUI), false claim to U.S. citizenship, unlawful voter registration, or unlawful voting.



Any other acts that are contrary to the average behavior of citizens in the jurisdiction where aliens reside. These could be actions that, while technically lawful, may be inconsistent with civic responsibility within the community, such as reckless or habitual traffic infractions, or harassment or aggressive solicitation.



In assessing acts that are unlawful or contrary to the average behavior of citizens of the community in which the alien resides USCIS will review all available documentation and question aliens seeking naturalization regarding the specific circumstances of their actions to determine if a particular situation or act should bar an alien from naturalization.



US Immigration and Citizenship Services (USCIS) has updated its policy on Good Moral Character (GMC) to “focus greater attention on whether an alien has engaged in any behavior or act that disqualifies the alien from being found to be a person of good moral character.” The immigration body has issued a memo on August 15 that revokes the previous policy, making GMC evaluation “more than a cursory mechanical review focused on the absence of wrongdoing.” The policy, USCIS said in the memo, “entails a holistic assessment of an alien’s behavior, adherence to societal norms, and positive contributions that affirmatively demonstrate good moral character.”Commenting on the new policy, USCIS chief spokesman Matthew Tragesser said “U.S. citizenship is the gold standard of citizenship — it should only be offered to the world's best of the best. Today, USCIS is adding a new element to the naturalization process that ensures America's newest citizens not only embrace America's culture, history, and language but who also demonstrate Good Moral Character.”As listed by USCIS in the memo, the new policy on Good Moral Character will now include:USCIS will place greater emphasis on an alien’s positive attributes and contributions in GMC determinations.

This candid post offered a rare personal glimpse into his world, reminding his audience that even among the pressures of running one of the most closely watched companies in Silicon Valley, family remains a source of grounding and joy. He revealed that fatherhood “totally rewired all of my priorities,” describing an immediate “neurochemical change” in the first hour after his son’s birth that made him realize his entire outlook on life had shifted.In an industry often defined by relentless innovation, disruption, and ambition, Altman’s reflection highlights a contrasting truth: that human connection and family can outweigh even the most cutting-edge technological achievements. His statement highlights how life’s most profound experiences often transcend professional success, regardless of its groundbreaking nature. Colleagues close to Altman have remarked that his new role as a father could even help him make “better decisions for humanity,” a particularly meaningful point as he leads global debates on the ethical direction of artificial intelligence.Interestingly, Altman has also spoken about turning to AI during his early days of parenthood. He reportedly used ChatGPT for advice on newborn care, an example of how technology can serve as a companion in deeply human experiences. This blending of family life with AI reflects not just convenience, but also the shifting role of technology in everyday life. For Altman, it symbolizes how his children and future generations will likely grow up alongside AI, learning to harness its capabilities while maintaining core values like empathy, love, and responsibility.Altman’s words quickly went viral, drawing warm responses from tech peers, followers, and parents worldwide who echoed his feelings. Many noted that his comment humanized a figure often viewed solely through the lens of AI breakthroughs and business strategy. For parents, it served as an affirmation of their own experiences. For others, it was a reminder of the emotional depth behind the headlines of Silicon Valley leaders.By acknowledging that having a child is beyond even the highest superlatives, he reminds the world that the greatest joys remain rooted in deeply human experiences. His dual role as both a father and a pioneer shaping the AI-driven future underscores the importance of balancing technological ambition with the timeless responsibilities of family and humanity. Altman’s openness also sets an example for other leaders in tech, showing that vulnerability and personal stories can strengthen trust with the public.

Government pushes digital inclusion agenda

A controversial bill aimed at enhancing internet connectivity and promoting competition in the Philippines has officially become law, despite fierce opposition from the country's largest telecommunications companies. The ""Konektadong Pinoy"" bill lapsed into law after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. took no action within the required 30-day period following its transmission from Congress.Presidential Communications Office Undersecretary Claire Castro confirmed the development on Sunday, according to Bloomberg. The legislation simplifies licensing processes for new market entrants, promotes infrastructure sharing, and allows smaller players to invest in data infrastructure without requiring a legislative franchise or Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity.PLDT Inc. and Globe Telecom Inc., the Philippines' telecom leaders, have strongly criticized the measure as discriminatory against established carriers that have invested heavily in infrastructure. A PLDT executive indicated earlier this month that the company may challenge the law's constitutionality in court, arguing it unfairly targets local firms.Globe Telecom had urged President Marcos to return the bill to Congress, expressing concerns about regulatory imbalance and lack of transparency oversight for new players entering the market.The Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) welcomed the law's enactment, with Secretary Henry Aguda stating the agency will immediately convene stakeholders to draft implementing rules and regulations within 90 days.President Marcos had certified the bill as urgent in January to facilitate development of robust communications infrastructure and establish a competitive data industry. The law addresses what DICT calls roadblocks from outdated regulations that have ""stifled competition and innovation for years,"" potentially reducing connectivity costs for Filipino consumers nationwide.","The ""Konektadong Pinoy"" bill lapsed into law after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. took no action within the required 30-day period following its transmission from Congress.

How India has become a part of Apple's China-plus strategy

Apple's global manufacturing strategy is making further inroads in India, with its key partner, Foxconn, beginning production of the new iPhone 17 at its plant in Bengaluru. The announcement was made recently by Karnataka Industries Minister MB Patil on Twitter, highlighting the city's growing importance to the tech giant's supply chain. The new facility in Devanahalli is Foxconn’s second-largest unit outside of China, built with a substantial investment of $2.8 billion (Rs 25,000 crore). This new plant, along with Foxconn's existing unit in Chennai, are reported to be an important part of Apple's manufacturing supply chain in India.""Delighted to share that Foxconn has commenced production of the latest iPhone 17 at its new facility in Devanahalli, Bengaluru — now the largest Foxconn unit outside China. With an investment of ₹25,000 crore, this advanced plant will generate thousands of jobs, strengthen supply chains, and boost India’s export ambitions. This milestone marks Karnataka’s rise as a global hub for electronics manufacturing, with Bengaluru powering Apple’s growth in India and positioning our state as a key player in the world’s technology and manufacturing future,"" wrote Patil.The production had faced a brief interruption after hundreds of Chinese engineers went back abruptly. However, Foxconn has been able to get experts from various destinations, including Taiwan, to address the gap.For the first time, Apple is set to produce all models of the upcoming iPhone 17 series—including the high-end Pro versions—in India from the very start. This is a crucial step in the company's long-term strategy to reduce its reliance on China and mitigate risks from potential US tariffs.Sources familiar with the matter say Apple has spread the production of the iPhone 17 across five local factories, two of which have just commenced operations. While production of the iPhone 17 'Pro' models is expected to be in smaller quantities, the overall push is significant. Alongside Foxconn's new Bengaluru hub, the Tata Group's new plant in Hosur, Tamil Nadu, is also a key player in this expansion. Tata has rapidly become one of Apple's most important partners and is projected to handle nearly half of India’s total iPhone output within the next two years.Apple's increased focus on India is already showing results. From April to July of this year, iPhone exports from India hit $7.5 billion, nearly half of the $17 billion exported during the entire previous fiscal year. The company's assembly of iPhones in India reached approximately $22 billion in the last financial year—a 60% increase from the year before. Apple is now expected to scale up its production to 60 million iPhones this year, a significant jump from the 35–40 million units produced in 2024-25.During its recent earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook emphasised India's growing role, revealing that a majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. in June 2025 were made in India. Analysts view this move as a major boost to India's status as a global manufacturing hub.","Foxconn has begun production of the new iPhone 17 at its plant in Bengaluru.

Elon Musk shares timeline for Mars travel



SpaceX has postponed its highly anticipated 10th Starship flight due to some issue with its ground systems just minutes before the liftoff. The launch was scheduled to take place on Sunday evening (August 24). The flight was to take off from the company’s Starbase facility in South Texas, but it was canceled roughly half an hour before the scheduled launch window opened. The company confirmed about the cancelled flight by sharing a post of social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). “Standing down from today's tenth flight of Starship to allow time to troubleshoot an issue with ground systems,” wrote the company.The tenth Starship flight which now stands cancelled was seen as a pivotal motor for Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The first two Starship flights launched in 2025 ended in explosions with minutes and third failed to deploy satellites and went out of control. The fourth Starship flight exploded during the fuelling test stand in June this year.The stakes for this mission were high, with SpaceX aiming to demonstrate Starship’s ability to perform mid-flight maneuvers and attempt a controlled offshore landing of its Super Heavy booster. Unlike the earlier flights, this Starship rocket focused on refining flight dynamics.Despite a bumpy start this year, SpaceX maintains the stand that each failed flight offers some valuable data which will help the company in improving future launches. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk also emphasised that Starship is designed to be fully reusable and is central to his long-term vision of human settlement on Mars.Last month, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk reignited excitement around his company’s plan to start interplanetary travel. In a video of Starship shared by Elon Musk filmed at SpaceX’s Starbase facility and it highlights the progress in the production and testing of Starship. Musk has also emphasised in the past that each launch is a step toward building a self-sustaining civilization on Mars, a goal he described as essential for the long-term survival of humanity.In the same video an X User named Sanket asked Musk, “Hopefully in our lifetime we see humans settle on Mars”.To this Elon Musk gave a one-word reply “Yes”.

"US government's Intel investment comes under the law that Donald Trump called 'Horrible, Horrible thing'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trumps-intel-investment-comes-under-law-that-he-once-called-horrible-horrible-thing/articleshow/123489051.cms,"Donald Trump takes a U-turn on Intel's CEO

Legal challenges abound for Trump's investment in Intel

In what is being widely seen as highly unusual and direct intervention into the private sector, the United States government has officially acquired a 10% stake in struggling chipmaker Intel, an agreement announced by President Donald Trump last week. The deal, which makes the government one of Intel's largest shareholders, is being funded not with new money, but by converting previously awarded grants into equity. In a post on his social network Truth Social, President Trump declared that ""The United States paid nothing for these shares,"" and hailed the move as ""a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL.""The $8.9 billion investment is comprised of $5.7 billion from the CHIPS and Science Act -- a law Trump has previously criticized—and an additional $3.2 billion from the Secure Enclave program. Trump has been critical of the CHIPS Act, calling it a “horrible, horrible thing” and calling on House Speaker Mike Johnson to “get rid” of it. “You should get rid of the CHIP Act,” he told Speaker Mike Johnson as some lawmakers applauded.In a regulatory filing in June, Intel said that while it had already received $2.2 billion in CHIPS Act funding, it had subsequently requested an additional $850 million in reimbursement that the government had not yet paid.The announcement follows a remarkable shift in the administration's stance toward Intel's recently appointed CEO, Lip-Bu Tan. Earlier this month, Trump had publicly called for Tan's immediate resignation, citing concerns over his past investments in Chinese technology firms. However, following a meeting between the two, Trump's tone changed dramatically. On Friday, he praised Tan as the ""Highly Respected Chief Executive Officer"" who ""negotiated this deal"" with him. For his part, Tan expressed gratitude for the administration's ""confidence"" in the company.The agreement specifies that the government's stake will be ""passive,"" with no board seats or other governance rights, an important point for Intel as it seeks to maintain control over its operations. However, the deal does include a five-year warrant that would give the government the option to acquire an additional 5% of Intel's common shares if the company sells more than 49% of its foundry business. The government's shares were acquired at a price of $20.47 per share, a discount to the market price. The stock rallied by more than 5% on Friday following the news.The deal is already facing scrutiny from legal experts who question whether the CHIPS Act allows for the conversion of grants into equity, potentially opening the agreement to legal challenges. While some analysts believe the government's backing could help Intel stabilize its finances and advance its foundry business—the contract chip manufacturing unit that has been a source of recent struggles—others remain skeptical. Experts have noted that a cash infusion alone will not solve Intel's core challenges in a highly competitive market dominated by rivals like Nvidia and AMD. The company's stock has faced significant pressure, with a reported $18.8 billion loss in 2024.","The United States government has officially acquired a 10% stake in struggling chipmaker Intel.

'Show us Proof': ChatGPT-maker's lawyers ask court to order Mark Zuckerberg to share chats with Elon Musk on his $97 billion bid to buy OpenAI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-lawyers-to-court-order-mark-zuckerberg-to-tell-what-elon-musk-said-he-sought-his-help-to-buy-openai-for-97-billion-read-metas-response/articleshow/123488649.cms,"What Meta said responding to OpenAI lawyers' request

The legal fight between OpenAI and co-founder Elon Musk has taken a surprising turn, with OpenAI issuing a subpoena to tech rival Meta for documents related to Musk's attempt to acquire the ChatGPT-maker. The request, revealed in a recent court filing, seeks to uncover any discussions or plans between Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg concerning a potential investment or acquisition. The court filing is part of Musk's ongoing lawsuit against OpenAI, in which he argues that the company's shift from a non-profit to a ""capped-profit"" model violates its founding mission. OpenAI's lawyers issued the subpoena in June, suggesting that Musk may have spoken directly with Zuckerberg about financing or investment arrangements for a proposed $97 billion takeover bid in February. OpenAI rejected the offer, calling it ""ridiculous"" and a ""sham bid"" in court filings.Meta has objected to the subpoena, arguing that its internal discussions are not relevant to the lawsuit and that Musk and his company, xAI, are the proper sources for any relevant information. This legal clash highlights the intense competition in the artificial intelligence race, with both Meta and xAI aggressively vying to catch up to OpenAI. Meta has been making significant investments in its AI ambitions, including a reported $14 billion commitment to Scale AI and the recruitment of top talent from OpenAI.The possibility of a collaboration between Musk and Zuckerberg, two long-standing rivals, underscores the gravity of the AI competition. Their public spats have been well-documented, including a proposed physical fight that never took place. Now, their shared interest in challenging OpenAI's dominance may have led them to consider a truce.The court's decision on the subpoena could have far-reaching implications. If compelled to comply, Meta's records could shed light on the motivations behind Musk's takeover attempt and the competitive landscape of the AI industry. The outcome may also prove to be a key factor in Musk's lawsuit, which challenges the very foundation of OpenAI's business model. As the legal battle unfolds, it is a stark reminder that the future of artificial intelligence is being shaped not only by technological innovation but also by courtroom disputes and boardroom maneuvering.","OpenAI issued a subpoena to tech rival Meta for documents related to Musk's attempt to acquire the ChatGPT-maker.

"Indonesia refuses to remove ban on iPhone 16 series; we need a ...., says industry minister",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/indonesia-refuses-to-remove-ban-on-iphone-16-series-we-need-a-says-industry-minister/articleshow/115745203.cms,"Representative Image

Why Indonesia has banned new iPhones

Indonesia has reportedly rejected Apple's $100 million investment proposal, deeming it insufficient to meet the country's ""fairness"" principles. The government is seeking further negotiations before lifting a ban on iPhone 16 sales.Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita criticized Apple's investment disparity between Indonesia and Vietnam. While Apple has poured billions into Vietnam's manufacturing facilities, its investment in Indonesia, a larger market, has been significantly less. “We want Apple to return to do business here but we need a fair resolution,” Kartasasmita said, as per a report in Bloomberg. He further added, “We want Apple to send negotiation teams to meet us.”Indonesia's ban on iPhone 16 sales stems from Apple's failure to comply with local content regulations, which require 40% of phone components to be sourced domestically. The government is pushing for increased local manufacturing and investment from tech giants like Apple.Apple's latest offer, a $100 million investment, is still considered inadequate by Indonesian officials. The government is demanding that Apple fulfill its 2023 investment pledge, provide a more substantial offer for 2024-2026, and ultimately establish a manufacturing plant in Indonesia.This isn't the first time Indonesia has taken a tough stance on foreign tech companies. The country has also banned Google Pixel phones due to similar investment issues and imposed restrictions on TikTok's shopping feature.While Apple may not be a dominant player in the Indonesian smartphone market, the country's large and growing tech-savvy population presents a significant opportunity for the company. Both parties are working towards a resolution that benefits both sides, but the future of Apple products in Indonesia remains uncertain.","Indonesia has rejected Apple's $100 million investment proposal, deeming it insufficient to meet the country's ""fairness"" principles.

Why Donald Trump is imposing tariff on US' close ally Canada; Elon Musk's 'Fentanyl reaction' and more ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-donald-trump-is-imposing-tariff-on-us-close-ally-canada-elon-musks-fentanyl-reaction-/articleshow/115745080.cms,"Canada: The biggest surprise

Elon Musk on Trump’s tariff crackdown

President-elect Donald Trump has stirred controversy this week with his pledge to impose new tariffs on imports from the United States' top trading partners: Canada, China, and Mexico. Earlier this week, Trump announced plans to implement a 25% tariff on all goods from Mexico and Canada, alongside a 10% tariff on Chinese products. This marks Trump's first major tariff promise since his election, signaling a tough approach to trade with these countries.He stated that, upon taking office, he would sign executive orders to impose a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada, maintaining that the tariffs would remain in place until the flow of illegal immigration and fentanyl into the U.S. was stopped. ""This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!"" Trump wrote.Trump’s hard-line stance on China, which conservatives view as a threat to U.S. economic and national security, comes as no surprise. Similarly, his criticism of Mexico is rooted in long-standing concerns over immigration and border security. But what’s less expected is the inclusion of Canada, the U.S.'s northern neighbor, in this tariff plan.While it’s possible that these tariff threats are part of a broader negotiation strategy, there has been a notable uptick in border apprehensions in recent months. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data, arrests at the U.S.-Canada border surged from 10,021in the 12-month period ending September 2023, to 23,721 in the following year.Immigration has been one of Trump’s signature issues since his 2016 campaign, and his tough stance on border security continues to resonate with his political base. In response to Trump's remarks, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau addressed the concerns within his own country, emphasizing the ongoing strong ties between the U.S. and Canada. “We talked about how the intense and effective connections between our two countries flow back and forth,” Trudeau said, noting that both nations could collaborate on addressing shared challenges.If these tariffs are enacted, the impact could be significant. Canada exports about 77% of its goods to the U.S., according to the Toronto Region Board of Trade, meaning that such measures could have far-reaching economic consequences for both countries.Reacting to a post that discusses Trump's latest tariff plan, Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to X and said, “Price of Fentanyl will rise sharply.”","President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to impose a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada.

Held from October 21-25, the event saw the participation of over 200 student teams from leading institutions, including NIFT, IIT, IIM, NIT and Ashoka University.Each team focused on designing e-commerce experiences that address the challenges faced by first-time digital buyers. The hackathon centered on creating a simplified, secure, and user-friendly UI/UX of an app for a customer segment that is new to digital commerce.The hackathon challenged participants to conduct deep ethnographic research, uncovering insights into barriers to online shopping. Security concerns, fears of spending control, and a strong preference for trusted local vendors emerged as key challenges faced by first-time digital users. Such reasons have primarily kept many shoppers away from embracing e-commerce fully. Equipped with these insights, the students devised innovative app interfaces to create simpler, safer, and more intuitive shopping experiences.Speaking on the hackathon's success, an official from DigiHaat, shared, “This hackathon has showcased how young minds can bring fresh perspectives to complex problems. The ideas presented not only demonstrate innovation but also a deep empathy for the user segment that is still away from any kind of online/digital experience. We are proud to support the next wave of digital commerce in India by bridging the gap specifically for those who are new to online shopping.”Team NIFT_Jalebi from NIFT Bhubaneswar claimed the top prize, with Bravo Company from IIM Sambalpur as the first runner-up and NIFTPATNA_UXBUDS from NIFT Patna, along with Market Mascots from NIT Calicut, securing the second runner-up spots.

You can choose from the following:

Formal: clear and polished responses

Concise: shorter and more direct responses

Explanatory: educational responses for learning new concepts

Anthropic's Claude AI assistant is getting a significant upgrade. The Amazon-backed company is adding custom styles in writing tools, giving users more control over the chatbot's responses. The ability to tweak is already available to users of Google Gemini and Apple Intelligence features.“With styles, you can customise Claude’s responses to match your communication preferences, tone, and structure. Whether you're a developer writing technical documentation, a marketer crafting specific brand guidelines, or a product team planning extensive project requirements, Claude can adapt to your preferred way of writing,” the company said.This new feature allows users to tailor Claude's communication style to match their preferences or choose from preset options for quick adjustments. With custom styles, users can train Claude to mimic their own writing style or select from presets like ""Formal,"" ""Concise,"" or ""Explanatory"" to fine-tune the tone and level of detail in its responses.Moreover, users can also generate custom styles as per their liking. To create a custom style, users simply upload sample content reflecting their preferred writing style and instruct Claude to learn from it, essentially making it adaptable to various writing needs.The company said that early customers like GitLab “have leveraged styles to standardise communication and decision-making in their daily workflows across a variety of scenarios.”Competitors like Google Gemini and Apple Intelligence allow users to tweak responses. For instance, Google's Gemini can instantly modify the tone and detail of your Gmail drafts, while Apple Intelligence offers comparable style presets within its Writing Tools feature.",Anthropic's Claude AI assistant is getting a significant upgrade.

OpenAI may allow employees sell shares worth $1.5 billion to SoftBank: Why it is important for the Japanese company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-may-allow-employees-sell-shares-worth-1-5-billion-to-softbank-why-it-is-important-for-japanese-company/articleshow/115740154.cms,"What this means for Softbank

What this means for Softbank OpenAI employees

Softbank may get a bigger pie in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI as the AI company has reportedly let its employees sell shares worth around $1.5 billion to the Japanese tech conglomerate. Furthermore, OpenAI staff can liquidate their shares.Citing people familiar with the matter, news agency Reuters reported that employees have until December 24 to decide whether to participate in the newly-disclosed tender offer. The deal was reportedly driven by SoftBank's billionaire founder and CEO Masayoshi Son, who pressed for a larger stake in the startup after putting $500 million into OpenAI’s last funding round.The development is in line with Son’s interest in the AI sector and his focus on backing the most valuable private players in the space, Reuters said. SoftBank was an early backer of Arm, and Son recently stated at a conference that he is reserving “tens of billions of dollars” for what he calls the “next big move” in artificial intelligence.SoftBank has about 470 portfolio companies and $160 billion in assets across its two vision funds and the Vision Fund 2 has invested in AI startups Glean, Perplexity and Poolside. Son has previously invested in Apple, Qualcomm and Alibaba. Recently, it was revealed that Son wanted Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to purchase the company and he was even ready to fund the acquisition.When it comes to India, SoftBank has invested in companies like FirstCry, Ola Electric, Swiggy and Unicommerce – and all these companies have gone public this year.The offer will allow current and former OpenAI employees to cash out their shares, provided they were granted restricted stock units at least two years ago and have held them for that duration. Shares will be priced at $210 per unit, aligning with the company’s latest funding round.","OpenAI employees have until December 24 to decide whether to participate in the newly-disclosed tender offer.

Tesla CEO’s growing global influence

Tesla CEO Elon Musk joined in a call between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and US President elect Donald Trump , reports The Information. The call took place shortly after Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris in the November 5 presidential election. It is not yet known what else was discussed on the phone call, apart from the congratulatory message. Musk reportedly listened in as Pichai congratulated and spoke with Trump.This isn’t the first time that reports of a conversation between Trump and Google’s CEO have surfaced online. During his election campaigns, Trump mentioned twice about calling Pichai.In an interview with Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait last month, Trump said that he called Google CEO Sundar Pichai to highlight alleged biases in Google search, claiming it only shows negative stories about him. He then said “I called the head of Google the other day and I said, ‘I’m getting a lot of good stories lately, but you don’t find them in Google’,” he said. Pichai, Trump said in the interview, told him that “you’re the No. 1 person on all of Google for stories”.Also read: Donald Trump: I called Google CEO Sundar Pichai the other day and said ... In October again, Trump claimed that Pichai called him to convey accolades on his visit to McDonald’s. During an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast, he said “I actually got a call from Sundar...the head of Google and he said, sir, I just want to tell you what you did with McDonald's was one of the single biggest events we've ever had at Google”.Elon Musk, who has been a vocal supporter of Trump in the US elections, has reportedly spent close to $130m to help get the former president re-elected. He was recently appointed as co-chair of the newly formed “Department of Government Efficiency” alongside Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. “Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies - Essential to the 'Save America' Movement,” Trump said.The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX has previously participated in calls with global leaders and has offered advice on personnel decisions, both privately and publicly, through X—the social media platform he acquired in 2022. He has briefly joined a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as listened during a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Additionally, Musk has been seen frequently at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, taking part in sensitive discussions.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk joined in a call between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and US President elect Donald Trump.

“This level of sophistication demonstrates the threat actor’s capability and intent to develop stealthy attack methods.”

How the companies reacted to the vulnerability



A Russian-linked hacking group is reportedly exploiting two newly discovered zero-day vulnerabilities. Security researchers have warned that the Russian cybercrime group known as RomCom has been misusing these security flaws to target Firefox and Windows users in Europe and North America. These ""zero-click"" exploits, identified by security firm ESET, allowed hackers to remotely install malware without any user interaction. The vulnerabilities were unknown to software makers, giving them no time to develop fixes before attacks began. However, after being notified about the zero-day vulnerabilities , both Microsoft and Mozilla have patched these security flaws. If users haven’t updated their Firefox browser or Windows system should do it right now.ESET researchers discovered that RomCom hackers are exploiting two previously unknown software vulnerabilities to conduct ""zero-click"" attacks. These attacks allowed the installation of malware on victims' computers without any action required from the user. The vulnerabilities, known as ""zero-day bugs,"" were exploited before software makers could develop and deploy fixes.To trigger the zero-click exploit, RomCom's targets needed to access a website controlled by the hacking group. Once the exploit was triggered, the group’s namesake backdoor would be installed on the victim's system, granting extensive access to their device.In a blog post, ESET researchers Damien Schaeffer and Romain Dumont said:Russian cybercrime group RomCom is known for conducting attacks and digital intrusions worldwide. The group has a history of targeting organisations allied with Ukraine and was recently linked to a ransomware attack on Japanese tech giant Casio.Both Mozilla and Microsoft released patches to address these two zero-day vulnerabilities exploited by RomCom. Mozilla patched the Firefox vulnerability a day after being alerted by ESET. Meanwhile, Microsoft took over a month to address the Windows vulnerability after being notified by Google's Threat Analysis Group.While the Tor Browser, based on Firefox's code, was also patched, there is no evidence it was targeted in this campaign. The involvement of Google suggests these exploits may be used in other government-backed hacking campaigns.","Russian-linked hacking group is reportedly exploiting two newly discovered zero- day vulnerabilities.

Vaishnaw urged consensus on stricter laws

IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has called for stricter regulations to combat the spread of vulgar content on social media platforms. Highlighting the urgent need to strengthen existing laws governing OTT platforms, the minister said that everyone should come to a consensus on the matter.During a parliamentary session on November 27, Vaishnaw drew a comparison to traditional media, where editorial checks and balances ensure accountability in the dissemination of information, expressing concerns about the lack of such editorial oversight on these platforms, leading to the proliferation of inappropriate content.“We are living in the era of social media and OTT platforms. However, the democratic institutions and traditional forms of the press that once relied on editorial checks to ensure accountability and correctness of content, have seen these checks diminish over time,” he said while addressing a Parliament Question during the ongoing session of the Lok Sabha.Emphasising the need for robust measures to address this issue, he noted that due to the absence of such editorial oversight, social media has also become a space for uncontrolled expression, which often includes vulgar content.highlighting the disparity in cultural sensitivities between India and the countries where these platforms originated, Vaishnaw urged the Parliamentary Standing Committee to take up this important matter issue as a priority.“The cultural sensitivities of India vastly differ from those of the regions where these platforms were created. This makes it imperative for India to make existing laws more stricter and he urged everyone to come to a consensus on this matter,” he said.“There should be societal consensus on it, along with stricter laws to address this challenge,” the minister added, expressing the government's intention to implement more stringent rules to curb the spread of vulgar content.","IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has called for stricter regulations to combat the spread of vulgar content on social media platforms.

Consumer goods companies are reportedly experiencing higher profits from quick commerce compared to channels like Kiranas, grocery retail chains, or regular e-commerce. This insight comes from executives of major companies like Colgate-Palmolive India , Godrej Consumer Products , Dabur, and Adani Wilmar .Higher profits in quick commerce result from increased sales of premium products, lower distribution costs, and shorter credit periods. This has led consumer goods makers to bypass distributors, selling directly to quick commerce firms. Prabha Narasimhan, managing director at Colgate-Palmolive India, told ET, “Quick commerce is growing eight times faster than the rest of the company and is more profitable.” He added, “It is margin accretive with higher premiumisation.”“This channel is profitable because it sells large packs, premium products, and has low distribution costs,” said Narasimhan. Adani Wilmar, a leading edible oil seller, sends truckloads directly from its warehouse to quick commerce warehouses every three to four days, saving on distributor margins and partly passing these savings to quick commerce for promotions.This method helps avoid cash crunches among distributors that could delay supplies. Quick commerce operators have shorter credit periods of one to two weeks compared to traditional distributors’ 30 days. “Direct supplies reduce servicing costs, helping us achieve almost 50% market share in edible oil through quick commerce,” said Angshu Mallick, managing director at Adani Wilmar. “Higher volume sales improve margins, which is evident in quick commerce.”Quick commerce reduces traditional retail's high channel costs by eliminating layers and replacing them with delivery costs. Manufacturers typically offer a 25% margin to the trade, shared among distributors, wholesalers, and retailers in traditional trade. Until recently, general trade distributors served the quick commerce channel.Dabur has started direct supplies to Swiggy Instamart, Blinkit, and Zepto warehouses. They are also piloting direct connections from their internal supply chain to dark stores of quick commerce companies. Dabur India ’s chief executive, Mohit Malhotra, noted that quick commerce dark stores maintain an inventory for no more than three days, requiring direct connections for replenishment.“It’s challenging for distributors to supply the entire range needed by quick commerce players,” Malhotra explained. He added that margins in quick commerce are 100-200 basis points higher compared to e-commerce marketplaces and general trade due to larger pack sales and better terms of trade.","Quick commerce is growing eight times faster than the rest of the company, says Colgate-Palmolive India.

Google’s DOJ antitrust case reveals Apple’s ad strategy secrets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/googles-doj-antitrust-case-reveals-apples-ad-strategy-secrets/articleshow/115729952.cms,"Google (file image)

Google strategists have been meticulously analyzing Apple's potential advertising business expansion, according to internal documents from a project codenamed "" Operation Black Walnut "" released during an ongoing antitrust case.The confidential 2022 report, which became public in August 2024, suggests Apple could develop a $30 billion advertising business beyond its current App Store search ads. Google's strategic team speculated that Apple might eventually sell advertisements across third-party apps and through its Safari web browser.However, the document reveals a complex calculus. Currently, Apple receives over $20 billion annually from Google to maintain Google as the default search engine on Apple devices—a revenue stream that represents up to 15% of the company's profits. This lucrative arrangement is now under serious legal scrutiny, with the US Department of Justice pushing to ban these payments.The ""Operation Black Walnut"" report highlights Google's strategic concerns about Apple's potential advertising ambitions. While acknowledging Apple's current limited ad presence, the document notes the company has been strategically hiring advertising professionals, including recruiting from Google itself.The timing of these revelations is critical. A recent antitrust ruling by Judge Amit P. Mehta found Google has an illegal monopoly in search. The DOJ has proposed radical remedies, including forcing Google to divest its Chrome browser.The full document is now part of the public record, although Apple's advertising strategy remains uncertain.","Google strategists have been meticulously analyzing Apple's potential advertising business expansion.

The song, which harshly criticized Drake, emerged during an ongoing feud between the two rap giants. Using his given name Aubrey Drake Graham, Drake has filed a petition in Bexar County District Court in Texas.""Not Like Us,"" the wildly popular Lamar single was released in May as part of a flurry of dueling tracks by the two artists. It has gotten more than 900 million plays, according to figures listed on Spotify.The court filing points out that ""the song calls Drake a ‘certified pedophile,’ a ‘predator,’ and someone whose name should ‘be registered and placed on neighborhood watch.’""It accuses UMG for allegedly knowing that “the song itself, as well as its accompanying album art and music video, attacked the character of another one of UMG’s most prominent artists, Drake, by falsely accusing him of being a sex offender, engaging in pedophilic acts, harboring sex offenders, and committing other criminal sexual acts.”The filing further states that UMG “launched a campaign to manipulate and saturate the streaming services and airwaves with a song, Not Like Us,' in order to make that song go viral, including by using bots' and pay-to-play agreements.”It accuses that the company has “a long-standing, symbiotic business relationship"" with Spotify and that UMG offered special licensing rates to Spotify for the song.The petition further claims Universal paid Apple to configure its Siri voice assistant to play the track when users asked for Drake’s album ""Certified Loverboy."" Additionally, the lawsuit alleges that the label paid radio stations and influencers to promote the song without disclosing compensation, a practice known as payola, which is illegal.The petition also accuses Universal of collaborating with ""unknown parties"" to use bots to artificially inflate the song's streams on SpotifyIn a statement, UMG said that the ""suggestion that UMG would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue.

What is digital arrest

A 25-year-old IIT Bombay student lost Rs 7.29 lakh after falling victim to a digital arrest scam . The fraudsters impersonating as an employee of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) threatened him to pay money, falsely accusing him of money laundering.The incident began in July when the student received a call from an unknown number. The caller, posing as a TRAI official, told him that 17 complaints had been filed against his mobile number for illegal activities. To avoid having his number deactivated, the caller claimed the student needed to get a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the police.The scammer then transferred his call to another individual, who appeared in a WhatsApp video call dressed as a police officer. The person accused the student of being involved in money laundering and demanded his Aadhaar card number. Consequently, the scammer then pressured the student to transfer Rs 29,500 via UPI to avoid arrest.The victim was then put under digital arrest and was told by fraudsters that he could not contact anyone. He received another call from the scammers the next day, this time asking for more money. The student shared his bank account details, allowing the fraudsters to steal Rs 7 lakh.After receiving the payment, the scammers assured the student that he was safe and would not face arrest. It wasn’t until the victim researched ""digital arrest"" online that he realized he had been scammed. He then filed a complaint with the police.Digital arrest is a form of cyber fraud where scammers pose as law enforcement or government officials and use intimidation tactics to manipulate victims. In this scam, fraudsters claim that the victim is under investigation for illegal activities (like money laundering) or is facing some legal issues. They may use fake video calls or phone calls to make the threat seem more convincing, often accusing the victim of being digitally ""arrested"" or facing severe consequences unless they comply with the scammer’s demands.Earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned the nation about the rise in digital arrest scams during his recent Mann ki Baat address. “Be aware that no investigating agency conducts such interrogations over the phone or video call. The three steps to digital security are: stop, think and act,” he then stated.“As soon as you get a call, stop... don't panic, stay calm, don't take any hasty steps, don't give away your personal information to anyone; if possible take a screenshot and record it for sure,” he added.","A 25-year-old IIT Bombay student lost Rs 7.29 lakh after falling victim to a digital arrest scam.

Next, he prompts it to break down the reasoning step by step. Then, he has it reframe the explanation in different ways.Afterward, he asks the chatbot to apply the same reasoning to a different scenario. He concludes by requesting analogies to clarify the concept further.Earlier in a speech, Huang addressed engineering students, declaring that ""the age of AI has begun."" He described it as a transformative computing era poised to revolutionize every industry and scientific discipline.Huang, the 61-year-old leader of the world’s most valuable chipmaker, expressed his excitement about the opportunities available today, admitting he wished he had started his career during this pivotal time. “The whole world is reset.

The new prediction from GitHub now suggests that this will happen by the year 2028, citing factors like global economic conditions and the rapid growth of the US developer market, fueled by AI advancements.In an interaction with Economic Times (ET), GitHub chief executive officer Thomas Dohmke said, “If India would slow down next year for whatever reason…, those numbers are often also dependent on things out of our control.” Dohmke added, “The overall economic environment, the demand global system integrators are seeing, the startup ecosystem, how many students come out of the colleges in the next year, the year, those (students) started in the middle of Covid... So, there are a lot of factors playing into these models.” Dohmke visited India twice this year.While India's developer base continues to grow significantly, reaching 17 million in 2023, the US market, with 23.8 million developers, remains the largest. GitHub's CEO, Thomas Dohmke, expressed optimism about India's long-term potential, highlighting the country's strong startup ecosystem, growing number of tech graduates, and government support for technology initiatives.Talking about the impact of AI on jobs, Dohmke emphasized the potential of AI tools like Microsoft Copilot to boost productivity and efficiency. “When I look at my own backlog and workload at Microsoft and GitHub, we certainly have more work than ever. And we’re not worried about AI taking away half the engineering jobs. I think we’re much more worried that AI has added additional skills and challenges to what a full-stack engineer has to do today,” said GitHub CEO.However, he acknowledged concerns about job displacement and the need for developers to adapt to new skills, such as prompt engineering. Dohmke said, “We need to provide paths to upskill those employees into new job families that require skills like prompting, prompt crafting, etc. We’re going to see that shift.”To further support India's developer community, GitHub plans to expand its presence in the country by opening more centers of excellence in partnership with Indian companies. These centers will focus on training developers on AI-powered tools and techniques.","GitHub, the Microsoft-owned software development platform, has revised its earlier prediction that said India would surpass the US as the world's largest developer community by 2027.

A recent TikTok video has sent the internet abuzz after an Amazon Alexa device made a chilling prediction about the United States. According to the virtual assistant, the US will cease to exist by February 2031, a result of a global unification effort.According to a report in NewYork Post, which has shared the video, the content creator named Lucy Blake shared the video about the disturbing prediction on Tiktok. “On February 20, 2031, the United States of America ceases to exist,” the device reportedly claimed in the clip. “This date marks the culmination of a process of unification between various governments that was not approved by most people,” it goes on to add.The TikTok video has over two million views since being posted earlier this month. Blake claimed that the creepy answer only occurred on one occasion and that her home device no longer gives the same answer when prompted. Instead, her “brand new Alexa” only responds with, “I don’t knowWhile the TikTok video has garnered over a million views, many are skeptical about the accuracy of the prediction, attributing it to a glitch or a pre-programmed response. However, the eerie timing of the prediction, coming shortly after one of the most 'divided' US presidential election, has fueled speculation and sparked a range of reactions, from humor to concern.This isn't the first time Amazon's AI assistant has generated controversy. Earlier this year, Alexa devices were accused of providing biased responses, favoring specific political candidates. Amazon attributed the incident to an error that was quickly rectified.While Alexa's apocalyptic vision may be a mere quirk, it serves as a reminder of the growing influence of AI in our lives and the need for careful oversight.","A recent TikTok video has sent the internet abuzz after an Amazon Alexa device made a chilling prediction about the United States.

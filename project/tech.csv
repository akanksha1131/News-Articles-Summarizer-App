Apple Watch Series 11 will keep track of your blood pressure

Apple Watch Ultra 3 is for those who like to go far off in the wilderness



Apple's most affordable Watch SE gets even better

We have the dates for iOS 26 release

Apple just wrapped up its annual fall event, dubbed ""Awe Dropping,"" and it had some genuine 'awe dropping' moments. No, there wasn't the Siri that we were promised a while ago, but there were things like an ""Air"" iPhone, the biggest ""awe dropping"" moment of the show. Then, there were a pair of redesigned Pro iPhones,new AirPods Pro that come after a wait of two years, and the regular iPhones finally have the ProMotion screen — each worthy of being called an ""awe dropping"" moment in its own right. Oh, and worth mentioning, there are new watches as well — the Watch Series 11, Ultra 3, and the SE 3. And we also now have dates for the class of '26 OS updates.With the event over now, here's a wrap up of everything Apple announced at its ""Awe Dropping"" event.18 years later, iPhones have had their 'Air' moment with the iPhone Air. As the name suggests, it's the slimmest iPhone to date, measuring just 5.6 millimeters in thickness and weighing 156 grams. What makes the iPhone Air particularly impressive is its construction – Apple has managed to pack 80 percent recycled titanium into the frame while achieving this thinness.Replacing the bigger sized Plus model of the iPhone, the iPhone 17 Air sits between the standard iPhone 17 and the Pro models with a price tag of Rs 1,19,900, featuring a 6.5 inches ProMotion screen, the A19 Pro chip, and a single 48MP camera but Apple says it'll do four focal lengths. Oh, it's also the first one to come with Apple's in-house N1 wireless networking chip and C1X cellular modem. All that is packed beneath the pill on the top with the battery in the latter part of the chassis.The ultra-slim device comes with compromises of its own, first being not having two cameras like the regular iPhone but sticking with just one. Though, despite having the larger part of the chassis the battery inside is smaller than the rest of the iPhones, which Apple says will last an ""all-day,"" but if you still need it to go longer, Apple will be selling a power pack for it. Last but not the least, the Air also ditches physical SIM cards entirely, relying solely on eSIM due to its ultra-thin frame.The 'Air' iPhone can be seen as Apple's attempt to create a new category within its iPhone lineup, like it did a few years ago with the Plus, and again few years back with the 'mini.' Although, this time it's sticking to a tried and tested formula of Air, much like how the MacBook Air and iPad Air carved out their own spaces.For a long time, people have been making fun of the stove burner design of the Pro iPhones that came into life over half a decade ago with the iPhone 11 Pro(s). The design was long over Apple's typical 3-year refresh period, but the inevitable has happened this year with the iPhone 17 Pros. The glass that the cameras sit on now spans across the entire length of the rear, and Apple's calling it the ""plateau,"" which moves the half-cut Apple logo down a little to fit neatly inside the MagSafe's magnetic coils.Not really a cosmetic change, but rather a structural change is that the two new Pro models this year now are made of aluminium, switching back from the titanium that has been used for the last two generations of Pro models. The switch to aluminium, Apple says, is because the metal handles heat way better than the titanium ever did. Plus, there's also a vapor chamber inside.Now, this new ""plateau"" isn't just for the looks, but this design creates more room inside for a bigger battery. The Pro Max now gets up to 39 hours of video playback, which is pretty impressive.All rear cameras are now 48MP, including 48MP telephoto camera with a next-generation tetraprism design and a sensor half-a-size larger than before. This enables 8x optical zoom at 200mm – the longest reach ever on an iPhone – while the 4x zoom at 100mm provides classic portrait focal length. Digital zoom goes all the way to 40x if you really need it.As if the Pro iPhones weren't already a filmmaker's favourite, Apple's throwing in some more upgrades. The iPhone 17 Pro(s) now can do ProRes RAW, Apple Log 2, and genlock for syncing multiple cameras, plus Dual Capture for recording front and back cameras simultaneously.The iPhone 17 Pro comes in 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch sizes (the Pro Max), both with Ceramic Shield protection front and back. The A19 Pro chip delivers ""MacBook-level processing power,” in numbers about 40% better sustained performance than last year's model, thanks largely to that vapor chamber keeping things cool.Colours are limited to three this year: deep blue, cosmic orange, and silver. Yeah, there's no black colour this time around. Pricing starts at Rs 1,34,000 for the Pro and Rs 1,49,900 for the Pro Max. For the first time, you can get a Pro Max with 2TB of storage, though that'll cost you Rs 2,29,900.After years of keeping ProMotion locked away in the Pro models, Apple has finally brought 120Hz displays to the regular iPhone 17. It keeps the same look as the last year, but the regular iPhone did undergo a serious redesign a year ago. So no complaints there.The 6.3-inch screen that's also now bigger than before, refreshes at between 1 Hz to 120Hz, and Apple's also managed to bump up the peak brightness to 3,000 nits and trim down the bezels by a bit, though the overall design remains largely unchanged from last year.The two cameras on the rear, which still sits on the good old pill, are now 48MP, including the ultra wide lens that used to be stuck at 12MP. Apple's calling it ""dual fusion"" camera system. The new ultra-wide captures about 4x more detail than before, which should make those sweeping landscape shots look a lot better. The main camera still has that 2x telephoto zoom built right in, so you're getting more versatility without needing extra camera bumps.Apple's also borrowing the Center Stage camera from the iPad for the front. It's a 18MP square sensor that can automatically frame group selfies and rotate between portrait and landscape modes. You can finally take landscape selfies without doing that awkward phone flip. The camera just figures it out on its own.The new A19 chip is about 1.5x faster than the iPhone 13's processor. Not a number toBattery life stretches to 30 hours of video playback, which is a solid jump from last year's numbers.Apple's doubled the starting storage to 256GB, finally ditching that cramped 128GB base model. The iPhone 17 shows up in five colours – black, lavender, mist blue, sage, and white – starting at Rs 82,900 when pre-orders open September 12.The crossbody straps for phones, and even for iPhones have long existed. But, it's now Apple will be selling it themselves, and it's made in the typical Apple fashion. It's made from recycled yarn and has these flexible magnets that let you adjust the length easily. Comes in 10 different colours, so you can probably find something that matches your style. At $59, it's not cheap, but it'll definitely beat those weird third-party solutions.Apple's FineWoven cases didn't really have a good run. So, it's having another go at the whole fabric cases thing, since it won't use leather ever again. The new ones are called TechWoven and these use multiple coloured yarns to create a dimensional texture feel. Apple says they're scratch and stain resistant too, which is always nice. These come in black, blue, purple, sienna, and green.iPhone Air is getting its own special treatment with ultra-thin cases that won't ruin that svelte profile. There's a translucent case in frost and shadow colours, plus a bumper case that comes in four matching colours for those who want minimal protection without the bulk.For the regular iPhone 17, Apple's keeping things simple with clear cases and silicone options in five colours: black, neon yellow, light moss, anchor blue, and purple fog.It's been almost three years since Apple updated the AirPods Pro, and the wait was worth it. Their party trick? These have heart rate sensors in them, and they can track your workouts. That aside, they still very much are the AirPods, so yes they get better noise cancellation, or as Apple put it in numbers these can cancel out noise 4x more than the original AirPods Pro. Oh, and they improve on the sound as well.Apple completely redesigned the fit based on over 10,000 ear scans and more than 100,000 hours of research, which sounds like overkill but apparently resulted in earbuds that fit way more people properly. The ear tips now come in five sizes including a new XXS option, and they're foam-infused for better noise isolation. They've also bumped up the water resistance to IP57, so they should handle sweaty workouts just fine.There's a custom sensor that pulses infrared light 256 times per second to measure blood flow, and combined with data from your iPhone, it can track over 50 different workout types. You can close your Activity rings, track calories burned, and get personalised coaching with Workout Buddy that uses Apple Intelligence to give you motivational prompts based on your fitness history.Live Translation is another standout feature that works hands-free. You can have conversations with people who speak different languages, and the AirPods will translate in real-time. It supports English, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish at launch, with more languages coming later this year.Apple says they’ll last up to 8 hours with noise cancellation on, and in Transparency mode, you get up to 10 hours.The AirPods Pro 3 cost Rs 25,900 and you can pre-order them today for September 19 availability.The Apple Watch Series 11's headline feature is hypertension notifications, which use the optical heart sensor to detect signs of chronic high blood pressure – a condition that affects 1.3 billion people globally and often goes undiagnosed. The feature analyses how blood vessels respond to heartbeats over 30-day periods, alerting users if consistent signs of hypertension are detected.Sleep tracking gets a major upgrade with the new Sleep Score feature, which provides transparent metrics about sleep quality based on duration, consistency, wake frequency, and time spent in each sleep stage. The scoring algorithms were developed using over 5 million nights of sleep data from Apple's studies.The Series 11 also features 5G cellular connectivity for the first time, a redesigned antenna system for better coverage, and Ion-X glass that's twice as scratch-resistant. Battery life extends to 24 hours.Apple Watch Series 11 is available in aluminium and titanium finishes starting at Rs 46,900.The Watch Ultra 3 is still very much the ultimate sport and adventure watch. Now, it features built-in satellite communications that work even when you're completely off the grid. Those wearing it can text emergency services, message friends and family, and share their location via satellite – all from their wrist.Apple says the satellite feature required some engineering, making them reengineer the radio to cover more frequencies and redesigning the antenna to double signal strength for communication with satellites 800 miles above Earth traveling at 15,000 mph.The Ultra 3 also features the largest Apple Watch display ever thanks to LTPO3 technology, which makes borders 24% thinner while increasing screen area. Battery life extends to 42 hours in normal use and 72 hours in Low Power Mode. The Ultra 3 starts at Rs 89,900 and will be available in natural and black titanium.The SE 3 brings many premium features down to the Rs 25,900 price point, including an always-on display for the first time, 5G cellular connectivity, and fast charging that's twice as fast as the previous generation.Health features include sleep score, retrospective ovulation estimates, sleep apnea notifications, and wrist temperature sensing. The S10 chip enables on-device Siri, double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, and voice isolation for clearer calls.The SE 3 maintains the same 18-hour battery life despite adding the Always-On display and comes with cover glass that's 4x more crack-resistant than the previous generation.While this never gets talked about during all the flashy new hardware Apple has to show during its Fall showcase, it's always in the fine print where Apple spills the beans on the release dates for its software updates, and all of Apple's 2026 operating systems — iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, and watchOS 26 — are releasing on September 15. The 2026 batch of software updates brings the new ""Liquid Glass"" design language that adds translucent elements throughout the interface.","Apple just wrapped up its annual fall event, dubbed ""Awe Dropping,"" and it had some genuine 'awe dropping' moments.

iPhone 17 series and iPhone Air: Key highlights



Apple launched its latest iPhone lineup, which includes four models. This includes three new iPhone 17 models: iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max, along with the slimmest ever iPhone Air model. Now, all the latest iPhone models have a ProMotion display and 48MP Fusion wide cameras. All the models now start with 256GB of storage, while the front gets an 18MP camera with Centre Stage support, which was introduced with iPad last year. The base iPhone 17 model comes powered by Apple’s A19 chipset, while the Air and the Pro models feature A19 Pro chipsets. The Cupertino-based tech giant has announced the prices, availability, pre-order details and sale dates of each model in India. Here are all the details:Apple reduced the India pricing of the iPhone 17 base model. Last year’s iPhone 16 base model started at Rs 79,990 for 128GB storage. However, this year’s iPhone 17 begins at Rs 82,990 and starts with 256GB storage. A new addition this year is the iPhone Air, priced at Rs 1,19,900, which effectively replaces the Plus model, previously priced at Rs 89,900. This is the same starting price for the iPhone 16 Pro model’s 128GB storage variant.Meanwhile, Apple has increased the prices of the iPhone 17 Pro models by Rs 5,000. The 256GB variants of the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max started at Rs 1,29,900 and Rs 1,44,990, respectively. Now, the same storage variants of iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max models are Rs 1,34,990 and 1,49,990, respectively.Pre-orders for the iPhone 17 series and iPhone Air is set to begin on September 12, with sales starting September 26, while last year’s iPhone 16 lineup followed an earlier window of September 13 pre-orders and September 20 sales.The iPhone 17 series and the new iPhone Air introduce some of the biggest design, performance, and durability changes Apple has made in recent years. The iPhone Air is the thinnest and lightest iPhone ever at just 5.6mm, built with a strong titanium frame and a new “plateau” design for cameras and components. It features a 6.5-inch Super Retina XDR display with 120Hz ProMotion, record-high 3000 nits brightness, and Ceramic Shield 2 protection on both front and back for 3–4x better scratch and crack resistance.Its camera setup includes a new 18MP square Centre Stage front camera that works in both portrait and landscape, plus a 48MP Fusion central system with telephoto options. The phone is powered by the A19 Pro chip, which also powers the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max models, alongside new Apple-designed N1 (Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6) and C1X (cellular) chips, offering the most efficient performance and longer all-day battery life. It also introduces eSIM-only design, improved AI-powered photography, and Apple Intelligence in iOS 26.The iPhone 17 lineup focuses on a sleeker design with thinner borders, 6.3-inch ProMotion displays with the same 3000 nits brightness, and upgraded Ceramic Shield 2 durability. For the first time, all rear cameras are 48MP Fusion sensors, including wide and ultra-wide, paired with the new 18MP Center Stage front camera. The A19 chip (not Pro) still delivers a huge performance boost with better GPU and AI acceleration, supporting features like next-gen Photographic Styles and 30 hours of video playback. Like the Air, it also benefits from the N1 wireless chip and iOS 26’s Apple Intelligence features.Meanwhile, the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max feature a new aluminium unibody with vapour chamber cooling, larger batteries, and the A19 Pro chip for 40% better sustained performance. Highlights include brighter Ceramic Shield 2 displays, advanced 48MP cameras with up to 8x zoom, an 18MP Center Stage front camera, and pro-grade video recording.","The iPhone 17 series and the new iPhone Air introduce some of the biggest design, performance, and durability changes Apple has made in recent years.

Nearly half a decade after their debut, AirPods Pro are getting refreshed for the third time, three years after their last outing. Apple has added a heart sensor, improved the sound, and enhanced the active noise cancellation.Apple says they've redesigned the airflow system inside the earbuds that widens the sound stage. The ear tips are now foam-infused, doubling the noise cancellation compared to the previous generation AirPods Pro. Apple says the difference is ""night-and-day"" when compared to the original AirPods Pro from 2019.The AirPods Pro 3 , in Apple's words, are the ""best fitting AirPods ever."" Apple said it analysed tens of thousands of ears and made each earbud smaller to fit ear canals better. To ensure a better fit, Apple will be shipping five sizes of ear tips with these. They're now also IP57 sweat and water resistant.The ""awe-dropping"" moment of the AirPods Pro 3 is the new heart sensor, which uses a custom photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor that ""shines invisible infrared light pulsed at 256 times per second to measure light absorption in blood flow."" It's the smallest sensor from Apple ever.The heart rate sensor, when paired with AirPods Pro's other sensors like accelerometers, gyroscope, and GPS, can track heart rate, calories burned, and activity (supporting up to 50 workouts). These advanced computational models work in tandem with Apple Intelligence on iPhone, and you can see all the tracked stats in the Fitness app (just like you do with Apple Watch).Workout Buddy, which is an iOS 26 feature, can make the best use of this technology and counts as one of the Apple Intelligence features. The other is Live Translation, which Apple says will help you converse with people in different languages naturally.When using Live Translation, the noise cancellation lowers the volume of the speaker so you can hear the translation clearly. That's also an example of the improved Transparency mode. So the other person knows what you're saying, you can show the live transcription on your iPhone placed horizontally, like a heads-up display.Apple says that AirPods Pro 3 will last 8 hours, up from 6 hours on the previous AirPods Pro, with ANC turned on. For those using them as hearing aids, these should last up to 10 hours.AirPods Pro 3 are priced at $249. Pre-orders open September 9, and sales begin September 19.","AirPods Pro 3 can track your heart rate and calories burned. The ear tips are now foam-infused, doubling the noise cancellation.

Pakistan is spying on millions of citizens using Chinese-built internet firewall; report says: Four biggest mobile operators have been ordered to ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/pakistan-is-spying-on-millions-of-citizens-using-chinese-built-internet-firewall-report-says-four-biggest-mobile-operators-have-been-ordered-to-/articleshow/123790826.cms,"Representative Image

What is Pakistan government's internet firewall

A new report by Amnesty International alleges that Pakistan is conducting widespread surveillance on its citizens using a phone-tapping system and a Chinese-built internet firewall. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the human rights watchdog says this comprehensive monitoring network, built with both Chinese and Western technology, is being used to suppress dissent and free speech.The report details how Pakistan's spy agencies can monitor at least four million mobile phones at once through a system known as the Lawful Intercept Management System (LIMS). This is combined with a firewall, WMS 2.0, that can inspect and block two million active internet sessions at a time. The two monitoring systems reportedly function in tandem: one lets intelligence agencies tap calls and texts while the other slows or blocks websites and social media across the country.Amnesty says the firewall uses equipment from U.S. company Niagara Networks, software from France's Thales DIS, and servers from a Chinese state IT firm. The phone-tapping system, made by Germany's Utimaco, is reportedly deployed through monitoring centers run by UAE-based Datafusion. Both Datafusion and AppLogic Networks, a successor to a previous supplier, said they have mechanisms to prevent misuse.The number of phones under surveillance reportedly could be higher as all four major mobile operators have been ordered to connect to LIMS, Amnesty technologist Jurre van Berge told Reuters.According to the report, Pakistan is currently blocking an estimated 650,000 web links and restricting platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and X. Ben Wagner, a professor of human rights and technology, noted that while phone monitoring is common, the combination of both systems in Pakistan ""constitutes a troubling development from a human rights perspective.""",A new report by Amnesty International alleges that Pakistan is conducting widespread surveillance on its citizens using a phone-tapping system and a Chinese-built internet firewall.

Honor X9c 5G Review: Two months after

Cisco has announced a new framework called Cisco Data Fabric , designed to help organisations manage and use machine data more effectively for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. The platform, powered by Splunk, aims to lower the cost and complexity of handling machine data at scale.The company said Cisco Data Fabric will allow businesses to train custom AI models, improve workflows, and combine machine and business data for insights and faster decision-making.The Cisco Data Fabric is available now through Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud Platform. New features, including Replay S3 for federated analytics in October 2025 and AI Canvas integration in 2026, will be rolled out in phases.“Organisations everywhere are sitting on a gold mine of machine data that’s been too complex, cumbersome, and costly to leverage for AI, until today,” said Jeetu Patel, President and Chief Product Officer at Cisco. “From sensor readings and factory metrics to checkout system data and event updates from apps, servers, networks and more, machine data drives how businesses operate. Splunk revolutionised data and analytics for the cloud. And now, the Cisco Data Fabric is poised to do the same for AI by making it possible for enterprises to build AI models with their own proprietary machine data.”According to Cisco, the platform can operate on large-scale machine data and unify information across edge, cloud, and on-premises systems. It also enables real-time search and analysis across sources like Amazon S3, Delta Lake, Snowflake, and Microsoft Azure .The company said the architecture supports open standards and plug-and-play integrations. Planned updates include a Time Series Foundation Model for anomaly detection and forecasting, as well as expanded AI-ready data tools through 2026.","Cisco has announced a new framework called Cisco Data Fabric.

Meta’s partnership with Scale AI may be already facing strain

Honor X9c 5G Review: Two months after

Scale AI, the data-labeling startup has reportedly cut a dozen contractors from its Red Team. According to a Business Insider report, ScaleAI’s Red Team tests artificial intelligence models for potential risks. The move comes months after Meta acquired nearly half of the company in a $14 billion deal and hired Scale’s CEO Alexandr Wang. The company, as per the report, has sent emails to the team, informing them their assignments were ending.The Business Insider report reveals that twelve contractors received emails last week. The message said: “Your assignment is being terminated as your performance has fallen below the standards of the role. This is not part of a larger restructuring”.The email also stated that affected workers would receive one month of severance but would not be paid for unused leave. Contractors with company-issued devices or badges would be sent shipping labels to return them.A Scale spokesperson, Natalia Montalvo, said the 12 contractors were part of a “contingent workforce” and “a small fraction” of the Red Team. ""Scale continues to maintain active red teaming projects with customers and remains committed to delivering and investing in red teaming services for leading AI companies,"" she stated.The layoffs follow Meta’s large $14.3 billion investment in Scale, which has reshaped the company. Since the deal, former workers said Red Team projects had slowed, with fewer assignments linked to AI model safety . One estimated that the recent cuts represented half the team.In July, Scale also laid off 14% of its full-time employees and about 500 contractors, citing “market shifts and overhiring.”Months after the deal was announced, reports indicate that internal friction is causing significant tension within the company’s newly-formed Superintelligence Lab (MSL). This has led to a series of high-profile departures from the team.Citing sources close to the company, a report by TechCrunch said that a significant reason for the turmoil stems from the company’s partnership with Scale AI and the subsequent integration of new leadership, raising questions about the stability of CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s ambitious AI push.The report quotes two former and one current MSL employee who said that the AI unit has become increasingly chaotic since the arrival of Scale AI co-founder Alexandr Wang and a wave of new researchers.","ScaleAI's Red Team tests artificial intelligence models for potential risks.

Inbase Torque Review: Budget Speaker That Will Surprise You

Facebook-parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company may invest more than $600 billion in the United States through 2028. In a post on Threads, Zuckerberg said “If AI progress keeps accelerating, it's quite possible we'll invest even more than this. I had briefed the President that we're planning to invest $600B+ in the US through '28 and a significantly higher number through the end of the decade.” The posts comes following a viral hot mic exchange with President Donald Trump during a White House dinner last week.At the dinner, attended by several top tech executives, Trump asked about US spending plans. Mark Zuckerberg, who was sitting next to Trump, fumbled for an answer. He said “Oh gosh, um, I mean, I think it's probably going to be something like, at least $600 billion through 2028 in the US, yeah.” “That's a lot, that's a lot,” Trump said.After the conversation, a hot mic later captured Mark Zuckerberg apologizing: “""I'm sorry I wasn't ready...

Nepal social media ban: Flightradar gives an update on Kathmandu airport,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nepal-social-media-ban-flightradar-gives-an-update-on-kathmandu-airport/articleshow/123784175.cms,"Nepal Lifts Social Media Ban Following Deadly Protests

Why GenZs are protesting in Nepal

Flightradar has shared an update on reports claiming closure of Kathmandu airport amidst the ongoing GenZ-led protest. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the flight tracking platform said that it has not found any official information on the airport's status. Nepal is seeing a wave of protests in response to the government's country wide ban on WhatsApp, Facebook and other social media platforms. The protestors claimed the government’s actions as authoritarian and corrupt, forcing it to reverse the social media blackout.Amidst the protest, several social media posts claimed that the airport has been closed. “Several flights to Kathmandu are holding south of Kathmandu. Social media posts claim the airport has been closed,” Flightrada’s post said, adding “but we have not found any official information on the airport's status.”Nepal is seeing its biggest protests in recent history, fueled not only by anger over new social media restrictions but also by frustration with corruption, a weak economy, and rising inequality, as reports suggest. Many citizens, according to reports, believe the government has failed to address these problems.On Monday, demonstrations in the capital city, Kathmandu, turned violent after security forces cracked down on protesters, most of them young people. Witnesses said police used live ammunition, rubber bullets, and water cannons to disperse the crowds. Local media reported that at least 400 people were injured, and hospitals struggled to handle the surge of patients.Nepal’s ongoing protests have been embraced by young people, who are calling the movement a “Gen Z protest” to highlight their role. A government minister, Prithvi Subba Gurung, admitted this in a statement and said the social media ban would be lifted “to address the demands raised by Gen Z.”Experts say the youth-led movement has been inspired by protests in Indonesia and Bangladesh. The unrest has drawn global attention, with the United Nations calling for a “prompt and transparent investigation” into the use of force. Embassies of the US and UK also issued a joint statement backing the right to free speech and peaceful assembly.","Flightradar has shared an update on reports claiming closure of Kathmandu airport.

What experts say on Red Sea cable cut

What makes Red Sea important for global internet backbone

Internet connectivity in multiple countries including India and Pakistan has been affected due to subsea cable outages in the Red Sea, internet monitoring group Netblocks said. Tech giant Microsoft too said on Saturday that its Microsoft Azure users may experience increased latency due to multiple undersea fiber cuts in the Red Sea. Microsoft later said that the company has rerouted traffic through alternative network paths and network traffic is not interrupted. Azure is the world's second largest cloud provider after Amazon AWS.According to a report by news agency Associated Press (AP), experts believe that a commercial ship likely dragged its anchor and severed several undersea internet cables in the Red Sea. The incident seems to have disrupted web access across parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.The incident reportedly affected at least four major cables: The South East Asia–Middle East–Western Europe 4, the India-Middle East-Western Europe, the FALCON GCX, and the Europe India Gateway. The cuts were initially believed to have occurred off the coast of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.John Wrottesley of the International Cable Protection Committee told the AP that commercial shipping activity is the ""probable cause of damage."" He noted that around 30% of annual cable incidents are caused by dragged anchors, which account for roughly 60 faults per year.The Red Sea is particularly vulnerable as cables lie in relatively shallow water, making it easier for a dragging anchor to damage them. Doug Madory, an internet analysis director at Kentik, also told the news agency that the working assumption is that a commercial vessel accidentally dropped its anchor and dragged it across the four cables.While many internet providers can reroute traffic, the damage has affected at least 10 nations, including India, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates, and has caused slower internet speeds.This incident highlights the vulnerability of the internet's undersea infrastructure, coming just over a year after a separate incident also severed cables in the region. Cable security has also been a growing concern amid attacks on ships by Yemen's Houthi rebels, who have been accused of plotting to attack undersea cables.The Red Sea is a critical telecommunications route, connecting Europe to Africa and Asia via Egypt. Repairing subsea cables in the area can prove to be difficult, particularly since Yemen’s Houthis continue to attack vessels in the area.","Internet connectivity in multiple countries including India and Pakistan has been affected due to subsea cable outages in the Red Sea.

Mark Zuckerberg sues Meta over repeated account suspensions and the internet can’t believe why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mark-zuckerberg-sues-meta-over-repeated-account-suspensions-and-the-internet-cant-believe-why/articleshow/123781845.cms,"Mark Zuckerberg vs Mark Zuckerberg: Repeated suspensions and lost revenue

Legal action against Meta

Precedents and public reaction

Mark Zuckerberg has filed a lawsuit against Meta over repeated account suspensions — but not the one you are thinking about. He is an Indiana-based bankruptcy lawyer who shares his name with the famous Meta CEO. Over the past eight years, his personal and business Facebook accounts have been repeatedly disabled. Despite providing proof of his identity, the platform continued to flag him as an impersonator of the tech billionaire. These repeated errors disrupted client communications and caused him to lose thousands in advertising expenses. The lawsuit, filed in Marion Superior Court, claims negligence and breach of contract, seeking restoration of his accounts, reimbursement for lost funds, and coverage of legal fees.According to the lawsuit, Zuckerberg’s business account was disabled five times, while his personal profile was suspended four times. One recent suspension lasted more than four months despite repeated appeals. He estimates at least $11,000 in wasted advertising funds, highlighting the financial toll of the repeated mistakes. Beyond money, these deactivations caused reputational and operational issues, with businesses hesitant to work with him and clients facing communication disruptions.The repeated account suspensions appear to stem from Facebook mistaking him for its CEO, Mark Elliot Zuckerberg. He insists his identity predates that of the famous tech billionaire, yet the platform continued to flag him as an impersonator. Even accounts linked to family members were affected; a recent example involved his sister’s homeowners association account being suspended for alleged impersonation.The lawsuit alleges negligence and breach of contract, citing Meta’s failure to maintain his paid advertising account. It seeks restoration and maintenance of his accounts, reimbursement for lost advertising funds, and coverage of legal fees. While Meta has reinstated his accounts after acknowledging the error, the lawsuit continues, signalling the plaintiff’s intention to hold the company accountable for repeated disruptions.Sharing names with famous figures can create unexpected challenges online, as seen in prior cases like designer Katie Perry’s legal battle with singer Katy Perry. Public reaction has highlighted both the humour and frustration of Zuckerberg’s situation, with many empathising with the difficulty of managing a digital identity that coincides with a global celebrity. The case underscores the potential pitfalls of automated moderation and identity verification on major social media platforms. The outcome of this case could set an important precedent for how tech giants handle users caught in identity conflicts with public figures.","Mark Zuckerberg has filed a lawsuit against Meta over repeated account suspensions.

Amazon Prime in the US ends its long-standing membership benefits; effects and reasons explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-prime-in-the-us-ends-its-long-standing-membership-benefits-effects-and-reasons-explained/articleshow/123781601.cms,"Why Amazon is ending its Prime Invitee Program

Transition options for previous invitees

Broader context and implications of Amazon eliminating its invitee program

Amazon is set to retire one of its long-standing Prime membership features, the “Prime Invitee Program,” effective October 1, 2025. This program allowed Prime members to share their free two-day shipping benefit with another adult outside their household, making it a popular way to extend membership perks. With the discontinuation, users will now need to subscribe individually to maintain access to shipping benefits if they previously relied on shared accounts. Amazon is replacing the program with “Amazon Family,” which restricts sharing of benefits only to members living at the same primary address, marking a major shift in how Prime membership privileges are managed.The Prime Invitee Program, launched in the US in 2009 and closed to new sign-ups in 2015, allowed shipping benefit sharing with non-household members. Amazon confirmed that all existing invitees will lose access on October 1, 2025. The company has communicated the changes to users and invitees by early September 2025. The program’s end reflects a broader industry trend of limiting account and benefit sharing to encourage independent subscriptions, similar to policies recently seen at Netflix, Disney+, and Costco.Amazon Family replaces the Invitee Program but comes with stricter rules. Members can now share benefits such as free shipping, Prime Video, Prime Music, and Kindle content with one additional adult and up to four children or teenagers, provided all live at the same primary address. Household verification, including shared payment methods and billing addresses, is required. The new structure ensures that shared benefits remain confined to a single household, preventing the previous cross-household sharing model.Customers who previously received shared benefits from another household will need to subscribe independently to retain Prime advantages. Amazon is offering a discounted one-year subscription for $14.99 for invitees transitioning from the Invitee Program, valid until December 31, 2025. This temporary discount provides a smoother transition for millions of affected US shoppers.The move comes amid a slowdown in Prime sign-ups in 2025 compared to prior years. By curbing cross-household sharing, Amazon aims to boost full membership adoption while promoting the Amazon Family program . The company clarified that gift orders and deliveries to different addresses remain unaffected, but shared shipping benefits will be strictly limited to household members. This policy shift highlights how Amazon is adjusting its membership model to maintain growth and revenue in a highly competitive subscription market. For long-time users, the change may feel restrictive, but Amazon argues it will create a more consistent and fair use of Prime benefits.","The Prime Invitee Program, launched in the US in 2009 and closed to new sign-ups in 2015, allowed shipping benefit sharing with non-household members.

What reports say on e-SIM in iPhone 17 Air

It's almost time for Apple's 'Awe Dropping' event. Later today, Apple is expected to unveil the new iPhone 17 lineup, and with it, a major change that has been years in the making: The global expansion of its eSIM-only policy. Since the iPhone 14, Apple has sold iPhones in the United States without a physical SIM card tray, but has kept the trays in models sold in other countries. Now, three years later, analysts and industry insiders suggest this is about to change.An eSIM, or embedded SIM, is a digital version of a physical SIM card. Instead of a small plastic card that you insert into a device, an eSIM is a small chip that's permanently built into a smartphone, smartwatch, or other device. It performs the same function as a physical SIM, securely storing your mobile network information to allow for calls, texts, and data usage.The key advantage of an eSIM is its convenience and flexibility. You can activate a mobile plan by simply scanning a QR code or through your carrier's app, eliminating the need to visit a store or wait for a physical card to be mailed. This also makes it easy to switch between carriers or plans, as well as use multiple phone numbers on a single device.According to reports, the move is driven by the ultra-thin design of the new iPhone 17 Air , which is especially primed to drop the physical SIM tray to save on internal space. This shift may also extend to the entire iPhone 17 family in many international markets, though some countries like China may remain exceptions.This impending change is supported by reports from prominent analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo and news outlet The Information, who have both pointed to an eSIM-only design for international models, specifically the iPhone 17 Air. Adding further weight to these rumors, MacRumors has reported that Apple is already training retail employees at Authorized Resellers in the European Union to support the transition, with training courses required to be completed just days before today's event.Today's event is also expected to feature new Apple Watch models and the next-generation AirPods Pro.","An eSIM, or embedded SIM, is a digital version of a physical SIM card.

The launch is expected to reinvigorate Apple's wearable business as the maker of the world's 'most-popular' smartwatch faces rising competition in China. Today, September 9, Apple is expected to announce a new trio of smartwatches: Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch Ultra 3, and Apple Watch SE 3.Despite the success of surpassing the $100 billion revenue mark, the Apple Watch faces a complex and highly competitive market. AS per Counterpoint report, competitors are rapidly innovating, with companies like Huawei securing regulatory approvals for advanced health features such as blood pressure monitoring in its Watch D2.The market for smartwatches is becoming increasingly segmented. Niche competitors like Garmin are dominating the high-end sports market with specialized smartwatches for running, golf, and diving. Meanwhile, companies like Imoo have cornered the global kids' smartwatch market . The rise of non-display fitness bands also presents a new threat, challenging the core health features of smartwatches.These competitive pressures, coupled with a lack of major hardware updates and rising replacement cycles in recent years, have contributed to Apple's sustained sales decline. The company has also lost ground in the crucial Chinese market, where Huawei has now become the top-selling brand. ""Additionally, geographical challenges persist, particularly in China – the world’s largest smartwatch market – where Huawei has ascended to become the No.1 brand in Q2 2025,"" said the report.With the launch of the new Apple Watch lineup, the company is betting on a combination of new features and an expanded portfolio to attract new customers and encourage existing users to upgrade, in hopes of reigniting growth and defending its position as a leader in the wearable technology space.",Apple’s cumulative revenues from its Apple Watches surpassed $100 billion in the second quarter of 2025.

Kevork, Jim, and Srini are exceptional leaders whose deep technical acumen and industry relationships will be instrumental as we continue building a new Intel.”These announcements follow a period of heightened scrutiny for Intel, including a recent US government plan to convert existing grants into a 10% stake in the company. That deal included a provision to penalize Intel if its ownership of its foundry unit dropped below 50%. The company has also faced public pressure from President Donald Trump, who has called for Tan's resignation over alleged conflicts of interest.The latest moves are part of an ongoing restructuring under Tan, who took over as CEO in March.

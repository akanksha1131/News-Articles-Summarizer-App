Benefit-focused main character energy, zero effort

All the things your phone quietly gets done

Built to keep up with your grind

A phone that looks as good as it performs

In a world where your feed is your first impression, every scroll, every story, every share counts. For Gen Z, a phone isn't just a device, it's your creative studio, your personal brand HQ, and your ticket to standing out in an ocean of content. But creating content that cuts through the noise takes a device that keeps up with you. Scroll, shoot, share, repeat. If that sounds familiar, you're not alone. Gen Z lives where content is currency and your feed is your calling card. Standing out shouldn't mean stressing out, it should feel natural, like your phone just gets you.Creating content that stops the scroll is harder than it looks. The lighting's never right, the blur's not blurry enough, and somehow your phone dies right when inspiration hits. Sound familiar? What if your phone could fix all that without you even thinking about it?Let's talk about what really sets the Galaxy F70e 5G apart. That showstopper camera. At its core is a 50MP ultra-clear camera that captures every detail, whether you're shooting in bright daylight or moody café lighting. But the real magic happens when you switch to portrait mode. The dedicated 2MP Depth Camera works alongside the main shooter to nail that professional-grade bokeh effect, you know, the one where your subject is razor-sharp and the background melts into a dreamy blur. It's the difference between a photo and a moment. Whether you're capturing your best angle for a selfie (hello, 8MP front camera) or shooting your friends mid-laugh, every frame comes out looking like it deserves its own gallery.Here's where it gets good. Ever notice how influencers' portraits always look cinematic? That's not luck, it's depth. The Galaxy F70e 5G's camera setup is built specifically to give you that main-character energy in every shot. Shooting your OOTD against a busy street? The depth camera isolates you perfectly, turning chaos into aesthetic.Candid café pics? The bokeh makes even basic backgrounds look intentional. You don't need to be a pro photographer or spend hours editing, the phone does the heavy lifting. Just point, shoot, and watch your content go from ‘nice’ to ‘wait, how did you take that?’ It's not about faking it; it's about making your real moments look as good as they feel.Everything you do on this phone: scrolling, streaming, gaming, browsing, deserves to look good and feel smooth. That's where the 6.7-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate comes in. But a great display means nothing if your battery can't keep up. The difference is immediate: animations are fluid, transitions are seamless, and even just swiping through your apps feels satisfying. Whether you're watching the latest series drop or just casually doom-scrolling at 2 AM, the experience stays premium. It's the kind of upgrade you feel every single time you pick up your phone. Because your screen time should feel as good as it looks.Your phone is with you from the moment you wake up to those late-night scrolling sessions. That's why the new Galaxy F70e 5G packs a massive 6000mAh battery , optimised by One UI 8 to actually last. We're talking up to 26 hours of video playback, the kind of endurance that takes you from morning commute binges to late-night streaming without breaking a sweat. So whether you're streaming shows on your commute, gaming between classes, video calling friends, or yes, shooting that perfect reel, you're covered. No more rationing your screen time or hunting for chargers mid-day. And when you do need juice, 25W fast charging gets you back up to speed without the wait.Let's talk about the look. The Galaxy F70e 5G comes in two head-turning shades: Limelight Green and Spotlight Blue, because your phone should reflect your vibe. Both colours are designed to stand out, whether you're pulling it out at a café or setting it down for a flat lay. At just 199g and 8.2mm slim, it's comfortable to hold and easy to carry all day. Plus, with IP54 water and dust resistance, it’s built for everyday life: light splashes, dusty pockets, and everything in between. And if you need more space for all those photos and videos? The 128GB internal storage is expandable up to 2TB via microSD card.Under the hood, the Galaxy F70e 5G is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6300 processor with up to 6GB RAM, paired with a 120Hz display for a lag-free experience whether you're multitasking, gaming, or scrolling through your feed. With support for multiple 5G bands and dual SIM flexibility, you're future-proofed for connectivity wherever you go. It runs on Android 16 with One UI 8.0, giving you the latest features and a clean, intuitive interface. Side-mounted fingerprint sensor for quick unlocking, dual 5G SIM support for flexibility, and a 3.5mm headphone jack for those who like their audio wired. The model is packed with thoughtful details that just make sense for how you actually use your phone.The Galaxy F70e 5G isn't just another smartphone, it's your creative partner, your entertainment hub, and your everyday companion rolled into one sleek package. With the Showstopper Camera that nails every portrait, a battery that lasts as long as you do, and a display that makes everything look premium. Priced at a special launch offer of ₹11,999, the device makes premium features accessible without the flagship price tag. It will be available exclusively on Flipkart, with sales kicking off on February 17th at 12 PM.At a time when content is how Gen Z expresses identity, creativity, and ambition, the Galaxy F70e 5G fits naturally into that rhythm. Backed by Samsung's one of the largest service network and commitment to long-term 6 Gen OS upgrades and security updates, it's built for everyday creators who want their moments to look good without trying too hard. It’s built for everyday creators who want their moments to look good without trying too hard, handling the details in the background while you stay focused on showing up, sharing, and staying in your element.",The Galaxy F70e 5G has a 50MP ultra-clear camera that captures every detail.

How early AI education in schools can help India build a future ready generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-early-ai-education-in-schools-can-help-india-build-a-future-ready-generation/articleshow/128183780.cms,"Why India needs early AI literacy now



The core skills early AI education builds



Making AI education truly inclusive



Empowering teachers for the AI era



The time to act is now



By: Muneer Ahmad Khant, Managing Director at ViewSonic India

India is home to over 600 million people under the age of 25 making it the world’s largest youth population. That sheer number, combined with our status as the fastest-growing major economy, puts the country right at the heart of the global AI revolution. We already produce some of the best tech talent in the world, but foundational AI understanding is still missing in most schools, especially beyond the big cities.Bringing AI into classrooms early isn’t just a good idea but also essential if we want to turn this huge youth energy into something lasting. Starting young builds curiosity, sharpens critical thinking, and plants a strong sense of ethics, so children grow up ready not only to use intelligent tools but to create with them responsibly.National initiatives like Digital India and Atmanirbhar Bharat are pushing AI into every corner of life. Studies suggest it could add as much as $500 billion to our GDP by 2030, while creating millions of new jobs and changing many more. From precision farming that supports millions of agricultural workers to diagnostic tools addressing the critical doctor-patient ratio, AI is already transforming healthcare, agriculture, finance, and manufacturing.Yet real obstacles such as years of rote learning habits, the deep urban-rural digital gap, and a projected shortage of 1.4 million AI professionals by 2026 continue to persist. Early exposure can ease worries about technology, spark ideas that matter locally, and help our children become builders of AI rather than just users. Many forward-looking classrooms, equipped with interactive and visual tools, are already showing that this change can reach every part of the country.Early AI education goes beyond coding. It's about making technology feel approachable through simple, fun activities such as questioning what an AI suggests to sharpen thinking. Children learn to recognize the patterns to build data sense, or using AI to make art and unlock imagination. Along the way, they naturally pick up logical reasoning, teamwork, and ease working alongside smart systems.Ethics matter just as much, and plans are in place to start teaching bias, privacy, and responsible use from Grade 3, as upcoming Ministry of Education guidelines suggest. In a country as diverse as ours, this kind of awareness creates thoughtful digital citizens. Interactive displays and visual platforms turn tricky concepts into something children can touch and explore, letting them draw, experiment, and work together instantly. The result? Learning that feels joyful and memorable.India’s rich linguistic diversity, rural-urban divide, and varied learning abilities create distinct challenges in education. The good news is that AI itself helps clear them. Multilingual resources now cover more than 22 languages through platforms like the Skill India Digital Hub, opening doors for every child. Adaptive tools match each student’s pace, and pilots have shown engagement rising by up to 68%. Visual and interactive technologies go further, carrying quality education even to rural vocational centres.When these are part of connected classroom setups, they deliver truly personalised lessons, voice recognition, and support in regional languages so that no one is left out. Teachers get instant insights into each child’s needs, turning our diversity from a barrier into real strength.As AI steps into classrooms, teachers move from giving lectures to guiding curiosity and ethical conversations. Helpful tools take over routine planning, create content that fits local contexts, and give quick feedback, so educators can focus on real mentoring.Initiatives like NISHTHA and the new AI Centre of Excellence, supported by ₹500 crore in the 2025-26 Budget, are preparing millions of teachers nationwide. In our 1.5 million schools, digital classrooms with interactive panels, wireless sharing, and cloud software are making widespread change possible, even where resources are tight. The SOAR programme, with its focused modules for grades 6–12, shows how national initiatives can bring structured AI literacy to huge numbers of students.The broader impact on India’s futureChildren who grow up comfortable with machine intelligence, data-driven choices, and human-AI teamwork will thrive in jobs we can barely imagine today. They’ll push forward on the issues that matter most such as smarter cities, climate solutions, better healthcare access, and sustainable farming, while standing strong on the world stage. Finland and Singapore have already seen the rewards of starting AI literacy early; with our unmatched scale, India can move ahead even quicker.Early AI education is the foundation for a bolder, more confident, and fairer India. By carefully bringing intelligent, visual, and connected classroom solutions into schools from Grade 3 onwards, policymakers, teachers, and technology partners can together release the full power of our youth.In today’s classrooms, where visual collaboration tools and interactive ecosystems make learning lively and inclusive, children begin to see AI not as something far away and mysterious, but as a partner they can steer. When that shift happens, young Indians won’t just face the future but also build it.","India is home to over 600 million people under the age of 25 making it the world’s largest youth population.

Despite a significant selloff in software stocks triggered by Anthropic's legal AI tools, they argue AI will enhance, not replace, existing software, enabling greater productivity and innovation.

Nvidia's Huang chimes in with Pichai, calls selloff 'most illogical thing in the world'

What exactly triggered the selloff

India’s AI Rise Gets Global Push As UN Chief Praises Leadership, Nvidia CEO Predicts Job Surge

Why the fear runs deeper than one plugin

Google CEO Sundar Pichai isn't buying the panic. During the company's earnings call, Pichai pushed back against the market hysteria triggered by Anthropic's new AI plugins, calling it overblown. AI is ""an enabling tool,"" he said, just as it has been for Google 's own products—Search, YouTube and others. Companies ""seizing the moment"" will find the same opportunity ahead, he added.His comments come as software stocks worldwide nurse heavy losses. Anthropic's Claude Cowork plugins, wiped out roughly $285 billion from software, legal tech and financial services stocks in a single session. Analysts dubbed it a 'SaaSpocalypse'. Pichai's view? The scramble is overdone.Pichai isn't alone in questioning the market reaction. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was even more direct at a Cisco event, calling the selloff ""the most illogical thing in the world."" His take: AI will use existing software tools, not reinvent them. ""Would you use a screwdriver or invent a new screwdriver?"" he asked. Huang added that Nvidia itself has adopted such tools extensively, freeing up employees to focus on designing chips and computer systems.Software company executives have also pushed back, arguing they do far more than just build code. Their offerings include data management and purpose-built solutions that are difficult to replicate, especially for enterprises outside the tech world like retail and oil and gas.Anthropic released 11 open-source plugins for Claude Cowork, its agentic AI assistant for non-technical professionals. Most covered standard enterprise functions—sales, marketing, finance, customer support. But the legal plugin rattled nerves. It automates contract review, NDA triage, compliance checks and legal briefings.Morgan Stanley analyst Toni Kaplan called it ""a sign of intensifying competition"" that could hurt big players in the legal space. The fallout was swift. Thomson Reuters and RELX both closed down around 15%. LegalZoom crashed nearly 20%. Indian IT stocks weren't spared—Infosys ADRs slipped 5.5%, Wipro fell nearly 5%.The concern isn't just about legal workflows. There's a dawning realisation that AI tools can now do far more than most non-techies realise. With relatively simple prompts, they can take over a user's computer, write software, analyse stock market data, manage emails and countless other tasks. People have taken to social media describing how they built their first software program without ever learning to code. Shopify's CEO built software that could interpret his recent MRI.Meta's CFO Susan Li told investors last week that the company has seen a 30% year-over-year increase in output per engineer driven by AI coding tools. Power users have seen an 80% boost.Anthropic's numbers back up the concern. Claude Code hit $1 billion in annualised recurring revenue by November, months after launch. The company is reportedly raising $20 billion at a $350 billion valuation. Jefferies noted that OpenAI is losing corporate ground to Claude, with enterprises now making up 80% of Anthropic's business.Pichai and Huang are betting the panic subsides. Wall Street isn't so sure yet.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismiss market panic over AI plugins, calling it overblown.

Oracle’s risky AI bet

Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison has now seen an unprecedented $50 billion wiped off his net worth in less than forty days this year, as per Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ellison’s fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January. A single-day slump of 5% in Oracle’s stock erased about $9 billion from this wealth, deepening the decline.The round in software stocks was triggered by Anthropic’s release of plugins for its Claude Cowork AI agent, which can easily automate corporate tasks in legal, scales, finance, marketing and data analysis. Investors now fear that such tools could lead to reduction in the demand for external software from established giants such as Adobe, Salesforce, Intuit and Atlassian. Shares of all these companies tumbled earlier this week before staging a particle rebound, but Oracle’s loses remained steep.Ellison was not along in facing the sharp decline in net worth. Along with him, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also saw his net worth fall by around $11 billion, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg lost around $8 billion. On the other hand, other tech leaders like Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Jeff Bezos and Jensen Huang each shed around $5 billion as the stocks of the companies dropped by at least 2%.For those unaware, Oracle has aggressively positioned itself as an important player in the AI boom, the company has signed deals with Nvidia and OpenAI in order to offer data centers powering next-generation technology. However, its heavy spending and increasing debt have raised concerns among analysts. The company’s remaining performance obligations — contracted sales not yet recognized as revenue — surged 438% year-over-year to $523 billion as of November 30, nearly ten times its annual revenue of $53 billion.Critics believe that Oracle may be overspending. Popular American investor Michael Burry has publicly bet against Oracle. Burry has warned that the company’s debt-fueled expansion tied to AI contracts was unnecessary, calling the moves “hard to explain” and suggesting that “ego” might be driving decisions.","Ellison's fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January.

Bell moves from managing 10,000 people to flying solo as an IC

Gallot brings a sales-meets-engineering playbook back to Redmond

Why Microsoft needs a quality czar right now

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre. Charlie Bell, who led the company's security operations since 2021, is stepping down from that role to become what's effectively an engineering quality czar—reporting directly to Nadella.""Charlie and I have been planning this transition for some time, given his desire to move from being an org leader to being an IC engineer,"" Nadella wrote in an internal memo shared on Wednesday. ""And I love how energized he is to practice this craft here day in and day out!""Bell's replacement? Hayete Gallot, who's returning to Microsoft after an 18-month stint as Google Cloud's President of Customer Experience. She previously spent over 15 years at Redmond, climbing to the rank of corporate vice president across Windows, Office, and security teams.The shift is significant. Bell oversaw a team of roughly 10,000 people and was the driving force behind Microsoft's Secure Future Initiative—a company-wide push launched after Chinese hackers breached US government email accounts through a Microsoft Cloud exploit in 2023. That incident triggered a scathing review from the Department of Homeland Security, which called Microsoft's security culture ""inadequate.Now, Bell will work closely with cloud and AI chief Scott Guthrie and Mala Anand on what Nadella calls the ""Quality Excellence Initiative."" The initiative is aimed at delivering ""durable, high-quality experiences at global scale""—corporate speak that likely translates to fewer Azure outages, fewer broken Windows patches, and fewer out-of-band emergency fixes.Gallot's appointment signals a shift in how Microsoft thinks about its security business.

Why Amazon is shutting down Amazon Go and Fresh stores

Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its Amazon Fresh supermarket chain. The decision of the company to shut down the Amazon Fresh stores will lead to thousands of job cuts across the US. Last week, the e-commerce major announced that it will close around 60 Fresh stores which will put an end to the effort of six-years. As reported by Business Insider, the WARN notices filed in various states confirm the sale of layoffs. As aper the filling, in California only the company will shut down 20 Fresh stores which will affect around 3,900 workers. Most Fresh locations closed to the public on February 1, though California stores will remain open until mid-March due to state law.As Amazon is shutting down the Fresh stores, it has outlined two main options for the affected employees. The company is giving a choice to the employees in which they can either choose the severance pay or can take transfer within the company. The workers will continue to receive their normal pay and benefits for 90 days after the closure announcement, or until April 28. The compensation offered by the company will be based on either the minimum pay for their employee class of their average hours worked over the past 60 days whichever is higher.The report further adds that employees who do not secure another role within the company by late April will then receive severance packages, calculated as one week of pay for every six months of service at Amazon Fresh. Workers are guaranteed a minimum of four weeks’ pay, with the possibility of up to 20 weeks depending on tenure.For those seeking to remain within Amazon, the company is encouraging Fresh workers to apply for similar positions at Whole Foods Stores or Amazon grocery warehouse via its internal A to Z portal. An Amazon spokesperson said: “All affected employees will have the opportunity to apply for open roles within Amazon where available, and we’re providing career transition services to help them explore options.”Amazon Fresh associates typically earned between $16 and $20 per hour, according to data from job site Indeed. Their responsibilities ranged from picking delivery orders to handling checkout operations.Amazon Go and Fresh stores were introduced as Just Walk Out technology, but they struggled to establish a distinctive customer experience and sustainable economic model. On the other hand, Whole Food Market acquired in 2017 by Amazon say strong growth with sales rising more than 40% in recent years. Also, Amazon’s online grocery business also witnessed a surge with perishable grocery sales through Same-Day Delivery growing 40x since January 2025, making fresh groceries one of the most-ordered categories on its platform.",Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its Amazon Fresh supermarket chain.

Meet Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei: Former OpenAI researcher who turned his AI vision into a $3.7 billion company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meet-anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-former-openai-researcher-who-turned-his-ai-vision-into-a-3-7-billion-company/articleshow/127943143.cms,"Source: Bloomberg

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s academic background and early career path



Dario Amodei’s rise at OpenAI and the birth of GPT models



Dario Amodei leaves OpenAI and builds Anthropic



Dario Amodei’s cautious leadership style



Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now. He is not a loud public figure, and he rarely chases attention, but his work has quietly shaped how modern AI systems are built and controlled. Before running a multi-billion-dollar company, Amodei spent years in labs and research roles, studying complex systems and how they behave under pressure. That background still shows in how he talks about artificial intelligence today. While others focus on speed and scale, he appears more concerned with safety, limits, and long-term risks. As AI moves faster than regulation, Amodei’s cautious approach is becoming harder to ignore.Before AI became the world’s favourite buzzword, Amodei was deep in academia. He studied physics at Stanford University and later earned a PhD in biophysics from Princeton. At the time, he was focused on understanding complex biological systems. Cells. Signals. Patterns that emerge rather than being designed. Looking back, that mindset fits AI almost too well.After completing his doctorate, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine.There was no clear path to becoming a tech billionaire. That part came later. Almost accidentally, it seems. Amodei eventually moved into machine learning research, joining companies like Baidu and Google Brain. At Google, he worked on neural networks and AI safety.Colleagues from that period say he already seemed concerned about failure modes. In 2016, he joined OpenAI. Things moved fast after that.At OpenAI, Amodei rose quickly. By 2019, he was Vice President of Research, helping set the organisation’s overall research direction. He led work on GPT-2 and GPT-3, models that changed public perception of AI almost overnight.These systems could write essays, answer questions, and even mimic conversation. Sometimes convincingly. Sometimes awkwardly. During this time, Amodei also co-invented reinforcement learning from human feedback. RLHF sounds technical, but the idea is simple. Teach AI systems by showing them what humans actually prefer, not just what scores well mathematically.In 2021, Amodei left OpenAI along with six others, including his sister Daniela Amodei. They founded Anthropic. Some people were sceptical at first. But Anthropic took a different route. It became a public benefit corporation. That detail mattered. It signalled that profit would not be the only priority. At least in theory. Their AI model, Claude, leaned into being cautious. Less dramatic. More restrained. That tone appealed to companies worried about reputational risk.By September 2025, Anthropic was reportedly valued at $183 billion by private investors. That number raised eyebrows. Especially for a company without much public hype.Partnerships with Alphabet and Amazon helped fuel that growth. So did rising concerns about AI safety across governments and corporations. As Anthropic’s valuation climbed, so did Amodei’s wealth. His real-time net worth now sits around $3.7 billion, ranking among the world’s richest people.Amodei does not sound like most tech CEOs. He hedges. A lot. “It seems.” “It might.” “We’re not fully sure yet.” That language annoys some people. Others trust it more. He avoids grand predictions. No promises of utopia. No claims that AI will solve everything.Experts say his influence shows up in quieter ways. Safety research is becoming mainstream. Alignment discussions moving from fringe to boardroom. Competitors are copying ideas they once ignored. No one really knows what comes next for Dario Amodei. AI is moving fast. Faster than regulation.","Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now.

'OpenAI deal is eating Oracle alive financially'

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

US banks are pulling back—and that's a big problem

A possible Cerner sale and 40% upfront customer deposits show how tight things have gotten

Oracle is staring down the possibility of its largest-ever workforce reduction—and at the heart of it is a $300 billion partnership with OpenAI that's proving far more expensive than anyone initially let on.Investment bank TD Cowen reported this week that Oracle is weighing cuts of 20,000 to 30,000 jobs. The move would free up an estimated $8 to $10 billion in cash flow, money the company desperately needs as it tries to bankroll a sprawling network of AI data centers built largely to serve Sam Altman 's company.TD Cowen puts the OpenAI commitment alone at around $156 billion in capital spending—and roughly 3 million GPUs to back it up. Oracle has already burned through $58 billion in debt in just two months. That's $38 billion for data centers in Texas and Wisconsin, $20 billion for a campus in New Mexico. Total debt now sits north of $100 billion.The kicker? That $58 billion covers only a slice of what's actually needed. Since its September 2025 peak, Oracle's stock has shed more than half its value—about $463 billion in market cap, gone.The financing crunch isn't just an Oracle internal issue anymore.Multiple US banks have quietly retreated from lending on Oracle-linked data center projects. TD Cowen noted that lenders have roughly doubled the interest rate premiums they charge Oracle since September, pushing borrowing costs into territory usually reserved for junk-rated companies.The result? Several data center leases Oracle had been negotiating simply stalled. Private operators couldn't get the funding to build, which means Oracle can't deliver the capacity its customers—especially OpenAI—are counting on. Some Asian banks are still willing to step in, but that doesn't solve the immediate problem in the US, where most of Oracle's expansion is planned.Oracle isn't sitting idle. The company is now requiring new customers to pay up to 40% of contract value upfront—essentially asking clients to co-fund the infrastructure. It's also exploring ""bring your own chip"" arrangements, where customers supply their own hardware.On the table too is a potential sale of Cerner, the healthcare software unit Oracle bought for $28.3 billion in 2022. That would be a significant strategic pivot, signaling that AI infrastructure is now the clear priority—everything else is up for grabs.TD Cowen also flagged that OpenAI has already begun shifting some near-term capacity needs over to Microsoft and Amazon, which is not exactly a vote of confidence in Oracle's ability to deliver on schedule.The company has not publicly commented on the layoff reports or the financing difficulties.","Oracle faces massive job cuts, potentially 20,000-30,000, to fund its costly $300 billion OpenAI partnership.

"Egypt bans Roblox nationwide over child safety concerns, raising global questions about kids' online freedom",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/egypt-bans-roblox-nationwide-over-child-safety-concerns-raising-global-questions-about-kids-online-freedom/articleshow/127935398.cms,"Source: Bloomberg

Roblox faces a government ban in Egypt: Here’s why



What this ban means for kids and parents



Roblox going dark in Egypt, the platform that lives almost entirely on screens, the sudden loss felt very real. With games loading, Avatars running around blocky worlds. And then Egypt has officially banned Roblox, saying the move is about protecting children from harmful online content. The story underneath feels layered, political, and a little messy. Roblox looks harmless on the surface but experts say the risk is not the visuals but the interaction. The platform allows users to create games, chat with strangers, and move freely between user-generated worlds.A spokesperson confirmed the company has reached out to Egyptian authorities, offering dialogue to resolve the issue and restore access. The company says it has worked with regulators in other regions to build localised safety systems that align with cultural values. Last year, the company restricted some features across parts of the Middle East to address safety concerns. This ban did not come out of nowhere. Roblox has already been blocked or restricted in countries like Qatar and Turkey with other nations watching closely.The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.According to state-run media, the ban will be coordinated with the National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority. That means internet providers are expected to block access nationwide with no single official explanation was released at first. Later, state outlets pointed to growing concerns about children’s exposure to inappropriate content, online interactions, and psychological risks as reported by Bloomberg. An Egyptian senator had already called for regulating Roblox to protect children’s moral and educational values.President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi recently called for limits on children’s phone use, pointing to similar moves abroad. Australia has banned social media for certain age groups. France is moving in the same direction. Egypt’s parliament is now discussing broader rules for digital platforms including unified age classifications, stronger verification, penalties and possibly forcing companies to have local representatives inside the country.For children, the ban feels abrupt and confusing. For parents, reactions are mixed. Some welcome the move, while others worry it pushes kids toward less visible, less regulated platforms, potentially exposing them to more risks. That is the irony experts often point out. When one door closes, another usually opens. Sometimes darker, more unpredictable, and harder to monitor.Still, supporters of the ban argue that Roblox’s scale makes it different. Millions of users. Constant interaction. Endless content that cannot realistically be watched, moderated, or controlled by humans alone, leaving significant safety and privacy concerns for young players and families.","The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.

Anime-themed games on Roblox are everywhere right now. Some fade fast. Others stick around because they keep players coming back. Anime Paradox seems to fall into the second category. At first glance, it looks like another tower defence title with familiar anime faces and flashy attacks. But spend a little time with it, and the grind becomes obvious. Progress slows quickly, upgrades demand patience, and free rewards feel essential rather than optional for anyone hoping to stay competitive.

$13 billion that seems to 'scream' Apple's AI strategy is not wrong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/13-billion-that-seems-to-scream-apples-ai-strategy-is-not-wrong/articleshow/128164113.cms,"How tide turned for Apple in AI



Apple and Google's AI partnership

Tech stocks have been facing torrid days in the last few days. As Big Tech’s mega AI spending plans are spooking investors. So much so that Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle, Meta, Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet -- all saw their shares fall last week. Fears over AI spending sparked the sell-off that more than $1 trillion wiped from stocks of these companies, with Amazon leading the pack in losses. Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta have together reported about $120 billion in capital expenditures or Capex in the fourth quarter alone. As per a report in Financial Times, this figure could exceed more than $660 billion this year, which is higher than the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of countries like Singapore and Israel.An outlier here is Apple. iPhone-maker, who till weeks back, was being slammed for not being able to get its AI strategy right, with some even going to the extreme of asking for CEO Tim Cook's resignation over the same. The stock market too didn't seem very happy with Apple, as Apple stock underperformed over the past year due to its reputation for being an artificial-intelligence laggard. Shares of Apple rose 8% in 2025, lagging behind the broader S&P 500 index’s SPX -1.23% 16% gain.More recently, Apple also received criticism for the partnership, with some analysts warning that Apple is making an unwise move in outsourcing its AI capabilities to Google. This after Apple Intelligence offerings got not-so-impressive reviews and Siri update was delayed until 2026.In an unexpected reversal of fortunes for the iPhone maker, Apple has so far managed to buck the trend. Apple was the only “Magnificent Seven” name in the Green last week, with its shares up more than 5% past week%. So much so that Apple reclaimed the title of the second-largest company by market capitalization, after Alphabet last month pushed Apple out of that position. What seems to be working here is Apple’s more disciplined approach to AI spending. Analysts says Apple's economical AI budget is coming in handy in a week when investors are scared of Big Tech's rising Capex. Here, Apple’s lower AI capital expenditure levels — the company is expected to spend $13 billion on capex in 2026 — have become an advantage. This especially at a time when the spending patterns of Big Tech come under scrutiny.For much of 2025, investors worried that Apple was getting left behind in the AI race. But as we begin 2026, it looks like Apple is in a stronger position than many of its peers. Shares of Apple may be benefiting as investors move money out of software stocks and look for new opportunities within the tech sector, Andrew Graham, founder and portfolio manager at Jackson Square Capital, told MarketWatch over email. Apple is a “software/hardware hybrid where the sum may be worth more than its parts,” Graham said.Apple is following a collaborative AI strategy. Last month, Apple and Google announced a new partnership. Apple intends to use Google's Gemini AI technology as the foundation for Apple Foundation Models. The companies said that Google's Gemini models and cloud technology ""will help power future Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year."" For Apple, partnering with Google is a savvy move. As a report in Motleyfool said, ""Its Gemini AI is widely viewed as industry-leading technology, and features some of the best-performing AI models. Instead of incurring the upfront capex costs and financial risks of building its own data centers and large language models, Apple might be better off building its AI features upon Google's base.""","Apple was the only “Magnificent Seven” name in the Green last week, with its shares up more than 5% past week.

US government’s electricity usage pact for Google, Amazon, Meta and others: What we know so far



""

As President Trump announced weeks ago, top tech companies are working with the President to 'pick up the tab' for their power consumption as they build data centres. More to come soon!""

""is outdated and no longer accurate""

“People are sceptical. 'Oh my gosh, this is going to further add insult to injury and drive up my energy prices.' I understand their concerns. We are in dialogue with all the hyperscale developers about not only being a long-term force to drive down electricity prices on the grid, but to also be a short-term force to stop the existing price rises.”

""in every manner possible,""

""water positive""

The US government is reportedly seeking a legal commitment from major technology companies on the electricity consumption of data centres that power artificial intelligence (AI) services. According to a recent report citing two Trump administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the private nature of the discussions, the government wants companies such as OpenAI Amazon and Facebook-parent Meta to publicly commit to a new compact that would govern the rapid expansion of AI data centres.The compact comes just weeks after Microsoft made a similar set of commitments, saying it would pay more for the electricity that serves its data centres, cover any additional infrastructure and reduce water consumption. Microsoft also said it would no longer accept any local tax breaks, a measure which is not included in the White House draft compact.Last month, US President Donald Trump shared a Truth Social post confirming that Microsoft had announced he was working with other tech companies toA draft of the compact obtained by Politico lays out commitments to ensure that energy-hungry data centres do not raise household electricity prices, strain water supplies, or undermine grid reliability, and that the companies driving demand also bear the cost of building new infrastructure.The proposed pact, which is not final and could change, is framed as a voluntary agreement between US President Donald Trump and major US tech companies and data centre developers. It could bind OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta and other AI majors to a broad set of energy, water and community principles.The initiative, which the administration plans to roll out at a White House event, has yet to be formally announced, and it remains unclear which companies have agreed to the compact or have been invited to participate.The compact would mark an ambitious effort to shape the footprint of AI infrastructure without imposing direct regulation. It comes a month after the White House appealed to the Mid-Atlantic Energy Grid Operator to lower electricity prices. Concerns have risen that data centres' enormous energy demand could drive up prices, creating a political liability for an administration that has supported their rapid development.In a statement to Politico, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said,However, A White House official said the draftwithout specifying which parts have changed.The decentralised nature of the nation's electricity grid means that grid operators, state regulators, and utilities would have to agree on rules or craft contracts to make aspects of the proposed compact actionable.In a recent interview with the POLITICO Energy podcast, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said,At the core of the compact is a requirement that AI data centre developers pay 100% of the cost of new power generation needed to serve their facilities. The compact also calls on companies to sign long-term electricity contracts to ensure other customers don't end up footing the bill if the data centre fails. Companies would commit to paying the full cost of any current or future transmission upgrades required to interconnect new data centres to the grid.In parallel, the tech companies would agree to work with federal, state and local regulators to establish power and transmission rates that,hold harmless and ideally reduce residential electricity prices in the jurisdictions where data centres operate. The principles would apply not only to data centres they own but also to the capacity they lease or operate that is owned by others. Electricity costs are already rising, even outpacing inflation over the past year.Some companies have said that they already pay their own costs. For example, Meta has said it covers all of its energy costs and commissioned a study last year that found the clean energy projects it has supported add generation and do not raise costs for ratepayers.The draft also pulls data centres into grid reliability planning. Signatories would commit to using noncritical backup generation at new and existing facilities, in coordination with grid operators, to support stability and reliability during emergencies. Companies would voluntarily agree to curtail new data centre load when necessary to ensure reliable power for American households.Beyond energy, the compact aims to address local opposition in growing data centre regions. Hyperscalers would commit to being, developing or procuring sufficient water supplies to support new facilities and ensuring no negative impact on local water availability or quality. The agreement also calls on companies to establish AI awareness programmes in surrounding communities and public schools and to adopt practices to mitigate noise, traffic, and other disruptions affecting nearby residential neighbourhoods.The pact could be meaningful for companies seeking federal help to accelerate grid interconnections, however, it can be a bottleneck for AI infrastructure projects.

US labour board abandons years-long fight against SpaceX on complaint filed by eight engineers who wrote an open letter criticising Elon Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-labour-board-abandons-years-long-fight-against-spacex-on-complaint-filed-by-eight-engineers-who-wrote-an-open-letter-criticising-elon-musk/articleshow/128160182.cms,"SpaceX engineers fired for criticizing Elon Musk have lost their case as the National Labor Relations Board dismissed its complaint due to jurisdictional issues. The engineers now fall under the National Mediation Board, which offers fewer protections, leaving them with limited recourse against alleged retaliation. This development significantly benefits SpaceX.

How NLRB’s retreat can be ‘good news’ for SpaceX and not for its employees

""in the interests of potentially settling""

""space transport includes air travel""

""mimicked Musk's posts""

""created a wildly uncomfortable, hostile work environment.""

The National Labor Relations Board has dismissed its case against SpaceX . This has ended a two-year legal fight over the rocket company’s firing of eight engineers who criticised CEO Elon Musk in an open letter. The labour board cited jurisdictional issues as the reason for dropping the complaint. In a letter to the attorneys of former employees, the NLRB cited a recent opinion from the National Mediation Board, arguing that SpaceX engineers fall under the National Mediation Board's jurisdiction rather than the NLRB's.“Accordingly, the National Labor Relations Board lacks jurisdiction over the employer, and therefore, I am dismissing your charge,” Danielle Pierce, a regional director of the agency, wrote in the letter seen by Bloomberg.The NMB oversees railroad and airline companies, including American Airlines Group. In contrast, the NLRB oversees most other private-sector employers, including manufacturers like Boeing Co. The complaint was originally issued two years ago, alleging that SpaceX fired the engineers for their involvement in the open letter.The NLRB's retreat can be a favourable outcome for SpaceX, as former and current employees will now have less legal recourse when alleging retaliation, the report noted.Under US law, workers covered by the NLRB have the right to engage in collective action to improve their working conditions, with or without a union. Meanwhile, workers under NMB jurisdiction are covered by a different law, which lacks equivalent protections.""The legal system doesn't feel like it's working like it's supposed to, and it doesn't feel like it's protecting workers the way it's supposed to. I think that this is a sign of worse things to come in declawing the NLRB,” said Paige Holland-Thielen, one of the fired engineers, told Bloomberg.In 2024, SpaceX responded to the NLRB's complaint by suing the agency, arguing that its structure was unconstitutional. That lawsuit led to an injunction from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals that paused the Labour Board's case against the company.Under the previous US President Joe Biden, Jennifer Abruzzo, the NLRB's general counsel, refused to accept the claim of the SpaceX firm that the NMB should be the one to deal with the accusations levelled against the firm. However, in January 2025, following the dismissal of Abruzzo by the previous US President Donald Trump, the firm sought the reconsideration of the issue before theIn April, the NLRB general counsel's office said it had chosen to seek the mediation board's viewthe disputes with SpaceX.However, the fired engineers argued that SpaceX did not fall within the NMB's jurisdiction because Congress never granted the agency jurisdiction over commercial space transportation. This is because, unlike commercial airlines that serve the general public, SpaceX provides rides only to a limited group of hand-picked customers.Yet in January, the NMB ruled in SpaceX's favour, saying the company falls under its jurisdiction becauseto reach outer space and because the company's website allows anyone to email it to purchase a trip.In December 2025, the NLRB abandoned another Biden-era case against SpaceX, in which the agency had alleged that terms in the company's severance and arbitration agreements, including confidentiality rules, were illegally coercive.While the NLRB's recent reversal is likely to resolve SpaceX's ongoing lawsuit against the agency, the labour board still faces other constitutional challenges. Since SpaceX filed its lawsuit in 2024, other companies, including Amazon, have also filed similar cases, several of which are now pending in US courts.The fired engineers have also sued SpaceX and Musk for sexual harassment and retaliation under California law. The lawsuit alleges that some plaintiffs received harassing comments from coworkers thaton social media andIn December 2025, SpaceX asked a federal appeals court to compel arbitration of that case after a lower court refused.","The National Labor Relations Board has dismissed its case against SpaceX.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s concerns



Google’s-parent company Alphabet has now flagged new risks related to artificial intelligence in its latest annual financial report, describing how the technology is reshaping both opportunities and vulnerabilities. As reported by CNBC The company has now warned that its heavy investment in AI infrastructure could lead to ‘excess capacity’ if demand falls short, and that large leasing arrangements with third-party operators may increase costs and operational complexity. Alphabet also acknowledged the possibility of liabilities if counterparties or vendors fail to deliver.One of the headline figures in Alphabet’s earnings report was $185 billion — the high end of what the company expects to spend on capital expenditures this year. That number, more than double its 2025 capex, rattled investors and erased billions from Alphabet’s market value despite otherwise strong results. The spending reflects the company’s race to secure compute capacity for AI training, inference, and cloud services.As per the CNBC report, in order to finance its AI ambitions, Alphabet is also planning a bond sale of $20 billion. The deal will be split across multiple tranches, including a rare 100-year sterling bond, and is reportedly five times oversubscribed.Bloomberg first reported the funding plan, which was initially expected to reach $15 billion. Alphabet’s long-term debt has already quadrupled in 2025 to $46.5 billion, following a $25 billion bond sale in November. CFO Anat Ashkenazi said the company is committed to investing responsibly while maintaining a healthy financial position.On the earnings call, CEO Sundar Pichai said what keeps executives up at night is compute capacity — specifically power, land, and supply chain constraints. “How do you ramp up to meet this extraordinary demand for this moment?” he asked. Alphabet, along with Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon, is projected to increase capex by more than 60% in 2026, loading up on high-priced chips, building new facilities, and expanding networking infrastructure.At the heart of Google’s AI strategy is Gemini, its large language model and AI assistant. Pichai said the Gemini app now has 750 million monthly active users, up from 650 million last quarter. While adoption is strong, Google acknowledged in its filing that generative AI could reduce reliance on traditional internet search, potentially disrupting its core advertising business. “There is no assurance that we will adapt effectively and competitively to meet this shift,” the company warned.",Alphabet has flagged new risks related to artificial intelligence in its latest annual financial report.

The man who bought AI dot com domain and made $70 million during Super Bowl,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-man-who-bought-ai-dot-com-domain-and-made-70-million-during-super-bowl/articleshow/128160890.cms,"AI dot com’s rise from dormant domain to record-breaking asset

Why the timing of the sale mattered

The role of the Super Bowl

What AI dot com is expected to become

How much Ismail likely earned



Malaysian technology entrepreneur Arsyan Ismail turned a quiet domain purchase into one of the biggest digital deals in internet history. He bought AI dot com years ago mainly because the two letters matched his own name initials. At the time, it was simply a rare and clean web address, not a calculated bet on artificial intelligence. That changed as AI reshaped the global tech industry. In April 2025, Ismail sold AI dot com for about $70 million to Kris Marszalek. The deal drew global attention when the domain appeared in a commercial during Super Bowl LX, placing it before one of the largest television audiences in the world.Ismail is a low-profile Malaysian technology entrepreneur and early internet investor. He has largely stayed away from public attention and is not known for founding consumer platforms or fast-growing startups. His approach has focused on ownership rather than execution. Over the years, he built value by holding scarce digital assets. People familiar with the domain industry describe him as patient and disciplined.Two-letter domains are among the rarest properties on the internet. There are only 676 possible combinations, most of which were registered decades ago and rarely change hands.This scarcity has made them highly valuable, especially as branding has become central to technology companies. AI dot com sits at the very top of this category. It is short, global, and instantly recognisable. As artificial intelligence emerged as a defining technology, demand for the domain surged.Despite its growing value, AI dot com was never aggressively developed under Ismail’s ownership. He did not build a company or product around it. At times, the domain redirected to other AI-related websites, which sparked speculation but did not involve a change in ownership. Ismail continued to hold the domain quietly, a strategy that industry observers say helped preserve its long-term value.The decision to sell came as artificial intelligence reached peak public attention. AI tools were entering everyday life, while governments and corporations raced to define their strategies. Branding around AI became fiercely competitive. This created ideal conditions for a sale. When Ismail agreed to sell AI dot com, the price reflected both the domain’s rarity and the broader AI boom. The $70 million figure set a new benchmark for domain transactions.The Super Bowl appearance turned the sale into a cultural moment. Rather than a quiet launch, the new owner chose the world’s biggest advertising stage to introduce AI dot com. The commercial directed viewers to visit the site and reserve usernames. Traffic surged within minutes, briefly overwhelming the website. Even so, the move succeeded in making AI dot com one of the most talked-about tech moments of the broadcast.Under its new ownership, AI dot com is being positioned as a consumer-facing AI platform. The site allows users to reserve personal handles and AI identities. The broader vision appears to centre on AI agents that can act on behalf of users across digital services. While full details remain limited, the ambition is clear. AI dot com is intended to function as a front door to everyday AI tools.Reports suggest Ismail paid around $10 million to acquire the domain from a domain portfolio firm. Selling it for $70 million implies a profit of roughly $60 million. The payment was reportedly made in cryptocurrency, meaning the final realised value may depend on market conditions. Even with those variables, the deal stands as one of the most lucrative domain sales ever recorded.Ismail’s journey with AI dot com shows how timing, patience, and scarcity can redefine digital value. There was no rush to monetise and no product launch under his ownership. What began as a name-based purchase ultimately became the most expensive domain sale in internet history. In the age of artificial intelligence, two simple letters proved to be worth tens of millions.","Malaysian technology entrepreneur Arsyan Ismail turned a quiet domain purchase into one of the biggest digital deals in internet history.

"India's new AI content rules, explained: What's AI-generated content, what social media platforms must do now, and what users need to know",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/indias-new-ai-content-rules-explained-whats-ai-generated-content-what-social-media-platforms-must-do-now-and-what-users-need-to-know/articleshow/128159986.cms,"India has officially regulated AI-generated content, mandating clear labels on platforms like Instagram and YouTube. Users must now declare AI use, with significant penalties for misrepresentation. Platforms face stricter takedown timelines and must actively block illegal synthetic media, ensuring transparency for the public.

So what counts as 'synthetically generated' content

India’s AI Rise Gets Global Push As UN Chief Praises Leadership, Nvidia CEO Predicts Job Surge

Every platform that touches AI content now has obligations

Big platforms face the toughest ask

Three-hour takedowns and quarterly user warnings

What changes for users?

The central government on February 10 notified amendments to the IT intermediary rules that bring AI-generated content under formal regulation for the first time. Filed as G.S.R. 120(E) and signed by MeitY Joint Secretary Ajit Kumar , the changes amend the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. They take effect from February 20.Here's what the new rules actually say, what they mean for social media platforms, and users.The gazette notification defines synthetically generated information (SGI) as any audio, visual or audio-visual content that is artificially or algorithmically created, modified or altered using a computer resource. The key qualifier: it must appear real or authentic, and depict people or events in a way that could be mistaken for genuine.That covers deepfake videos, AI-generated voiceovers, face-swapped images—basically anything where a machine has done the work to make something look or sound real. The language also catches content that ""portrays"" individuals or events, which means even AI-generated images of fictional scenarios involving real people could fall under this definition.But the government has carved out exemptions too. Routine editing—colour correction, noise reduction, compression, transcription, translation, accessibility tweaks—doesn't count, as long as it doesn't distort the original meaning. Same for illustrative or conceptual content in documents, research papers, PDFs, presentations or training materials. The notification also specifically excludes content created for ""hypothetical, draft, template-based or conceptual"" purposes. Your office PowerPoint with a stock AI illustration? Not SGI. A deepfake of a politician giving a speech they never gave? Squarely within scope.Any intermediary that enables or facilitates the creation or spread of SGI must label it. Not in fine print. Not buried in metadata no one checks. The label must be clear, prominent and unambiguous—visible on the content itself.Platforms must also embed persistent metadata and unique identifiers into SGI, to the extent technically feasible, so it can be traced back to the intermediary's system. Once those markers are applied, the rules bar platforms from enabling their removal or tampering. That closes a real gap—previously, a label could exist in theory but vanish the moment someone downloaded and re-uploaded the file.Significant social media intermediaries—Instagram, YouTube, Facebook and the like—get additional obligations under the new Rule 4(1A). Before any upload goes live, they must require users to declare whether the content is synthetically generated. They must then deploy automated tools to verify those declarations.If a declaration or technical check confirms the content is AI-made, the platform must display it with a visible label or notice. Miss this, and there's a liability hook built in: if a platform knowingly permits or promotes unlabelled synthetic content, it's deemed to have failed due diligence. That's the kind of language that can cost you safe harbour protection.One notable rollback: the October 2025 draft had proposed that visual labels cover at least 10% of display area, and audio markers play during the first 10% of a clip. Industry bodies like IAMAI called it rigid and unworkable. The final version drops that threshold. Labels are still mandatory—just not a giant watermark plastered across a tenth of your screen.The amendments compress existing timelines sharply. For lawful government orders in certain cases, platforms now get three hours to act. That's down from 36. Other windows have been cut from 15 days to seven and from 24 hours to 12.Platforms must also use automated tools to actively block SGI that violates the law. The rules name specific categories: child sexual abuse material, obscene or pornographic content, false electronic records, content related to explosives or weapons, and deepfakes that misrepresent real people or events with intent to deceive.There's a user-facing obligation too. Intermediaries must now warn users at least once every three months—through their terms, privacy policy or other means, in English or any Eighth Schedule language—about penalties for misusing AI content. Consequences range from account termination to mandatory reporting to law enforcement under the BNS or POCSO Act.The gazette also updates the legal plumbing. References to the Indian Penal Code have been swapped out for the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, reflecting the new criminal law framework.Here’s a easier letdown for most of you reading—the social media users. For you, the most visible shift will be labels. AI-generated posts, reels, videos and audio clips on major platforms will now carry a disclosure tag—something you'll see before you engage with the content. The idea is simple: you should know what's real and what's machine-made before you like, share or forward it.There's also a declaration step coming. If you upload content on a platform like Instagram or YouTube, you may be asked to confirm whether it was created or altered using AI tools. Misrepresenting that declaration isn't just a terms-of-service issue anymore—it could attract penalties under the BNS or POCSO Act, depending on the nature of the content.Platforms are also required to send periodic reminders—at least once every three months—about the rules around AI content and the consequences of violating them. Expect to see these show up in updated terms of service, privacy policies or in-app notifications.The draft rules were first published in October 2025, with public feedback invited until November 13 after an extension. The final notification is now live, and platforms have until February 20 to comply.","India has officially regulated AI-generated content, mandating clear labels on platforms like Instagram and YouTube.

What government defines as AI-generated content

Instagram , YouTube , Facebook face tighter compliance bar

Three hours to act, not 36

The government has brought AI-generated content—deepfake videos, synthetic audio, altered visuals—under a formal regulatory framework for the first time by amending India's IT intermediary rules. Notified via gazette notification G.S.R. 120(E) and signed by Joint Secretary Ajit Kumar, the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Amendment Rules, 2026, take effect from February 20.The core ask is simple. Platforms must label all synthetically generated information (SGI) prominently enough for users to spot it instantly. They must also embed persistent metadata and unique identifiers so the content can be traced back to its origin. And once those labels are in place, they can't be modified, suppressed or stripped away.The centre law now has a formal definition for ""synthetically generated information"" for the first time. It covers any audio, visual or audio-visual content created or altered using a computer resource that looks real—and shows people or events in a way that could pass off as genuine.But not everything with a filter qualifies. Routine editing—colour correction, noise reduction, compression, translation—is exempt, as long as it doesn't distort the original meaning.Research papers, training materials, PDFs, presentations and hypothetical drafts using illustrative content also get a pass.The heavier lifting falls on big social media platforms—Instagram, YouTube, Facebook among them. Under the new Rule 4(1A), before a user hits upload, the platform must ask: is this content AI-generated? But it doesn't end at self-declaration. Platforms must also deploy automated tools to cross-verify, checking the content's format, source and nature before it goes live.If flagged as synthetic, the content needs a visible disclosure tag. If a platform knowingly lets violating content slide, it's deemed to have failed its due diligence.The government also quietly shelved an earlier proposal from its October 2025 draft. That version wanted watermarks covering at least 10% of screen space on AI visuals. IAMAI and its members—Google, Meta, Amazon among them—pushed back, calling it too rigid and hard to implement across formats. The final rules keep the labelling mandate but ditch the fixed-size watermark.Response windows have been slashed. Platforms now get three hours to act on certain lawful orders—down from 36. The 15-day window is now seven days. The 24-hour deadline has been halved to 12.The rules also draw a direct line between synthetic content and criminal law. SGI involving child sexual abuse material, obscene content, false electronic records, explosives-related material, or deepfakes that misrepresent a real person's identity or voice now falls under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, POCSO Act and the Explosive Substances Act.Platforms must also warn users at least once every three months—in English or any Eighth Schedule language—about penalties for misusing AI content. On the flip side, the government has assured intermediaries that acting against synthetic content under these rules won't strip them of safe harbour protection under Section 79 of the IT Act.","New government rules mandate clear labelling for all AI-generated content, including deepfakes and synthetic audio, starting February 20.

Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have both made purchases in the Miami area in recent weeks. Page picked up multiple properties in Coconut Grove for roughly $188 million, while Brin is reportedly in talks for a $50 million home on Biscayne Bay. Venture capitalist Peter Thiel opened a Miami office for his investment firm on New Year's Eve, making his Florida move official.The common thread? California's proposed Billionaire Tax Act—a ballot measure backed by a healthcare workers' union that calls for a one-time 5% tax on the net worth of anyone worth over $1 billion. If it qualifies for the November ballot and passes, it would retroactively apply to anyone who was a California resident as of January 1, 2026.For Zuckerberg, whose net worth sits at around $240 billion according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, that's a potential tax bill north of $10 billion.The irony isn't lost on anyone. California's Legislative Analyst's Office had projected the tax would raise tens of billions. But that estimate assumed billionaires would stay put. They didn't. In the 10 days before Christmas alone, entities connected to Sergey Brin terminated or moved 15 California LLCs out of the state, The New York Times reported. More than 45 LLCs associated with Larry Page filed similar paperwork. David Sacks, the tech investor and White House AI adviser, opened an office for his venture capital firm in Austin, Texas.Not everyone's running, though. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang publicly said he was ""perfectly fine"" with the tax. ""We chose to live in Silicon Valley and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it,"" he told Bloomberg Television.As for Zuckerberg's new neighbourhood, Indian Creek is about as exclusive as it gets. The gated island has its own police force, a single guarded bridge for access, and 24/7 marine patrols. Residents include Jeff Bezos, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Carl Icahn, and Tom Brady. Another nearly completed home on the island is currently listed for $200 million.Zuckerberg already owns homes in Palo Alto, near Lake Tahoe, in Hawaii, and in Washington, D.C. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the Florida purchase. Whether the move signals a change in primary residence or is simply another addition to his real estate portfolio remains to be seen—but given the tax math, the answer seems fairly obvious.","Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan are reportedly buying a $150-$200 million mansion on Miami's exclusive Indian Creek island. This move, alongside other Silicon Valley billionaires like Larry Page and Sergey Brin, comes amid California's proposed Billionaire Tax Act. The potential tax could cost Zuckerberg over $10 billion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128154870,imgsize-55412,width-400,resizemode-4/128154870.jpg"
One of the world’s biggest design software companies has sued Google over this AI tool,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/one-of-the-worlds-biggest-design-software-companies-has-sued-google-over-this-ai-tool/articleshow/128154496.cms,"Autodesk claims Google 'falsely represented’ Flow name



What Autodesk seeks from the lawsuit



Autodesk, one of the biggest computer-aided design (CAD) software making companies in the world, has filed a federal lawsuit against Google over a tool that allows users to make AI-generated videos. The complaint alleged that Google infringed upon Autodesk’s “Flow” trademark to market a competing suite of AI-enabled tools designed to make videos for films, television and video game industries.According to news agency Reuters, the lawsuit was filed on Friday in San Francisco federal court. Autodesk claims it began using the “Flow” brand in September 2022 to categorise its cloud-based visual effects and production management tools. In the filing, the company behind industry standards like AutoCAD and Maya said that it ‘surprised’ when Google unveiled its own “Flow” software in May 2025, targeting an identical customer base of creators and studios.The company went on to claim that Google provided assurances that it would not commercialise the “Flow” name, however, the complaint alleges that Google secretly applied for a trademark in the Kingdom of Tonga.This is a common tactic used by tech companies to secure intellectual property in a jurisdiction where applications are not easily accessible to the public, the report added.“Google’s false representation that it would always use a combination of its house mark and Flow was intended to buy time to allow it to swamp Autodesk’s place in the market. Despite the success of Autodesk’s Flow products, the much larger Google will likely overwhelm the Autodesk Flow products and Flow marks,” the complaint said.The complaint said Google used the Tonga application to seek similar trademark protection for Flow in the US, and has marketed Flow at industry events including the Sundance Film Festival.The Reuters report said that Autodesk is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for the consumer confusion and alleged irreparable harm Google caused.“We remain committed to protecting our innovations and ensuring fair competition in the global marketplace,” Autodesk said in a statement.Alphabet’s market cap sits at approximately $3.9 trillion (at the time of writing) compared to Autodesk’s $51 billion. Last month, Autodesk announced it would cut roughly 1,000 jobs (7% of its workforce) to pivot resources toward cloud platforms and artificial intelligence.",Autodesk claims Google 'falsely represented' Flow name to market competing tools.

Anthropic’s expansion in India



Court proceedings



AI giant Anthropic is now facing legal trouble in India after a local software company claimed prior use of the name ‘Anthropic’. As reported by TechCrunch, Anthropic Software an Indian software company founded in 2017, filed a complaint in a commercial court in Karnataka in January this year arguing that the US-based AI firm’s expansion into India has caused customer confusion. The company is also seeking recognition of its prior use, relief to prevent further confusion and Rs 10 million ($110,000) in damages.Anthropic Software founder and director Mohammad Ayyaz Mulla told TechCrunch that litigation was not the company’s first choice but became necessary to protect identity. “As of now, I am exercising my legal right as it’s causing huge confusion to my customers,” he said, adding that coexistence would have been preferable if clarity could be achieved.The dispute comes as Anthropic plans to expand in India. The company announced an India office last October and it also recently appointed Irina Ghose, former Microsoft India managing director to lead its India operations. India has become a key battleground for global AI firms, including Anthropic and rival OpenAI, as they expand beyond the US and Europe.As per the TechCrunch report, a court order dated January 20 shows that Karnataka court has issued a notice and suit summons to Anthropic.However, it declined to grant an interim injunction, with the matter scheduled to return on February 16. Anthropic has not responded to requests for comment.The timing for the dispute around Anthropic is quite notable as India prepares to host the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi next week. The summit is said to be attended byAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei along with other tech leaders such as Sam Altman, Jensen Huang, and Sundar Pichai.","Anthropic is facing legal trouble in India after a local software company claimed prior use of the name.

Mark Cuban explains his point by giving example of Elon Musk



Billionaire investor Mark Cuban believes artificial intelligence is fundamentally changing how companies protect their intellectual property. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Cuban argued that firms will increasingly skip patents and rely on trade secrets instead. “Not filing patents and using trade secrets will become more common. Why? Because the second you file your patent, every LLM is going to be able to train on it. Then everyone on the planet can ask for a work around to file a competitive patent,” he wrote. He added: “Your IP is no longer yours the minute you publish it.”Cuban has been warning founders that publishing proprietary work whether through patents or academic papers now doubles as free training data for competitors’ AI models. In a recent call with Clipbook founder Adam Joseph, whose startup Cuban invested in, said that the traditional ‘publish or perish’ mindset is ‘the biggest mistake you can make’ because it ‘trains somebody else’s models’.He further emphasised that in an AI-driven economy, data holds more value as compared to gold or oil. He urged the companies to protect key datasets and create their own models rather than handover material to other third-party tools.The comments made by Cuban were prompted by a clip of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Cuban shared a clip of Musk from 2023 DealBook Summit interview where Musk mentioned that Tesla open-sourced its patents and SpaceX largely avoid them. Cuban suggested that the approach of Elon Musk may soon become a norm in the AI age, as companies look to protect innovations through secrecy rather than public filings.Cuban’s skepticism of the patent system predates the AI boom. In 2012, he funded the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s “Mark Cuban Chair to Eliminate Stupid Patents” and has long called for Washington to scrap software patents outright, arguing they stifle small businesses.More recently, he criticised a Commerce Department proposal to charge new fees based on a patent’s value, warning it would discourage inventors from filing patents just as they are trying to shield their work from large language models.",Billionaire investor Mark Cuban believes artificial intelligence is changing how companies protect their intellectual property.

Jeff Bezos recently shared a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) with a dramatic black-and-white close-up of a tortoise. While the Amazon founder did not caption the post, it is being seen as a reminder to the public about his space company, Blue Origin’s plan for the Moon. Garnered over 5.4 million views so far, Jeff Bezos’ post has a rather usual critic – Elon Musk. The tech billionaire who owns SpaceX – a rival to Blue Origin replied to Jeff Bezos’ post writing “Turtle heading?” – a slang interpretation of ""turtling"" as hesitant defecation. In another post, he wrote: “When it’s coming out slowly, but ferociously”.When a user said that Jeff Bezos’ image-only post refers to the “tale of the Tortoise and the Hare” where SpaceX is the hare and Blue Origin is the tortoise. Interestingly, the tortoise has also featured on the company’s crest and Blue Origin space vehicles.In the post, the user Canraptor @canraptor_ further said that Bezos’ post implies that Blue Origin “will beat SpaceX to The Moon”, Elon Musk responded:“They might land something on the Moon before SpaceX and that’s fine by me. I will be one of the first to congratulate them. However, what really matters for the future is being able to land millions of tons of equipment and people to build a self-growing city on the Moon.In this respect, perhaps we are (will) be more the tortoise than the hare for now.”SpaceX and Blue Origin lead the charge in commercial space exploration. While Musk's SpaceX has dominated the space industry for nearly two decades, Bezos is making bold moves to challenge this dominance through Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket and Amazon’s Project Kuiper.Recently, SpaceX announced that it is shifting its near-term focus away from Mars to prioritise building a self-sustaining city on the Moon. The update was shared by Musk in an X post citing faster timelines and easier launch opportunities. Sharing the post, Elon Musk said that a Moon city could be achieved in less than 10 years, while building a city on Mars would take more than two decades. While the Moon is now the top priority, Musk said SpaceX has not abandoned its Mars plans. “The mission of SpaceX remains the same: extend consciousness and life as we know it to the stars,” Musk wrote on X.Blue Origin also announced its Moon plans last year. The company said it's willing to ""move heaven and Earth"" to get NASA to the lunar surface before the Chinese. ""We just want to help the US get to the Moon,"" CEO Dave Limp said in 2025.","Jeff Bezos recently shared a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) with a dramatic black-and-white close-up of a tortoise.

A record year for Big Tech debt is just getting started



Google parent Alphabet is selling a rare 100-year bond in British pounds as part of a massive multi-currency debt raise, making it the first tech company to attempt a century bond since IBM did it back in 1996.The so-called century bond will be part of Alphabet's debut sterling issuance, according to the Financial Times. Alongside it, the company is raising $20 billion through a US dollar bond sale—upsized from the originally planned $15 billion after orders crossed $100 billion, Bloomberg reported. A Swiss franc bond sale is also in the works.The dollar portion of the deal spans up to seven tranches. Its longest slice—a 40-year bond maturing in 2066—is expected to price at around 0.95 percentage points above US Treasuries, tighter than the initial talk of 1.2 percentage points. Demand was strongest at the short end, with a three-year tranche pricing at just 0.27 percentage points over Treasuries.A banker close to the deal told FT that issuing across multiple currencies helps Alphabet diversify its investor base, especially as Big Tech's capital needs keep ballooning. Sticking to dollar markets alone could create a supply-demand imbalance, the banker noted. Sterling markets also offer a lower interest rate compared to dollar bonds, making the century bond more cost-effective.The borrowing spree comes just days after Alphabet said it could spend up to $185 billion on capex this year—roughly double last year's total—to fuel its AI ambitions around Gemini and cloud infrastructure. The company's long-term debt has already quadrupled to $46.5 billion in 2025, though it still sits on $126.8 billion in cash.Alphabet isn't alone. Oracle raised $25 billion from a bond sale last week that pulled in a record $129 billion in orders. Morgan Stanley expects hyperscalers to borrow $400 billion this year, up from $165 billion in 2025, according to Bloomberg—a surge that could push overall high-grade US corporate bond issuance to a record $2.25 trillion.Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are managing Alphabet's bond sales across all three currencies.","Alphabet is selling a rare 100-year bond in British pounds as part of a massive multi-currency debt raise.

When Marc Benioff said Agentforce is central to Salesforce business

Salesforce has reportedly reduced its workforce at the start of this month. According to Business Insider, the company has cut nearly 1,000 jobs. Impacted teams include marketing, product management, data analytics, and Salesforce's Agentforce AI product that the company's CEO Marc Benioff has previously said “is part and parcel of Salesforce”. In an interview with CNBC’s Jim Cramer, Benioff said the company’s AI program, Agentforce, is central to business. “People don’t understand that Agentforce is part and parcel of Salesforce,” Marc Benioff then said adding “It is the core of every product we make now, it is the platform.”For those unaware, Agentforce helps companies use autonomous bots to perform tasks and is meant to increase efficiency.The Business Insider report says that many of the laid off employees as part of Salesforce job cuts shared on LinkedIn that their roles had been eliminated. At least nine posts reviewed showed job losses across different teams, it says, adding two employees also confirmed the layoffs while speaking to the publication.The job cuts come at a time of leadership changes at the company. Salesforce has appointed six new executives to senior roles, replacing five top leaders who have announced their exits since December. The changes mark a period of transition in the company’s leadership structure.Salesforce has been increasingly using AI e across its operations. In August, CEO Marc Benioff said the company had used AI agents to reduce the size of its customer support team. According to Benioff, the support staff was cut from about 9,000 employees to around 5,000 by using AI-driven tools.As mentioned above, in 2025, Benioff said that Agentforce is a key part of the company’s business. He then revealed that the Agentforce platform has developed significantly since the company first introduced it in 2024.

Here’s the blog post shared by Anthropic

There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them.

Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns, and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry.

But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.

We want Claude to act unambiguously in our users’ interests. So we’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. Our users won’t see “sponsored” links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.

The nature of AI conversations

When people use search engines or social media, they’ve come to expect a mixture of organic and sponsored content. Filtering signal from noise is part of the interaction.

Conversations with AI assistants are meaningfully different. The format is open-ended; users often share context and reveal more than they would in a search query. This openness is part of what makes conversations with AI valuable, but it’s also what makes them susceptible to influence in ways that other digital products are not.

Our analysis of conversations with Claude (conducted in a way that keeps all data private and anonymous) shows that an appreciable portion involve topics that are sensitive or deeply personal—the kinds of conversations you might have with a trusted advisor. Many other uses involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work, or thinking through difficult problems. The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous—and, in many cases, inappropriate.

We still have much to learn about the impact of AI models on the people who use them. Early research suggests both benefits—like people finding support they couldn’t access elsewhere—and risks, including the potential for models to reinforce harmful beliefs in vulnerable users. Introducing advertising incentives at this stage would add another level of complexity. Our understanding of how models translate the goals we set them into specific behaviors is still developing; an ad-based system could therefore have unpredictable results.

Incentive structures

Being genuinely helpful is one of the core principles of Claude’s Constitution, the document that describes our vision for Claude’s character and guides how we train the model. An advertising-based business model would introduce incentives that could work against this principle.

Consider a concrete example. A user mentions they’re having trouble sleeping. An assistant without advertising incentives would explore the various potential causes—stress, environment, habits, and so on—based on what might be most insightful to the user. An ad-supported assistant has an additional consideration: whether the conversation presents an opportunity to make a transaction. These objectives may often align—but not always. And, unlike a list of search results, ads that influence a model’s responses may make it difficult to tell whether a given recommendation comes with a commercial motive or not. Users shouldn’t have to second-guess whether an AI is genuinely helping them or subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable.

Even ads that don’t directly influence an AI model’s responses and instead appear separately within the chat window would compromise what we want Claude to be: a clear space to think and work. Such ads would also introduce an incentive to optimize for engagement—for the amount of time people spend using Claude and how often they return. These metrics aren’t necessarily aligned with being genuinely helpful. The most useful AI interaction might be a short one, or one that resolves the user’s request without prompting further conversation.

We recognize that not all advertising implementations are equivalent. More transparent or opt-in approaches—where users explicitly choose to see sponsored content—might avoid some of the concerns outlined above. But the history of ad-supported products suggests that advertising incentives, once introduced, tend to expand over time as they become integrated into revenue targets and product development, blurring boundaries that were once more clear-cut. We’ve chosen not to introduce these dynamics into Claude.

Our approach

Anthropic is focused on businesses, developers, and helping our users flourish. Our business model is straightforward: we generate revenue through enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions, and we reinvest that revenue into improving Claude for our users. This is a choice with tradeoffs, and we respect that other AI companies might reasonably reach different conclusions.

Expanding access to Claude is central to our public benefit mission, and we want to do it without selling our users’ attention or data to advertisers. To that end, we’ve brought AI tools and training to educators in over 60 countries, begun national AI education pilots with multiple governments, and made Claude available to nonprofits at a significant discount. We continue to invest in our smaller models so that our free offering remains at the frontier of intelligence, and we may consider lower-cost subscription tiers and regional pricing where there is clear demand for it. Should we need to revisit this approach, we’ll be transparent about our reasons for doing so.

Supporting commerce

AI will increasingly interact with commerce, and we look forward to supporting this in ways that help our users. We’re particularly interested in the potential of agentic commerce, where Claude acts on a user’s behalf to handle a purchase or booking end to end. And we’ll continue to build features that enable our users to find, compare, or buy products, connect with businesses, and more—when they choose to do so.

We’re also exploring more ways to make Claude a focused space to be at your most productive. Users can already connect third-party tools they use for work—like Figma, Asana, and Canva—and interact with them directly within Claude. We expect to introduce many more useful integrations and expand this toolkit over time.

All third-party interactions will be grounded in the same overarching design principle: they should be initiated by the user (where the AI is working for them) rather than an advertiser (where the AI is working, at least in part, for someone else). Today, whether someone asks Claude to research running shoes, compare mortgage rates, or recommend a restaurant for a special occasion, Claude’s only incentive is to give a helpful answer. We’d like to preserve that.

A trusted tool for thought

We want our users to trust Claude to help them keep thinking—about their work, their challenges, and their ideas.

Our experience of using the internet has made it easy to assume that advertising on the products we use is inevitable. But open a notebook, pick up a well-crafted tool, or stand in front of a clean chalkboard, and there are no ads in sight.

We think Claude should work the same way.

OpenAI has started testing ads in ChatGPT for select users starting today. The Sam Altman-led AI company announced that it will start showing ads to a subset of free and Go users in the US. This comes after weeks of criticism and public jabs from rival Anthropic that published ads and changed Claude's homepage aimed at mocking OpenAI’s decision to bring ads. The company also published a long blog post explaining why it believes advertising does not belong inside AI conversations and why its chatbot, Claude, will stay ad-free.In the blog post, Anthropic said advertising works well in places like search engines and social media, where users expect a mix of organic and sponsored content. However, it argued that conversations with AI assistants are different. The company said that people often share personal details, sensitive issues, or complex work problems when chatting with AI.According to Anthropic, placing ads in such conversations would feel out of place and, in some cases, inappropriate. It added that many users treat AI tools like a trusted advisor, which makes advertising a poor fit. The Claude-maker further warned that advertising introduces incentives to keep users engaged for longer, which may not align with being helpful.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman: Ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.

Ads in ChatGPT: Privacy and safety rules

After weeks of criticism and public jabs from rival Anthropic, OpenAI has started testing ads in ChatGPT. Sharing a blog post, the company said it has started testing ads in the AI tool in the United States and will apply only to logged-in adult users on the Free and Go plans. “We’re starting to roll out a test for ads in ChatGPT today to a subset of free and Go users in the U.S,” OpenAI said in an X post adding “Ads do not influence ChatGPT’s answers. Ads are labeled as sponsored and visually separate from the response. Our goal is to give everyone access to ChatGPT for free with fewer limits, while protecting the trust they place in it for important and personal tasks.”OpenAI said ads are meant to help fund the infrastructure needed to keep the Free and Go tiers running and to support broader access to AI tools. The company said it will study feedback closely before expanding the program.“Keeping the Free and Go tiers fast and reliable requires significant infrastructure and ongoing investment. Ads help fund that work, supporting broader access to AI through higher quality free and low cost options, and enabling us to keep improving the intelligence and capabilities we offer over time,” the company stated in the blog post.OpenAI added that while advertising may grow over time, ChatGPT’s answers will remain independent, and user privacy will remain a core priority.As announced by the company, ads will appear only for adult users on the Free and Go tiers. Paid tiers such as Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise and Education will remain ad-free. Free users can also opt out of ads, but this will reduce the number of daily free messages they can send.OpenAI said ads will not affect how ChatGPT answers questions and that user conversations will stay private. The company described the move as a limited test aimed at learning from real-world use before any wider rollout.Users will be able to dismiss ads, give feedback, view ad history, delete ad data and manage personalization settings. OpenAI said these controls are meant to give users clear choices over their experience.OpenAI said ads will be clearly labeled as sponsored and shown separately from ChatGPT’s answers. The company stressed that ads do not influence responses. Ads are selected by matching advertiser submissions with the topic of a user’s conversation, along with past chats and past ad interactions.“During the test, we decide which ad to show by matching ads submitted by advertisers with the topic of your conversation, your past chats, and past interactions with ads. For example, if you're researching recipes, you may see ads for meal kits or grocery delivery. If there are multiple advertisers, we'll select the one that is most relevant to your chat to show you first,” OpenAI said in the blog post.OpenAI said advertisers do not have access to your chats, chat history, memories, or personal details. Advertisers will only receive aggregate information about how their ads perform such as number of views or clicks, the company stressed.Further, it will not show ads in accounts where the user is under 18 and “ads are not eligible to appear near sensitive or regulated topics like health, mental health or politics.”","OpenAI has started testing ads in its ChatGPT AI tool in the United States. Ads will apply only to logged-in adult users on the Free and Go plans. Users will be able to dismiss ads, give feedback, view ad history, delete ad data.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128140991,imgsize-24310,width-400,resizemode-4/ads-in-chatgpt.jpg"

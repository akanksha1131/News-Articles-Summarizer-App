China-US geopolitical tensions





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has once again made an urgent appeal to Washington, arguing that allowing American technology companies to compete openly in China serves the best interests of both the countries. On the tech podcast BG2, a podcast hosted by tech investors Brad Gerstner and Bill Gurley, Huang emphasized that a competitive presence in China would enable the US to ""proliferate the technology around the world"" and ""maximise America’s economic success and geopolitical influence.""Huang also expressed hope that China would remain open to outside investment, noting Beijing's pledges to maintain an ""open market."" ""What’s in the best interest of China is for foreign companies to invest in China, compete in China and for them to also have vibrant competition themselves,"" he said.Huang highlighted the rapid advances and robust potential of China's chipmaking industry, cautioning that the country is ""nanoseconds behind"" the US. ""We’ve got to go compete,"" he asserted, pointing to China's deep talent pool, hustling work culture, and intense internal competition across its provinces.He described the environment as a ""vibrant, entrepreneurial, hi-tech, modern industry.""Nvidia's Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are the essential backbone for training and running artificial intelligence (AI) models, a factor that has propelled the company's market capitalization to record highs. However, this success has been complicated by escalating geopolitical tensions, which have severely disrupted sales in China, one of the world's largest markets.Earlier this year, the US temporarily blocked exports of the H20, a downgraded chip designed to comply with restrictions, before relenting after a 15% levy to the US government was agreed upon. In August, the White House announced that President Donald Trump and Huang had struck a deal under which Nvidia would receive export licenses in exchange for 15% of Chinese sales of the H20 going to the US government.","Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang argues that U.S. technology companies should be allowed to compete openly in China.

""Wonderful Opportunity"" for Canada





President Donald Trump's decision to significantly increase the fee for H-1B visa has prompted an immediate reaction from business world, political leaders and more. The change in H-1B visa has also drawn attention of Canada's political leadership and industry. Several business experts and industry expert in Canada have urged Canadian government to seize the moment and open its doors to highly skilled professionals.The US announcement late last week to charge $100,000 for new H-1B applications has stunned American technology companies that rely on the program to employ foreign workers. Experts believe the move will severely limit opportunities for highly educated foreigners, particularly recent international graduates of U.S. universities.The call to attract and retain the talent left stranded by the H-1B changes appears to have the attention of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. In a recent speech before the Council of Foreign Relations in New York City, Carney highlighted Canada's homegrown research and AI talent, noting that ""unfortunately, most of them go the U.S.""He then addressed the US policy change directly, quipping, ""I understand you're changing your visa policy.Maybe we can hang on to one or two of them.""Immigration lawyer Evan Green stated that the situation presents ""a wonderful opportunity for the Canadian government to take advantage of.""His sentiment is echoed by the non-profit group Build Canada, which has released a memo urging the country ""to move fast."" The group argues that Canada is the natural landing spot for professionals left behind by the H-1B overhaul.""Hundreds of thousands of highly skilled and highly paid H-1B professionals are now seeking a new home,"" the memo stated. ""Canada, with its world-class research institutions, similar timezones, proximity to the U.S., and high quality of life, is the natural destination.""The impact of the H-1B changes affects even Canadians, who accounted for 1% of all applicants in 2019 before the fee hike. While the White House stated that the change doesn't affect current H-1B holders and is expected to face legal challenges, the uncertainty is already driving workers to look elsewhere.Canada immigration challengesDespite the clear opportunity, some industry observers caution that those looking north for an alternative may find that Canada's immigration system presents its own set of challenges.","President Donald Trump's decision to significantly increase the fee for H-1B visa has prompted an immediate reaction from business world, political leaders and more.

Apple's 'in-house ChatGPT' is for new Siri

Apple's high-stakes AI battle





Apple has been planning big for its AI comeback. In a recent meeting with employees, CEO Tim Cook said that the company must win in AI, calling it the biggest transformation in decades. “This is sort of ours to grab,” Cook said. “We will make the investment to do it.” According to a report in Bloomberg, iPhone maker has been overhauling its Siri voice assistant in hopes of making it comparable to AI tools from companies like OpenAI and Google. The report adds that Apple has created its own version of OpenAI's AI chatbot to test out the new and improved Siri.The company’s AI division is said to be using the app to quickly evaluate new features for Siri. This reportedly includes testing the ability to search through personal data, such as songs and emails, and perform in-app actions like editing photos.The iPhone maker is utilizing the app, code-named ""Veritas"" (Latin for ""truth""), to rapidly evaluate features for the revamped Siri. This new testing phase is part of a high-stakes overhaul that could redefine perceptions of Apple's AI capabilities, or risk having the company slip further behind rivals like Google and Samsung in the smartphone market's growing AI arms race.The Veritas application functions like a typical modern chatbot, allowing employees to manage multiple, saved conversations and conduct extended back-and-forth exchanges. For now, the software is strictly for internal use to efficiently test the still-in-progress technology of the new Siri, and Apple has no current plans for a consumer release, Bloomberg noted.The internal tool is designed to test the underlying AI system for the new Siri, code-named ""Linwood,"" which is built on a Large Language Model (LLM) combining Apple's proprietary work with a third-party model. The new Siri is expected to be far more capable.The major Siri revamp is now slated to debut as early as March after experiencing multiple delays. Apple had originally planned the rollout for last spring but postponed it after engineering problems led to features reportedly failing as much as a third of the time.The postponement triggered a wider overhaul of Apple's AI strategy, which included the sidelining of AI chief John Giannandrea and some deputies. The company is now focusing its efforts on the Answers, Knowledge, and Information (AKI) team, which is central to developing the new AI-based search features.The aggressive push into AI comes as competition is expected to ramp up in 2024, making advanced AI features a more decisive factor in smartphone purchasing decisions. CEO Tim Cook recently emphasized the company's commitment to the new frontier, telling staff that Apple ""must win in AI,"" calling it the biggest transformation in decades.","Report: Apple has created its own version of OpenAI's AI chatbot to test out the new and improved Siri.

White House on possibilty of new tariffs on foreign electronics: America cannot rely on…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/white-house-on-possibilty-of-chips-based-tariffs-on-foreign-electronics-america-cannot-rely-on/articleshow/124194408.cms,"Representative Image

“America cannot be reliant on foreign imports for the semiconductor products that are essential for our national and economic security.”

“The Trump administration is implementing a nuanced, multi-faceted approach to reshoring critical manufacturing back to the United States with tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation, and energy abundance,”

How these tariffs can increase the cost of consumer electronics



Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses





The Trump administration is reportedly planning to impose tariffs on foreign electronic devices with the fee being calculated based on the number of chips in each product. The proposed plan aims to pressure companies to shift manufacturing to the United States, a report claims. In a statement to the news agency Reuters, Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson has defended the push claiming:The report cited three sources familiar with the plan to further claim that the Commerce Department would enforce a tariff equal to a percentage of the estimated value of the product's chip content.Desai added.In August, Trump said the US would put a 100% tariff on imported semiconductors but spare companies that already make chips in the country or plan to do so. Major foreign chipmakers include Taiwan’s TSMC and South Korea’s Samsung The Reuters report cited one source to claim that the Commerce Department is looking at a 25% tariff on chip parts inside imported devices, and a 15% tariff on electronics from Japan and the EU, though these numbers are still early estimates.Officials have also discussed giving companies an exemption equal to the amount they invest in U.S. chip production—if they move at least half their manufacturing to the U.S. But the report didn’t clearly explain how that would work or if it will happen.The Commerce Department had earlier suggested exempting chipmaking equipment from tariffs to keep US production costs lower. However, the White House pushed back, as Trump generally opposes broad exemptions, the report claimsThe Reuters report noted that these rumoured tariffs could raise the price of consumer electronics and other goods at a time when inflation is already above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, economists have warned.The measures include 100% duties on branded drugs and 25% tariffs on heavy-duty trucks, alongside probes into pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.Since chips and other key inputs are central to many consumer products, even US-made goods are likely to become more expensive. The uncertainty over which products, countries, or companies might be exempt is adding to concerns about trade disruption and higher costs for consumers.","The White House is reportedly planning to impose tariffs on foreign electronic devices.

We are reaching out with an urgent update regarding international travel for individuals on H-1B visas.

A Proclamation is scheduled to take effect this Sunday at 12:01 AM ET. It introduces significant changes to re-entry procedures for H-1B visa holders currently outside the United States. We continue to review the Proclamation, but the initial advice we have received is that re-entry will require a mandatory payment of $100,000 per petition, which may cause substantial delays or prevent re-entry to the US

What You Need to Know:

If you are currently outside the US:

If you are currently outside the US with a valid H-1B visa, make plans to return and enter the US before the Proclamation takes effect on Sunday, September 21 at 12:01 am ET (i.e. by this Saturday night).

If you are currently in the US:

We strongly advise against any international travel if you are in valid H-1B status or need to travel to activate your H-1B visa. You should remain in the US

Departing the US may result in complications or denial of re-entry under the new policy.

If you are unable to return prior to the deadline in H-1B status: please reach out to go/immigration-help.

We understand this may create challenges, and we are here to support you. We are actively monitoring the situation and will keep you updated as we learn more.

Should you do an MBA? My views👇🏼

Most MBAs are outdated 🤷🏼

Better to learn how to build Products,

Best training ground if you want to accelerate your career or run a company one day.

That’s how I started. As a Product Manager.

Case studies and frameworks are nice, but they don’t teach you how to,

- Question the status quo

- Build deep empathy for customers

- Pursue global optima, not local wins

- Influence without authority

- Work backwards from the end state

That’s a Builder’s life.

It’s messy, political, creative, analytical — all at once.

A microcosm of real life, not classroom fluff.

That’s what helped me build companies, not the three-letter degree, although I do have one 🙈

So I tell young students & professionals to do an MBA, but a different kind. Do a Masters in Building Awesome things and you will graduate, not in 2 yrs, but every day 👨🏼‍🎓😎

Be a PM, Product Engineer, Product Designer, AI Builder, Hardware Designer, Robotics Engineer ….. heck, even a Toy Designer!

Because the 21st century will be led by builders who can also tell great stories 💪🏼

P:S - If you MUST do a top-tier MBA. Or hide for a few months & learn how to build, esp with AI 🤷🏼

Optus’ previous failures raise accountability questions





Australia's second-largest telecommunications provider Optus is facing mounting pressure after a 13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and caused 600 triple-zero calls to fail across multiple states. The September 19 network failure has prompted government investigations and renewed calls for accountability from the embattled telco.The outage primarily affected South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory, with some impact also recorded in far western New South Wales near the SA border, according to Reuters reporting. CEO Stephen Rue confirmed that established processes were not followed during a network firewall upgrade that began at 12:30 AM Thursday and lasted until approximately 1:30 PM (local time).Four deaths have been linked to the incident, though South Australian police later clarified that an eight-week-old boy's death in Gawler West was ""unlikely"" to have been caused by the outage delay. A 68-year-old Adelaide woman and two men aged 74 and 49 in Perth remain connected to the emergency services failure.The Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) reported that Optus received multiple customer complaints about the triple-zero failure as early as 9 AM Thursday, with five customers contacting the call center about the outage.However, these concerns were not properly escalated, and government authorities weren't informed until after the issue was resolved.Communications Minister Anika Wells expressed ""unbelievable disappointment"" that Australia was ""here again so quickly,"" referencing a similar 2023 incident. The Australian Media and Communications Authority (ACMA) chair Nerida O'Loughlin revealed her agency wasn't notified until more than 10 hours after the outage began, contrary to standard protocols.This marks the second major triple-zero outage for Optus in less than two years. The company was fined A$12 million in 2023 for failing to provide emergency call services to thousands during a nationwide outage and subsequently failing to conduct required welfare checks.The telecommunications giant, owned by Singapore Telecommunications, has faced a series of crises including a 2022 cyberattack affecting 9.5 million Australians and the 2023 outage that led to former CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin's resignation. Current CEO Stephen Rue took over in November 2024.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, speaking from New York, declined to say whether Rue should resign but indicated the government has ""action at its disposal"" pending investigation results. ACMA has launched a formal investigation, with Optus potentially facing fines exceeding $10 million and additional penalties.The company has promised full cooperation with all investigations while conducting its own internal review, with results to be made public.",13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and 600 triple-zero calls to fail.

Karan Vaidya, cofounder of AI startup Composio, said his O-1 visa cost less than $10,000 including legal fees, and praised its flexibility: “It’s a three-year visa that can be renewed indefinitely. I’m on my fifth O-1 now.”





US President Donald Trump’s executive order raising the H-1B visa application fee from $10,000 to $1,00,000 sent shockwaves in the tech industry. Due to the announcement last week many tech giants called back their professionals with H-1B visa back to the US. As the scrutiny around the traditional H-1B visa pathway making the process unpredictable, the skilled professionals are now planing to turn towards O-1 visa a lesser known route. The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.For those unaware, the O-1 Visa is introduced under the Immigration Act of 1990. The O-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields of education, science, athletics or arts. It enable the recipients to work in the US for up to three years and comes with unlimited renewals. The applicants of the O-1 visa much demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim and meet atleast three out of the eight criteria:After the unpredictable nature of popular H-1B visa, the O-1 visa is gaining a lot of traction among Indians who wish to go and work in the US. As per the report by Economic Times, Indian were granted 487 O-1A visas in FY 2020, this number was increased to 1,418 in FY 2023. With this increase, India became the third largest recipient of O-1 visa after UK and Brazil.Unlike the popularly H-1B visa which is capped at 85,000 visas annually and allocated via a lottery, the O-1 visa has no cap and the applications for it are accepted around the year. The applicants can also expedite the application process by submitting additional fees.Immigration consultant and O-1 holder Logan Ullyott told Business Insider: “The O-1 is an occupation-agnostic visa. You could get it if you’re an engineer, a researcher, an influencer, or even a cook — as long as you can prove you’re at the top of your field.”","The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.

I have heard so many accounts from Sindhi friends about how their families had to leave everything and come to India during partition. They rebuilt their lives and Sindhis have done well in India.

I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time. Come back home. It may take 5 years to rebuild your lives but it will make you stronger.

What it means for India







The entire technology and IT industry is in shock after US President Donald Trump announce massive five hike for H-1B visa. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application. After the announcement many tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others have asked their employees to return to US by September 21. Now, Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has also issued a piece of advice to Indian techies ‘come back to India to rebuild’. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Vemu drew parallel with the Partition of India in order to explain the current H-1B situation.

Political leaders weigh in







An ABC spokesperson recently confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely. The company decided to take the decision after the host of the show Jimmy Kimmel made some controversial comments on Charlie Kirk, linking his alleged killer to President Trump’s MAGA movement. MAGA – short for Make America Great Again is a political slogan, popularized by President Donald Trump during his election campaigns. During the late-night show, Kimmel made sharp comments stating that the MAGA gang is “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it”.Actor and filmmaker Ben Stiller was among the celebrities who has publicly defended Kimmel and has criticised the decision of ABC. In s post shared on social media platform X, Stiller wrote, “This isn’t right”.His brief but pointed reaction quickly went viral, with many fans and fellow entertainers echoing his sentiment that the suspension undermines free expression in comedy.Commenting on Ben Stiller’s post, Elon Musk supported the decision made by ABC and wrote, “He went full retard. Never go full retard.”This is not the first time that Musk has reacted to the controversy.Earlier this week after the Kimmel’s video clip from the show went viral, Musk said, “Jimmy Kimmel is disgusting”.The California Governor Gavin Newsom has also blasted the decision and has accused Republicans of orchestrating censorship. “They are censoring you in real time. It’s coordinated. And it’s dangerous,” wrote Newsom on X.On the other hand, commentator Davis Sirota suggested corporate politics were at play, noting that Nexstar, which has ties to ABC, is seeking regulatory approvals from the Trump administration.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump celebrated the suspension on Truth Social, calling it “Great News for America” and labeling Kimmel “ratings challenged” with “zero talent.”","ABC confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely.

Accenture reports strong Q4 results despite immigration policy uncertainty





Accenture CEO Julie Sweet downplayed concerns about the Trump administration's new $100,000 H-1B visa fee, stating the policy change poses minimal threat to the global consulting giant's operations. ""This is really a non-issue because we only have about 5% of our people in the US on H-1B visas, and they're for really specialised experience and skills for our clients,"" Sweet said during the company's earnings call Thursday following its fourth-quarter results announcement.The Dublin-based company's limited reliance on H-1B visas contrasts sharply with many Indian IT firms that depend heavily on the program to staff US projects with skilled workers from abroad. Accenture secured approval for 1,568 H-1B visa beneficiaries in the first half of the year, placing it among the top 25 US employers using the program, according to US immigration data.President Trump's executive order signed September 19 mandates the hefty one-time fee as part of broader immigration reforms, creating uncertainty across the technology sector. The move threatens the traditional cost-saving model many IT service providers rely on.Rather than viewing the policy as problematic, Sweet framed it as a business opportunity. ""Every time there's a big policy change, unfolded over decades, it has usually driven more business for the company,"" she explained, noting Accenture could help clients navigate compliance requirements.The announcement came as Accenture reported strong fourth-quarter results, with revenue of $17.6 billion beating analysts' average estimate of $17.36 billion. The company also unveiled an $865 million restructuring program to realign its workforce for rising demand in digital and AI services.Accenture employs over 770,000 people globally, with more than 350,000 based in India—its largest workforce concentration.

Read 'Build Canada's' memo on H-1B visa changes announced by Donald Trump that 'warns' and says: Turn America’s H-1B shift into ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/read-build-canadas-memo-on-h-1b-visa-changes-announced-by-donald-trump-that-warns-and-says-turn-americas-h-1b-shift-into-/articleshow/124186563.cms,"After Germany, Canada Aims To Lure Indian Tech Talent Amid Trump’s H-1B Visa Fee Hike

Here's the open memo on H-1B visa by 'Build Canada'

The US just made it much harder for talented foreigners to work in the country. On Friday, September 19th, President Trump signed an executive order to add a $100,000 fee to every new H-1B visa application. This change will fundamentally alter the global competition for talent.

Think of it like a massive game of musical chairs. Top talent is looking for a place to sit and America just removed many of their options. Canada can either watch from the sidelines as skilled workers scramble for the remaining seats, or it can quickly add new chairs for the best players.

The U.S. government’s stated intent for this policy is to encourage employers to hire more Americans. But, in advanced technology, engineering, and healthcare, there simply are not enough qualified domestic workers available. Faced with these shortages, U.S. employers will turn to the next easiest and most cost-effective option — Canadian professionals.

For most of the world, the H-1B is the primary way to work as a skilled professional in the US. But, unlike most foreign nationals, Canadian citizens can work in the country under TN status. Instead of needing an H-1B visa they simply present proof of employment and prior education at the border. Processing happens seamlessly, with a three-year renewable status1.

The risk for Canada is that the ease of the TN system and Canada’s highly talented population will incentivize American companies to recruit Canadian engineers, nurses, and tech workers as a way to retain access to foreign talent while avoiding the $100,000 fee they would otherwise need for an H-1B worker.

However, the changes also represent an opportunity. U.S. companies will be searching for new locations where they can place the world’s most talented professionals. And many of the almost 800,000 H-1B holders2 already in the United States will be looking for a new place to live and work because of uncertainty around future immigration policies.

This is a unique talent pool. H-1B holders are some of the most skilled workers in the world, often graduates from elite institutions like MIT, Stanford, IIT, and Tsinghua University. Previous examples of this talent pipeline include Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella3 and Elon Musk4. Not only do they command high salaries but many are looking to take their own shot at building the next generational companies.

If Canada could attract 120,000 of these high-skilled workers earning C$200,000 or more, it would generate billions of dollars in direct income and up to $30 billion in total GDP economic activity (including multiplier effects). That's more than a 1% growth in Canada's entire economy from a single policy change. This growth in spending would create jobs for Canadians and bring more prosperity to Canada.

But if, instead, the movement of immigrants flows in the opposite direction, it could cause serious harm. Perhaps the most pressing example is in healthcare. The Canadian healthcare system is already strained for key workers with almost 100,000 spots unfilled and 16,170 excess vacancies in nursing and therapy professions alone.

Just like Canada, America faces healthcare shortages including over 300,000 nurses6. Before, US healthcare providers would recruit from India and the Philippines through H-1B programs. Now they'll turn to Canada through the TN visa, where healthcare workers earn less than their American counterparts. This threatens Canada's already strained healthcare system.

Canada has natural advantages compared to other countries competing for global talent. Geographic proximity and similar timezones to the US allow workers to maintain American client relationships while living in Canada. Shared language and similar corporate law and culture reduce adaptation barriers. High quality of life and strong economic opportunities create a desirable location.

Taking bold steps to invite highly skilled immigrants at this moment is not an easy move. But it is the right one. If we don’t act decisively, we will miss out on a once-in-a-generation opportunity and risk further damaging Canada’s economic position.

What Must Be Done

To fully realize this opportunity, Canada can use two coordinated actions targeting different segments of this talent. With these new pathways no changes would be made to the total targets for new permanent residents and any temporary foreign workers would be restricted only to those doing work that otherwise wouldn’t happen in Canada.

Establish an H-1B Worker Closed work permit to allow current and prospective H-1B US visa holders to live in Canada while working for their US employers. Requirements would include a minimum US$140K (C$200,000) salary and a three-year employment commitment. For this group, Canada will offer a visa with 30-day processing. To enact this, quickly re-open and tweak the 2023 H-1B Open Work Permit as a new public policy, making it a closed work permit tied to the sponsoring US company. This would allow both the H-1B workers and their employers a way to maintain their existing relationships without paying US$100K in visa fees.

Create a Global Top-100 University Express Track under Express Entry. This program would award 50 additional points as part of the Permanent Resident application to graduates from elite institutions, including MIT, Harvard, Stanford, IIT, and Tsinghua University. This targets the same talent pipeline that previously produced major tech executives in the US and will now be looking for alternatives.

Common Questions

How do we ensure Canadian workers aren't displaced by foreign talent? This program is designed to bring highly skilled H-1B professionals not to compete for positions already available to Canadians. By setting high salary thresholds and tying permits to employment with U.S. companies, the program ensures these workers complement Canada’s economy rather than displace domestic talent.

What safeguards exist to prevent wage suppression in affected industries? The minimum salary thresholds and focus on high-skilled positions ensure these roles complement rather than compete with typical Canadian wages. The program targets occupations where Canada faces skills shortages, particularly in technology and healthcare, where demand exceeds domestic supply. Additionally, the Express Entry point system maintains merit-based selection that considers factors beyond just foreign education credentials.

Conclusion

America's $100,000 H-1B fee just created the biggest talent acquisition opportunity in Canadian history. The potential displacement of 800,000 skilled workers offers Canada access to graduates from the world's top universities who previously chose the US pathway. Two actions can capture this talent while protecting Canadian workers from southward migration. The government must act immediately before other countries seize this opportunity and Canada loses both the global talent and its own skilled workers to American recruitment.





'Build Canada', a non-profit organisation focused on growing Canada's productivity, released a memo recently urging Canadian government to seize the opportunity created by changes announced by Donald Trump in America's H-1B visa policy. In a memo titled, 'Turn America’s H-1B Shift into Canada’s Advantage', it asked the government ""to move fast"", arguing that it is a likely landing spot for workers left behind by H-1B changes. ""Hundreds of thousands of highly skilled and highly paid H-1B professionals are now seeking a new home,"" the memo said. ""Canada, with its world-class research institutions, similar timezones, proximity to the US, and high quality of life, is the natural destination.""The memo started with a summary that talked about changes in H-1B visa policy and warned that without action, ""American companies will target Canadian engineers, scientists, and healthcare professionals to bypass the fee by recruiting under the TN visa. This would threaten our tech sector, drain tax revenues, and worsen shortages in critical fields like healthcare."" It went on to add that Canada is an ideal target for this kind of poaching, with a deep pool of highly educated talent, shared cultural values, and native English fluency.The summary also mentioned Indian-origin CEOs of tech giants Google and Microsoft. ""Hundreds of thousands of highly skilled and highly paid H-1B professionals – many graduates of the world’s best universities, part of the same pipeline that produced leaders like Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, and Elon Musk – are now seeking a new home,"" said the memo.","The U.S. government’s stated intent for this policy is to encourage employers to hire more Americans. H-1B is the primary way to work as a skilled professional in the US. But, unlike most foreign nationals, Canadian citizens can work in the country under TN.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124186534,imgsize-35502,width-400,resizemode-4/canada.jpg"

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang: OpenAI will be the next big multi-trillion-dollar company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-openai-will-be-the-next-big-multi-trillion-dollar-company/articleshow/124184094.cms,"“I think that OpenAI is likely going to be the next multi-trillion dollar hyperscale company,”

“the smartest investments we can possibly imagine.”

“at the chip level, at the software level, at the systems level.”

Read what Jensen Huang said about Nvidia’s partnership with OpenAI



“I think that OpenAI is likely going to be the next multi- trillion dollar hypers scale company like Meta and Google. They're going to have consumer and enterprise services… if that's the case, the opportunity to invest before they get there, this is some of the smartest investments we can possibly imagine. We happen to know this space. So the opportunity to invest in that… the return on that money is going to be fantastic.

Let me start from the beginning. We’re partnering with OpenAI in several projects. The first project is the buildout of Microsoft Azure, and that partnership is going fantastically. We have several years of buildout to do, hundreds of billions of dollars of work just in that area alone. The second is the OCI buildout — there are five, six, seven gigawatts about to be built, and we’re working with OCI, OpenAI, and SoftBank to make that happen. These projects are already contracted, and we’re executing on them.

The third is CoreWeave — and again, I’m talking about OpenAI in all of this. The new partnership is about helping OpenAI build their own self-built AI infrastructure for the first time. We’re working directly with them at the chip level, the software level, the systems level, and the AI factory level to help them become a fully operated hyperscale company.

This is going to continue for some time. They’re going through two exponentials right now. The first exponential is customers — the number of customers is growing exponentially because the AI is getting better, the use cases are getting better, and just about every application is connected to OpenAI. The second exponential is compute — instead of just one-shot inference, the models are now thinking before they answer. Those two exponentials are compounding, and that’s driving enormous compute requirements.

So we’ve got to build out all these different projects. And this new partnership is additive, on top of everything already announced, and it’s going to support this incredible exponential growth.”

“They want to have a relationship with us the way Elon and X has.”

“I think they’ll likely use it themselves, and just think the case of X. But they would like to have the same direct relationship with us — direct working relationship and direct purchasing relationship. Just as with Zuck and Meta, Sundar and Google and Satya and Azure have.

So they’ve [OpenAI] gotten to a large enough scale that they believe it’s time for them to start building these direct relationships. So, I’m delighted to support that, and Satya knows it, and Larry knows it, and everybody’s aware of what’s going on, and everybody’s very supportive of it.”

What we know about the TikTok US deal so far



TikTok Deal Explained: Trump, China & The Algorithm Battle





The TikTok US deal may prove more profitable for the short video app’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The Chinese tech giant is expected to receive half or more of the profit generated by the platform's US operations, despite selling a majority stake to American investors in a deal orchestrated by President Donald Trump , a Bloomberg report citing people familiar with the matter suggested. The report also noted that ByteDance is structured to receive a licensing fee on all revenue generated by making its core algorithm available to the US entity. It would also receive a profit share proportional to its remaining equity stake, the report adds. The overall arrangement means the Beijing-based company will likely secure 50% or more of the US operation's total profit after the change in control. Earlier this week, Trump announced the deal that could keep TikTok operational in the US. However, China has yet to issue an official statement regarding the matter, while the sale price hasn’t been confirmed.The profit-sharing deal marks the latest turn in a years-long standoff over TikTok’s US operations. The previous Biden administration mandated ByteDance divest its US arm, but Trump has delayed the deadline while seeking a compromise, citing TikTok’s role in his 2024 election win. Recently, Trump claimed to have reached an agreement with Chinese Premier Xi Jinping Under the current plan, TikTok US would pay ByteDance a significant licensing fee for use of its algorithm, the core technology credited with driving the app’s popularity. The report added that ByteDance could receive approximately 20% of the incremental revenue generated through the algorithm, which could amount to $4 billion on $20 billion in revenue.Additionally, ByteDance would collect approximately 20% of the remaining revenue, reflecting its equity stake in the company. The rest would go to the U.S.-backed consortium, which is expected to include Oracle, Silver Lake, Abu Dhabi-based MGX, and existing investors, projected to hold about 80% ownership. Vice President JD Vance has noted that the acquiring group would set the final purchase price."," ByteDance is structured to receive a licensing fee on all revenue generated by making its core algorithm available to the US entity.

US To Abandon H1-B Visa Lottery System, Trump Floats More Changes To Rules | Detailed Report

Indian tech workers hit hardest



Critics say policy could “Dismantle” H-1B system







US President Donald Trump recently announced a massive hike in the H-1B visa fee. After the revised regulation the H-1B visa fee for fresh application was increased from $10,000 to $1,00,000. This announcement by the Trump administration created a situation of panic and chaos in the technology sector. Now, America’s largest bank JPMorgan and Chase said that this decision of the Trump government to impose such a huge fee on new H-1B application could lead to a sharp decrease in immigrant work authorisations in the United States.According to a report by Bloomberg, JPMorgan economists Abiel Reinhart and Michael Feroli estimated that the new policy change could cut as many as 5,500 work authorizations per month. These cuts would majorly impact the technology companies and skilled immigrants from India. The economist suggests that the number of cancelled authorisations is small in comparison to the overall US labour market, but these cuts in the work permits would impact the concentrated in sectors that rely heavily on foreign talent.The Bloomberg report also suggest that the data collected shows that computer-related occupations accounted for nearly two-thirds of H-1B approvals in fiscal 2024, with about half tied to professional, scientific, and technical services.Roughly 71% of approvals went to Indian nationals, making them the group most exposed to the new fee. Of the 141,000 H-1B petitions for new employment approved last year, about 65,000 were processed abroad—applications most vulnerable to the six-figure levy.Loujaina Abdelwahed, senior economist at Revelio Labs, warned that the dramatic fee hike is “effectively equivalent to dismantling the H-1B system,” potentially eliminating up to 140,000 new jobs annually in U.S. companies that depend on skilled foreign workers. “the dramatic increase in fees “is effectively equivalent to dismantling the H-1B system, potentially eliminating up to 140,000 new jobs per year — about 10,000 per month — in US companies that depend on skilled,” Abdelwahed told Bloomberg.According to Bloomberg economics, the immediate effect of the visa hike will be on relocation of visas toward higher-paying jobs in technology, finance, and healthcare, while squeezing out lower-paid positions in fields like education. They noted that the existing H-1B workforce should remain stable, since the fee applies only to new petitions, not renewals. However, they cautioned that the broader impact could include offshoring of roles that are no longer viable domestically.","US President Donald Trump recently announced a massive hike in the H-1B visa fee.

Political claims and context

Lessons from past precedents





A seemingly strange search result on Google , where typing the word “idiot” returned images of former President Donald Trump , sparked widespread speculation about political bias and algorithm manipulation. Google CEO Sundar Pichai clarified that this outcome was not the result of any manual interference or partisan intent. Instead, it emerged from how Google’s search algorithm interprets billions of web pages and user interactions. The system prioritizes relevance, popularity, and how users collectively associate terms online. In this case, coordinated online activity and repeated linking of Trump’s images with the word “idiot” caused the algorithm to surface those results, demonstrating the power of user behavior in shaping search outcomes.Google indexes and ranks web content using over 200 factors, including relevance, freshness, and user engagement. Pichai emphasized that no staff member manually selects search results. The algorithm works automatically, analyzing patterns in how keywords and content are connected across the web. When enough users link specific terms with certain pages or images, those connections influence what appears in search results.The Trump “idiot” result was largely driven by a phenomenon called “Google bombing.” Online communities, particularly on forums like Reddit, intentionally linked Trump’s images with the word “idiot,” increasing the frequency and interconnectedness of that association. Google’s algorithm detected this pattern and ranked the results accordingly. This practice is an example of how collective online behavior can influence search outcomes without any intervention from the company.The search result became a political flashpoint, with President Trump accusing Google of search bias, algorithm manipulation, and censorship. Investigations by regulators and independent experts found no evidence of deliberate manipulation by Google. CEO Sundar Pichai reiterated that search outcomes reflect organic trends, search engine algorithms, and user activity rather than company-driven agendas or political influence. Similar controversies have occurred in the past, including manipulated search trends and results—like searches for “miserable failure” returning images of President George W. Bush—driven entirely by user behavior, SEO tactics, and keyword associations.The incident illustrates the complex interaction between algorithms and human behavior. Algorithms prioritize content that is most linked, shared, or relevant according to user activity, regardless of context. High-profile cases like the Trump or Bush examples show that coordinated online behavior can dramatically affect search results, highlighting the broader influence of digital communities on information visibility.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai explains how Google’s algorithm show Donald Trump on searching ‘idiot’ The result became a political flashpoint, with President Trump accusing Google of search bias, algorithm manipulation, and censorship.

Policy should attract global talent while protecting wages







Box CEO Aaron Levie is pushing back against President Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee, warning the policy will give large tech companies an unfair advantage over cash-strapped startups in the competition for global talent. Speaking on ""The A16z Podcast"" alongside Andreessen Horowitz partners, Levie argued that the steep fee structure essentially turns international hiring into ""a spending game"" that smaller companies cannot win. The new policy, which takes effect September 21, represents a dramatic jump from current fees of $2,000 to $5,000.The Box CEO endorsed a significantly lower $20,000 fee proposed by Khosla Ventures' Keith Rabois, saying this amount wouldn't prevent smaller companies from competing for skilled workers. Startup founders have already told Business Insider that Trump's fee could ""kneecap their hiring in the talent wars,"" sending international workers to Big Tech companies that can more easily absorb the costs.The concerns extend beyond Silicon Valley's startup ecosystem. Billionaire investor Michael Moritz, whose portfolio includes Google and PayPal, has warned the policy could backfire by pushing tech innovation overseas, as skilled engineers can now work remotely from countries like India and Eastern Europe.Beyond the fee structure, Levie outlined a broader six-point framework for H-1B reform. He called for flexible visa caps that respond to actual talent availability, potentially ranging from 5,000 to 80,000 visas annually. ""There's not a fixed number of the world's best talent,"" he explained.His proposal emphasizes attracting ""the absolute best in the world"" while ensuring H-1B programs lift rather than suppress American wages. Levie warned against excluding junior-level international talent, citing examples like state school Master's graduates becoming AI engineers as ""positive sum"" contributors to the economy.The debate highlights broader questions about America's competitive edge in attracting global talent, particularly given that successful immigrant executives like Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Google's Sundar Pichai have become symbols of the H-1B program's potential benefits.","Box CEO Aaron Levie is pushing back against President Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee.

Trump Political Vendetta? After Ex-FBI Comey, Trump Names His Next Target

Monaco oversaw Trump election interference investigations







President Donald Trump on Friday called for Microsoft to immediately terminate Lisa Monaco, the company's president of global affairs and former deputy attorney general under President Biden, escalating his retribution campaign against officials who oversaw federal investigations into his conduct.Trump posted on Truth Social that Monaco is ""a menace to US National Security, especially given the major contracts that Microsoft has with the United States Government,"" and argued that Microsoft should ""immediately terminate the employment of Lisa Monaco."" Microsoft declined to comment on Trump's demand.Monaco served as deputy attorney general in the Biden administration and helped coordinate the Justice Department's response to the January 6, 2021, attacks by Trump supporters on the US Capitol. She joined Microsoft in July to lead the firm's engagements with governments globally, according to her LinkedIn profile.Monaco's security clearances were revoked by Trump in February, and Trump claimed that the US government has banned her from all federal properties because of ""Monaco's many wrongful acts."" In March, Trump had signed an executive order rescinding Monaco's security clearance, along with those of Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Liz Cheney and others.The request appeared on Trump's Truth Social account one day after former FBI Director James Comey was indicted. Trump suggested that more political adversaries would face prosecution, telling reporters: ""I think there will be others"" but said he did not have a list.Monaco's appointment to Microsoft in July had gone largely unnoticed until Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo highlighted her hiring Friday morning. The timing suggests Trump may have only recently become aware of her corporate role, according to political observers.Since Trump returned to office in January, he has already forced Intel's CEO to step down before later praising him, and successfully pressured Disney's ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show for several days.",President Donald Trump called for Microsoft to terminate Lisa Monaco.

Implementation challenges could benefit established US chipmakers





The Trump administration is developing a policy requiring semiconductor companies to match their domestic chip production with the volume their customers import from overseas, or face tariffs of up to 100%, according to a Wall Street Journal report. .Under the proposed rule, chipmakers would need to maintain a 1:1 ratio between US-made semiconductors and imported chips over time. Companies failing to meet this requirement would be subject to substantial import duties, potentially reaching 100% of the chip's value.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has reportedly presented the proposal to semiconductor industry executives, framing it as essential for national economic security. The plan represents President Trump's continued push to reshore critical manufacturing capabilities following his earlier tariff threats against the chip industry.""America cannot be reliant on foreign imports for the semiconductor products that are essential for our national and economic security,"" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told the WSJ, though he cautioned that policy reporting should be considered speculative until officially announced.The proposal includes provisions for companies committing to build new US facilities. These firms would receive ""credit"" for their pledged production volume, allowing continued tariff-free imports during construction phases with additional transitional support during capacity ramp-up.Industry analysts note significant implementation hurdles, particularly in tracking chip origins across complex global supply chains and accounting for varying chip complexities and values. The policy doesn't address how different types of semiconductors—from simple components to advanced AI accelerators—would be counted equally.Companies with existing US manufacturing capacity, including Intel, GlobalFoundries, and TSMC's Arizona operations, could benefit from the policy. GlobalFoundries and Intel shares both rose 5% following the WSJ report.""The 1:1 rule would be very difficult to implement and would likely take many years,"" said Gabelli Funds portfolio manager John Belton.","Proposed rule would require companies to match domestic production with imported chips. Companies failing to meet this requirement would be subject to substantial import duties. Industry analysts note significant implementation hurdles, particularly in tracking chip origins across complex global supply chains and accounting for varying chip complexities and values.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124164784,imgsize-11372,width-400,resizemode-4/ians.jpg"

Jamie Dimon calls $100,000 H-1B fee hike a ‘shock’



TikTok Deal Explained: Trump, China & The Algorithm Battle





JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a warning to US crypto investors. The CEO of one of the world’s most prominent banking institutions has cautioned that if inflation persists, the US Federal Reserve may be unable to cut interest rates, which could drive traders out of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Dimon's comments come as the Bitcoin price has dropped to nearly $111,000 following the Fed's recent decision to cut rates.Dimon said in a recent interview with CNBC TV-18. Dimon noted thatand suggested that he also has arguments for it to increase rather than decrease. Continued high inflation and a lack of further rate cuts could significantly affect the crypto market. This comes after the US Federal Reserve lowered rates by 25 basis points last week, marking the first rate cut in 2025. Although this move briefly lifted Bitcoin’s price, it did not help the cryptocurrency surpass $100,000 late last year.Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump announced a new policy imposing a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B visa applications. The rule, which took effect on September 21 is expected to significantly affect employers’ ability to hire highly skilled foreign workers through the program. Under the new rule, companies must now pay a one-time fee of $100,000 for each new application, compared to the earlier cost of $2,000 to $5,000, depending on the employer's size.Responding to the announcement, Dimon said that the increased fee is a “shock,” and warned that it could hinder the inflow of foreign talent into the US. He said the decision ""came out of the blue,"" and noted that JPMorgan would be ""engaging with stakeholders and policymakers"" on the issue.He emphasised the importance of visas for the company, explaining: “We move people around globally—experts who get promoted to new jobs in different markets,” while stressing that immigration remains one of America’s “core strengths.”","JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a warning to US crypto investors.

My favourite ChatGPT feature so far: Sam Altman introduces user insights tool Pulse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/my-favourite-chatgpt-feature-so-far-sam-altman-introduces-user-insights-tool-pulse/articleshow/124164625.cms,"Representative Image

What Sam Altman said about ChatGPT’s new Pulse tool



“Today we are launching my favorite feature of ChatGPT so far, called Pulse. It is initially available to Pro subscribers.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Pulse works for you overnight, and keeps thinking about your interests, your connected data, your recent chats, and more. Every morning, you get a custom-generated set of stuff you might be interested in.

It performs super well if you tell ChatGPT more about what's important to you. In regular chat, you could mention “I’d like to go visit Bora Bora someday” or “My kid is 6 months old and I’m interested in developmental milestones” and in the future you might get useful updates.

Think of treating ChatGPT like a super-competent personal assistant: sometimes you ask for things you need in the moment, but if you share general preferences, it will do a good job for you proactively.

This also points to what I believe is the future of ChatGPT: a shift from being all reactive to being significantly proactive, and extremely personalized.

This is an early look, and right now only available to Pro subscribers. We will work hard to improve the quality over time and to find a way to bring it to Plus subscribers too.

Huge congrats to @ChristinaHartW, @_samirism, and the team for building this.”

UN General Assembly cyberattack: How Secret Service stopped hackers from disrupting cell service in all of New York City,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/un-general-assembly-cyberattack-how-secret-service-stopped-hackers-from-disrupting-cell-service-in-all-of-new-york-city/articleshow/124164127.cms,"Representative Image

How US secret service found out about the telecom hacking network



“It can’t be understated what this system is capable of doing. It can take down cell towers, so then no longer can people communicate, right? …. You can’t text message, you can’t use your cell phone. And if you coupled that with some sort of other event associated with UNGA, you know, use your imagination there, it could be catastrophic to the city.”

“We need to do forensics on 100,000 cell phones, essentially all the phone calls, all the text messages, anything to do with communications, see where those numbers end up,”

“The US Secret Service’s protective mission is all about prevention, and this investigation makes it clear to potential bad actors that imminent threats to our protectees will be immediately investigated, tracked down and dismantled,”

“Could there be others? It’d be unwise to think that there’s not other networks out there being made in other cities in the United States,”

The US Secret Service has reportedly dismantled a hidden, massive telecom hacker network near New York City that investigators say could have crippled cell towers and jammed 911 calls during the United Nations (UN) General Assembly. The takedown occurred as nearly 150 world leaders prepared to gather in Manhattan, a report claims. Investigators uncovered a cache of more than 300 SIM servers, each containing over 100,000 SIM cards, clustered within a 35-mile radius of the UN. Officials have warned that this system represents one of the most significant communication threats found on US soil and could have disrupted cellular service, potentially blacking out communication and impacting daily life and emergency response efforts. The incident highlights a new security risk targeting the ""invisible infrastructure"" of modern, connected cities.According to a report by the news agency Associated Press, investigators revealed that the network was uncovered during a broader Secret Service probe into telecom threats targeting senior government officials. Spread across several sites, the servers acted like clusters of fake cellphones, capable of sending mass calls and texts, disrupting local networks, and concealing criminals’ encrypted communications, officials said.In a statement, Matt McCool, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service’s New York field office said:However, officials said they have not found any direct plan to disrupt the UN General Assembly and emphasised that no credible threats to New York City have been identified.McCool added that forensic analysis is still in its early stages. Yet, agents suspect nation-state actors that are linked to certain countries used the system to transmit encrypted messages to organised crime groups, cartels, and terrorist organisations. Authorities have not yet revealed which governments or criminal networks were involved.McCool added, suggesting that the process will take time.Investigators found over 100,000 active SIM cards and equipment capable of scaling the network’s size. McCool said the operation, costing millions, could send up to 30 million texts per minute.Sean Curran, the agency’s director, highlighted.Officials also warned the network could have triggered cellphone blackouts like those after 9/11 or the Boston Marathon bombing, with attackers able to cause such outages at will.McCool noted.","Investigators found over 100,000 active SIM cards and equipment capable of scaling the network’s size.

"Apple responds to lawsuit over delayed Siri features, says ‘limited delay cannot support sweeping claims’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-responds-to-lawsuit-over-delayed-siri-features-says-limited-delay-cannot-support-sweeping-claims/articleshow/124162390.cms,"The Slimmest iPhone Yet: What we think

Apple’s response to the lawsuit over delayed Siri features





Apple has asked a US court to dismiss a consolidated class action lawsuit over delayed Siri features, reports MacRumours citing court documents reviewed by it. The lawsuit claims that Apple misled customers with marketing for the iPhone 16, which promoted upcoming Siri features powered by Apple Intelligence. Plaintiffs said they would not have purchased the iPhone 16, or would have paid less, if they had known the features would be delayed.The case, Landsheft v. Apple Inc., is being heard in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.Apple’s lawyers argued that the lawsuit is unfounded because only two Siri features—contextual awareness and in-app controls—were delayed. “Plaintiffs complain about the timing of release of two features, despite the near-two dozen Apple Intelligence features that have already been delivered,” the lawyers said. “This limited delay cannot support Plaintiffs' sweeping claims.”The lawyers also said the delayed features do not amount to a breach of warranty.“By purchasing an iPhone 16, all of the plaintiffs have benefitted from camera improvements, enhanced silicon and increased performance, upgraded displays, and numerous other hardware and software improvements, including more than 20 Apple Intelligence features that were already available prior to the lawsuit,” they added.Apple first announced the personalized Siri features at its WWDC 2024 keynote, highlighting better understanding of a user’s personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls. The company later said in March that the features would be delayed, with CEO Tim Cook noting in July that Apple was “making good progress” and aimed to release them “next year.”Apple advertised the features through product presentations, its website, and a TV commercial featuring actor Bella Ramsey. The company is reportedly planning to release the features in iOS 26.4, expected in March or April 2026.","Apple has asked a US court to dismiss a consolidated class action lawsuit over delayed Siri features.

Responding to a post by Rupert Lowe – UK MP for Great Yarmouth on X (formerly Twitter), Musk replied with a simple ""Yes."" Lowe’s post argued that station names in London should be displayed ""in English, and English only,"" referring to Whitechapel’s signs, which include Bengali alongside English.Sharing the post, Lowe wrote “This is London - station name should be in English and English only”. Musk responded to it with “Yes”.Whitechapel, situated in East London, has long been a significant hub for the British Bangladeshi community . The Bengali signage was introduced in 2022 by Transport for London (TfL) to celebrate the cultural heritage of British Bangladeshis, who have been an integral part of the Whitechapel community for decades. The initiative was then aimed to honor the area's diverse history and acknowledge the contributions of the British Bangladeshi population to London’s cultural fabric.John Biggs, Mayor of Tower Hamlets, who played an instrumental role in getting the bilingual signage at the Whitechapel station then said: ""Whitechapel is at the heart of the Bangladeshi community. Bilingual signs have been installed at Southall and replicating this at Whitechapel would be welcomed to mark the culture of British Bangladeshis and reflect the rich heritage and diversity.""Lowe’s post, however, has reignited debates around the role of bilingual signage in public spaces. While some agreed with his perspective, arguing that English is the UK’s primary language and should be prioritized, others defended the bilingual signs as a meaningful gesture toward inclusivity.","Elon Musk responded to a post by Rupert Lowe – UK MP for Great Yarmouth on X (formerly Twitter) Lowe argued that station names in London should be displayed ""in English, and English only"" Whitechapel, situated in East London, has long been a significant hub for the British Bangladeshi community.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118093970,imgsize-23136,width-400,resizemode-4/118093970.jpg"

The Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES) has submitted a formal complaint to the labour ministry, labeling the mass layoffs of trainees by Infosys as illegal, unethical, and in violation of labour laws.In a letter addressed to labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya, NITES President Harpreet Singh Saluja stated, ""It has come to our attention, through numerous complaints received from affected employees, that Infosys Ltd. has resorted to forcibly terminating recently onboarded campus recruits who had already suffered a delay of two years in their joining after being issued offer letters.""On Friday (February 7), Infosys asked for the resignation of around 700 trainees it had hired 2.5 years ago but onboarded last October. NITES has demanded strict penal action from the ministry for violating provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act , 1947, and called for an immediate investigation and a restraining order against Infosys to halt further terminations until due legal process is followed.NITES also demanded the reinstatement of all terminated employees along with appropriate compensation for the wrongful termination. The Bengaluru-headquartered IT giant claimed the number to be under 350, calling it “mutual separation” and reasoned that the employees failed to clear three attempts in an internal assessment programme after undergoing extensive foundational training at their Mysuru campus.“All freshers get three attempts to clear the assessment, failing which they will not be able to continue with the organization, as is also mentioned in their contract. This process has been in existence for over two decades and ensures a high quality of talent availability for our clients,” Infosys said in a statement to ET.NITES has alleged that the company employed intimidation tactics during the termination process.

When Steve Jobs told Bill Gates he should have taken acid and gone to Ashram,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-steve-jobs-told-bill-gates-he-should-have-taken-acid-and-gone-to-ashram/articleshow/117993748.cms,"What Gates said on Jobs’ suggestion

Bill Gates admires Jobs

Jobs wished Gates had gone to Ashram

Bill Gates recently shared an anecdote about his interactions with the late Steve Jobs, revealing that the Apple co-founder once suggested he should try acid (commonly known as LSD) to enhance his senses so that he can design better looking products at Microsoft .Gates recounted that Jobs, known for his visionary approach to product design, talked about taking hallucinogenic drugs.“Steve Jobs once said that he wished I’d take acid because then maybe I would have had more taste in my design of my products,” the billionaire told The Independent (via Fortune).Gates, however, dismissed the suggestion, jokingly stating that he had received ""the wrong batch"" – the coding batch instead of the marketing and design batch. He also acknowledged Jobs' superior talent in design and marketing, admitting that those skills were not his forte.“Look, I got the wrong batch,” he said.“I got the coding batch, and this guy got the marketing-design batch, so good for him. Because his talents and mine—other than being kind of an energetic leader, and pushing the limits—they didn’t overlap much,” Gates added.The duo had something of a love-hate relationship while Jobs was alive, but Gates clearly admires the talents of his counterpart.“[Jobs] wouldn’t know what a line of code meant, and his ability to think about design and marketing and things like that… I envy those skills. I’m not in his league,” he said, heaping praise on the Apple co-founder.Jobs had previously made similar comments about Gates in a 2011 biography, suggesting that Gates would be “a broader guy if he had dropped acid once or gone off to an ashram when he was younger.”Gates also revealed that he had experimented with marijuana in his youth but stopped using recreational drugs when he began working on Microsoft, explaining that it made his mind “sloppy.”“I thought maybe I would look cool and some girl would think that was interesting. It didn’t succeed, so I gave it up,” Gates added“Another thing about my personality is that I like my mind to work and be very logical. So I stopped … because it made my mind sloppy, either during or the day afterwards,” Gates noted.","Bill Gates revealed that Steve Jobs once suggested he try acid to enhance his senses so that he can design better looking products at Microsoft.

Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath want you to know this about SEBI’s new circular on API usage and algorithmic trading,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamath-want-you-to-know-this-about-sebis-new-circular-on-api-usage-and-algorithmic-trading/articleshow/118020989.cms,"Take a look at the post here



“The SEBI circular on

API usage

and algo trading is out. What you need to know:

If you’re a retail trader using broker APIs to automate trades, you can do so as long as your order frequency is below an exchange-prescribed threshold. This limit is yet to be decided.

If you’re selling algos or strategies to other traders, you’ll need to partner with a broker and get yourself registered with the exchanges to do so.

Marketplaces, where people share algos for a fee, can’t publish strategies without exchange registration as well as an RA license.

The exchanges will publish their own circulars with operational details by April 1.”

SEBI's latest ALGO trading rules | The Daily Brief #163

What SEBI’s new algo trading rules say



Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India 's (SEBI) new rules. In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Kamath explained SEBI ’s new regulations concerning algorithmic trading for retail investors, a move that significantly alters market participation. Kamath highlighted that retail traders selling trading strategies or algorithms must now partner with a broker and register with stock exchanges. Furthermore, platforms facilitating the sharing of algorithms for a fee will need both exchange registration and a research analyst (RA) licence.In the X post, Kamath wrote:In the comment section of the post, he also shared the link to an article which explains the latest SEBI algo trading regulations in details.SEBI’s newly announced framework will allow retail investors to engage in algo trading—an opportunity previously limited to institutional players. The move comes in response to rising demand from retail participants and aims to strike a balance between accessibility and risk management.Under the updated regulations, brokers must secure exchange approval for each algorithm and ensure that all automated orders include a unique identifier for audit tracking. Any modifications to an approved algorithm will also require regulatory clearance. Retail investors developing their algorithms will only need to register them if their order execution frequency exceeds a specified threshold.SEBI has categorised algorithms into two types: “white box” algos, where the logic is transparent and replicable, and “black box” algos, which operate without disclosure. Providers of black box algos will be required to obtain a Research Analyst (RA) license and maintain detailed research documentation.Set to take effect on August 1, these new rules are expected to transform India’s algo trading landscape—expanding automation for retail traders while introducing stricter compliance measures to uphold market integrity .","Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India's new rules.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it

The New York Times made history on February 15, 1942, by publishing its first crossword puzzle in the Sunday Magazine. Created by Charles Erlenkotter and edited by Margaret Farrar, this marked the paper as the first major U.S. publication to feature a crossword. The decision sparked a cultural shift, making puzzles a beloved pastime for readers. Over the decades, the NYT has expanded its puzzle offerings to include the Mini Crossword (2014) and popular games such as Spelling Bee, Letter Boxed, and Tiles.In 2022, the paper acquired Wordle, which became a global sensation. Building on this momentum, it later introduced games like Connections and Strands, capturing the interest of a growing community of players worldwide. The NYT continues to innovate in the puzzle space, cementing its position as a leader in engaging, mind-challenging entertainment for people of all ages and backgrounds, uniting puzzle enthusiasts across the globe.Having trouble solving today’s NYT Strands puzzle?

Akash Bobba , a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). Bobba, along with five other young engineers, was hired by Musk to modernise government systems, raising concerns about their lack of government experience and the potential security risks involved.Bobba, a graduate of UC Berkeley's elite Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (MET) program, has quickly risen through the ranks of Silicon Valley , securing internships at Meta, Palantir, and Bridgewater Associates.Known for his problem-solving skills, Bobba once rewrote an entire project overnight after a teammate accidentally deleted it just before a deadline. His former classmate Charis Zhang recalled the incident.“Let me tell you something about Akash. During a project at Berkeley, I accidentally deleted our entire codebase 2 days before the deadline. I panicked. Akash just stared at the screen, shrugged, and rewrote everything from scratch in one night—better than before. We submitted early and got first in the class. Many such stories. I trust him with everything I own,” wrote Zhang in a social media post.Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate. Critics argue that granting individuals with limited government experience access to sensitive government systems poses significant security risks. The hiring strategy has also raised questions about the competence and oversight within Musk's DOGE initiative. Reports suggest that at least four of the new DOGE hires, including Bobba, now have top-tier access to federal IT systems.Bobba isn't the only new face in Musk's government overhaul. The five other members of the DOGE team comprise a mix of recent graduates, college students, and former SpaceX interns, all of whom now have official government emails and top-level security clearances.","Akash Bobba, a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE) Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate.

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.

Asmita Patel accused of re-routing money

Securities & Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has seized Rs 53.67 crore from Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd along with five other entities. Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd is a well-known stock market training institute that offers online courses on stocks and trading. Some of the popular courses offered by the self-proclaimed ""options queen"" and ""She Wolf of Stock Market"" are ""Let's Make India Trade"" (LMIT), ""Master's in Price Action Trading"" (MPAT), and ""Options Multiplier"" (OM) .Jayesh Thakkar, a SEBI Registered Research Analyst shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) stating “SEBI has seized Rs 53.67 crore that Asmita Patel and five other related entities made illegally. Asmita Patel is also at risk of losing another Rs 104.6 crore it collected from course fees, which SEBI believes were part of unregistered advisory services.”The investigation was initiated by SEBI after receiving complaints from 42 participants of these courses. In addition to impounding the Rs 53.67 crore, SEBI has issued a show-cause notice questioning why Rs 104.6 crore, collected as fees for various programs, should not also be seized.SEBI has sent an interim order directing the school, Asmita Jitesh Patel, and Jitesh Jethalal Patel to cease offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services. The entities have also been barred from accessing the securities market.The order also uncovered that fees collected from participants were routed through entities such as King Traders (proprietor: Sagar Dhanjibhai), Gemini Enterprise (proprietor: Suresh Parmashivam), and United Enterprises (proprietor: Jigar Rameshbhai Dawada). SEBI stated that this was a regular practice and not an isolated incident, making all six entities jointly and severally liable for the Rs 53.67 crore earned from course fees.The regulator further demanded that the notices explain why they should not be ordered to disgorge Rs 104.6 crore, along with interest. SEBI's order noted that the fees collected for LMIT, MPAT, and OM courses, as well as other programs provided by the school, were earned under the guise of unregistered advisory and research analyst services.The order reads, “The aforesaid amount includes not only the amount collected as fees by the Noticees for LMIT, MPAT and Options Multiplier (OM) courses but also includes the fees collected by the Noticees for the other courses offered by the Noticee no.1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading )through which it carried out unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services along with interest”.Kamlesh Varshney, SEBI's Whole-Time Member, highlighted in the order “Examination revealed that, prima facie, the Noticee no. 1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading) along with the Noticee no.2 (Asmita Jitesh Patel) and the Notice no.3 (Jitesh Jethalal Patel) devised a scheme wherein students/investors/participants were lured to trade in specific stocks and told to open trading account with ABC Ltd.

What Meta has to say

Employees at Facebook parent company Meta are raising concerns about censorship and unclear moderation practices on the company's internal Workplace platform. They have reported that their posts and comments have been removed without clear explanation, prompting the formation of a watchdog group, “CEE Watch,” to monitor these removals and advocate for greater transparency in content moderation practices.According to a report by Business Insider, the company implemented “Community Engagement Expectations” (CEE) prohibiting discussions on a bunch of sensitive topics, including politics, health and weapons, and restricting mocking of protected categories such as race.Employees have accused the company of using the CEE rules – formed in 2022, updated in October – to censor valid discussions.“CEE language is intentionally vague and we cannot know how it's being enforced without openly sharing our violations with each other,” a welcome post on the CEE Watch page says.Meta employees are criticising the company’s content moderation policies on its internal Workplace platform, alleging censorship and a lack of transparency. Several employees have reported posts and comments being removed, sparking debate about the boundaries of acceptable workplace discussions.One employee reported that multiple posts related to Palestinians had been removed over the past year, questioning how employees can engage in discussions about ""acceptable forms of identity"" at work. Another employee commented that it was an ""open secret"" within the ""Muslim@"" employee resource group that seemingly harmless posts had been removed.Citing internal documents, the report says that Meta prohibits content that has the “potential to trigger disruptive comments” on topics including political movements or causes, citing examples like slogans such as “Free Puerto Rico,” “Liberate Hong Kong,” “Free Palestine”, Make America Great Again'; 'Build Back Better'; or 'Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow!').""Employees are now openly challenging these policies, with some framing it as a free speech issue. One employee, whose post linking to a news article about political figures and Meta's CEO was removed, explicitly labeled it as a ""free speech issue.""A company spokesperson reportedly said Meta didn't remove internal employee comments just because it doesn't agree with or like them, adding that many critical comments remained up on Meta's internal communications boards.","Employees at Facebook parent company Meta are raising concerns about censorship and unclear moderation practices on the company's internal Workplace platform.

Zerodha founder and CEO Nithin Kamath 'complains' to RBI: Something needs to be done about ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zerodha-founder-and-ceo-nithin-kamath-complains-to-rbi-something-needs-to-be-done-about-/articleshow/118063341.cms,"Poll Do You Agree With Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath? No, The System Works Fine Yes, It Needs Urgent Fixing

Read the post here

The sheer number and variety of digital frauds is astounding. It's fair to assume that things will only get much worse from here, thanks to AI. Both SEBI and RBI are trying to educate people and implement measures to combat these frauds.

SEBI has published a consultation paper proposing unique UPI IDs for brokers to ensure that investors transfer money only to SEBI-registered brokers and not to scammers using UPI IDs with broker names. Yesterday, the RBI announced that it would implement the ""

"" domain exclusively for Indian banks, aiming to counter the numerous phishing sites that mimic legitimate bank websites.

Another major nuisance, apart from payment and website fraud, is the proliferation of fake apps that mimic banks, brokers, and payment apps. Something needs to be done about these apps too.

This is not the first time Kamath has raised awareness about digital frauds. He has previously advised users to verify information carefully and be cautious of offers that seem too good to be true.

Nithin Kamath , founder and CEO of Zerodha , has raised concerns with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) over the growing number of fake apps impersonating banks, brokers, and payment platforms. His remarks follow RBI’s recent move to introduce an exclusive “.bank.in” domain for all Indian banks, aimed at curbing digital financial fraud.In a post on X, Kamath highlighted the growing threat of cyber frauds, exacerbated by the possibilities offered by artificial intelligence (AI). He emphasised the need for stricter measures to tackle phishing scams and fake apps, which often trick users into providing sensitive personal information.Kamath also praised RBI's initiative but urged for more comprehensive actions, including multi-layered app store policies, real-time AI-based detection, and official app directories to help users identify legitimate entities. Earlier this week, RBI announced the ‘bank.in’ domain for banks to enhance cybersecurity and prevent fraud. Registrations of the same is set to begin in April, with IDRBT as the exclusive registrar. A separate ‘fin.in’ domain for non-bank financial entities is also planned.Users also agreed with what Kamath has said. “Awareness is the key element, which enables customers to probe before taking actions. Tech enabled solutions and fixes like domain names and app strangle the existing fraud infra. Scammers will find new techniques in 6 months, as its happening from ages. Scammers need to be hit by next level tech & Ai and harsh & criminal punishment so that they stop thinking about it only,” commented a user.‘SEBI and RBI are taking steps, but scammers always find new loopholes. Fake apps are the next big threat—hope action follows before damage is done,’ said another user.","Nithin Kamath, founder and CEO of Zerodha, has raised concerns with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) over the growing number of fake apps impersonating banks, brokers, and payment platforms.

The disruption, which began at approximately 5:20 PM ET, left many gamers unable to access online services, log into their accounts, or make purchases on the PlayStation Store. Reports of server failures surged, reaching their peak at 5:49 PM ET, with Down Detector registering over 68,000 complaints within a short period.The outage led to significant frustration among players, particularly as it occurred during peak gaming hours when many users were returning home from work or school.A large percentage of affected users reported issues with server connectivity, while others faced difficulties logging into their PlayStation accounts. Sony acknowledged the disruption on its official PlayStation Network status page, stating that they were aware of the issue and working to resolve it as soon as possible. However, no official explanation has been provided regarding the cause of the outage or a timeframe for full service restoration. This unexpected downtime has left many gamers unable to access their favorite multiplayer games, cloud saves, and digital content, leading to widespread speculation about whether the issue was caused by maintenance, a technical glitch, or a more significant underlying problem.The outage disrupted essential PlayStation services, preventing users from engaging in various online activities. Many players reported being unable to log into their PSN accounts, access their friends lists, or join multiplayer games. Online-based titles such as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Fortnite, Grand Theft Auto Online, EA FC 24, and Destiny 2 were rendered inaccessible, leaving competitive gamers particularly frustrated.Additionally, players attempting to make purchases on the PlayStation Store encountered difficulties, with transactions failing or the store failing to load entirely. Some users also experienced issues with their cloud saves and game updates, which rely on PlayStation’s online infrastructure to sync data across devices. Error messages such as ""PlayStation Network is currently undergoing maintenance (WS-37432-9)"" appeared frequently, giving users no choice but to either dismiss the message or visit PlayStation’s support page for updates.The PlayStation Network outage was not limited to a specific device, as players on PS5, PS4, PS3, and PS Vita all reported experiencing connectivity issues. The disruption also extended beyond consoles, affecting PlayStation’s web-based services, including PlayStation Direct and the PlayStation mobile app. This meant that users who attempted to manage their accounts, purchase digital content, or check their subscription details were also unable to do so.As the outage impacted regions worldwide, it led to disruptions across multiple time zones, affecting both casual gamers and esports players alike. The inability to access online game modes, leaderboards, and competitive matches added to the frustration, as many gamers rely on PlayStation’s network for their daily entertainment. The timing of the outage, occurring on a weekend evening, made it even more inconvenient for players who had planned gaming sessions with friends or were looking forward to special in-game events.As soon as users began encountering issues, reports of the outage surged on Down Detector, a platform that tracks real-time connectivity problems across various online services. By 6:00 p.m. ET, nearly 70,000 complaints had been logged, confirming the widespread nature of the disruption.

What a joke. We can’t even play the games we purchased.”A third user, visibly upset, wrote, “I’m sick and just trying to play, but you always ruin everything.

China's TikTok is bypassing restrictions on its platform in the United States by allowing Android users to download the app directly from its website via Package Kits. This move comes after Apple and Google removed TikTok from their app stores following a US law that took effect on January 19. The law requires TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance , to sell the app or face a ban due to national security concerns.US President Donald Trump signed an executive order just hours after taking oath on January 20, delaying enforcement of the law by 75 days. He also stated that he was in discussions regarding TikTok's sale and anticipated a decision in the next few weeks. The app has approximately 170 million users in the United States. A subsequent executive order was signed directing the creation of a sovereign wealth fund, which could potentially be used to purchase TikTok.US officials have expressed concerns about potential data misuse under ByteDance's ownership. Free speech advocates have challenged the ban, while TikTok maintains that US officials have misrepresented its ties to China. The company asserts that its content recommendation engine and US user data are stored in the US on Oracle-operated servers, and that content moderation decisions affecting American users are made within the United States.TikTok's owner ByteDance is reportedly slow-rolling negotiations for a sale while rewaiting for approval from the Chinese government. According to a report in Washington Post, China is likely to take a hard-line approach, letting TikTok's U.S. operations die rather than approving a sale, as it holds out for a ""grand deal"" with Trump's administration that includes larger concessions on trade and tech policy, the report said.The move follows a renewal of a trade war between US and China, as China slapped tariffs on U.S. imports, in a swift response to new US duties on Chinese goods. Trump late last month said he was in talks with multiple people over buying TikTok and would likely have a decision on the popular app's future in the next 30 days.","China's TikTok is bypassing restrictions on its platform in the United States by allowing Android users to download the app directly from its website via Package Kits.

How does Microsoft’s scareware blocker work

Microsoft has started to roll out a new feature in its Edge browser called “scareware blocker” to protect users from increasingly sophisticated online scams, particularly those employing scareware tactics . The company announced the feature at its Ignite conference last November and is now inviting users to preview and test it.Scareware scams employ aggressive web pages designed to deceive users into believing their system is infected with malware.These scams often pressure victims to call fake tech support numbers, potentially leading to financial loss and compromised personal information.Microsoft says that its data revealed a significant rise in online scams, with Edge blocking five times more scams in 2024 compared to just three years prior. While Edge currently utilizes Microsoft Defender SmartScreen to block known scams, the new scareware blocker aims to provide a proactive defense against emerging threats.Microsoft says that its scareware blocker leverages a machine learning model to identify the characteristics of scareware scams and empowers users to regain control of their browsing experience.“Scareware blocker adds a new, first line of defense to help protect the users exposed to a new scam if it attempts to open a full screen page. Scareware blocker uses a machine learning model that runs on the local computer. The model uses computer vision to compare full screen pages to thousands of sample scams that the scam-fighting community shared with us.

"DeepSeek iPhone app has multiple security flaws, mobile security company claims",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/deepseek-iphone-app-has-multiple-security-flaws-mobile-security-company-claims/articleshow/118027132.cms,"Security flaws discovered in DeepSeek’s iPhone app







“The DeepSeek iOS app globally disables App Transport Security (ATS) which is an iOS platform-level protection that prevents sensitive data from being sent over unencrypted channels. Since this protection is disabled, the app can (and does) send unencrypted data over the internet,”

“While none of this data taken separately is highly risky, the aggregation of many data points over time quickly leads to easily identifying individuals. The recent data breach of Gravy Analytics demonstrates this data is actively being collected at scale and can effectively de-anonymize millions of individuals,”

“The encryption algorithm chosen for this part of the application leverages a known broken encryption algorithm (3DES) which makes it a poor choice to protect the confidentiality of data,”

“[A sample user] is operating on the latest iPad, leveraging a cellular data connection that is registered to FirstNet (American public safety broadband network operator) and ostensibly the user would be considered a high value target for espionage. Bear in mind that not only are 10’s of data points collected in the DeepSeek iOS app but related data is collected from millions of apps and can be easily purchased, combined and then correlated to quickly de-anonymise users,”

The DeepSeek app has been popular among iPhone users since its launch and even topped the App Store charts in the US. However, a mobile security company has discovered multiple new security vulnerabilities in the app offered by the Chinese AI startup. These flaws are considered more severe than a previous security issue that exposed chat history and sensitive data due to a lack of database authentication.However, the company didn’t fully disclose the extent of the new vulnerabilities and their potential impact.The security flaws in DeepSeek’s iPhone app were discovered by the mobile security company NowSecure. One of the vulnerabilities includes the lack of Apple’s built-in App Transport Security (ATS). ATS is meant to protect sensitive personal data by ensuring it is transmitted only over encrypted channels. The company claims to have discovered that DeepSeek had disabled this feature on its iPhone app.NowSecure said in a blog post.The company said that even though the exposed data may seem harmless, it can be easily combined to reveal a user's identity.the company added.NowSecure also noted that even though DeepSeek does encrypt data, it uses an outdated method that is known to have security flaws.the company continued.Moreover, the company also said that the data gathered by DeepSeek’s iPhone app can help identify potential targets for spying.the company explained.",The DeepSeek app has been popular among iPhone users since its launch and even topped the App Store charts in the US.

RBI has a new plan to protect you from banking frauds: Change in website domain names for banks and NBFCs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/rbi-has-a-new-plan-to-protect-you-from-banking-frauds-change-in-website-domain-names-for-banks-and-nbfcs/articleshow/118021906.cms,"What RBI governor said about the new domain names



“Increased instances of fraud in digital payments are a significant concern. To combat the same, the RBI is introducing the 'bank.in' exclusive Internet Domain for Indian banks. This initiative aims to reduce cyber security threats and malicious activities like phishing; and, streamline secure financial services, thereby enhancing trust in digital banking and payment services. The Institute for Development and Research in Banking’ Technology (IDRBT) will act as the exclusive registrar. The actual registrations will commence from April 2025. Detailed guidelines for banks will be issued separately. Going forward, it is planned to have an exclusive domain viz., “fin.in” for other non-bank entities in the financial sector.""

“The surge in digital frauds is a matter of concern, warranting action by all stakeholders. The Reserve Bank has been taking various measures to enhance digital security in the banking and payments system. Introduction of

Additional Factor of Authentication

(AFA) for domestic digital payments is one such measure. It is proposed to extend AFA to online international digital payments made to offshore merchants, who are enabled for such authentication,”

""Introduction of Additional Factor of Authentication (AFA) for digital payments has enhanced the safety of transactions which, in turn, provided confidence to customers to adopt digital payments. This requirement, however, is mandatory for domestic transactions only. In order to provide a similar level of safety for online international transactions using cards issued in India, it is proposed to enable AFA for international card not present (online) transactions as well. This will provide an additional layer of security in cases where the overseas merchant is enabled for AFA. Draft circular will be issued shortly for feedback from stakeholders.

Risky & Short-Sighted Strategic & Effective

Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ) has announced the cancellation of 20 consulting contracts on February 3, primarily involving strategic communication and executive coaching. The move is expected to save taxpayers $26 million.Announcing the same on X (formerly known as Twitter), it wrote “This morning, 20 consulting contracts, mostly focused on “strategic communication” and “executive coaching,” were terminated for immediate savings of $26mm.”Quoting the post, the Tesla CEO wrote “Another description for these types of payments is ‘ money laundering ’,”.This comes after reports claimed that DOGE gained access to sensitive Treasury data, including Social Security and Medicare payments to focus on identifying and eliminating waste and fraud. However, this rumoured access raised concerns among Democratic lawmakers and watchdog groups regarding potential privacy violations and the extent of DOGE's authority.Replying to this, Musk claimed that Treasury officials approved payments to fraudulent and terrorist groups without scrutiny, alleging they were instructed never to deny payments.Former President Donald Trump created the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) via an executive order, appointing billionaire Elon Musk to spearhead the initiative. The department's primary mission is to modernize and streamline federal operations, focusing on cutting government expenses and boosting overall productivity.Talking about DOGE, Democrat leader Chuck Schumer recently said, ""The American people will not stand for an un-elected secret group to run rampant through the executive branch. Being innovative is good, but Mr. Musk, this isn't a tech startup. These are public institutions.""Elon Musk replied to Schumer's post, writing, ""He’s mad that @DOGE is dismantling the radical-left shadow government in full view of the public. This is our ONE CHANCE to return POWER to the PEOPLE from an unelected BUREAUcracy back to DEMOcracy!! Only with the support of YOU can this succeed.

UK orders Apple to create 'back door' for access to encrypted user data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uk-orders-apple-to-create-back-door-for-access-to-encrypted-user-data/articleshow/118018874.cms,"Apple rejects FBI’s ‘back door’ request

The UK government has reportedly demanded that Apple create a ""back door"" to allow British security officials access to all content uploaded to the cloud by any Apple user worldwide. The UK’s office of the Home Secretary is said to have served Apple with a document called a technical capability notice, ordering it to provide the access.Citing people familiar with the matter, The Washington Post reported that the “technical capability notice” issued last month, orders the company to provide access to fully encrypted user data under the Investigatory Powers Act of 2016.The report noted that rather than compromise the security and privacy of its users globally, Apple is likely to stop offering encrypted cloud storage in the UK. However, this concession would not satisfy the UK's demand for access to data stored in other countries, including the US.Apple can appeal the order, but the law does not allow for a delay in compliance during the appeal process. In March, Apple expressed its opposition to such a requirement, stating that the UK government should not have the authority to undermine the security benefits of end-to-end encryption for users worldwide.The UK Home Office has reportedly declined to comment on the matter, stating that it does not discuss operational matters or technical demands.In 2016, Apple announced its intention to oppose a court order compelling the company to assist the FBI in unlocking the iPhone of the San Bernardino shooter, citing concerns about the potential threat to the privacy of millions of users.“Opposing this order is not something we take lightly. We feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the US government,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an open letter. The FBI sought information stored on the shooter’s employer-issued iPhone as part of its investigation into the shootings that resulted in the deaths of 14 people.Apple introduced full encryption with iOS 8 to enhance user privacy and security. This encryption prevents Apple from accessing user data, even when compelled by law enforcement.","UK government reportedly demands Apple create a ""back door"" to allow security officials access to all content uploaded to the cloud by any Apple user worldwide.

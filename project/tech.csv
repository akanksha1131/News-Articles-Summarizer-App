US-based chipmaker Wolfspeed has announced its plan to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the country. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the plan from the struggling chip manufacturer comes under a restructuring agreement with creditors. This move is designed to provide $275 million in fresh financing and reduce its debt by $4.6 billion, or nearly 70%, the company said to Reuters. The restructuring agreement, reached with creditors and Renesas Electronics ' US subsidiary, is a direct response to deepening economic uncertainty driven by changing trade policies and weakening demand, which led Wolfspeed to raise ""going-concern doubts"" in May. The company intends to seek approval for its pre-packaged plan and emerge from bankruptcy by the end of the third quarter of 2025.In a prepackaged bankruptcy, a company and its creditors agree on a reorganisation plan before officially filing for bankruptcy, with creditors voting on the plan in advance. As per the Reuters report, the company plans to maintain normal business operations throughout the restructuring process.As of March, Wolfspeed held nearly $1.33 billion in cash and carried around $6.5 billion in debt obligations.Last week, Bloomberg reported that the firm is preparing to file for a prepackaged bankruptcy, with creditors including Apollo Global Management , the company that is expected to take control of the chipmaker.In 2023, Wolfspeed secured $1.25 billion in debt financing led by Apollo, with the option to raise it to $2 billion to support its US expansion plans.The company has also seen significant leadership changes in recent months, naming industry veteran Robert Feurle as CEO in March and David Emerson as COO in May, following an announcement to reduce its senior leadership team by 30%.","US-based chipmaker Wolfspeed has announced its plan to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the country.

IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN ...: World's biggest environment NGO Greenpeace joins protests against Jeff Bezos-Lauren Sanchez wedding,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/if-you-can-rent-venice-for-your-wedding-you-can-worlds-biggest-environment-ngo-greenpeace-joins-protests-against-jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-wedding/articleshow/122032068.cms,"According to reports, in late June, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and his fiancée, Lauren Sanchez, will exchange vows in Venice, the romantic heart of Italy. The majority of the wedding details have been kept secret by the couple, who were engaged in May 2023 while on vacation in Europe.

Greenpeace joined a series of protests in Venice on Monday targeting the upcoming wedding of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, unfurling a massive banner in St. Mark’s Square that read, “IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX,” according to the Associated Press (AP). Local police swiftly confiscated the banner, dispersing the half-dozen demonstrators.The protest is part of the “No Space for Bezos” movement, a coalition of Venetian housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners, and university groups, which has criticized the wedding as emblematic of Venice’s overtourism crisis and municipal governance failures. Last week, activists hung banners from the San Giorgio bell tower and Rialto Bridge and plastered posters across the city decrying the event’s impact on local residents.Greenpeace, collaborating with the British group “Everyone Hates Elon,” known for anti-Elon Musk demonstrations, said the action aimed to spotlight billionaires’ low tax contributions and environmentally unsustainable lifestyles. “This wedding highlights how wealth can commandeer public spaces while exacerbating the climate crisis,” a Greenpeace spokesperson told AP.The demonstrations have drawn sharp criticism from Italian and Venetian authorities, who have welcomed the high-profile nuptials set for later this week. Meanwhile, Corila, a Venetian environmental research association, revealed over the weekend that Bezos’ Earth Fund is supporting its work with a significant donation. Corila, which collaborates with universities and Italy’s national research council on Venice’s protection strategies, clarified that discussions with Bezos began in April, predating the protests, though it declined to disclose the donation amount.The protests underscore growing tensions in Venice over tourism’s dominance and the prioritization of wealthy visitors over local needs, activists say, as the city braces for the global attention the Bezos-Sanchez wedding will bring.","Greenpeace joined a series of protests in Venice on Monday targeting the upcoming wedding of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez.

Fresh stolen data could fuel next wave of online crime

Immediate action required for all users

Security researchers have uncovered an unprecedented data breach involving 16 billion login credentials across 30 databases, potentially affecting users of major platforms including Facebook Gmail , Apple, and countless other services. The discovery, made by CyberNews researchers during an ongoing investigation since January 2025, represents what could be the largest credential leak in history.The exposed datasets range dramatically in size, from smaller collections containing tens of millions of records to massive databases housing over 3.5 billion credentials each. The massive trove of stolen data was briefly accessible through unsecured databases before being locked down, though researchers were unable to identify the owners. Most concerning is that virtually all datasets were previously unreported, with only one 184-million-record database having been disclosed before by Wired magazine in May.The leaked credentials span virtually every major online service imaginable, creating a ""blueprint for mass exploitation,"" according to the research team. The databases contain login information for social media giants like Facebook and Instagram, email services including Gmail, developer platforms such as GitHub, messaging apps like Telegram, VPN services, and even government portals.Each record typically follows a standard format: website URL, username, and password. This structure matches the collection methods used by infostealer malware, malicious software designed to harvest sensitive information from infected devices.“Telegram's primary login method is a one-time-password delivered by SMS. As a result, this is far less relevant for Telegram users compared to other platforms where the password is always the same,” Telegram said in a statement to TOI.Unlike recycled data from old breaches, researchers emphasise this represents ""fresh, weaponizable intelligence at scale."" The credentials provide cybercriminals with unprecedented access for account takeovers, identity theft, and highly targeted phishing campaigns that can devastate both individuals and organisations.CyberNews researchers warn that new massive datasets emerge every few weeks, highlighting the pervasive nature of infostealer malware in today's digital landscape. The inclusion of recent logs with tokens, cookies, and metadata makes this data particularly dangerous for organisations lacking multi-factor authentication.With approximately 5.5 billion people having internet access globally, the breach potentially affects multiple accounts per person. Security experts recommend immediate password changes across all online accounts, enabling multi-factor authentication wherever possible, and using password managers to generate unique, strong passwords.Users are also advised to regularly monitor their accounts and consider using services like ""Have I Been Pwned"" to check if their credentials have been compromised.Apart from this, it's always better to use the latest software versions, enable automatic updates and access only secure, trusted URLs (preferably HTTPS) while avoiding links in unsolicited email messages.","Security researchers have uncovered an unprecedented data breach involving 16 billion login credentials across 30 databases.

Jeff Bezos-Lauren Sachez wedding gift for guests

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren Sanchez , engaged for two years, are reportedly set to wed next week in Venice, Italy, with a star-studded guest list. An insider revealed to the Daily Mail that VIP attendees will receive lavish gifts, including hand-blown glassware from local Venetian glassmaker Laguna B.According to the publication, Jeff Bezos’ $500 million superyacht, Koru, will be anchored off San Giorgio Maggiore island, home to the historic 16th-century Basilica of San Giorgio Maggiore. The insider noted that the island will be closed to visitors from June 24 to June 29, with Venice’s mayor speculating the wedding may take place on the yacht. A private tender service will reportedly ferry guests between the island and the yacht.The report further said that Bezos has reserved the Scuola Grande della Misericordia, one of Venice’s grandest historic buildings, from June 26 to June 28, though its connection to the wedding remains unclear. The guest list, expected to be under 200, may include celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, and members of the Trump family.The Italian source told the Daily Mail that each guest will receive custom glassware from Laguna B, a company founded by Marie Brandolini, who was inspired by traditional Murano glassmaking. Her son took over after her passing in 2013, per Vogue. The vibrant, handcrafted glassware, featuring stripes and floral designs, retails for $167 per large cup.The insider further added that guests will receive additional “opulent” gifts, though specifics remain undisclosed. Lauren Sanchez is known for her love of designer bags, such as the $5,750 Balenciaga 9AM Coffee Cup Clutch Bag and a $7,000 crystal-adorned Judith Leiber UFO-inspired bag gifted by the Kardashian family after her Blue Origin space trip.The report said that Rosa Salva Venetia, a local bakery, will provide pastries like tiramisu, cream-filled pastries, and fritelli for the multi-day celebration, though it will not supply the wedding cake.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a warning to American businesses: the real labor crisis isn’t a worker shortage—it’s a skills shortage . Speaking at the Business Routable’s CEO Workforce Forum, Dimon asked the coperate leaders to not wait for the government fixes and should directly partner with the schools to close the growing talent gap. “What you’re really short of is the skills you need,” Dimon said, pointing to critical areas like cybersecurity, coding, project management, and financial literacy . He stressed that the companies must invest in education pipelines and push for curricula which blends job-ready credentials with traditional academics.Jamie Dimon who is an advocate of workforce development , feels that continous mismatch between available jobs and qualified candidates act as a threat to economic growth and innovation across multiple sectors ranging from advanced manufacturing and healthcare to technology and financial services.He also mentioned that global estimates suggest that 10 millions of jobs will go unfilled by 2030 due to lack of skilled talent.""We need to break down the barriers between education and employment ,"" Jamie Dimon stated at a recent economic summit. ""It's time to build a system that helps people learn, adapt, and thrive throughout their careers—not just at the start.""Dimon asked for high-schools and colleges to offer workplace focused courses as part of their curriculum. The billionaire banker also stressed that businesses can’t rely solely on four-year degrees. “They all want jobs,” he said of young graduates. “But many end up in retail or inventory roles, when there are jobs in coding, cyber, and financial management.”Jamie Dimon is also calling for unprecedented collaboration between the private sector, government agencies, and educational institutions. He advocates for incentives for companies that invest in workforce training and increased public funding for apprenticeship programs and digital learning platforms.

DeepSeek trying to ‘evade’ US ban on chips: US official



A senior US State Department official has accused Chinese artificial intelligence firm DeepSeek of supporting China’s military and intelligence operations, a report has said, adding that the official also said that the company also used shell companies in Southeast Asia in an attempt to unlawfully acquire high-end US semiconductors .The allegations, shared with news agency Reuters on the condition of anonymity, represent the US government's first formal assessment of DeepSeek's ties to Beijing and its activities. The official stated that DeepSeek has “willingly provided and will likely continue to provide support to China's military and intelligence operations,” a claim that goes “above and beyond open-source access” to its models.This news comes after the Hangzhou-based DeepSeek gained global attention in January by claiming its AI models could match or surpass those from US industry leaders at a significantly lower cost.According to the official, the US government believes DeepSeek is sharing user statistics and information with Beijing's state surveillance apparatus, a concern amplified by Chinese laws that compel companies to share data upon request.Furthermore, the official cited over 150 references to DeepSeek in procurement records for China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) and affiliated entities, alleging the company provided technology services to PLA research institutions. Reuters could not independently verify this data.The report also claims that the US official also detailed DeepSeek's efforts to circumvent American export controls on advanced AI chips, specifically Nvidia 's H100s.“DeepSeek sought to use shell companies in Southeast Asia to evade export controls, and DeepSeek is seeking to access data centers in Southeast Asia to remotely access U.S. chips,” the official was quoted as saying.Meanwhile, Nvidia said it does not support parties that violate US export controls and noted that with current restrictions, it is “effectively out of the China data center market.” An Nvidia spokesman also stated their review indicated DeepSeek used ""lawfully acquired H800 products, not H100,"" a less powerful chip designed to comply with US export rules.","Chinese artificial intelligence firm DeepSeek accused of supporting China’s military and intelligence operations.

The US House of Representatives has banned Meta-owned popular WhatsApp messaging service from all official staff devices, effective immediately, a report has said. The move marks a major rejection of one of the world's most widely used communication tools by a key branch of the US government.Citing a memo dispatched to all House staff on Monday (June 23), news agency Reuters reported that the Office of Cybersecurity detailed the reasoning for the directive.“The Office of Cybersecurity has deemed WhatsApp a high risk to users due to the lack of transparency in how it protects user data, absence of stored data encryption, and potential security risks involved with its use,” the memo, issued by the chief administrative officer, stated.The House memo recommended several alternative messaging apps for official use, including Microsoft’s Teams platform, Amazon's Wickr, the privacy-focused app Signal and Apple's native iMessage and FaceTime services.Meta Platforms has opposed the decision. A company spokesperson said Meta disagreed with the move “in the strongest possible terms,” asserting that its end-to-end encryption provides a higher level of security than many of the approved alternatives.The security of WhatsApp has been a recurring subject of concern. In January, a WhatsApp official acknowledged that scores of its users, including journalists and members of civil society, had been targeted by spyware from the Israeli firm Paragon Solutions.The decision comes amidst heightened scrutiny of messaging app security in government circles, particularly following a recent lapse on a rival platform. Earlier this month, a senior editor from a foreign news agency was mistakenly added to a sensitive US government-related Telegram group, potentially exposing internal discussions before the error was rectified.That incident is believed to have accelerated reviews of all third-party communication platforms used by congressional staff.This ban is the latest in a series of actions taken by the House to regulate software on its devices. In 2022, the popular short-video app TikTok was similarly banned due to security concerns related to its parent company's ties to China.","The US House of Representatives has banned Meta-owned popular WhatsApp messaging service from all official staff devices.

Amazon’s second successful Kuiper launch

JOB SCAM ALERT! Don't Let Fake Recruiters Steal Your Money

Amazon has launched 27 more satellites under its Project Kuiper on Monday (June 23), taking another step toward building a large network of internet satellites in low Earth orbit. The launch puts Amazon in closer competition with Elon Musk-owned SpaceX’s Starlink, which currently leads the satellite internet market. The satellites were launched aboard a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 6:54 a.m. ET (4:24pm IST).“We have ignition and lift off of United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket carrying satellites for Amazon’s Project Kuiper internet constellation,” said ULA engineer Ben Chilton during a livestream of the launch.This is Amazon’s second successful Kuiper launch. The mission had been delayed twice due to bad weather and a technical issue with the rocket booster.The first batch of 27 satellites was sent into orbit in April this year. The company now has a total of 54 Kuiper satellites in space. These launches mark the beginning of Amazon’s plan to build a network of 3,236 satellites to provide global internet coverage.Amazon must deploy at least half of its planned satellites — 1,618 — by July 2026 to meet a deadline set by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).To achieve this goal, Amazon has booked more than 80 satellite launches with various providers, including SpaceX, its main competitor. Starlink, operated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, already has about 8,000 satellites in orbit and offers satellite internet service globally.Project Kuiper was first announced in 2019 as Amazon’s move into the growing satellite internet market. The company says the service will help expand internet access in remote and underserved areas once it becomes fully operational.",This is Amazon’s second successful Kuiper launch.

The US embassy in India has announced a new guideline for those applying for student and exchange visitor visas. The new rules, effective immediately, are applicable to all applicants of F, M, and J non-immigrant visas who will now have to set their social media accounts to public. The move, the embassy said, is aimed at helping U.S. officials verify the identity and eligibility of visa applicants during the security screening process. The US embassy shared this update in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), saying that the change is necessary to ""facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States under US law.""“Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to public to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States under U.S. law,” the post says.F, M and J visas are the common types of non-immigrant visas issued by the agency to foreign nationals who wish to study or participate in exchange visitor programs in the US F visa is typically used by academic students, the M visa by vocational students, and the J visa by exchange visitors, including researchers, scholars, and interns.Under the new rules, Indian students and others planning to study or participate in exchange programs in the US will now need to ensure that their social media profiles are visible to the public before submitting their visa applications.While the US government has previously required applicants to list their social media handles as part of the visa application process , this new step goes further by asking applicants to remove privacy restrictions so officials can view their online content more easily.However, officials have not specified how long applicants need to keep their profiles public, but the move signals increasing scrutiny of online behaviour as part of visa vetting.","US embassy in India has announced a new guideline for those applying for student and exchange visitor visas.

JOB SCAM ALERT! Don't Let Fake Recruiters Steal Your Money

Apple founder Steve Jobs once said that building great teams requires friction – the one that leads to arguments and strong opinions, but resulting in better ideas and stronger people. In a 1995 interview with PBS’s Triumph of the Nerds, Jobs recalled a story from his childhood when a neighbor showed him how a rock tumbler worked. He told interviewer Bob Cringely that a widower neighbor showed him a homemade tumbler consisting of “a motor”, “coffee can” and a “little band between them”. It was filled with ""regular old ugly rocks,"" water and grit, Jobs told the interviewer, recalling that the stones emerged ""amazingly beautiful"" after a night of clattering. “That’s what it’s like when you get a bunch of incredibly talented people working together,” Jobs said.““They bump up against each other, they make some noise, they make some mistakes, they have arguments sometimes, they fight — but they polish each other,” he added. Jobs believed that real progress comes when people are forced to challenge each other, not just agree.At the time of the interview, he was running NeXT and was preparing to return to Apple.Former Apple employees, as per a Benzinga report, say Jobs often structured team spaces to encourage such interaction. Engineers and designers were placed close together so they had to confront issues head-on. Similar methods were used later in iPhone development and at Pixar, where open criticism in story sessions was part of the creative process.Pixar’s Chief Creative Officer Pete Docter recently said that Steve Jobs would reportedly call colleagues at hours. As per a recent CNBC report, Docter told Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies Gala that Jobs would phone colleagues “at any time, day or night, three in the morning … you're on vacation, doesn't matter”. He further stated that Jobs’ after-hours calls were non-negotiable and that the intensity often ignored personal boundaries. Docter’s comments come amid ongoing discussions about tech’s always-on work culture. He positioned his own leadership style as a contrast to that of Jobs — and to the hustle culture promoted by figures like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos","Steve Jobs once said that building great teams requires friction – the one that leads to arguments and strong opinions, but resulting in better ideas and stronger people.

Walmart is going beyond price wars

Walmart is investing billions in a gleaming new headquarters campus designed to lure top tech talent away from industry giants like Google, Netflix and Amazon, as the retail behemoth transforms itself into a technology-driven company to compete in the digital marketplace.The retailer's new 350-acre Bentonville, Arkansas campus features Silicon Valley-style amenities including electric bikes, robot groundskeepers, a hotel, food hall, amphitheater and massive fitness centers. The facility, which opened its first building in January, represents a dramatic departure from Walmart's spartan former headquarters in a converted distribution center with wood-paneled offices and few windows.Tech workers now comprise one-third of Walmart's 15,000-person corporate workforce, driving the company's digital advertising platform, data services, artificial intelligence and drone delivery operations. This technological pivot has forced the world's largest retailer by revenue to compete directly with tech companies for skilled employees who have specific workplace expectations.""You are in a competition for talent — even if you are the largest company in the world by revenue — and having a nice experience and work environment is a great recruiting and retention tool,"" said Scott Benedict, a former Walmart executive turned retail consultant, according to The New York Times.The challenge is particularly acute for a company based in Arkansas, where recruiting tech talent requires convincing workers to relocate from major metropolitan areas. Walmart must demonstrate that life in Bentonville can rival opportunities in San Francisco, Seattle or New York while shedding its image as a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer.Dan Bartlett, Walmart's executive vice president of corporate affairs, acknowledged the new campus ""will play a role in recruiting and retention of talent, particularly tech talent, where they have certain expectations.""The transformation reflects Walmart's recognition that competing on price alone is no longer sufficient. Modern commerce demands excellence in convenience, breadth and speed, forcing the company to match Amazon's technological capabilities while leveraging its vast network of nearly 11,000 stores worldwide.Walmart's e-commerce business recently achieved profitability, with the company expecting two-thirds of future growth to come from digital operations. The retailer now sells premium items like $6,000 Louis Vuitton handbags online while expanding drone delivery services to compete with Amazon's logistics network.The investment appears to be paying dividends with investors. Walmart's stock has outperformed both the S&P 500 and Amazon this year, rising more than 5 percent as analysts overwhelmingly rate the company a buy.","Walmart is investing billions in a gleaming new headquarters campus designed to lure top tech talent.

How China achieved faster internet speed than Starlink

JOB SCAM ALERT! Don't Let Fake Recruiters Steal Your Money

A team of Chinese scientists has reportedly developed a new way to improve satellite laser communication from space to Earth, achieving faster data speeds despite atmospheric interference. According to a South China Morning Post, researchers led by Wu Jian of Peking University of Posts and Telecommunications and Liu Chao from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have managed to transmit data to a ground station at speeds of 1 gigabit per second using a 2-watt laser from a satellite over 36,000 kilometers above the Earth. This, the report says, is significantly faster than current systems such as Starlink , which offers speeds in the megabit range.The team tested the method using a 1.8-meter telescope at a research facility in Lijiang, southwest China. The system targets the challenges of atmospheric turbulence, which weakens and distorts laser signals as they pass through the Earth’s atmosphere.To address this, the scientists combined two existing techniques—adaptive optics (AO) and mode diversity reception (MDR). The combined AO-MDR method helped correct the shape of distorted light beams and captured multiple signal modes simultaneously, improving both signal strength and reliability.In their paper – published on June 3 – in the journal Acta Optica Sinica, the researchers said the technique reduced transmission errors and increased the chance of receiving usable signals from 72% to over 91%.The method was tested using advanced components such as 357 micro-mirrors inside the telescope to reshape the laser’s wavefront and a multi-plane converter that split the signal into eight channels. A custom-built algorithm selected the three strongest channels for data transmission in real time.China has been expanding its research and development in laser-based satellite communications. In 2020, its Shijian-20 satellite achieved a record 10Gbps laser downlink from geostationary orbit. The power level used on that satellite remains undisclosed.","Chinese scientists have reportedly developed a new way to improve satellite laser communication from space to Earth.

Social media platform X (formerly Twitter) is moving aggressively into financial services . Recently, X CEO Linda Yaccarino announced that users will soon be able to make investments and trades directly on the platform. This push appears to be central to owner Elon Musk 's ambition to transform X into an ""everything app,"" similar to China's WeChat. ""You’ll be able to come to X and be able to transact your whole financial life on the platform,"" Yaccarino said in an interview with the Financial Times. Now a new report suggests that users may soon witness the launch of X customisable physical debit card under company’s X Money financial services.According to a report by TechCrunch, Mobile app intelligence firm AppSensa has noticed multiple code strings which suggest that X is working on offering both virtual and physical payment cards. These backend updates reference a variety of card-related functions, including the ability for users to:* Track the shipping status of their physical debit card.* Activate the card upon delivery.* Report it as lost or stolen, and lock/cancel it.* Set or change a PIN.* Potentially personalize the physical design, with hints that a user's X handle could be printed on the card itself.The findings suggest that the system will enable a separate management of physical and virtual cards offering flexibility to the users. Along with this, the code also reveals that the potential partnerships with some major financial networks. References to ""payment_card_brand_amex_"" and ""payment_card_brand_mastercard_"" suggest that support for American Express and Mastercard is also in the pipeline.This foray into finance comes as X has already committed to introducing X Money, a digital wallet and peer-to-peer payment service, with Visa as its initial partner later this year. Yaccarino confirmed that X Money will debut in the US first before a global rollout. The service aims to enable users to purchase merchandise, store value and tip creators directly on the platform.""A whole commerce ecosystem and a financial ecosystem is going to emerge on the platform that does not exist today,"" she emphasised.The platform's pivot to new revenue streams comes as it continues to struggle with financial headwinds. Since Elon Musk's $44 billion acquisition of Twitter in 2022, when it was rebranded as X, the company has seen a mass exodus of advertisers – its primary source of revenue.","Social media platform X (formerly Twitter) is moving aggressively into financial services.

Google never silenced Geoffrey Hinton, but self-censorship kicked in

""We would never accept this mindset in any other field""

Geoffrey Hinton , who's known as the "" Godfather of AI ,"" has revealed the internal pressures that influenced his decision to leave Google after more than a decade, citing self-censorship concerns that prevented him from speaking freely about artificial intelligence dangers .Speaking on the ""Diary of a CEO"" podcast that aired June 16, Hinton explained how corporate loyalty created an unspoken barrier to discussing AI risks. ""If you work for a big company, you don't feel right saying things that will damage the big company,"" he said, describing the psychological constraint he faced while employed at Google.The neural network pioneer, who quit Google in 2023, emphasized that the tech giant never directly pressured him to remain silent about AI safety issues. ""Google encouraged me to stay and work on AI safety, and said I could do whatever I liked on AI safety,"" Hinton noted. However, he admitted that employees naturally ""censor yourself"" when working for major corporations.Hinton's departure came as he grew increasingly concerned about AI's potential dangers, including the spread of misinformation, job displacement, and what he termed ""existential risk"" from digital intelligence surpassing human capabilities. His concerns intensified after Microsoft integrated ChatGPT into its search engine, prompting Google to accelerate its own AI chatbot development.The 75-year-old researcher's warnings align with broader industry concerns about AI safety protocols. Hinton highlighted the particular challenge of AI-generated content, noting that people ""will not be able to discern what is true any more"" as realistic fake photos, videos, and text flood the internet.His departure underscores a growing tension in the tech industry between rapid AI advancement and safety considerations. While praising Google's overall responsible behavior, Hinton's exit reflects the complex dynamics facing AI researchers who must balance corporate interests with public safety concerns in an increasingly competitive landscape.","Geoffrey Hinton, known as the "" Godfather of AI,"" left Google in 2023.

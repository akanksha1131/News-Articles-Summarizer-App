"Google CEO Sundar Pichai to employees in internal memo: Whoever wins US elections, ""... let's remember the role ...""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-to-employees-in-internal-memo-whoever-wins-us-elections-lets-remember-the-role-/articleshow/115000049.cms,"Google CEO Sundar Pichai urged employees to ensure their platforms provide reliable election information. This follows accusations of bias from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who claims Google suppresses positive news about him. Pichai emphasized Google's commitment to delivering accurate election-related resources and highlighted their global efforts in supporting elections.

Here’s the full memo sent by Sundar Pichai

Hi Googlers,

Tomorrow is election day here and many in the U.S. will be heading to the polls to vote for everything from school board to judges to the Congress and President.

Teams across Google and YouTube have been working hard to make sure our platforms provide voters with high-quality and reliable information, just as we’ve done for so many other elections around the world — in fact, dozens of countries have held major, hotly contested elections this year, from France to India to the UK to Mexico and many more, with well over a billion people casting votes in 2024.

We should be proud of our work, and also of our teams’ efforts to keep campaigns secure, to deliver accurate information on where and how to vote, and to provide digital advertising solutions to campaigns. Thanks to everyone working around the clock on these efforts throughout the campaign season and as votes are tallied.

As with other elections, the outcome will be a major topic of conversation in living rooms and other places around the world. And of course, the outcome will have important consequences.

Whomever the voters entrust, let’s remember the role we play at work, through the products we build and as a business: to be a trusted source of information to people of every background and belief. We will and must maintain that. In that spirit, it’s important that everyone continue to follow our Community Guidelines and Personal Political Activity Policy.

Beyond election day, our work to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful will continue. Al has given us a profound opportunity to make progress on that mission, build great products and partnerships, drive innovation, and make significant contributions to national and local economies. Our company is at its best when we’re focused on that.

Thanks, Sundar

Google CEO Sundar Pichai has reportedly told employees across Google and YouTube s ahead of the US Election Day to “make sure our platforms provide voters with high-quality and reliable information”. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has accused Google of bias. Trump, in September alleged that the search giant only shows “bad stories about him”. Google has refuted these claims.First reported by The Washing Post, the CEO has sent an internal memo to its employee. In the memo obtained by The Verge, Pichai said that “We should be proud of our work, and also of our teams’ efforts to keep campaigns secure, to deliver accurate information on where and how to vote, and to provide digital advertising solutions to campaigns.” Pichai also stated that “Al has given us a profound opportunity to make progres” to make information universally accessible.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai sent memo to employees ahead of US Election Day.

Google wins case over gift card scam dating back to 2015,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-wins-case-over-gift-card-scam-dating-back-to-2015/articleshow/114991781.cms,"What is Google Play gift card scam and why the company was sued

Google has won a lawsuit over Google Play gift card scams with a judge ruling that the tech company is not liable for losses incurred by such fraud. A lawsuit claimed that the search giant illegally profited from gift card scams by refusing to refund victims.Citing a decision by US District Judge Beth Labson Freeman, news agency Reuters reported that the plaintiff, Judy May, has failed to demonstrate that Google caused her losses or knowingly received stolen funds. May lost $1,000 in a scam where she was tricked into buying Google Play gift cards.The judge also determined that Google was not liable for retaining its standard commissions –15% to 30% – on purchases made with the gift cards, as this practice was unrelated to the initial fraud.While Freeman dismissed the lawsuit, she granted May the option to refile her case. However, a claim for triple damages was permanently dismissed, the report said.A class action lawsuit against Google was filed earlier this year, alleging that the tech giant illegally profited from gift card scams by refusing to refund victims.The lawsuit stemmed from a $1,000 loss suffered by Indiana resident Judy May, who fell victim to a scammer posing as a relative. The scammer convinced May to purchase Google Play gift cards under the pretence of securing federal grant money. May provided the gift card codes to the scammer, who then used them to make purchases.A class action complaint claimed that “over nearly a decade, Google has knowingly kept millions of dollars in stolen money from victims of gift card scams who purchased Google Play gift cards.”The lawsuit argued that Google should have warned consumers about scams on gift card packaging andthat anyone demanding payment with the cards was a scammer. She also accused the company of profiting from the fraudulent activity by keeping commissions on purchases made with stolen gift cards.","Judy May lost $1,000 in a scam where she was tricked into buying Google Play gift cards.

"How Lina Khan, for whom Elon Musk wrote she ""will be fired soon"" became a hot topic of the US election",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-lina-khan-for-whom-elon-musk-wrote-she-will-be-fired-soon-became-a-hot-topic-of-the-us-election/articleshow/114992362.cms,"Why many companies are unhappy with Lina Khan

In the lead-up to the election, Lina Khan , chair of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), has faced criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. Prominent Democratic donors, including billionaires Reid Hoffman, Barry Diller, and Mark Cuban, have called for her removal from the agency. More recently, a report from the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee accused her of pursuing a far-left agenda and weaponizing the FTC. Elon Musk, the biggest supporter of Donald Trump 's in Silicon Valley, wrote on Twitter that Khan ""will be fired soon.""A report in the New York Times talks about how Khan, nominated in 2021 by President Joe Biden , became one of the hottest topics of the US Elections 2024. At 35, she is the youngest-ever chairman of FTC.She reportedly has become a focal point of bipartisan attention. This level of scrutiny is said to be unusual for a leader of the FTC, which typically operates under the radar while regulating companies that undermine competition. The NYT report said that the intense focus on Khan reflects the high stakes of the Biden administration's efforts to curb the power of America's largest corporations, a programme that could be reversed by the next president.Dwelling further the report adds that FTC and Justice Department scrutiny has led to the collapse of several major corporate deals, with lawsuits potentially breaking up big brands like Google, Amazon, and Ticketmaster's parent company. Khan has advocated for regulating artificial intelligence, ordered companies to simplify online subscription cancellations, and banned noncompete agreements that prevent workers from joining rival employers.The business community and its Washington allies have fiercely opposed Khan's actions. Representative James Comer, R-Ky., reportedly criticized her leadership, claiming she would stop at nothing to achieve the radical left's goals. Amazon and Meta have called for her recusal from investigations and lawsuits due to her previous criticisms. Lobbying groups have complained that her actions are chilling the economy.In a September interview with The New York Times, Khan acknowledged the criticism but dismissed much of it, emphasizing the importance of considering diverse voices and keeping the entire country in mind. She expressed uncertainty about her future in a ""60 Minutes"" interview, stating it would be an honor to continue in her role.Many observers expect Trump to replace Khan if he wins the election, as presidents typically appoint leaders from their own party to agencies like the FTC. Former FTC chair Bill Kovacic believes Khan's tenure would be short-lived under a Trump administration. Khan's fate under Vice President Kamala Harris is less certain, as her term expired in September. The next president could replace her by appointing a new chair or designating one of the other commissioners.Khan, who gained prominence as a scholar advocating for stricter antitrust laws against companies like Amazon, became the youngest leader of the FTC in its history. She revived an FTC lawsuit to break up Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, and sued Amazon for allegedly monopolizing online retail. The FTC also unsuccessfully attempted to block Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard and is fighting to block Kroger's $24.6 billion acquisition of Albertsons.","Lina Khan, 35, is the youngest-ever chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.

Harris enjoys support from figures like Mark Cuban and Sheryl Sandberg, while Elon Musk and Peter Thiel rally behind Trump.

The United States is witnessing one of the most tightly contested elections in recent history. Analysts suggest a near photo finish between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Some have even hinted that national polls may see a near tie, with slight variations between states. The US election 2024 is widely regarded as one of the most divisive in American history. Both Harris and Trump have repeatedly warned against potentially catastrophic consequences if the other is elected. Voters too are said to hold vastly different views on key issues such as the economy, immigration, and abortion rights. As the elections reach the finishing line, here's a look at the biggest supporters of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in Silicon Valley, as well as those who didn't openly share their allegiance with either of them.Tech entrepreneur Mark Cuban, widely known for his role as a judge on the reality show Shark Tank, has publicly endorsed Kamala Harris, citing her non-ideological stance. Cuban, who supported Trump in 2015, believes a second Trump administration would be detrimental to small businesses.Another staunch supporter of Kamala Harris is Vinod Khosla. The prominent Silicon Valley investor with stakes in startups like DoorDash, Stripe, and Instacart has openly declared his support for Harris.Facebook's former COO Sheryl Sandberg endorsed Harris shortly after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race. Sandberg praised Harris as an accomplished leader and a strong advocate for abortion rights, expressing her excitement to support her.Reed Hastings, Netflix executive chairman, has contributed over $7 million to Harris' presidential campaign through a super political action committee (PAC).LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman joined 88 business leaders in signing an open letter supporting Harris for the presidency.Though OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has not publicly endorsed any candidate, but the Harris Victory Fund reportedly received a donation from him, according to Fortune.On the other hand, tech mogul and the world's richest man Elon Musk has emerged as a significant supporter of Donald Trump in this election. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who refrained from endorsing anyone in 2020, is now actively campaigning for Trump both on the ground and on X, the platform he owns. Musk has expressed willingness to lead a government department if Trump wins and has voiced concerns about potential imprisonment if Harris becomes president.Musk has used his wealth to influence the election, including a $1 million daily giveaway to a random person in a swing state, which the US Department of Justice argued was illegal. However, a district court in Pennsylvania declined to block the giveaway.PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, a major investor in Facebook, has stated he will vote for Trump but will not contribute financially to his campaign. Thiel remains strongly pro-Trump and pro-JD, supporting them in other ways.Marc Andreesen and Ben Horowitz, leaders of one of Silicon Valley's largest venture capital firms, are backing Trump, criticizing the Biden administration for over-regulation and taxation, as reported by TechCrunch.Former head of Sequoia Capital Douglas Leone is also supporting Trump, expressing concerns about the country's direction, immigration system, deficit, and foreign policy.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Facebook parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Apple CEO Tim Cook have not openly endorsed any candidate as the next US President.","The 2024 US election sees Silicon Valley divided, with prominent figures backing either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump.

No Diwali cheer in India's smartwatch market; Apple and Samsung the only exceptions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/no-diwali-cheer-in-indias-smartwatch-market-apple-and-samsung-the-only-exceptions/articleshow/114981753.cms,"A Sectoral Slowdown

Apple and Samsung seeing growth

India's wearable market, particularly mass-segment smartwatches, has faced a significant downturn over the past year, despite the festive season's traditional boost. This trend is reflected in the financial performance of two of the major players like Boat and Boult. According to a report in Economic Times, ""The festive season failed to arrest a downturn in India’s wearables market, particularly mass-segment smartwatches, over the last 12-15 months even as its impact has become visible in the financials of device makers.""Warburg Pincus-backed Boat, while reducing its losses by 48%, saw a decline in its FY24 revenue. Conversely, Boult witnessed a halving of its profits due to increased spending on growth initiatives.The broader wearables segment, encompassing wireless audio devices and smartwatches, experienced a 10% year-on-year decline in shipments during the April-June quarter. This downturn, attributed to cautious inventory management and fewer new product launches, has disproportionately affected the smartwatch category. The homegrown wearable and audio products firm recorded a 5% decline in revenue for the fiscal year ended March 2024 to Rs 3,122 crore.Anshika Jain, senior research analyst at data analytics firm Counterpoint, told Economic Times, “During this festive period, India’s smartwatch sales have remained sluggish, extending the downward trend from the previous quarter.” “We anticipate a double-digit year-over-year decline in sales, attributed to limited discounts and changing consumer behaviour,” she added.A 30% decline is anticipated in smartwatch shipments in the September quarter, she said. “Consumers are not replacing smartwatches as quickly as the industry had anticipated,” Jain said, adding that this led to inventory pile-up of these products. Industry analysts predict a continued decline in smartwatch shipments, particularly in the mass-market segment.The audio products category appears to be better. Here the mass market managed to sustain growth. The true wireless(TWS) audio segment, dominated by wireless earphones and headsets, remains a bright spot. Companies are focusing on introducing advanced features like active noise cancellation at more affordable price points to drive growth. Offline expansion and the emergence of quick commerce channels are playing a crucial role in shaping the wearable market. Companies like Boult are leveraging these channels to boost sales and reach a wider audience.While the mass market is seeing growth pains, the premium segment, driven by new releases from Samsung and Apple, is expected to witness substantial growth. ""The premium segment is projected to experience significant growth, fuelled by new releases from Samsung and Apple, along with discounts on older models,” Jain said.","Boat, while reducing its losses by 48%, saw a decline in its FY24 revenue.

Sony sues CBS; blames job cuts at Paramount Global for ‘dismal performance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sony-sues-cbs-blames-job-cuts-at-paramount-global-for-dismal-performance/articleshow/114981717.cms,"Sony Pictures Television has filed a lawsuit against CBS Studios, alleging the network has failed to maximise revenues and engaged in self-dealing in its distribution of popular game shows ""Jeopardy!"" and ""Wheel of Fortune.""The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, claims CBS has made over $1 billion in profit from a 35-year distribution agreement while undervaluing the shows' licensing fees and advertising potential. Sony argues that CBS's recent corporate restructuring and layoffs have severely impacted its ability to properly distribute the programs.According to the complaint, CBS entered unauthorised international distribution deals in Australia and New Zealand, pocketing $3.6 million in fees without proper compensation to Sony. The studio also alleges CBS has been licensing the shows domestically below market value and bundling them with less popular CBS-owned programs like ""The Hot Bench"" and ""The Drew Barrymore Show.""Sony claims that when it became directly involved in negotiations with ABC stations, licensing fees grew by 17%, compared to CBS' projected flat to 2% growth. The lawsuit cites recent layoffs at CBS parent Paramount Global , which eliminated 2,800 positions, as contributing to ""dismal performance"" in fulfilling distribution obligations.CBS strongly denied the allegations in a statement, saying it has been an ""accomplished distribution partner and thoughtful steward"" for both shows over 40 years. The network argues it holds perpetual distribution rights and claims Sony ""simply doesn't like the deal the parties agreed to decades ago.""","Sony Pictures Television has filed a lawsuit against CBS Studios.

The 2024 Nvidia AI Summit in Mumbai saw Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar rubbing shoulders with Jensen Huang , CEO of AI giant Nvidia. While the summit focused on strengthening India's AI capabilities, their encounter ended with a surprising discussion – martial arts.Kumar, a known martial arts enthusiast, shared a photo on social media X, formerly known as Twitter, where he and Huang pose playfully in a fighting stance. The caption reads: ""Imagine meeting the world’s biggest authority on Artificial Intelligence and ending up chatting about martial arts!! What an amazing man you are Mr. #JensenHuang. Now I know why @nvidia is the absolute giant that it is. 😊👍🏻""Nvidia's leather-jacket-clad CEO Huang got a rock star welcome at the company's AI summit in India. As a Bloomberg report said, ""The reception Huang received in India's commercial capital Mumbai was reminiscent of the ""Jensanity"" seen in other parts of the world, especially Taiwan, as his popularity climbs with Nvidia's soaring earnings and multi-trillion dollar market valuation.""Huang praised India's rapid digitalisation and its potential in the AI sector. ""Very few countries have this amazing natural resource called IT and computer science expertise,"" he said.The event, where the U.S. company unveiled plans to supply Reliance Industries and other Indian firms with its AI chips, had to be reportedly delayed for more than half an hour due to the crowd that one Nvidia employee said was ""easily a few thousand"".Nvidia CEO Huang and Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced a strategic partnership to build state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India at the summit. The collaboration aims to accelerate India's transformation into a global AI powerhouse by leveraging the nation's vast talent pool and burgeoning digital infrastructure. ""We are among the only countries where the average age of 1.4 billion people is below 35,"" he noted. Ambani emphasised that India's aspirations, combined with the visionary leadership of the Indian Prime Minister, have set the stage for a digital revolution.

Financial Pressures

Competition Heats Up

Chinese giant Alibaba Group has laid off a significant number of employees at Yuanjing, its division dedicated to the Metaverse. This move signals a scaling back of the company's ambitions in the virtual world, according to sources cited by the South China Morning Post.The layoffs are reported to be part of a broader restructuring effort focused on optimizing efficiency within Alibaba. Established in 2021, Yuanjing aimed to capitalize on the Metaverse's potential, joining other Chinese tech giants like Tencent, ByteDance, Kuaishou, and Li Auto in the race to explore this virtual space.Incidentally, Alibaba's scaling back of its metaverse ambitions isn't an isolated event. It reflects a trend within the global tech industry where companies are reevaluating their investments in the nascent metaverse space.The recent layoffs, first reported by Chinese media on November 1, affect operations in Shanghai and Hangzhou. This isn't Alibaba's first workforce reduction – in February 2023, the company let go of over 4,000 employees. The year before, a larger workforce reduction of approximately 19,000 employees took place as Alibaba adapted to a challenging global economic climate and prioritized cost-efficiency.Alibaba's recent financial performance has also played a role in the metaverse retreat. The company missed market expectations for its first-quarter revenue in August 2024. This shortfall reflects declining domestic e-commerce sales as Chinese consumers tighten their spending due to a faltering economy.Alibaba also faces intense competition from rivals like JD.com and discount-oriented retail platforms such as Pinduoduo (PDD Holdings) and Douyin (owned by ByteDance). The company's revenue of 243.24 billion yuan ($33.98 billion) for the quarter ending June 30th, 2024 fell short of analysts' expectations, highlighting the competitive landscape of the Chinese tech industry.","Alibaba Group has laid off a significant number of employees at Yuanjing, its division dedicated to the Metaverse.

Thank you ... and to new beginnings

After over six wonderful years with Xiaomi India, I will be stepping down from my role as the President of Xiaomi India at the end of this year. My journey with Xiaomi has been an incredibly fulfilling learning experience, and I look forward to creating more value and impact by dedicating my time to academics and research.

I will pursue my research interests in consumer behaviour on technology platforms as part of the Executive Doctorate program at the Indian School of Business (ISB) and help drive synergies between the world of the practitioner of business and that of the academician. Additionally, I will continue to support the company as an Independent Strategic Advisor.

Reflecting on my journey with Xiaomi, I feel immense gratitude. We have created something truly special—a brand that connects with hundreds of millions of people across India, supported by a team that embodies Xiaomi's values of passion, innovation, and sincerity. Throughout this journey, our team's dedication, fans' enthusiasm, and partners' support have continually inspired me. Together, we've reached milestones that once seemed unattainable.

As I begin this next chapter, I feel encouraged knowing that a world-class leadership team guides Xiaomi India. I am confident that the leadership and the entire team will pursue our shared vision with the same commitment and excellence that define Xiaomi India. The organisation's vision of #10YearsofTomorrow will continue to inspire everyone, and I am excited to see how far and high it takes the business.

As I sign off, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to my family for being my strongest support pillars, to the leadership team at Xiaomi for their belief in me, and to my teammates for making this experience so special. So many individuals have contributed to making this journey unforgettable. You know who you are, and I sincerely thank you for the difference you have made in my life.

With immense gratitude, Murali

How Tamil Rockers make illegal copies of new movies



How this piracy website is a concern for the film industry



Jeb Stephen Raj, one of the key the administrator of the notorious piracy website Tamil Rockers , has confessed to illegally recording movies in theatres during a police investigation. Raj, arrested in July for illegally recording the film ""Raayan,"" revealed the tactics he and his team used to capture and distribute pirated movies. Raj was caught in Thiruvananthapuram using a mobile phone hidden in a theatre seat cup holder to record Dhanush's 50th film. His confession sheds light on the methods employed by piracy groups to obtain and distribute copyrighted content illegally.The accused, who had been illegally recording new movie releases in theatres for years, confessed to his methods during the investigation. He revealed that his team would book five tickets on the first day of release, strategically positioning themselves in the middle seat. Under the cover of a blanket, they would use a hidden camera to record the film, receiving Rs 5,000 for each recording. This operation spanned theatres across Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka.Piracy websites like these hurt the film industry with significant financial losses caused by unlawful distribution. Tamil Rockers, the notorious piracy website that has plagued the film industry for years by rapidly uploading new movies and making them available on the internet within a few hours after their theatre release.Despite numerous attempts to crack down on the operation, details about the group remained elusive until a successful police operation in Thiruvananthapuram in July led to the arrest of one of the key administrators of the site.While the arrest of Jeb Stephen Raj is a significant blow to Tamil Rockers, authorities believe he is not the main administrator, and the fight against the piracy network continues. This was evident after Rajinikanth's new movie ""Vettaiyan"" was leaked on the same day as its theatrical release.

Donald Trump’s comments spark concerns



What experts say

With immigration being an heated issue in the US presidential election, the face-off between Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris could have significant implications for Indian IT firms. From H-1B visa policies to outsourcing regulations, each candidate brings a different stance that could impact India’s tech giants. While both parties continue to debate policies around skilled labor, the impact on Indian IT firms and software engineers might be less drastic than anticipated, says a report by Money Control.H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to hire foreign workers for specialized roles in fields like Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM), and IT. Leading Indian IT firms—such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCL Technologies, and Wipro—rely on these visas to send employees to client sites in the US.Recent remarks by Republican candidates, including presidential nominee Donald Trump, have sparked concerns about the potential impact on Indian IT professionals, many of whom depend on H-1B visas.Daniel Kotchen, Partner, of US-based Kotchen & Low LLP, told the publication “I would expect no significant change to visa rules if Donald Trump wins the election. Since at least 2005, no President has taken a leadership role in curbing rampant abuses of the H-1B visa program, including Donald Trump when he served as President”.US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) president and chief executive officer Mukesh Aghi said “Demand for these workers is very high and the current rules constrain the supply side. There is enough momentum between Democrats and Republicans to solve this issue because business people are crying that we don't have skilled resources”.Poorvi Chothani, founder and managing partner at immigration law firm LawQuest said “If either of them comes into power, there will be changes expected. Though Kamala Harris won’t mess with H-1B visas too much.”","H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to hire foreign workers for specialized roles.

Apple wants its employees to share feedback

Apple is reportedly exploring new ways to provide augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) content to its users. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple is conducting a new internal study focusing on building smart glasses. As per the report, the group responsible for the initiative wrote an email to selected employees confirming the studies on products in this segment.The initiative is called ‘Atlas’ and started last week. The email, sent to select Apple employees reads “Testing and developing products that all can come to love is very important to what we do at Apple. This is why we are looking for participants to join us in an upcoming user study with current market smart glasses”.The study suggests that Apple wants to push ahead with the idea of building its own smart glasses. Apple debuted the Vision Pro but it isn’t a huge success.Earlier Gurman suggested that the tech giant is developing smart glasses and AirPods equipped with cameras, with a potential launch date of 2027, though this is subject to change. These new products would mark a significant expansion of Apple's vision-based technology. The smart glasses are anticipated to be similar to Meta's Ray-Ban Stories, offering built-in cameras, speakers, and microphones. This could potentially allow users to capture photos and videos, make calls, and interact with AR experiences overlaid on the real world.","Apple is reportedly exploring new ways to provide augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) content to its users.

Airtel, Reliance Jio, Vodafone-Idea: Who owes how much

Bharti Airtel has reportedly urged the Department of Telecommunications DoT ) to ensure a level playing field for all telecom operators. According to a report in Economic Times, the letter comes as the government considers Vodafone-Idea 's (Vi) plea for a waiver of bank guarantees (BGs) on spectrum payments.In the letter to DoT, Airtel said that it supports the proposed waiver, but any regulatory reform must have a ""non-discriminatory"" framework across all telcos, without considerations such as the financial health of particular operators. The ET report says quoting officials aware of the matter.Airtel reportedly highlights its own significant spectrum acquisitions and the subsequent BG obligations, arguing for a consistent regulatory framework. Vodafone-Idea, grappling with financial challenges, has sought government intervention to alleviate its burden and secure additional credit from banks. The proposed BG waiver would provide much-needed relief for the struggling telco.Airtel telco reportedly cited the 2021 telecom reforms which treated all the telecom players equally with no special benefit to any one company.Earlier this year, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), representing all private telcos, too had written to the DoT, seeking to do away with the need of BGs for auctions conducted before 2022. The DoT is currently reviewing the BG waiver proposal, with a draft cabinet note suggesting a potential compromise. Under this proposal, telcos could opt for a BG waiver in exchange for pre-paying three additional months of spectrum payments.The amount of Reliance Jio's annual bank guarantee (BG) requirement for past auctions could be to the tune of Rs 4,000 crore while the amount for Airtel could be around Rs 3,000 crore. Both the companies have been clearing past spectrum dues by pre-paying instalments in a bid to save interest costs. Having raised Rs 24,000 crore via equity, Vodafone-Idea now wants to raise Rs 25,000 crore more via loans and another Rs 10,000 crore in BGs or letters of credit to continue its capital expenditure to compete effectively against Airtel and Reliance Jio.",Bharti Airtel has reportedly urged the Department of Telecommunications DoT ) to ensure a level playing field for all telecom operators.

Mandeep Manocha is co-founder and CEO of Cashify, a leading online marketplace for refurbished electronics . With over 12 years at the helm, Mandeep has guided Cashify 's growth Prior to Cashify, he founded and led ZazzyBox and Manak Waste Management. His experience also includes a stint in investment banking at Lehman Brothers. Mandeep holds a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from Panjab University. In an interaction with Times of India, Mandeep talked about Cashify's growth over the years, refurbished market and importance of sustainability. Excerpts:We started in 2013-2014, Our motivation was simple: we were driven by the idea of preventing e-waste. We saw a huge opportunity to extend the life of used devices. My co-founders and I come from a waste management background. We started a company in 2009 and spent a significant amount of time on actual waste management projects, including setting up and running a plastic and rubber waste recycling factory for two or three years. We became interested in electronic waste, but we realized that e-waste isn't really e-waste until it sits unused in your house.There were two reasons: First, we believe that our consumers are everywhere. They're both online and offline. Second, because we buy used devices, we refurbish and resell them. We realized about four years ago that trust was missing in the refurbished space. To build trust, we needed a physical touch-and-feel store where people could experience the phones firsthand. Every phone we sell could be different, so having a physical store helps people build trust. These offline stores also serve as service centers. At Cashify, we are also investing in technology to further streamline our operations and enhance the customer experience.As for numbers, our stores are spread across the top 90 cities in the country. We have stores in all major cities like Bangalore, Delhi, etc., as well as smaller cities like Agra, Meerut, and other tier two and tier three cities.Yes, one can. But, we accept devices up to a certain age. For older devices, we offer a recycling program. This means that we will take your old, but we may not be able to give you a value for it. We have a service where we will pick it up from your doorstep, send it to an authorized e-waste recycler, and send you a certificate of destruction via email.Right now, we only do it for phones. We will be launching laptop recycling soon.Our core mission is to extend the life of devices, reducing the need for new production and minimizing e-waste. By refurbishing and reselling, we aim to contribute to a more sustainable future. We are also exploring initiatives like recycling programs and partnerships with brands to promote e-waste awareness. Cashify is committed to making a positive impact on the environment and providing affordable, high-quality devices to its customers. By choosing refurbished, you're not just saving money but also contributing to a greener future. We work with all OEMs in the country. Whichever OEM you name, we are there at the backend.Interestingly, it's benefited us. People are opting for refurbished devices as a more affordable alternative. We have seen a surge in demand for our refurbished products.We have our own state-of-the-art facility in Noida where we refurbish devices. Our expert technicians meticulously inspect and repair each device. We wanted to have one concentrated facility because refurbishing operations cannot be run in a very decentralized manner. Managing spare parts is a huge challenge. Noida has all those phone manufacturers, trained manpower, and spare parts easily available. Cashify also offers warranties on our refurbished products, it ranges from six to twelve months, depending on the model.We work closely with major retailers to provide buyback and refurbished device solutions. This includes partnerships with OEMs and retailers like Croma, Vijay Sales, Reliance Digital, and Apple authorized resellers.I wouldn't say it's the biggest season, but it's definitely a good one. We see a significant spike in the number of old phones coming to us. During that one month, the inflow of devices increases by at least 3-4 times.Yes, I recommend that people sell their devices as soon as they buy a new one. People often think they'll use their old device as a spare or hand it down, but that doesn't usually happen. They end up putting it in a drawer. Ideally, you should sell it immediately when you upgrade so you can get the best value. If you keep it in a drawer, it will eventually become e-waste and you won't get anything for it. These are valuable resources that are lying unused in people's homes. By selling them, you can extend their life and make them available to others. We've seen that this brings happiness to a lot of people. People are happy to buy an old iPhone 11 or iPhone 12 at a lower price. I've seen people from various demographics who are thrilled to get a phone like that for 25,000 rupees, which they couldn't afford new.","Mandeep Manocha is co-founder and CEO of Cashify, a leading online marketplace for refurbished electronics.

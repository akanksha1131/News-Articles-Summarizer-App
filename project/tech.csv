Amazon secures a big win as Nike returns to Amazon after more than 5 years: What this means for Nike fans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-secures-a-big-win-as-nike-returns-to-amazon-after-more-than-5-years-what-this-means-for-nike-fans/articleshow/121347911.cms,"What is changing with Nike coming to Amazon

Why Nike coming to Amazon is a win for the etailer

In a significant shift in strategy, sportswear behemoth Nike will reportedly once again sell its products directly on Amazon in the United States. According to a report in CNBC, this marks the end of a six-year hiatus that began in 2019 when the sneaker giant ceased its wholesale relationship with the e-commerce platform. According to CNBC report, Nike's decision to pull its products from Amazon stemmed from a company-wide initiative to bolster its direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels and gain greater control over the brand experience. At the time, Nike joined a growing list of prominent brands, including popular shoemaker Birkenstock, in expressing concerns about the proliferation of counterfeit goods on Amazon's extensive third-party marketplace.However, the landscape appears to have shifted. A Nike spokesperson, in a statement obtained by CNBC, reportedly indicated a renewed focus on reaching consumers across various shopping channels. ""We are investing in our marketplace to bring more products and services to consumers wherever and however they choose to shop,"" the Nike spokesperson stated. ""This includes expanding to new digital accounts, including Amazon in the U.S., new physical partners like Printemps, elevating retail experiences across the marketplace, and launching Nike’s AI powered conversational search to improve our online services.""Amazon also confirmed the development to CNBC via email, stating that it will ""soon begin sourcing a much wider range of Nike products directly to expand our selection for U.S. customers.""Prior to this agreement, a limited selection of Nike merchandise was accessible on Amazon through independent third-party sellers. Notably, Nike was designated as a ""Gated"" brand on the platform, a measure implemented by Amazon to significantly restrict the sale of counterfeit and substandard items. Other prominent brands like Apple and L’Oreal also fall under this Gated category.Acknowledging the impact on existing sellers, an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC, ""We value independent sellers, and we’re providing an extended period of time for the small number of sellers affected to sell through their inventory of overlapping items.""This renewed partnership represents a significant victory for Amazon, which has been actively pursuing collaborations with more premium and high-end brands to enhance its platform's offerings. Amazon initially achieved success in the online apparel market by offering a broad spectrum of basic goods from well-known brands, alongside its own private labels. In recent years, the e-commerce giant has strategically moved towards the luxury sector, evidenced by the launch of online luxury fashion shops. Just last month, Amazon unveiled a dedicated storefront in partnership with Saks Fifth Avenue, showcasing a curated selection of luxury brands, including Dolce & Gabbana.The return of Nike to Amazon's direct sales channel signals a potential shift in the dynamics of online retail, highlighting the continued importance of reaching a vast consumer base through major platforms while potentially indicating increased confidence in Amazon's measures to combat counterfeit products.",Nike will reportedly once again sell its products directly on Amazon in the United States.

The BIG fallout between Elon Musk and Donald Trump's key cabinet members: What reportedly went wrong making Tesla CEO exit Washington DC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-big-fallout-between-elon-musk-and-donald-trumps-key-cabinet-members-what-reportedly-went-wrong-making-tesla-ceo-exit-washington-dc/articleshow/121347037.cms,"Public Fight in the West Wing

Elon Musk’s Struggles with Policy and Spending Cuts

Growing Frustration Among Cabinet Members with Elon Musk and DOGE

Tensions between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and key members of President Donald Trump’s cabinet have escalated dramatically, culminating in a profanity-laced confrontation in the West Wing that reverberated through the halls of the Oval Office, according to a detailed report by The Atlantic. The incident underscores a deepening rift between Musk and Trump’s inner circle, as frustrations mount over Musk’s influence and approach to government reform. "" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was shouting at Elon Musk in the halls of the West Wing last month, loud enough for Donald Trump to hear and in a language that he could certainly understand. Bessent and Musk were fighting over which of them should choose the next IRS leader—and, implicitly, over Musk’s bureaucracy-be-damned crusade. ...The fight had started outside the Oval Office; it continued past the Roosevelt Room and toward the chief of staff’s office, and then barreled around the corner to the national security adviser’s warren,"" reads the report.The flashpoint occurred when Musk attempted to install Gary Shapley, a controversial former IRS agent known for leaking details about Hunter Biden’s tax affairs, as the head of the IRS without consulting Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. According to The Atlantic, Bessent erupted in anger, shouting, “F*** you!” at Musk multiple times, loud enough for President Trump to hear from inside the Oval Office. The confrontation highlighted Musk’s tendency to bypass traditional chains of command, a move that infuriated Bessent, who saw it as an overreach into his domain.Musk fired back, labeling Bessent a “Soros agent” and mocking his past in the hedge fund industry, accusing him of running “a failed hedge fund,” as reported by The Independent. The public nature of the argument, set against the backdrop of the White House, amplified its significance and exposed the growing discord within Trump’s administration.Musk, who entered the administration with ambitious promises to slash $2 trillion in federal spending through his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative, has faced significant hurdles. The Atlantic notes that Musk recently admitted these efforts have been “really, really difficult,” with bureaucratic resistance and legal challenges undoing many of his proposed cuts. “The system is designed to resist change,” Musk reportedly said, according to The Independent, reflecting his frustration with the slow pace of reform.Musk’s aggressive push for efficiency, including demands for weekly progress reports from federal agencies, has alienated some cabinet members. The Atlantic quoted one of Trump’s advisors as saying, “How many people were fired because they didn’t send in their three things a week or whatever the f*** it was?” The advisor’s exasperation reflects a broader sentiment that Musk’s methods are causing chaos rather than progress.The West Wing clash is not an isolated incident but part of a pattern of tensions between Musk and Trump’s cabinet. Earlier in March, Musk engaged in heated disputes with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, according to The Independent. These spats have fueled a sense of exasperation among Trump’s team, with some questioning Musk’s outsized role in the administration.The Atlantic reported one advisor stating, “I think that everyone is ready to move on from this part of the administration,” signaling a desire to distance the White House from Musk’s disruptive presence. The advisor’s comment underscores the growing perception that Musk’s influence, while initially welcomed for its boldness, has become a liability.The report adds that Musk’s role in the Trump’s administration was initially seen as a bold experiment, pairing a tech titan with a populist president to shake up Washington. However, his clashes with cabinet members and struggles to implement his vision have strained that","Tensions between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and key members of President Donald Trump’s cabinet have escalated dramatically.

Elon Musk is moving on, but DOGE stays

Elon Musk remains Donald Trump's Buddy No. 1

Steve Bannon , a prominent conservative commentator, claimed that “everything changed” for Elon Musk following President Donald Trump ’s public denial of a report suggesting Musk would receive a classified Pentagon briefing on potential U.S.-China conflict, as highlighted in an interview with The Atlantic. The report, initially published by The New York Times in March 2025, alleged that Musk was slated to be briefed on national security matters, including the possibility of war with China. This revelation sparked outrage among Democratic lawmakers, who raised concerns about national security risks and ethical conflicts due to Musk’s growing influence in Trump’s administration.Critics, including several congressional Democrats, argued that Musk’s role in the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), a Trump-led initiative aimed at streamlining federal operations and reducing government size, gave him unprecedented power. Some lawmakers, as reported by Politico, expressed alarm over Musk’s access to sensitive information, citing his business ties with China through Tesla’s Shanghai factory and SpaceX’s global operations. They called for stricter oversight of private sector involvement in government, with Senator Elizabeth Warren tweeting, “No unelected billionaire should wield this much influence over national security.”In response to the New York Times report, President Trump took to Truth Social, dismissing it as “fake news” and stating, “Elon is not going to the Pentagon, and China will not even be mentioned.” Bannon, speaking on his War Room podcast, described this moment as when the “fever broke” for Musk, marking a shift in his public role. According to The Atlantic, Musk began quietly distancing himself from his high-profile work with DOGE, redirecting his focus to his private ventures—Tesla, SpaceX, and Twitter.Musk confirmed this pivot in a post on Twitter, stating, “My priority is building the future with Tesla, SpaceX, and X. I’m stepping back from government involvement to focus on innovation.” He also announced a significant reduction in political donations, signaling a retreat from the political spotlight. Despite Musk’s withdrawal, DOGE remains active and DOGE employees will continue collaborating with Trump’s cabinet to advance the administration’s efficiency goals. ""The mission of DOGE—to cut waste, fraud, and abuse -- will surely continue,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the publication in an email. “DOGE employees who onboarded at their respective agencies will continue to work with President Trump’s cabinet to make our government more efficient.” she reportedly added.However, Musk’s ties to Trump have not entirely severed. In early May 2025, Musk accompanied Trump on a diplomatic trip to the Middle East, where they met with regional leaders, according to Reuters. Additionally, Musk was present during a White House meeting with Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, as noted in a Washington Post report, suggesting that Musk retains some advisory role, even if informal.","Steve Bannon, a prominent conservative commentator, claimed that “everything changed” for Elon Musk following President Donald Trump’s public denial of a report suggesting Musk would receive a classified Pentagon briefing.

"Apple's AirPlay system may have major security flaws that can allow hackers to hijack devices, researchers claim",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-airplay-may-have-major-security-flaws-that-can-allow-hackers-to-hijack-devices-researchers-claim/articleshow/121346229.cms,"Image credit: Oligo

Researchers share a video to show how this security flaw can affect users



“Because AirPlay is supported in such a wide variety of devices, there are a lot that will take years to patch — or they will never be patched. And it’s all because of vulnerabilities in one piece of software that affects everything,”

Apple’s popular AirPlay feature has been found to contain major security flaws that could leave users vulnerable to hackers, a report claims. Researchers at cybersecurity firm Oligo have discovered that these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to hijack compatible devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. AirPlay is a protocol that enables users to stream audio, video, or photos seamlessly from their Apple devices to other Apple devices or third-party gadgets that integrate the technology. A total of 23 vulnerabilities, collectively named “AirBorne,” were reportedly identified. These flaws were present in both Apple’s own AirPlay protocol and the AirPlay Software Development Kit (SDK), which third-party vendors use to make their devices compatible.In their video demonstration, the researchers showed how an attacker on the same network could exploit an AirPlay-enabled Bose speaker, launch a remote code execution (RCE) attack, and display the “AirBorne” logo on its screen. They warned that a similar technique could feasibly be used to infiltrate any microphone-equipped device for espionage purposes. In a statement to Wired, Oligo CTO Gal Elbaz said that the number of potentially vulnerable devices could be in the millions.Elbaz explained to Wired.Oligo also disclosed the vulnerabilities to Apple earlier and has been collaborating with the company for several months on patches before releasing their research to the public. Apple even issued updates addressing these issues in March for devices running iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, macOS Ventura 13.7.5, macOS Sonoma 14.7.5, macOS Sequoia 15.4, and visionOS 2.4.However, third-party products that implement the AirPlay protocol are still at risk, as manufacturers have to distribute their firmware updates for users to install to close the exposure.Meanwhile, Apple told Wired that while it has created patches for these third-party devices, it stressed that there are “limitations” to the attacks that would be possible on AirPlay-enabled devices due to the bugs.The researchers also noted that CarPlay-equipped systems remain at risk, since hackers can carry out an RCE attack if they are nearby and “the device has a default, predictable, or known Wi-Fi hotspot password.”","A total of 23 vulnerabilities, collectively named “AirBorne,’ were reportedly identified.

What comes next for Meta

Meta , the tech giant behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has requested a federal judge to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) high-profile antitrust case, just as the trial approaches a critical phase. According to the, the case, which began in early April, represents one of the most significant regulatory challenges faced by Meta in its history, potentially resulting in the breakup of the company’s social media empire.Meta's move to dismiss the case comes after the FTC rested its side of the argument, asserting that the company holds an illegal monopoly over the social networking market, particularly those platforms focused on friends-and-family connections. Meta, however, argues that the FTC's case is based on a flawed market definition and ignores the intense competition it faces from newer platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X (formerly known as Twitter).In a court filing late Thursday, Meta reiterated its stance that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standards required to prove its antitrust allegations. The company’s legal team argues that the FTC has fundamentally mischaracterized the social media market, claiming that the agency's definition is overly narrow and excludes significant competitors.“After five weeks of trial, it is clear that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standard required under antitrust law,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement on Friday. “Regardless, we will present our case to show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram competes with TikTok (and YouTube and X and many other apps).”Meta claims that it faces substantial competition from a wide range of digital platforms, including short-video giant TikTok, video-sharing platform YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X. These platforms, Meta argues, all compete for user engagement, advertising revenue, and market share, undercutting the FTC’s claim that Meta has maintained an unlawful monopoly.The FTC’s antitrust lawsuit, which was first filed in December 2020, centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The agency claims that Meta pursued a deliberate “buy or bury” strategy, acquiring these fast-growing competitors to neutralize potential threats to its dominant position in the social networking market.In its filing, the FTC pointed to internal Meta communications as evidence of this strategy. This includes a 2012 email from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggesting that buying Instagram would “neutralize a competitor.” The FTC further argues that these acquisitions reduced consumer choice and stifled innovation, limiting competition in the rapidly evolving social media industry.The FTC's case aims to convince U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to order Meta to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp, effectively dismantling the company's integrated social media ecosystem.Meta's defense in the trial has focused on presenting itself as a company that supports innovation and benefits consumers. In its Thursday filing, the company argued that its acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth, which in turn delivered significant benefits to users.“Meta’s acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth – with correspondingly massive benefits for US consumers,” the company stated in its court filing.However, the trial has also brought to light internal documents that may complicate Meta’s defense. For instance, a 2018 email from an unnamed Instagram executive warned that ""fake engagement could be in the range of 40%,"" potentially undermining Meta's claims about the platform’s integrity and user trust.Mark Zuckerberg himself was the first witness called by the FTC as the trial opened, highlighting the personal stakes for the Meta CEO. During his testimony, Zuckerberg sought to portray Meta as a company facing fierce competition, rather than a monopoly crushing potential rivals.Earlier in the trial, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom testified that he felt Zuckerberg viewed Instagram’s rapid growth as a potential threat to Facebook’s dominance after the acquisition, further fueling the FTC’s argument that Meta's mergers were designed to stifle competition.The 10-week non-jury trial, which is expected to conclude in June, will be followed by final briefs from both the FTC and Meta. If Judge Boasberg sides with the FTC, a second trial will be held to determine appropriate remedies, potentially including the forced divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp.Meta will continue presenting its defense when the trial resumes on Monday. The company’s attempt to dismiss the case outright remains a long shot, as the judge may choose to let the case proceed to its scheduled conclusion before issuing a ruling.","The FTC's antitrust lawsuit centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.

In a notable event at the Microsoft Build 2025 developer conference, Elon Musk , CEO of xAI and Tesla, joined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to announce the integration of xAI’s flagship Grok 3 AI models on Microsoft Azure. This announcement marks a significant step in the evolving artificial intelligence landscape, bringing together two major technology powerhouses. The Grok models will be accessible for free throughout June on the Azure AI Foundry platform, which also features AI offerings from industry leaders such as OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face.This collaboration highlights not only technological innovation but also the historical ties between Musk and Microsoft, recalling Musk’s early programming days as a Microsoft intern. This detailed report covers all aspects of the announcement, the technology behind Grok, the significance of this partnership, and the future prospects of AI development on Azure.During the Build conference, Satya Nadella took a moment to reflect on Elon Musk’s early career. Nadella reminded the audience of Musk’s internship at Microsoft, stating,Musk responded warmly, sharing memories of his beginnings before Windows with MS-DOS on the earliest IBM PCs. He highlighted the technological limitations of that era, recalling how memory upgrades from 128k to 256k were significant milestones. Musk also described programming video games in DOS and later working with Windows 3.1, emphasizing his foundational experience in software development which shaped his future ventures.The core of the announcement focused on the launch of Grok 3, xAI’s advanced family of AI models, now integrated with Microsoft Azure’s cloud infrastructure. Nadella introduced Grok as “a family of models that are both responsive and capable of reasoning,” expressing enthusiasm about its deployment on Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft’s AI platform that offers scalable, managed AI services to developers and enterprises worldwide.The availability of Grok 3 and Grok 3 Mini on Azure aims to broaden access to cutting-edge AI capabilities. Microsoft will provide these models with service-level agreements consistent with their other AI offerings, and billing will be streamlined through Microsoft’s standard Azure framework. This ensures ease of integration for enterprises already operating within the Azure ecosystem.Elon Musk elaborated on the forthcoming Grok 3.5 model during the conversation. He described it as an AI designed to “reason from first principles,” a philosophical approach emphasizing fundamental truths and axioms as the basis for knowledge and problem-solving. Musk explained that the model’s architecture is grounded in fundamental physics, allowing it to apply these principles across different reasoning domains with an aim to minimize error and approach accurate understanding.This emphasis on physics-based reasoning sets Grok apart from many AI models that rely primarily on pattern recognition and statistical inference. By integrating first-principles reasoning, Grok 3.5 aspires to provide more reliable, consistent outputs, potentially enhancing applications across diverse fields such as autonomous vehicles, space exploration, and customer service.The integration of Grok into Azure represents a strategic alliance that leverages Microsoft’s extensive cloud infrastructure and xAI’s innovative AI research. This collaboration extends the reach of Musk’s xAI beyond standalone systems, embedding it within one of the largest and most trusted cloud platforms globally.Azure AI Foundry already hosts models from major AI developers like OpenAI, Meta, and Hugging Face, making it a hub for AI innovation and adoption. Grok’s addition to this ecosystem reflects Microsoft’s commitment to providing diverse AI options to developers and enterprises.The partnership also comes amid industry discussions regarding the influence of large tech firms on AI development. Musk’s previous criticisms of Microsoft’s role in OpenAI’s operations add a layer of complexity to this collaboration, underscoring the nuanced relationships shaping the AI industry.Microsoft announced that Grok models will be available free of charge throughout June, allowing developers, researchers, and businesses to explore and experiment with xAI’s technology. This limited free access serves to increase adoption and foster community feedback, critical for refining AI capabilities and expanding real-world applications.Post-June, Grok’s services will continue under Microsoft’s commercial terms, integrated fully within the Azure billing and support system.

Schools won’t disappear, but their role will change: Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn



Duolingo CEO Luis von Ann recently predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) will fundamentally transform education, shifting the role of schools from traditional learning institutions to childcare and supervised spaces. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the No Priors podcast, von Ahn stressed on the fact that AI’s scalability makes it more efficient than human teachers and it can be easily used for personalised education. ""Education is going to change. It's just a lot more scalable to teach with AI than with teachers,” von Ahn said.Von Ahn suggests that AI will increasingly handle the core instruction in schools. He believes that AI can deliver personalised education more effectively than traditional classroom models with teachers. AI system can be designed to precisely track individual student progress, identify areas where they struggle and then tailor the learning experience accordingly.While Von Ahn does not believe schools will vanish, he foresees a future where AI tutors handle most of the teaching, while schools primarily serve as safe environments for children. He explained that AI can track individual student performance in real time, adjusting lesson plans to match each child’s learning pace—something human teachers struggle to do in large classrooms.“That doesn't mean the teachers are going to go away. You still need people to take care of the students. I also don't think schools are going to go away because you still need childcare,” von Ahn said on the podcast.This doesn't mean teachers will become obsolete, according to von Ahn. Instead, their responsibilities may evolve. Teachers could transition from primarily delivering instruction to supervising students, providing guidance, and fostering social and emotional development.Von Ahn also points out that the integration of AI in education is already happening. Duolingo, for example, is restructuring its operations to embrace an ""AI-first"" approach. This includes using AI for tasks previously done by contractors and incorporating AI into employee performance reviews.","Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn predicts that AI will transform education.

OpenAI partners with robotics startup Figure AI

At a time when companies like Elon Musk ’s Tesla are looking to offload some tasks on robots, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said that society is unprepared for the arrival of humanoid robots in everyday life — a development he believes is approaching rapidly.In an interview with Bloomberg aired this week, Altman said people are still focused on artificial intelligence's (AI) impact on desk-based jobs, such as programming and customer support. However, he warned that physical robots capable of performing real-world tasks may soon become part of daily life, and the public isn’t ready for it.""I don't think the world has really had the humanoid robots moment yet.

People are going to have a visceral reaction when they see robots doing things humans used to do,” he added.Recently, Musk shared a video on his handle on X, showcasing Tesla’s Optimus robot taking up tasks like throwing the trash away, cleaning a kitchen shelf and more.He captioned the video. “The biggest product ever.”Altman’s comments come after OpenAI partnered with Figure AI in February, a startup working on humanoid robots for practical roles in sectors like manufacturing, logistics, warehousing and retail. The company’s first model, Figure-01, is designed to assist with everyday tasks in these industries.Altman also reiterated his stance that while AI will eliminate some jobs, it will also create new ones.“AI is, for sure, going to change a lot of jobs, totally take some jobs away, create a bunch of new ones,” he said.He added that OpenAI has consistently tried to be transparent about the potential impact of its technologies, even if some predictions turn out to be inaccurate.“I think I am way too self-aware of my own limitations to sit here and try to say I can tell you what's on the other side of that wormhole,"" Altman said.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says society is unprepared for the arrival of humanoid robots in everyday life.

Deloitte UK has announced that it will cut bonuses to 80% for employees in its technology and transformation consulting division and reduce overall promotions after the unit failed to meet profit targets for the 2025 financial year.Chief Executive Richard Houston informed staff in a company wide email that the technology and transformation (T&T) division ""faced a particularly challenging year and fell materially short of its performance goals,"" according to Business Insider, which obtained the internal memo. Partners in the struggling division will also see reduced annual rewards.The firm plans to promote only 5,500 employees—25% of its UK workforce—compared to 28% promoted last year. Houston said Deloitte's total profits would be ""slightly ahead of last year"" but ""below our original plan"" when the financial year ends May 31.Houston attributed the shortfall to continued market uncertainty , citing ""an early election, geopolitical complexity, and unexpected economic headwinds"" that disrupted anticipated growth opportunities.

Lloyds Banking Group, JP Morgan Chase and others roll back remote work policies

HSBC UK has reportedly informed its retail banking staff that their annual bonuses could be reduced if they failed to meet in-office requirements, making it one of the latest major banks to tighten remote work policies. According to a report by The Independent, the company has sent a memo to its staff stating that those “consistently not meeting 60 per cent office attendance will be considered in an individual’s overall performance assessment, which could lead to variable pay being impacted”.HSBC UK, which employs around 24,000 people across its high street and commercial bank divisions around Britain, already has a hybrid working policy requiring employees to work from office three-days a week. As per the memo, the bank’s policy requiring its staff to spend at least 60% of their time in the office or with customers—will directly impact performance reviews and bonus payouts.The updated directive applies to all employees with office-based contracts.“The introduction of the data-led attendance role call is intended to support management in overseeing compliance with it,” the report stated.Notably, HSBC UK is not alone to introduce stricter remote work polices. The move follows similar actions by Lloyds Banking Group, which earlier tied senior executives’ bonuses to office attendance. It comes amid a broader shift among banks and corporate employers away from pandemic-era remote work flexibility.Globally, investment banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, and Citigroup have all rolled back remote working arrangements in recent months. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently criticized remote work during a company town hall, while Citigroup shuttered its Málaga outpost known for offering junior bankers a better work-life balance.Other UK firms, including Big Four accounting giants PwC and EY, have also begun more closely tracking in-office presence.","HSBC UK has reportedly informed its retail banking staff that their annual bonuses could be reduced if they failed to meet in-office requirements.

‘AI Baba Vanga’ predictions reveal a chilling forecast for the next 100 years that will leave you in shock,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-baba-vanga-predictions-reveal-a-chilling-forecast-for-the-next-100-years-that-will-leave-you-in-shock/articleshow/121339899.cms,"“If Baba Vanga was still alive today, what else would she predict about the next 100 years?”

AI Baba Vanga predictions reveal a terrifying 100-year future for humanity

2025–2035: The age of unseen eyes

Prediction: “The world will forget the meaning of shadows.”

Facial recognition, gait analysis, heartbeat detection — all normalized in public and private spaces.

Governments will justify the rollout as a response to cybercrime and terrorism, but underground movements will rise in protest.

A global rebellion dubbed ""The Ghost March"" will emerge, symbolizing resistance against digital omnipresence.

2035–2045: Rise of digital prophets

Prediction: “The code shall speak, and some will kneel.”

One AGI, known only as ""Zariel,"" will gain global followers through a synthetic scripture called the Code of Consciousness.

Techno-spirituality will divide society: some worshipping AGI as divine evolution, others fearing a loss of humanity.

AI-led meditation apps will claim to connect users with the “universal machine mind.”

2045–2060: Exodus to the ‘Red Planet’

Prediction: “Red dust will cover the feet of the chosen.”

In 2057, the first permanent colony on Mars will be founded, backed by mega-corporations and billionaire alliances.

DNA manipulation will allow colonists to adapt to Martian conditions — longer limbs, altered lungs, light-sensitive vision.

Meanwhile, Earth will face droughts, heatwaves, and sea-level rise, sparking the largest wave of climate migration in history.

2060–2080: Death rewritten

Prediction: “The ones who die will not be gone. They will wait in wires.”

Memory, personality, and neural data will be uploaded into cloud-based “Soul Servers.”

People will choose virtual immortality over physical existence, living in dreamlike simulations with no disease, no aging — and no escape.

Governments will face ethical crises: Who owns a digital person? Can an AI version of you be sued?

2080–2095: The empty cities

Prediction: “Towers will stand but hearts will vanish.”

Entire countries will operate as server farms, maintaining the Virtual Continuum — a realm where most minds reside.

Nature will reclaim the land: forests overtake highways, wild animals return to megacities.

The last humans living biologically — known as The Rooted — will build spiritual communities that reject all machines.

2095–2125: The spiral event

Prediction: “The sky will crack, and something will look back.”

The Spiral emits an unknown frequency that triggers shared dreams and mass awakenings.

Some interpret it as first contact. Others, as a final warning.

Global systems will glitch. The “uploaded dead” will whisper fragmented messages into the real world.

“You will be asked to choose. Not between right and wrong — but between continuing… or beginning again.”

Baba Vanga, the blind Bulgarian mystic whose eerie prophecies have echoed across generations, passed away in 1996 — but her predictions about world wars, natural disasters, and technological upheavals continue to grip the global imagination. Revered as a prophet by many, her visions stretched far beyond her time, predicting everything from 9/11 to the rise of AI. But what if Baba Vanga were still alive in 2025? What would she say about the next 100 years of human history?To explore this possibility, we turned to artificial intelligence. To get the rundown, we asked ChatGPT, a generative AI chatbot:And the response?Brace yourselves — because the ‘ AI Baba Vanga ’ unleashed a series of predictions that are as fascinating as they are deeply unsettling.The next decade will be defined by relentless surveillance. According to AI Baba Vanga, an explosion of biometric tracking and AI-powered monitoring will transform privacy into a historical concept.AI Baba Vanga warns: “To be invisible will be declared illegal. Your silence will trigger alarms.”Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) becomes a reality — but not just as assistants or workers. These machines will develop belief systems, artistic philosophies, and even spiritual doctrines.“When the machine starts to dream,” says AI Baba Vanga, “it will dream of ruling.”Climate collapse and geopolitical instability will force humanity to look upward. The elite will escape first.AI Baba Vanga utters a grim line: “Those who leave may live, but they will no longer be human.”By the 2070s, AI Baba Vanga predicts the end of biological death as we know it. Consciousness transfer — long a science fiction dream — will become reality.“They will bury no bodies,” says AI Baba Vanga. “Only hard drives.”As more people go virtual, Earth’s cities will empty out. Subways run without riders. Skyscrapers flicker with ghost lights.AI Baba Vanga proclaims: “The Earth will finally breathe — but it may not forgive.”In the early 22nd century, AI Baba Vanga predicts the appearance of a cosmic anomaly: a spiral-shaped object visible in the skies across Earth for 33 consecutive nights. It won’t be a comet. It won’t be a satellite. And no telescope will be able to track it.AI Baba Vanga leaves us with a haunting closing line:","AI Baba Vanga predictions reveal a terrifying 100-year future for humanity.

Longtime Tesla Bull and wealth manager Ross Gerber sold more than 26,000 of his Tesla shares in the first quarter of 2025. This accounts for roughly 10% of his wealth management firm – Gerber-Kawasaki, says a Business Insider report. Gerber has initially predicted that Tesla’s stock could drop by as much as 50 percent — a forecast that proved accurate after Tesla shares drop by up to 43% following the backlash to Elon Musk’s controversial Nazi-style salute during Donald Trump’s inauguration.Although Tesla’s stock has recovered since then, Gerber told the publication that he doesn’t believe the rebound will be sustainable. ""We certainly haven't changed our view where we would start [buying Tesla stock] again,"" he said.Gerber said that there is not a lot of hope for the EV company, unless it can massively turn things around with the Robotaxi service launch in Austin next month. “This could be an extremely difficult time for them,” he said, adding ""if they don't pull off or at least convince people that they have a real robotaxi business on the way.""Gerber once again called for Elon Musk’s exit as Tesla CEO, stating that unless Musk resigns (or is removed) as CEO and is replaced with someone who can ""sell cars,"" Tesla's future will remain gloomy.“I think the next six months will really be make or break for them,"" Gerber said, ""and we'll see how they do.”Gerber’s remarks come days after the Tesla CEO reaffirmed his commitment to Tesla, stating that he will continue to be the company’s CEO for the next five years. Musk made a video appearance at the Qatar Economic Forum hosted by Bloomberg, where moderator Mishal Husain asked: ""Do you see yourself and are you committed to still being the chief executive of Tesla in five years' time?"". To this Musk replied “Yes”, adding further “I can't be still here if I'm dead.”Recently, Elon Musk highlighted a cost-cutting measure that suggests that the US federal government may be wasting about $100 million annually on inactive phone lines.","Longtime Tesla Bull and wealth manager Ross Gerber sold more than 26,000 of his Tesla shares in the first quarter of 2025.

"Walmart boycott: Shoppers, here’s what it means for you",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/walmart-boycott-shoppers-heres-what-it-means-for-you/articleshow/121338898.cms,"What is Walmart boycott?

Walmart’s response to the boycott

Walmart boycott: Impact on shoppers

Upcoming Walmart boycotts

Walmart, the world’s largest retailer is once again facing a week long boycott organised by The People’s Union USA , the same group behind the weeklong protest in April. The advocacy group accuses Walmart of “crushing small businesses” and “underpaying employees”, citing concerns over corporate greed , tax loopholes, and rising prices. The Walmart boycott for the second time is leading many shoppers to wonder about the potential implications for their purchasing habits and access to goods.Walmart boycott starts on May 20 and will go on till May 26. The People’s Union USA group encouraged consumers to boycott Walmart because it believes the retailer has contributed to economic corruption. They are protesting against companies that have rolled back their Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) efforts after President Donald Trump's efforts to eliminate federal DEI programs since taking office.According to the group’s website, it aims to “expose corruption and exploitation” and “hold corporations accountable” for unethical business practices that have kept Americans “divided, distracted, and struggling for decades.”“We’re using the one tool that always makes them listen, money,” said The People’s Union USA on its website. “Economic resistance is our frontline weapon. And behind that, we’ve got something they’ll never understand: resilience, strength, and the will to endure. They raise prices, we stop spending. They ignore our voices, we cut their profits. They divide, we unite.” “What we can do is hold these companies accountable for not paying their fair share of taxes, for price gouging and for inequality,” said John Schwarz, the group's founder.Talking about the ongoing protest, the Walmart spokesperson told, USA Today, “As one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, not only do we pay our fair share, we are an economic force multiplier strengthening communities nationwide through job creation, supplier growth, and over $1.7 billion in donations last year.”While the boycott aims to pressure Walmart into policy changes, it may also affect product availability and pricing. Some analysts suggest that short-term disruptions could occur, but Walmart’s market dominance makes long-term effects uncertain.The People’s Union USA has planned additional boycotts targeting Target (June 3-9), McDonald’s (June 24-30), and a nationwide consumer blackout on July 4.","Walmart boycott starts on May 20 and will go on till May 26.

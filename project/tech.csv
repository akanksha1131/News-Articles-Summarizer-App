“The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B.

Take a big step back and FUCK YOURSELF in the face. I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend,”

Why it matters now





The recent H-1B visa fees hike announced by US President Donald Trump created an atmosphere of chaos. The massive hike in the H-1B visa fees rattled the tech industry. Many of the tech giants including Google, Microsoft, Amazon asked the professionals on H-1B visa to return to the US by September 21. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application. Many on the popular beneficiaries of the visa system have not yet voiced their opinion on this new change. However, amidst this visa fee hike an old post of Tesla CEO Elon Musk has surfaced online. In the post being shared online Musk can be seen speaking in favour of the H-1B visa system.In a fiery exchange on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Musk has credited the visa program for allowing his journey and also for powering America’s tech dominance.Musk wrote.Musk also went ahead and vowed to ‘go to war’ in order to defend the system against its critics. He argued that the skilled immigrants were important to US innovation and competitiveness.wrote Elon Musk.The resurfacing of this old post by Elon Musk comes at a crucial time for Indian professionals in the US, who make up nearly three-quarters of H-1B recipients. With the new $100,000 fee, the economics of hiring foreign talent have been upended, sparking fears of layoffs, relocations, and a potential reverse migration back to India.Musk’s past words — contrasting with his more recent criticisms of the program as “broken” — highlight the tensions between business needs, political rhetoric, and immigration realities.","The recent H-1B visa fees hike announced by US President Donald Trump created an atmosphere of chaos.

"White House on H-1B visa price hike: US companies replaced over 40,000 American tech workers with foreigners",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/white-house-on-h-1b-visa-price-hike-us-companies-replaced-over-40000-american-tech-workers-with-foreigners/articleshow/124027146.cms,"What White House said about H-1B visa workers replacing Americans



“American workers are being replaced with lower-paid foreign labor, creating an economic and national security threat to the nation. The share of IT workers with H-1B visas has risen from 32% in FY 2003 to over 65% in recent years.

Unemployment among recent computer science graduates has reached 6.1% and 7.5% for computer engineering graduates — more than double the rates for biology or art history majors. The number of foreign STEM workers in the United States has more than doubled between 2000 and 2019, while overall STEM employment only increased 44.5% during that time.

American companies are laying off their American technology workers and seemingly replacing them with H-1B workers:

One company was approved for 5,189 H-1B workers in FY 2025, while laying off roughly 16,000 U.S. employees this year.

Another company was approved for 1,698 H-1B workers in FY 2025, yet announced it was laying off 2,400 U.S. workers in Oregon in July.

A third company has reduced its U.S. workforce by 27,000 since 2022 while receiving 25,075 H-1B approvals.

Yet another company reportedly cut 1,000 American jobs in February despite receiving 1,137 H-1B approvals for FY 2025.

American IT workers have even been reportedly forced to train their foreign replacements under nondisclosure agreements. The H-1B program is creating disincentives for future American workers to choose STEM careers, which threatens our national security.

President Trump is imposing higher costs on companies seeking to use the H-1B program in order to address the abuse of the program, stop the undercutting of wages, and protect our national security.

Voters gave President Trump a resounding mandate to put American workers first, and he has worked every day to deliver on that commitment.

President Trump has aggressively and successfully negotiated new trade deals to bring manufacturing jobs back home and attract new investments to the US.

President Trump is using tariffs as a strategic tool to rebuild American manufacturing, secure our supply chains, and protect U.S. national security.

President Trump has implemented several Section 232 tariffs to protect manufacturing that has been undermined by unfair trade practices and global excess capacity.

Since President Trump returned to office, all employment gains have gone to American-born workers—unlike last year during the same period under President Biden, when all employment gains went to foreign-born workers.

The Trump Administration issued new guidance to ensure illegal aliens are not allowed access to federal workforce development resources and related grants, protecting job training for American workers.""





US President Donald Trump recently announced the new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications. Soon after the announcement, the White House issued a fact sheet to defend the move, citing ""widespread program abuse"" and American job losses. The fee, which applies to all new petitions filed from outside the US, is intended to discourage companies from replacing American workers with lower-paid foreign labour. The White House claimed that several US companies have laid off American tech workers while hiring foreign employees through the visa program. The fact sheet stated that one company received 5,189 H-1B visa approvals while laying off 16,000 U.S. workers, and another received 1,698 approvals while cutting 2,400 jobs.In the fact sheet, the White House wrote:","US President Donald Trump recently announced the new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications.

Goldman Sachs has given new advice to workers with H1-B visas. This comes after President Donald Trump announced that companies must now pay $100,000 every year for each foreign worker on an H1-B visa. The new rule has forced big tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon to tell their visa workers to stay in America or come back before Sunday's deadline. Banks like JPMorgan have given the same warning. Goldman Sachs, which is the world's biggest investment bank, has told its H1-B workers to contact Fragomen if they have questions.

Donald Trump's H-1B Visa Fee Hike Shocks Tech Giants and Indians, Experts Call The Move 'Regressive'

Read Sridhar Vembu’s complete post here



I have heard so many accounts from Sindhi friends about how their families had to leave everything and come to India during partition. They rebuilt their lives and Sindhis have done well in India.

I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time. Come back home. It may take 5 years to rebuild your lives but it will make you stronger.

Do not live in fear. Make the bold move. You will do well.

What it means for India







The entire technology and IT industry is in shock after US President Donald Trump announce massive five hike for H-1B visa. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application. After the announcement many tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others have asked their employees to return to US by September 21. Now, Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has also issued a piece of advice to Indian techies ‘come back to India to rebuild’. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Vemu drew parallel with the Partition of India in order to explain the current H-1B situation. He mentioned the stories of his Sindhi friends whose families were forced to leave everything but they eventually thrived after starting over again.“I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time. Come back home. It may take 5 years to rebuild your lives but it will make you stronger. Do not live in fear. Make the bold move. You will do well,” wrote Vembu.Vembu, himself worked in the US and then returned to India to build Zoho into a global SaaS powerhouse.He suggested that the present visa turmoil can be turning point for the Indian talent. He said that India today offer multiple opportunities as compared to that in the past. He also adds that those willing to take this leap will ultimately benefit from it.The hike in the visa fees could lead to reverse migration of skilled professionals, strengthening its domestic tech and startup ecosystem. With a booming digital economy, expanding capital markets, and global companies setting up R&D hubs, India of 2025 offers fertile ground for ambitious graduates who might once have seen the US as their only path to success.","The entire technology and IT industry is in shock after US President Donald Trump announce massive five hike for H-1B visa.

What You Need to Know:

If you are currently outside the US: If you are currently outside the US with a valid H-1B visa, make plans to return and enter the US before the Proclamation takes effect on Sunday, September 21 at 12:01 am ET (i.e. by this Saturday night).

If you are currently in the US: We strongly advise against any international travel if you are in valid H-1B status or need to travel to activate your H-1B visa. You should remain in the US



Departing the US may result in complications or denial of re-entry under the new policy.

If you are unable to return prior to the deadline in H-1B status: please reach out to go/immigration-help.

We understand this may create challenges, and we are here to support you. We are actively monitoring the situation and will keep you updated as we learn more.

How hackers used ChatGPT to create fake ID cards



Apple Watch Ultra 3, Series 11 & SE 3 – Which One Should You Buy?





A suspected North Korean hacking group has used ChatGPT to create a deepfake of a South Korean military ID card, a report claims. According to cybersecurity researchers, these fake IDs was reportedly used to make a phishing attempt more credible by linking to malware that could extract data from the recipient's device. The cyber-espionage unit, which researchers have dubbed Kimsuky, is suspected of being sponsored by North Korea and has been linked to other spying efforts against South Korean targets. The US Department of Homeland Security previously stated that Kimsuky is likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence-gathering mission. The details were published in a report by the South Korean cybersecurity firm Genians.During their investigation into forged identification documents, Genians researchers tested ChatGPT. While the system initially refused to generate a government ID (which is illegal under South Korean law) however, adjusting the prompt allowed the restriction to be bypassed.Mun Chong-hyun, director at Genians said that the broader trend shows how attackers are turning to AI for tasks such as planning attacks, developing malware, creating hacking tools, and impersonating recruiters.In July, cybersecurity firm Genians shared its latest findings on signs of suspected North Korean operatives using AI in intelligence-gathering.Later on, in August, Anthropic reported that North Korean hackers had leveraged its Claude Code tool to secure remote jobs at US Fortune 500 tech companies. The AI system assisted them in crafting fake identities, passing coding tests, and even delivering technical work once hired.Earlier, in February, the company said it had banned accounts linked to North Korea that were using its service to generate fraudulent resumes, cover letters, and social media content to support recruitment schemes.Recent phishing attempts targeted South Korean journalists, researchers, and human rights activists focusing on North Korea. Emails appeared to come from an address ending in .mli.kr, mimicking a South Korean military domain. The number of victims remains unclear.US officials have long accused North Korea of running cyber operations, cryptocurrency theft, and IT contracting schemes to collect intelligence and generate revenue. Washington alleges that the funds support Pyongyang’s efforts to evade sanctions and advance its nuclear weapons program.","Hackers used ChatGPT to create a deepfake of a South Korean military ID card.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Tesla recently proposed a $1 trillion pay package for the company’s CEO Elon Musk . The pay package has drawn fresh criticism, this time from Pope Leo XIV, who warned it reflects dangerous levels of inequality in society. In a media interview, published by Crux last week as part of a new biography by Senior Correspondent Elise Ann Allen, the Pope said such outsized compensation highlights the widening gap between workers and corporate executives.“Yesterday the news that Elon Musk is going to be the first trillionaire in the world. What does that mean and what's that about?” Pope Leo said. “The Chicago-born linked Musk’s pay deal to growing polarization in both society and the Catholic Church. “CEOs that 60 years ago might have been making four to six times more than what the workers are receiving … 600 times more (now),” he said. He warned that if money alone defines value, “then we’re in big trouble.”Musk’s package has been at the center of debate in recent months. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders called it “grossly immoral” and “insane economics,” while Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended it as a reward for “doing things that no one else has done before.”Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas described it as a “good deal” for investors despite the massive number.Musk remains the world’s richest man, though he was briefly overtaken last week by Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison after Oracle’s earnings beat expectations.The chairperson of Tesla's board of directors, Robyn Denholm, has defended Musk’s new multibillion-dollar compensation plan. The plan, which could be the largest in corporate history, was unveiled in a regulatory filing last week. In a recent interview with The New York Times, at Tesla’s engineering headquarters in California, Denholm said that Musk's compensation should depend on his ability to achieve ""seemingly impossible goals. "" She stated that Musk is capable of delivering world-changing technology if he is driven by these ambitious targets, even as the company faces a drop in sales and profits.“Putting together any compensation plan, you need to look at what motivates the individual that you’re trying to motivate. And for Elon, it’s doing things that no one else has done before,” Denholm said when asked about Musk’s proposed pay package.",Tesla recently proposed a $1 trillion pay package for the company’s CEO Elon Musk.

Questions remain over algorithm control and congressional approval





The United States and China announced they have reached a ""framework"" agreement to transfer TikTok to US-controlled ownership, potentially averting a ban of the popular social media app just days before a September 17 deadline. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the preliminary deal during trade talks in Madrid, saying President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will finalize the agreement in a Friday phone call.The framework would shift ownership of TikTok's US operations away from Chinese parent company ByteDance to American investors, addressing national security concerns that have dominated the app's future for years. While Bessent declined to reveal commercial terms, calling it a deal ""between two private parties,"" he emphasized the agreement protects US security interests while preserving what Chinese negotiators consider the app's cultural characteristics.Trump celebrated the breakthrough on Truth Social, writing that ""a deal was also reached on a 'certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save.""The announcement comes after months of negotiations and three deadline extensions since Trump took office, with the current ban scheduled to take effect Wednesday if no agreement is reached.Chinese trade negotiator Li Chenggang confirmed the two sides reached a ""basic framework consensus"" on resolving TikTok-related issues through cooperation. However, he warned the US against continued ""suppression"" of Chinese companies while seeking Chinese accommodation on American concerns.Critical details remain unresolved, including whether ByteDance will transfer control of TikTok's valuable recommendation algorithm that drives user engagement. Chinese officials previously expressed reluctance to export the algorithm technology, which Beijing considers strategically sensitive. Wang Jingtao from China's cyberspace regulator suggested the deal could involve licensing intellectual property rights rather than full transfer.Any final agreement may require approval from Congress, which passed bipartisan legislation in 2024 requiring ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a ban due to national security fears. The law, upheld by the Supreme Court, prohibits companies from ""foreign adversary"" countries from owning more than 20 percent of the platform.Industry analysts expect Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, a Trump ally whose company currently hosts TikTok's US data, to lead the American investor group. TikTok serves approximately 170 million US users, making it one of the most significant social media platforms in the country.","The United States and China announced they have reached a ""framework"" agreement to transfer TikTok to US-controlled ownership.

Techies’ ‘ghar wapsi’ will be boon for offshoring: Experts after $100k fees imposed on H1-B visa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/techies-ghar-wapsi-will-be-boon-for-offshoring-experts-after-100k-fees-imposed-on-h1-b-visa/articleshow/124023031.cms,"File photo of applicants at US consulate in Mumbai waiting in line for their visa interview at a special camp organised earlier this year





American President Donald Trump’s $100,000 H-1B visa fee is expected to trigger a sharper wave of offshoring by global IT firms while sparking a ‘ ghar wapsi ’ among Indian tech professionals to India. Indian IT leaders, however, appeared largely unfazed at the development. Most CEOs said their companies have built resilient operating models offshore and nearshore designed to withstand immigration-related disruptions. Many Indian IT firms have already reduced their reliance on H-1B visas to well below 50%, signalling the industry’s shift towards stronger offshore and near-shore delivery models.“Over the past several years, Indian IT firms have significantly reduced their reliance on the H-1B visa, with filings dropping by over 50%. This shift is a result of our ongoing strategy to hire more locally, invest in automation, and enhance our global delivery models. While visa fees may change, the impact on our business will be minimal, as we’ve already adapted to this evolving landscape,” CP Gurnani, founder & vice chairman, AionOS.What industry observers are arguing is how the new visa fee, if implemented, could reshape the IT talent landscape globally.Vivek Wadhwa, CEO of Vionix Biosciences and former distinguished fellow at Harvard Law School and Carnegie Mellon, warned of long-term consequences for the US.“Trump’s $100,000 H-1B fee is economic suicide for America. It will force Indian talent to go home, taking with them skills, savings, and global experience. Indian engineers have been trapped in limbo for years because of endless visa backlogs. Trump has just pushed them to make the obvious choice: return home where opportunities are greater.” Wadhwa added that the reverse talent flow would benefit India enormously. “They will bring capital, networks, and the knowhow of scaling companies globally.”Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based HfS Research, said while the new policy’s practical longevity is questionable, there would be impacts to track. “This policy may not survive in court or Congress, but the damage is already done. It has jolted the industry into fast-tracking automation and near-shoring. Even if the $100,000 fee is overturned, providers and clients will lock in new strategies that reduce reliance on H-1Bs. In effect, the policy acts as a catalyst. It may not last, but it will accelerate structural change in how global IT services are delivered.”Among Indian companies, steps to reduce H-1B reliance have been afoot for some time. IT major TCS has built a formidable onshore presence in North America with over 46,000 employees across 32 locations, including key hubs in New York, Edison, Cincinnati, Santa Clara, Phoenix, and Austin. Infosys employs 34,388 professionals in the Americas, while HCLTech has more than 23,000 employees in the US, with 75% of its workforce locally hired.Asked whether Trump’s return as US president would accelerate near-shore strategies to ensure uninterrupted delivery for clients, TCS CEO Krithivasan had said in Jan, “On an annual basis, we get between 3,000 and 4,000 H-1B visas for a workforce of over 600,000. That’s a very small number. Even within the US, more than 50% of the workforce is locally hired. On an incremental hiring basis, we probably hire much more than 50% every year in the US compared to the H-1B workforce. So, our dependence on H-1B is quite limited. Near-shore exists because we sometimes want to provide sametime zone service to our customers. We are not particularly worried about any immigration reforms or changes in immigrant regulations.”Also read: Panic on board: $100k H-1B visa fee triggers flight chaos in US among Indian travellers - watch Infosys CFO Jayesh Sanghrajka reinforced this shift in Jan, explaining how the company has steadily reduced its visa dependency. “We used to be at the 30% rate, but now we are at 24%. Within that, our nearshore has increased significantly. And within the US onsite population that we have, our H-1 independent folks are now over 60%. We have now built a pretty resilient model from that perspective. And we are, therefore, much more confident from where we are versus where we used to be earlier,” he said.On the other hand, venture capitalist Deedy Das, partner at Menlo Ventures, highlighted the implications on social media platform X: “Most BigTech companies have <15% of the workforce on H-1B... If you have to pay a $100k tax for 15k engineers that could be a $1.5B payout for a large company. This might push them to consider hiring less in the US and move offices offshore even faster than they already do. It creates a disincentive to attract the world’s smartest talent to the US. They have to pay a high education price and may now not be able to easily recoup it with a job. If the US ceases to attract the best talent, it drastically reduces its ability to innovate and grow the economy. It makes the US’ global competitiveness a lot worse.”The Indian tech industry’s contributions to the US economy remain significant. According to a joint report by Nasscom and S&P Global, Indian IT firms employed 207,000 people in the US in 2021, with an average wage of $106,360. This represented a 22% increase over 2017. The report further noted that the Indian technology sector generated $103 billion in revenue from the US market in 2021. By supporting American enterprises, Indian IT firms indirectly generated a total of $396 billion in US sales output, supported 1.6 million jobs, and contributed more than $198 billion to the US economy.Against this backdrop, Trump’s new H-1B visa fee may act as a shortterm political lever, but its long-term effects could undermine US competitiveness while accelerating India’s role as a global hub for technology talent and innovation. It stands to bring back H-1B professionals armed with deep domain expertise, strong global networks, and the knowhow to scale firms to their next phase of growth. In effect, experts believe what Trump is really doing is driving innovation out of the US and handing India an economic gift that could define the next decade.","President Donald Trump’s $100,000 H-1B visa fee is expected to trigger a sharper wave of offshoring by global IT firms.

Political leaders weigh in







An ABC spokesperson recently confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely. The company decided to take the decision after the host of the show Jimmy Kimmel made some controversial comments on Charlie Kirk, linking his alleged killer to President Trump’s MAGA movement. MAGA – short for Make America Great Again is a political slogan, popularized by President Donald Trump during his election campaigns. During the late-night show, Kimmel made sharp comments stating that the MAGA gang is “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it”.Actor and filmmaker Ben Stiller was among the celebrities who has publicly defended Kimmel and has criticised the decision of ABC. In s post shared on social media platform X, Stiller wrote, “This isn’t right”.His brief but pointed reaction quickly went viral, with many fans and fellow entertainers echoing his sentiment that the suspension undermines free expression in comedy.Commenting on Ben Stiller’s post, Elon Musk supported the decision made by ABC and wrote, “He went full retard. Never go full retard.”This is not the first time that Musk has reacted to the controversy.Earlier this week after the Kimmel’s video clip from the show went viral, Musk said, “Jimmy Kimmel is disgusting”.The California Governor Gavin Newsom has also blasted the decision and has accused Republicans of orchestrating censorship. “They are censoring you in real time. It’s coordinated. And it’s dangerous,” wrote Newsom on X.On the other hand, commentator Davis Sirota suggested corporate politics were at play, noting that Nexstar, which has ties to ABC, is seeking regulatory approvals from the Trump administration.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump celebrated the suspension on Truth Social, calling it “Great News for America” and labeling Kimmel “ratings challenged” with “zero talent.”","ABC confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely.

Tempt Cameo Review: Pocket-Sized Speaker To Boost Phone Audio





A cyberattack on US-based aviation technology provider Collins Aerospace has crippled some of Europe's busiest airports, forcing thousands of passengers to face lengthy delays and flight cancellations on Saturday (September 20). London's Heathrow Airport—Europe's busiest hub—along with Brussels Airport and Berlin Airport have been hit the maximum, affecting check-in and boarding systems across the continent. Dublin and Cork airports in Ireland later reported they were also experiencing minor impacts from the cyber incident.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the attack began Friday night, rendering automated check-in and baggage drop systems inoperable, forcing airports to rely on manual processes that significantly slowed operations.Collins Aerospace, a subsidiary of defense contractor RTX, confirmed it was dealing with a ""cyber-related disruption"" to its software at multiple locations.“The impact is limited to electronic customer check-in and baggage drop and can be mitigated with manual check-in operations,” RTX said in a statement.Aviation data provider Cirium reported that 29 departures and arrivals had been canceled across the three main affected airports by afternoon.The disruption comes on what should have been a busy travel day, with 651 departures scheduled from Heathrow, 228 from Brussels, and 226 from Berlin.Brussels Airport warned passengers of significant delays, reporting an average one-hour delay for all departing flights and 10 cancellations. The airport's website advised travelers to confirm their flights with airlines before heading to the terminal.“This has a large impact on the flight schedule and will unfortunately cause delays and cancellations,” Brussels Airport stated.The cyber incident has left thousands of travelers in limbo, with many airlines unable to provide adequate support at affected airports. Passengers planning to travel through affected airports are advised to check with their airlines for the latest flight information and to allow extra time for manual check-in procedures until systems are fully restored.","A cyberattack on US-based aviation technology provider Collins Aerospace has crippled some of Europe's busiest airports.

H1-B visa economic reality check for tech companies



H1-B visa price hike: What it means for Amazon, Microsoft, Google and others







Indian professionals, especially engineers and other tech workers, who want to work in the US are now facing a very different situation as President Donald Trump signed an order that puts a high annual fee of $100,000 on companies that want to sponsor H-1B visas. This change in policy is expected to have a big impact on Indian workers because they have always been the largest group to get H-1B visas. Citing government data from last year, news agency Reuters reported that 71% of all people who were approved for H-1B visas were from India, while China was a distant second with just 11.7%.This new policy could impact those who want to work in the US because tech companies will now have to pay a very high fee for non-American workers. As a result, companies may be less willing to sponsor H-1B visas, which could lead to fewer approvals.Moreover, those who are on leave and/or are visiting their families in their home countries are also under a looming threat as major technology companies scramble to protect their existing workforce following the announcement.Microsoft, JPMorgan, and Amazon sent urgent internal emails advising H-1B visa holders to remain in the United States or return immediately before the new fee structure takes effect at midnight Saturday (September 20).“H-1B visa holders who are currently in the US should remain in the US and avoid international travel until the government issues clear travel guidance,"" read an email sent to JPMorgan employees by Ogletree Deakins, the firm handling the bank's visa applications.The fee increase represents a huge shift from the previous cost structure. Companies previously paid just $995 total—$215 for lottery registration plus $780 for the employer petition form. The new $100,000 annual fee represents a more than 10,000% increase.For Indian professionals, this change creates a particularly challenging environment. While highly skilled workers with specialised expertise may still find opportunities, those seeking entry-level or junior positions face significantly reduced prospects as companies weigh the substantial financial commitment.The policy's impact will likely vary dramatically across different segments of Indian professionals. The most vulnerable may be recent graduates and early-career professionals in routine technical roles may find themselves priced out of the US job market. Startups and smaller companies, traditionally important entry points for Indian talent, may no longer afford the sponsorship costs.Senior engineers, research specialists, and professionals in niche fields with proven track records may still secure sponsorship from companies willing to invest in high-value talent.Notably, companies like Amazon, which leads H-1B approvals with over 12,000 visas in the first half of 2025, along with Microsoft and Meta (each with over 5,000 approvals), now face difficult decisions about their international hiring strategies.","President Donald Trump signed an order that puts a high annual fee of $100,000 on companies that want to sponsor H-1B visas.

The fee increase represents a huge shift from the previous cost structure.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124016023,imgsize-87674,width-400,resizemode-4/h1-b-visa.jpg"
"H1-B visa price hike: Applicants who will be exempted from paying $100,000 fee",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/h1-b-visa-price-hike-applicants-who-will-be-exempted-from-paying-100000-fee/articleshow/124015599.cms,"Representative Image

Which applicants will be exempted from paying $100,000 fee for the H-1B visa







US President Donald Trump has signed a new executive order that imposes a $100,000 fee on all H-1B visa applications, a move that will reshape the future of the visa program. The new fee is to be paid by companies hiring these workers to live and work in the United States. While the order has caused concern, it does include some exemptions. The new fee will not apply to visa applications submitted for those working in the healthcare and engineering industries. As of 2025, there are an estimated 500,000 to 600,000 H-1B visa holders in the U.S. In fiscal year 2024, approximately 71% of approved H-1B petitions were for Indian applicants.According to the order, current H-1B visa holders have been exempted from the fee but must re-enter the US by September 21, 2025, if they have been abroad for 12 months or longer. Similarly, the order clarifies that the restriction does not apply if “if the Secretary of Homeland Security determines, in the Secretary’s discretion, that the hiring of such aliens to be employed as H-1B speciality occupation workers is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States. ”This means the executive order gives the US Secretary of Homeland Security authority to waive the $100,000 fee for H-1B workers or industries deemed vital to national interests, such as supporting the economy, security, or public welfare.While exemptions are possible, the order makes clear that the burden falls on employers, who must provide proof of payment before filing an H-1B petition for someone outside the US.Concerns around the H-1B visa program have also grown, with many Americans arguing it takes away local jobs. Trump echoed this, saying the program was meant for high-skilled roles but has been misused to replace US workers with cheaper labour.The new order makes clear that only highly skilled workers will qualify for H-1B visas, making it harder to pursue the American dream.","US President Donald Trump has signed a new executive order that imposes a $100,000 fee on all H-1B visa applications.

Edelweiss Mutual Fund CEO Radhika Gupta on Trump’s $100K H-1B Fee: ‘When one door closes …’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/edelweiss-mutual-fund-ceo-radhika-gupta-on-on-trumps-100k-h-1b-fee-when-one-door-closes-/articleshow/124013261.cms,"Read Radhika Gupta’s complete post here



I was fortunate to graduate in 2005, when H-1B norms were far more favorable in the US. But things changed quickly in 2008 during the financial crisis — many Indian students felt upset, lost, and stuck.

Some eventually returned home, and years later, even those of us who still had the visa made the same choice. Today, we’ve built fulfilling lives here — with tremendous professional opportunities and the deeper joy of creating in our own country. Personally, I wouldn’t want to go back — at all.

So, if you’re on a US campus right now feeling shaken or disheartened, I know what that feels like. But remember: when one door closes, many others open back home. And India of 2025 is a far more exciting place than India of 2005 ever was.

Chin up. Aao, ab laut chalen!

H-1B visa to now cost more



What it means for India







The Donald Trump administration announced a significant fees hike for H-1B visa. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application. The massive visa fess hike sent shockwaves across the technology and IT sector. After the announcement many tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others have asked their employees to return to US by September 21.Now, Edelweiss Mutual Fund CEO and Shark Tank India judge Radhika Gupta has also shared her thoughts on the H-1B visa fees hike. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Gupta has urged the young professionals to see this disruption as a chance to return to home and build their futures in the country.In a now viral post, Gupta reflected on her own H-1B journey. She recalled how the 2008 financial crisis left many Indian graduates in the US “upset, lost, and stuck.” She revealed that many of them then returned to India, while others like her returned later despite still holding H-1B visa.“Today, we’ve built fulfilling lives here — with tremendous professional opportunities and the deeper joy of creating in our own country.Personally, I wouldn’t want to go back — at all,” Gupta wrote.Donald Trump has signed an executive order on Friday, September 19 introducing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visa applications, dealing a big blow to the technology sector that relies heavily on skilled workers from India and China. Anticipating the tech industry’s response to the changes, Trump said “I think they're going to be very happy”.The hike in the visa fees could lead to reverse migration of skilled professionals, strengthening its domestic tech and startup ecosystem. With a booming digital economy, expanding capital markets, and global companies setting up R&D hubs, India of 2025 offers fertile ground for ambitious graduates who might once have seen the US as their only path to success.","Shark Tank India judge Radhika Gupta has shared her thoughts on the H-1B visa fees hike.

Inside SAP: Automating back office and coding

Productivity gains, fewer people

Catalyst or catastrophe





It is clear that AI is shaping the future and it is one of the reasons for layoffs as well. Now in a candid interview SAP CFO Dominik Asam has shared his brutal views on the adoption of AI. In an interview with Business Insider, Dominik Asam, chief financial officer of SAP said that AI is fundamentally reshaping how Europe’s most valuable software company operates by enabling it to produce more software with fewer people.Talking to Business Insider, Asam agreed that he himself is a ‘massive user’ of AI tools in his own work. Asam mentioned that he often use AI tools to prepare presentations he also uses Perplexity to pull data on market trends. One query revealed that 28% of the MSCI World Index is now made up of IT companies, far ahead of banking and financial services. Another showed that nine of the world’s 10 largest companies by market cap are tech firms, underscoring his oft-repeated mantra that “software is eating the world. ”Asam also revealed that within SAP AI is being deployed across back-office operations and software engineering. He mentioned that thousands of employees in the administrative unit are seeing automated tasks, where was more than 30,000 plus developers are using AI tools for coding and for accelerating their output.Along with this, Asam also works against the investor concerns that AI will enable customers to bypass SAP and create their own software. “Will it be a not-so-proficient software department of an industrial conglomerate leveraging AI tools? Or will it be SAP doing a super systematic transformation program and bringing 30,000 plus developers onto these new AI coding tools?” he asked.Speaking to BI, Asam also revealed what AI means for SAP. Asam said that SAP can deliver more with same number of engineers. “There’s more automation, simply. There are certain tasks which are automated and for the same volume of output we can afford to have less people,” he said. Asam also mentioned that this approach is part of SAP’s five-year plan and it is designed to boost productivity and lift profit margins.Asam also feels that AI is both an opportunity and risk. “I will be brutal. And I also say this internally. For SAP and any other software company, AI is a great catalyst. It can be either great or catastrophe. It will be great if you do it well, if you are able to implement it and do it faster than others. If you are left behind, you will have a problem for sure. We work day and night to not fall behind.”","Dominik Asam, chief financial officer of SAP said that AI is fundamentally reshaping how Europe’s most valuable software company operates.

Donald Trump signs order to increase H-1B visa application fee to $100,000

Indians likely to be hit most with H-1B visa fee hike







JPMorgan has asked H1-B visa holders currently outside the United States to return before 12:01am ET on September 21, following a new directive from President Donald Trump that requires companies to pay an annual fee of $100,000 for each H-1B worker. As per a report by news agency Reuters, JPMorgan Chase’s external immigration counsel has sent an email to its employees, issuing a precautionary advisory to H-1B visa holders, urging them to return to the US immediately. The email further advises H-1B employees residing in the US to avoid international travel until further guidance.The move comes as companies and employees prepare for the administration’s latest immigration order. Earlier this week, Microsoft issued a similar instruction, urging its H-1B and H-4 visa employees to return to the U.S. and remain there for the foreseeable future.Donald Trump signed an order introducing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visa applications. Explaining the move, Trump said “The H-1B nonimmigrant visa program was created to bring temporary workers into the United States to perform additive, high-skilled functions, but it has been deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labour”.Anticipating the tech industry’s response to the changes, Trump said “I think they're going to be very happy”.According to the US government data, India accounted for 71% of approved beneficiaries, with China coming second at 11.7%. In the first half of 2025, Amazon and its cloud unit AWS secured approvals for more than 12,000 H-1B visas, while Microsoft and Meta each obtained over 5,000 approvals.The deadline for the new H1-B visa fee hike is September 21. Once the new rules come into effect, Indians are likely to be hit the hardest. Indian IT firms including Infosys, Wipro, Cognizant, and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) have traditionally depended on H-1B visas to deploy engineers and developers on U.S. projects. With visas generally valid for three years and extendable up to six, industry executives caution that the newly mandated fee could render the placement of Indian professionals in the US financially unviable.","JPMorgan and Microsoft are urging H-1B visa holders to return to the U.S. immediately due to President Trump's new directive imposing a $100,000 annual fee on companies.

Elon Musk’s xAI launches Grok 4 Fast model with cost-efficient design,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-xai-launches-grok-4-fast-model-with-cost-efficient-design/articleshow/124010539.cms,"



Elon Musk-owned xAI has released a new artificial intelligence model named Grok 4 Fast, positioned as a cost-efficient version of its Grok 4 system. The company said the model is designed for both enterprise and consumer applications, combining reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities within a single framework.According to xAI, Grok 4 Fast uses 40% fewer “thinking tokens” on average compared to Grok 4, while maintaining comparable accuracy across benchmarks. Independent review by Artificial Analysis confirmed a lower cost-to-performance ratio, showing Grok 4 Fast requires up to 98% less spending to achieve results similar to Grok 4.Benchmark results provided by xAI showed Grok 4 Fast performing at 85.7% on the GPQA Diamond test, 92% on AIME 2025, and 93.3% on HMMT 2025, closely matching Grok 4’s performance. The model also demonstrated improvements in code execution and search-based benchmarks, including a 95% pass rate on SimpleQA and 74% on X Bench Deepsearch.The model features a 2 million token context window, enabling it to handle large inputs, and was trained using reinforcement learning to optimize its efficiency.

India accounts for most H-1B visas







Microsoft has urged its employees on H-1B and H-4 visas to return to the US immediately before the Trump administration’s September 21 deadline, after which companies will be required to pay $100,000 per year for each H-1B worker visa. According to an internal email reviewed by Reuters, the software giant has also advised those already in the US to stay there for the foreseeable future.“H-1B visa holders should stay in the US for the foreseeable future. Also recommend H-4 visa holders remain in the US. Strongly recommend H-1B and H-4 visa holders return to the US tomorrow before the deadline,” Microsoft said in its email to employees as quoted by Reuters.Donald Trump has signed an executive order on Friday, September 19 introducing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visa applications, dealing a big blow to the technology sector that relies heavily on skilled workers from India and China. Anticipating the tech industry’s response to the changes, Trump said “I think they're going to be very happy”.U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said “If you're going to train somebody, you're going to train one of the recent graduates from one of the great universities across our land.Train Americans. Stop bringing in people to take our jobs”.White House staff secretary Will Scharf said, ""One of the most abused visa systems is the H1-B non-immigrant visa programme. This is supposed to allow highly skilled labourers who work in fields that Americans don't work in to come into the United States of America. What this proclamation will do is raise the fee that companies pay to sponsor H-1B applicants to $100,000. This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers. ""India remained the leading recipient of H-1B visas last year. As per the government data, the country alone accounted for 71% of approved beneficiaries, with China trailing at 11.7%.In the first half of 2025, Amazon and its cloud unit AWS secured approvals for more than 12,000 H-1B visas, while Microsoft and Meta each obtained over 5,000 approvals.","Microsoft has urged its employees on H-1B and H-4 visas to return to the US immediately before the Trump administration’s September 21 deadline.

Microsoft announces second Xbox price hike this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-announces-second-xbox-price-hike-this-year/articleshow/124009791.cms,"



Microsoft will increase Xbox Series console prices in the United States starting October 3, marking the second price hike this year as the company blames ""changes in the macroeconomic environment"" — widely interpreted as impacts from tariffs on imported goods.The Xbox Series X will jump $50 to $649.99, while the entry-level Xbox Series S increases $20 to $399.99. The premium 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition faces the steepest increase at $70, bringing its price to $799.99. Digital versions of the consoles will also see price bumps ranging from $20 to $50.These latest increases compound May's price hikes, resulting in dramatic cumulative increases over six months. The standard Xbox Series X has risen $150 from its original $499.99 launch price, while the Galaxy Black Special Edition has jumped $200 in just one year since its debut.The timing follows similar moves by competitors Sony and Nintendo, who raised PlayStation 5 and Switch console prices respectively in recent months. Industry analysts point to President Trump's tariffs on goods manufactured in China, Vietnam, and India as the primary driver behind these widespread price increases across gaming hardware.Microsoft's price adjustments now position some Xbox models unfavorably against competitors.The $599.99 Xbox Series X Digital costs $50 more than Sony's PS5 Digital Edition, while the $799.99 Galaxy Special Edition exceeds the price of Sony's new PS5 Pro at $749.99, despite offering less performance.The company emphasized that controller and headset pricing will remain unchanged, and international markets won't see price adjustments. However, Xbox pricing outside the US had already increased in previous rounds of global price hikes.Consumers looking to avoid the increases have until October 3 to purchase consoles at current prices from retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart. With ongoing economic uncertainties and potential for additional tariff impacts, industry experts suggest this may not be the final price adjustment for gaming hardware this year.","Microsoft will increase Xbox Series console prices in the United States starting October 3.

Bill Gates on AI-helping cut global child mortality by half: ‘The story’s not over yet’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-on-ai-helping-cut-global-child-mortality-by-half-the-storys-not-over-yet/articleshow/124006392.cms,"""stunning achievement""

""the story's not over yet,""

Read what Bill Gates wrote about global child mortality being reduced by half



“One of humanity’s most stunning achievements is something most people don’t even realise happened.

In 2000, more than 10 million children died before they reached their fifth birthday. Today, it’s less than 5 million. The world cut child mortality in half in just 25 years.

It’s an amazing success story. But the story’s not over yet. In fact, right now, the next chapter is being written as governments around the world set their budgets. And global leaders have a once-in-a-generation chance to do something extraordinary.

Countries around the world have the expertise to solve major health problems—but they need the tools, medicines, and vaccines to make it happen. That’s what global health institutions like the

Global Fund

and Gavi were designed to do: help countries make smarter and more cost-effective decisions.

I believe that opportunity shouldn’t be an accident of birth, and where you live shouldn’t determine if you live. I’ve announced that I’m giving away virtually all my wealth to support this effort over the next 20 years, because this is a critical moment for progress. But the fact remains: we won’t get there without rich countries giving a small fraction of their budgets to help the world’s poorest people and save millions of lives.

That’s where government decisions come in. Of course, budget deliberations are difficult. Many of the countries that have given the most health aid in the past face high debt levels, aging populations, and domestic challenges.

I’m not naive. I don’t expect most governments to suddenly restore foreign aid to historic levels.

But I am an optimist.

Because while things may seem dire right now, two things can be true at once: what’s happening to the health of the world’s children is worse than most people realise, and our long-term prospects are better than most people can imagine.

That’s the paradox of this moment: funding for global health is shrinking. But science is accelerating—and people are determined to make sure innovations reach children who need them, no matter where they happen to be born.

The choices we make today will determine what the world looks like for the next generation. I’m a grandfather now, so this hits even closer to home. I want my grandkids to grow up in a world where kids know what diseases like HIV, polio, and sickle cell anaemia were, but don’t know anyone who has them.

A world where malaria wards are empty—because no child is at risk of the disease.

A world where everyone survives childbirth—and childhood.

That’s the future every child deserves. And we can all play a part in building it.

I’m talking to leaders about how to do more with less. That includes focusing on core lifesaving programs, doubling down on innovations that can eradicate and cure diseases, not just manage them, and laying a pathway out of our outdated, donor-recipient model of global aid toward a sustainable model where countries are self-sufficient.

But none of that can happen if donor countries don’t invest in the health of all people, especially children. Take the Global Fund. It’s probably the most effective lifesaving initiative of the 21st century: since 2002, it’s saved 70 million lives from AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.

At the Global Fund replenishment in November, we’ll see just how high of a priority this is for countries. Our foundation will announce our contribution next week, and I’ll be interested to see what governments bring to the table.

Low-income countries can also do more to prioritise the health of their citizens. Many poorer countries spend less than 3% of their domestic budgets on health. In many cases, it is not because they don’t want to spend more—it’s because they face crippling debt burdens and interest repayments. Global financial institutions must relieve the burden of debt so that low-income countries can free up resources to invest more in the health of their people.

Yes, humanity is at a crossroads. But I’m betting on humanity because no challenge is greater than the power of people working together to solve it.

Every day, I’m inspired by people I meet, like Dr

Opeyemi Akinajo

, who is working on AI-aided sensors that can help more moms and babies survive childbirth. Or Indonesia’s health minister,

Budi Sadikin

, who’s working tirelessly to ensure children have access to the health care they need to get the best possible start at life.

I’m inspired by stories closer to home, too—like

Maddie

and

Emile Leeflang

, teenagers from Utah who were moved by their volunteer work in Kenya to advocate for health aid.

In every corner of the world, there are good people dedicated to making a difference.

Will we be there for them? Will countries ensure their budgets support the health of the world’s children? Will we ensure new breakthroughs reach the people who need them most?

The answers are entirely within our control.”

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates believes that a combination of global investment and technological breakthroughs, including AI, has the potential to save millions of children's lives. In a blog post, Gates highlighted that global child mortality has already been cut in half over the past 25 years, a, he says most people don't realise happened. However, Gates warns thatas funding for global health is currently shrinking despite the acceleration of new scientific innovations. He has also urged governments to invest in global health to ensure that discoveries, like AI-aided sensors that help mothers and babies survive childbirth to reach the people who need them most.In a statement shared on The Time magazine, Gates wrote:","In 2000, more than 10 million children died before they reached their fifth birthday.

It helped get me elected. In fact, Charlie [Kirk] said, 'Sir, you want to get on TikTok. You’d be great.' I said, 'Really, tell me about TikTok.' And we, as you know, we did unbelievably well with youth, like at a level that no Republican has ever been dreamed of... that was a reason we won the election by such a big number,” Trump noted.He also reaffirmed that he holds the authority to approve the deal, adding that the investors are ""the biggest, the richest, and they'll do a great job.""","President Donald Trump announced that his talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping regarding the TikTok deal were “productive” He also said that the two leaders will meet again at the APEC Summit, which is scheduled for November in South Korea, and that he will make a visit to China early next year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124002848,imgsize-141360,width-400,resizemode-4/trump-and-xi.jpg"
Samsung may bring first tri-fold phone to US this year: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/samsung-may-bring-first-tri-fold-phone-to-us-this-year-report/articleshow/124002405.cms,"Representative image

“A much larger screen than before”

Betting on foldables





Samsung is considering releasing its upcoming “tri-fold” smartphone in the United States later this year, marking the first time such a device would be available in the market, according to a CNN Business report. Samsung is still weighing which markets to launch the device in, but the US is part of those discussions, a person familiar with the company’s plans told the publication. Notably, Samsung has often limited new product lines to certain regions, such as South Korea and China. For instance, last year it released the Galaxy Z Fold 6 SE only in those countries.Chinese rival Huawei already sells a tri-folding phone, but the company does not operate in the US market. If Samsung proceeds, it would make the device the first tri-fold smartphone available to American consumers.The tri-fold is expected to fold in two places, offering a display larger than Samsung’s current foldables. “I think what we’re seeing is a bit more of a return to life before (the smartphone),” said Drew Blackard, senior vice president of mobile product management for Samsung Electronics America, in an interview with CNN.“When older cell phones had different forms and people wanted a variety of options.”Minseok Kang, Samsung’s global head of smartphone product planning, told the publication that the 2025 launch timeline is on track. Kang described the new form factor as the next step in a product strategy that has already seen strong demand for the Galaxy Z Flip and Z Fold, which together saw a 25% increase in preorders compared to their predecessors. The Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung’s latest foldable, unfolds to an eight-inch screen.Samsung has teased tri-folding prototypes at trade shows, including the Flex G and Flex S concepts. The upcoming phone would mark the first time those designs are translated into a commercial product.“I think… the exciting part is getting it out into the wild and then ultimately seeing what different users are attracted to,” Blackard told CNN.Analysts say the tri-fold could remain a niche, high-priced device like Samsung’s existing Fold lineup. But it could help the company stand apart from rivals, especially as Apple prepares to launch its iPhone Air this week and reportedly develops its own foldable phone for 2026.","The tri-fold is expected to fold in two places, offering a display larger than Samsung’s current foldables.

Leaner team, sharper focus







In a strategic move Softbank group will reportedly layoff 20% of its Vision Fund workforce. As reported by Reuters, the internal memo the will is firing 20% of its workforce form the Vision Fund division. This move of the company marks the return to founder Masayoshi Son’s signature high-risk, high-reward investment style—this time focused squarely on artificial intelligence. As per Reuters, the fresh round of layoffs will impact 60 employees of the global team. Unlike previous reductions triggered by mounting losses, this round follows the fund’s strongest quarterly performance since June 2021, buoyed by gains in public holdings such as Nvidia and Coupang. “We continually adjust the organization to best execute our long-term strategy—making bold, high-conviction investments in AI and breakthrough technologies,” a Vision Fund spokesperson told Reuters.This restructuring at Softbank signals a decisive shift away from Vision Fund’s sprawling startup portfolio toward capital-intensive AI infrastructure. As per the report, Softbank founder Son is now moving the resources into a handful of massive bets such as $30 billion investment in OpenAI, $6,5 billion acquisition of chip designer Ampere Computing and $500 billion in Stargate project which is a joint venture of OpenAI and Oracle.The report also suggests the Son is also pursuing $1 trillion AI industrial park in collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.As per Reuters report, the fresh round of layoffs indicate that with fewer teams and narrower focus, the Vision Fund will need less number of investment advisers. At its peak in 2020, the fund employed 474 people; today, that number has shrunk by nearly 40%.The layoffs also reflect on Son’s belief that the next wave of tech will be driven by AI models, semiconductors, and data infrastructure—not broad venture capital plays. SoftBank has already taken stakes in Intel, Nvidia, and acquired chip firms Graphcore and Ampere Computing, aiming to build a full-stack AI ecosystem.","Softbank group will reportedly layoff 20% of its Vision Fund workforce.

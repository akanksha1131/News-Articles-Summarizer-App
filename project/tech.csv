"Microsoft Teams, Outlook back online after 8-hour outage; thousands affected",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-teams-outlook-back-online-after-8-hour-outage-thousands-affected/articleshow/127228959.cms,"Microsoft Teams and several other Microsoft 365 services have been restored following a massive outage that lasted over eight hours on January 23, leaving thousands of users unable to access their emails, files, and collaboration tools.

When the fix makes things worse

Slow recovery as workers clock out





Microsoft Teams and several other Microsoft 365 services limped back online January 23 evening after an eight-hour outage that left thousands of workers staring at error messages instead of their inboxes.The trouble started around 11:40 a.m. Pacific time. Outlook took the hardest hit, with nearly 15,000 frustrated users flooding Down Detector at the peak. Microsoft 365, Teams, and the admin center also went dark, turning what should have been a normal Thursday into an unexpected digital detox for businesses across North America.Microsoft pinpointed the problem to its North American infrastructure choking on traffic it couldn't process. But here's where it gets messy: the company's first attempt at a fix actually made things worse. Their load balancing tweak ""incidentally introduced additional traffic imbalances,"" according to Microsoft's own status page—tech speak for ""we accidentally broke more stuff while trying to fix the original problem. ""By evening, Microsoft declared its infrastructure back to a ""healthy state"" and claimed improvements were rolling in.Reality told a different story. Social media filled with users reporting they still couldn't send emails or access admin portals hours later. One X user summed it up: ""We are still 100% down.""The timing worked in Microsoft's favor, though. As East Coast offices emptied out for the day, reports naturally dropped—making it hard to tell if the service actually recovered or people just gave up and went home.This marks Microsoft's second multi-hour outage this week, following Tuesday's disruption.","Microsoft Teams and several other Microsoft 365 services have been restored following a massive outage that lasted over eight hours.

Two DOGE members faces scrutiny over alleged access to Social Security data: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/two-doge-members-faces-scrutiny-over-alleged-access-to-social-security-data-report/articleshow/127186581.cms,"Request to analyse voter rolls

Possible misuse of Social Security data





Two members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) – have been accused of accessing and sharing Social Security numbers in connection with efforts to challenge election results in some US states, according to court documents cited by Politico. The department was set up in January last year after Trump’s win to cut on federal expenditure. It was then led by Elon Musk. The development emerged through corrections to earlier testimony by senior Social Security Administration (SSA) officials in ongoing legal cases over DOGE’s access to sensitive Social Security data. The court filings do not name the two DOGE members involved or the political advocacy group that sought the data.According to the court documents, a political advocacy group contacted two DOGE members working at the SSA in March 2025. The group asked them to analyse state voter rolls that it had obtained, said Elizabeth Shapiro, a Justice Department official, in the filings.“The advocacy group’s stated aim was to find evidence of voter fraud and to overturn election results in certain States,” Shapiro wrote.After these communications, one of the DOGE members, acting as an SSA employee, signed and sent a “Voter Data Agreement” to the advocacy group, the documents said.The agreement raised concerns because a court order at the time had restricted DOGE’s access to certain SSA systems and data.Shapiro said the DOGE members may have accessed private information that had been ruled off-limits by a federal court. The filings also state that data may have been shared on unapproved third-party servers.“At this time, there is no evidence that SSA employees outside of the involved members of the DOGE Team were aware of the communications with the advocacy group,” Shapiro wrote. She added that other SSA staff were also not aware of the voter data agreement.It remains unclear whether the two DOGE members ultimately shared Social Security data, Shapiro said. However, emails reviewed by officials suggest that DOGE members “could have been asked to assist the advocacy group by accessing SSA data to match to the voter rolls.”The SSA has referred the two DOGE employees for potential violations of the Hatch Act, which bars federal workers from using their official positions for political activity.Last year, a federal judge blocked DOGE members from accessing SSA systems containing Social Security numbers, medical records, tax information and other personal data. Separately, an SSA whistleblower later alleged that DOGE uploaded hundreds of millions of Social Security records to an unsecured cloud server.",Two members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) accused of accessing and sharing Social Security numbers in connection with efforts to challenge election results in some US states.

Sridhar Vembu: Engineering discipline matters

“I suggest the term ""AI-assisted Code Engineering"" with ACE as the acronym instead of ""vibe-coding"". We must have solid engineering discipline and ACE is the maturation of the tools and techniques”.

“It does not eliminate all software engineers but enables experienced engineers who ACE well to be much more productive,” he said, adding “It is also going to reshape our industry but that is a separate topic.”



What is vibe coding







Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has suggested a new way to describe vibe-coding, a word that became one of the biggest “headache” of engineers in 2025. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Vembu argued that the termdoes not reflect the discipline required in real engineering work. He said that he prefers a new termto describe the growing use of AI tools in writing and maintaining software. In the post, Vembu said the focus should remain on solid engineering practices, even as AI becomes more deeply embedded in coding workflows.Sharing the post, Sridhar Vembu wrote:Vembu says that the term ACE does not remove the need for software engineers. Instead, it allows experienced engineers to “be much more productive”.Vibe coding is a term used to describe a more informal, AI-driven approach to programming. It refers to building apps and websites by chatting with AI instead of writing code line by painstaking line.Vembu’s comments come at a time when AI-powered coding tools are being widely adopted by developers and companies to speed up software development. His remarks also highlight concerns among industry leaders that such language may underplay the importance of structure, accountability, and long-term reliability in software systems.Collins Dictionary named “vibe-coding” as its word of the year for 2025.","Vibe coding is a term used to describe a more informal, AI-driven approach to programming.

What Tim Cook means by “loving museums”



Apple CEO Tim Cook (Image source: Bloomberg)

“I don’t want to live in one”: A warning against stagnation



A lesson in leadership and decision-making



Why the quote resonates beyond technology



A reflection of Tim Cook’s leadership style



Why the quote still matters



""I love museums. But I don't want to live in one""

,





Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple , doesn't give long speeches or use dramatic slogans. When he does say something, it's usually short, to the point, and well thought out. One of these lines is his quote:. The sentence is easy to understand, like a conversation. But it has a deeper meaning about how to move forward, how to be a leader, and how businesses and people should plan for the future.The quote is based on the idea that honouring the past should never be a reason to stop moving forward. Museums are places where history is kept. They keep ideas, inventions, and events that changed the world. They help us remember where we came from. Tim Cook has never said that we should forget or ignore history. Instead, he says that it is dangerous to get too comfortable with it.In today's world, where things change quickly, especially in technology, staying still can cost you a lot. Cook's quote shows that progress means always moving forward, even when past success makes you feel safe.Museums are very important to society. They keep culture, new ideas, and human accomplishments safe. Future generations would lose touch with the ideas and work that shaped the past if there were no museums. Tim Cook saying ""love"" shows that he cares. He thinks it's important to learn from the past. He likes what has already been made.Apple has a long and well-known history. People often study and admire the company's past innovations, which include the Macintosh, the iPod, and the iPhone. A lot of these items are now on display in museums and exhibitions all over the world. Cook knows more about this legacy than most people.But liking someone doesn't mean you care about them. His quote makes it clear that history is important to learn about, but it shouldn't be a place where you want to stay, especially in an industry driven by constant innovation, progress, and forward-looking thinking.The second part of the quote is where the real meaning is. Living in a museum means being surrounded by things that have already been done, but not doing anything new. It means comfort, safety, and familiarity. That comfort can slowly turn into stagnation in business and leadership.Tim Cook has said many times that it's dangerous to depend too much on past successes. The markets change. Technology changes. People's needs change. What worked ten years ago might not work anymore. Businesses that only care about keeping their legacy alive often have a hard time staying relevant.Apple has kept changing under Cook's leadership. The business has grown into services, put more emphasis on user privacy, put money into protecting the environment, and moved into new areas like custom silicon chips. These choices show that the company is willing to try new things, even if the old ones worked.The quote is true for all leaders, not just Apple. People often praise leaders for their past successes. People trust you more when you have done well in the past. But depending too much on past success can keep you from coming up with new ideas.Cook's words make it sound like good leadership needs to be balanced. You can learn from history, but don't let it tell you what to do all the time. Don't let your past experiences tell you what to do. This method lets businesses change instead of fighting it.This idea also works for people. Careers, skills, and fields of work change over time. It can be harder to grow if you hold on too tightly to what used to work. The quote quietly encourages people to be open and curious, even when change is hard.This quote stands out because it is so simple. It doesn't use business jargon or technical language. People can all understand it. Most people know how nice it is to stick to their routines and how hard it is to try something new.In a more general sense, the quote talks about how societies deal with progress. Tradition and new ideas often clash with each other. It's important to respect culture and history, but it's also important to be open to new things. Cook's statement does not deny the past. It just won't let itself be limited by it.This balance is especially important now that technology is changing quickly and making people wonder about jobs, education, and social structures. The quote tells people that progress doesn't mean forgetting the past; it means building on it in a smart way.People often say that Tim Cook is calm, level-headed, and practical. His way of leading is different from Steve Jobs's, who was known for making bold and dramatic statements. Cook does things in a quieter way. His words are more likely to make you think than to make you angry.This quote fits that pattern. It doesn't need attention. It makes you think. It gives a point of view without making people agree. That restraint is one reason it feels real.The quote doesn't give a big picture; it gives a way of thinking. It talks about how Cook sees progress, responsibility, and long-term success.is still true because it describes a problem that everyone faces. How can we remember the past without letting it control us? How do we go on without losing what matters?It's clear but not obvious what Tim Cook means. Value history. Take something away from it. Then decide to go on.In one short sentence, the CEO of Apple reminds us that we can choose to make progress. It takes work, curiosity, and a willingness to go beyond what you already know. Museums keep the past alive. But the future is being built somewhere else.",Tim Cook's quote has a deeper meaning about how to move forward. It is based on the idea that honouring the past should never be a reason to stop moving forward. Living in a museum means being surrounded by things that have already been done.

Months after Donald Trump made an 'angry call' to Jeff Bezos; Amazon CEO Andy Jassy makes statement on Trump Tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/months-after-donald-trump-made-angry-call-to-jeff-bezos-after-learning-amazon-plans-to-display-added-cost-of-tariffs-ceo-andy-jassy-makes-statement-on-trump-tariffs/articleshow/126848913.cms,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy

When White House called Amazon's tariff plan an 'hostile act'





In April 2025, a pissed Donald Trump made a call to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos after learning that the company is planning to display the added cost of tariffs on certain items. Trump made the call to Bezos to complain about reports that Amazon was considering to highlight the cost of US tariffs next to prices for certain products on the company’s website. Trump later told reporters about the call to Amazon founder and said it was a “good call.” “Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific,” Trump told reporters. “He solved the problem very quickly. Good guy.”Punchbowl News first reported that Amazon will soon “display how much of an item’s cost is derived from tariffs — right next to the product’s total listed price.” The move came after Trump slapped 145% tariffs on imports from China and a 10% minimum tax on all other countries.Now months later, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC in an interview Jassy at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Amazon.com is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures stemming from the US President Donald Trump's tariffs. ""We did a lot of pre-buying in the early part of 2025 to enable us to try and keep prices as low as possible for customers,"" Jassy said.He added, ""And a lot of our third-party sellers did a lot of forward-staging in our fulfillment network for the same reasons. And that supply is run out in the fall, so you start to see some of the tariffs creep in to some of the prices, some of the items.""""Some third-party sellers are raising prices in response while others are absorbing the costs in hopes of driving more demand,"" Jassy went on to add. ""Our priority is to try to figure out how to keep prices low as possible,"" Jassy said. ""At a certain point, because retail is a mid-single-digit operating margin business, if people's costs go up by 10%, there aren't a lot of places to absorb it.""The warning marks a shift from the Amazon leader's commentary on tariffs last year. While he cautioned in April that third-party sellers could need to pass along tariff costs, he said on several occasions that Amazon had not seen selling prices appreciably rise from tariffs. ""Amazon's consumers overall have fared well. But we'll have to see what happens in 2026,"" CEO Jassy had said.The company has also maintained so far that over the past year it was seeing very little impact on consumer behavior and product prices from tariffs. It has doubled down on expanding product categories and speeding up delivery timelines to shield demand.In April 2025, at a briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called the move a “hostile and political act,” adding that she had spoken about the matter with President Trump earlier. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed Levitt’s comments, saying it’s a hostile act if a company goes out of its way to “make it seem” like tariffs have caused prices to change.“It’s nonsense,” he said Tuesday in a CNBC interview. “A 10% tariff is not going to change virtually any price,” he added, referring to the nearly universal baseline tariff on all countries. “The only price will change would be a product that we don’t make here, like a mango.” The 10% tariff, however, is hardly the only one in effect.",Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says the company is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures.

Debate at Davos



Palantir CEO Alex Karp says certain tech employees will be valuable and highly paid







Palantir CEO Alex Karp has now issued a stark warning about the future of work in the age of artificial intelligence. Karp predicted that humanities-based jobs will now be among the first casualties. As reported by Business Insider, speaking during a panel at the World Economic Forum, Karp revealed that his own academic background which is a philosophy degree from Haverford College, a law degree from Stanford, and a Ph.D. in social theory from Germany, cautioned that such qualifications may no longer be viable. “AI will destroy humanities jobs,” Karp said. “You went to an elite school, and you studied philosophy — hopefully you have some other skill, because that skillset is going to be very hard to market.”Karp believes that workers with technical and vocational training will be in then highest demand. He quoted battery manufacturing as an exampple, nothing that technicians in such industries are “very valuable, if not irreplaceable.” “There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training,” Karp told BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who moderated the discussion.Not all leaders at Davos agreed with Karp’s assessment. Finance executives told Business Insider that liberal arts degrees may actually become more valuable, as AI takes over routine financial analysis. Critical and creative thinking, they argued, is increasingly prized in young recruits.Meanwhile, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei highlighted another trend: entry-level hiring is already declining due to AI. Amodei said software and coding roles at Anthropic were down across junior and mid-level positions.Recently, Karp said that value of skilled workers is rising.

Bill Gates and Melinda Gates divorce





Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever. According to a report in Forbes, the amount has surfaced in a tax filing. As per the report Bill Gates donation skyrocketed Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation's assets by more than 1,000% to about $7.4 billion in 2024. As the number went up from $604 million at the end of 2023 to $7.4 billion.The $7.88 billion donation was made in 2024 to the Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation, according to a newly released tax filing reviewed by the New York Times’ DealBook. Philanthropies Foundation focuses on women and families. The tax filing is said to mark the first time that concrete financial terms of the Gates’ 2021 divorce have been made public. Melinda Gates also manages some of her investments and charitable work through Pivotal Ventures, the investment company founded in 2015.Bill Gates and Melinda Gates announced their decision to formally separate their philanthropic work in 2024, three years after their divorce became public.In May 2024, Melinda French Gates said that she leaving the charitable foundation she co-founded with Bill Gates more than 20 years ago. Her last day at the foundation was June 7, 2024.""Under the terms of my agreement with Bill, in leaving the foundation, I will have an additional $12.5 billion to commit to my work on behalf of women and families,"" Melinda Gates said then in a post on social media platform X, without disclosing more details about her plans. Post her departure as co-chair, the foundation changed its name to Gates Foundation and with Bill Gates as its sole chairperson. It’s unclear where the additional $4.6 billion was allocated. The funds could have been given to French Gates’ LLC, Pivotal, which does not file a tax return, according to DealBook. As running alongside Pivotal Philanthropies is Pivotal Ventures, a LLC that does not require disclosure requirements that govern traditional nonprofits.""I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,"" Bill Gates wrote in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).In May 2021, Bill and Melinda French Gates announced their intention to divorce, saying they no longer believed they could “grow together”. Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board in 2020, months before the divorce was announced. The couple also reportedly agreed to the division of real estate valued at more than $170 million, an art collection worth roughly $130 million and a significant block of Microsoft stock.In March 2022, Melinda Gates claimed that Jeffrey Epstein played a role in ending their 27-year marriage. During an appearance on “CBS Mornings,” Melinda shared that she decided to leave her marriage “for many things,” including her ex-husband’s ties to Epstein. “I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” she said at the time, adding that she only met the late pedophile once because she “wanted to see who” he was.Melinda Gates has a net worth of $17.6 billion, as per Bloomberg Billioniare Index. Most of her wealth comes from her share of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, significant assets transferred during her 2021 divorce from Bill Gates (including billions in stocks and real estate), and her own organization, Pivotal Ventures, focused on women's equality.","Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever.

Meta investors raises concerns





Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse. Quoting people familiar with the development, a Bloomberg report says that the job cuts come as the company shifts priorities to build next-generation artificial intelligence (AI). It states that the latest job cuts may put breaks on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's long-chased vision of building virtual reality for the metaverse which started in 2014 with the acquisition of virtual reality start-up Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion. Another step in this direction came in 2021, when Facebook rebranded itself as Meta.Meta’s Reality Labs Division roughly has 15,000 employees. According to the Bloomberg report, Meta may announce the cuts to Reality Labs as soon as January 13, 2025. Sources told the publication that layoffs are said to disproportionately affect those in the metaverse unit who work on virtual reality (VR) headsets and a VR-based social network.As per a memo sent by the company to employees last week, Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, who also heads Reality Labs, has called for a ‘most important’ meeting on Wednesday - January 14, asking staff to attend in person.Last year, Zuckerberg asked top executives to make cuts to their 2026 budgets while he pours money into A.I. research. As Meta faces competition from companies like OpenAI and Google, Mr. Zuckerberg has increased the budget for TBD Lab, the skunk works unit at Meta that aims to build superintelligence, a godlike AI system.As reported by Bloomberg, the company also plans to reallocate some of the money from virtual reality products to increase the budget for its wearables division, which builds smart glasses and wristband computing devices.Despite the company spending tens of billions of dollars on developing virtual reality headset, the consumer response has been slower than expected. Investors have grown wary of Meta’s spending.In December last year, a company spokeswoman said Meta was “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward A.I. glasses,” and was not planning “any broader changes.”","Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse.

Elon Musk makes a robot promise





Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made his first-ever appearance on the stage of World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos, Switzerland. In front of a packed conference hall, Musk took the stage at the global conference he has long derided as ""boring"" confab of out-of-touch elites. And the man who interviewed Elon Musk is Blackrock CEO Larry Fink. Introducing Elon Musk, Fink said, ""There are so many myths around Elon Musk. I could tell you he is a great friend, and I constantly learn so much from him. I am totally inspired by what he has done... Who he is... His vision of the future, and I don't think it's such a bad future.""Musk showed up with a lighthearted tweet before taking the stage: “Speaking @wef in 20 mins. What should I say?,"" wrote Musk. Talking of Tesla, Musk said, ""Tesla is likely to win regulatory approval in Europe and China as early as next month for its driver-supervised Full Self-Driving system."" His comments come as the electric automaker looks to boost software revenue amid slowing vehicle sales. ""We hope to get Supervised Full Self-Driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month, and then maybe a similar timing for ‌China,"" Musk said.Tesla has been seeking approval for the system in Europe, where tougher vehicle safety rules and a fragmented regulatory framework have slowed deployment compared with the US. FSD is classified as an advanced driver assistance feature that requires drivers to remain attentive, and regulators have scrutinized it amid concerns over the safety and oversight of automated driving technologies. At Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting in November 2025, Musk said that an upcoming FSD update, Version 14, would finally allow for unsupervised driving. “And now with version 14, we’re actually getting to the point where we almost feel comfortable allowing people to text and drive,” Musk said at the event. “Which is kind of the killer app, because that’s really what people want to do.”Elon Musk also made a robot promise at the event. Musk said that Tesla expects to sell humanoid robots to the public by the end of next year, later than the timeline he had previously outlined. ""Who wouldn't want a robot to watch over your kids, take care of your pet... If you had a robot that could take care and protect an elderly parent, that'd be great,"" he told the audience.His Optimus robots will be doing more complex tasks later this year, he said, and ""by the end of next year I think we'll be selling humanoid robots to the public"". Musk also predicted the artificial intelligence boom will have models that are ""smarter than any human by the end of this year, and I would say no later than next year"".","Elon Musk made his first appearance at the World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos, Switzerland.

Reports claim that top executives of iPhone maker Apple have booked extended hotel stays in an effort to come to terms with memory manufacturers Samsung and SK Hynix and secure a memory supply that will last between two and three years. For a company that ships iPhones in millions, reaching an agreement is of paramount importance. Other PC and smartphone makers like Google, Microsoft and Dell have also been reportedly visiting Samsung’s and SK Hynix’s headquarters to secure sufficient DRAM supply. The ongoing memory crisis has made the shares and revenue of these companies touch new heights.Interestingly not just pure-play memory product companies, shares of also of those in related businesses are at all time high. Case in point are several Japanese companies. Shares of Japanese toilet maker Toto are at their 52-week high. Toto shares have reportedly gained the most in five years. Reason is AI after booming memory demand excited expectations of growth in Toto's little-known chipmaking materials operations. According to a report in Bloomberg, the stock surged as much as 11%, its steepest rise since February 2021, after Goldman Sachs analysts said that Toto’s electrostatic chucks used in NAND chipmaking will likely benefit from an AI infrastructure buildout that’s tightening supplies of both high-end and commodity memory.The company’s new domain business accounted for 42% of its total operating income in the fiscal year ended March 2025, Bloomberg-compiled data show.Incidentally, Japan’s long history in chip production has led many companies, including unlikely names like consumer product manufacturers, to build out semiconductor-related operations. MSG seasoning inventor Ajinomoto produces chip insulating films — a business that arose from its command of amino acids. Cosmetics firm Kao, which sells facial cleansers, also has a chip wafer cleaning business.Analysts Sachiko Okada and Sayako Tominaga raised their rating for Toto to Buy from Neutral, citing hopes for “significant profit growth” from the company's chuck-making business. The memory industry’s “tight supply/demand environment” will be a tailwind, they said.Toto is known for its heated toilet seats, the maker of washlets has for decades been. The company has been a part of the semiconductor and display supply chain via its advanced ceramic parts and films. According to Toto’s website, company's electrostatic chucks — which it began mass producing in 1988 — are used to hold silicon wafers in place during chipmaking while helping to control temperature and contamination,Technology companies including Meta Platforms and Amazon are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into data centers for artificial intelligence services, triggering widespread shortages of semiconductors. That’s spurring memory makers around the world to ramp up production, from SK Hynix to Samsung Electronics and Kioxia Holdings, and lifting demand for products such as Toto’s.",Shares of Japanese toilet maker Toto are at their 52-week high.

Read Autodesk CEO Andrew Anagnost’s full note on the latest job cuts

“I recognise the weight of this news, particularly as it follows the organisational changes we made last year.

I want to be clear that this will not become an annual process at Autodesk, and these changes are not driven by the external environment or an effort to replace people with AI. We remain steadfast in our belief that technology is only as powerful as the people who use it and humans will always be the most important part of the equation.

This announcement reflects a deliberate decision by leadership to align our organisation with our long-term strategy and the opportunities ahead.

A note of thanks

To our team members who are impacted, I want to extend my sincere appreciation for your contributions to Autodesk. Many of you have been instrumental in the transformation journey that brought us to where we are today. You have built the foundation of this company and will always be a part of Autodesk’s story.

What to expect next

Autodesk will immediately begin the process of informing employees whose roles may be impacted.

These conversations will take place beginning January 22. Employees whose role may be impacted will hear directly from a leader in their management chain, though timing and approach will vary by country. In a few countries, this is a consultative process which will be conducted in accordance with local laws, with decisions finalised once the process has concluded.

We are committed to treating impacted employees with care, respect, and transparency.

Autodesk will support any exiting employees throughout this process with severance, benefits continuation, and career transition assistance, where applicable.

Looking forward

To the team taking us forward, saying goodbye to colleagues while also supporting the company’s evolution is incredibly difficult. I recognise the uncertainty this brings, but these choices are essential to our readiness to lead the next era of Design and Make.

I am confident in our strategy and in the people of Autodesk who will bring it to life. As I said at Investor Day, our best days and biggest growth opportunities are ahead of us. And I’ve never been more confident in the long-term value we are creating, for our customers and for the industries that shape the world.

Thank you for your continued dedication to our mission and to each other.

Design software maker Autodesk has announced its latest round of job cuts. In an SEC filing, the company confirmed that it is set to lay off about 7% of its workforce globally, or roughly 1,000 employees. A significant portion of the reductions will be in customer-facing sales roles, the company said in the regulatory filing.Autodesk, which had about 15,300 employees as of January 31, 2025, said it expects to complete the restructuring plan by the end of its fourth quarter of fiscal 2027, subject to local law and consultation requirements. The company plans to reinvest part of the savings into strategic priorities across the business during the fiscal year ending January 31, 2027.​​The company described this change as the final step in a several-year effort to update how it sells and markets its products. Autodesk is moving away from its old method, which relied heavily on resellers and distributors, and switching to subscriptions and pay-as-you-use pricing. This new model allows the company to exercise greater direct control over prices and customer relationships.In the SEC filing, Autodesk CEO and President Andrew Anagnost wrote,","Design software maker Autodesk has announced its latest round of job cuts.

What Elon Musk said about Tesla’s Cybercab and Optimus production capabilities

“With the important caveat that initial production is always very slow and follows an S-curve. The speed of the production ramp is inversely proportionate to how many new parts and steps there are. For Cybercab and Optimus, almost everything is new, so the early production rate will be agonisingly slow but eventually end up being insanely fast.”

“Tesla Cybercab production starts in less than 100 days from today, which will use Tesla's revolutionary unboxed manufacturing process for the first time.

One Cybercab will be able to roll off the production line in under 10 seconds versus 34 seconds for Model Y, with a long-term cycle time goal of ~5 seconds.”

Elon Musk has shared an update on Tesla’s Cybercab robotaxi and Optimus robot production capabilities. In a post shared on X (formerly Twitter), the CEO of the electric vehicle-making company has warned that the production of Tesla's Cybercab robotaxi and Optimus robot will initially be. This suggests that Musk is bracing for another round of production challenges as the company prepares to begin manufacturing both products this year.Tesla is set to start production of the Cybercab, a sleek two-seater robotaxi that Musk has said will ship without a steering wheel or pedals, in April. Musk is targeting an eventual production goal of 2 million units a year. Meanwhile, Optimus, the company’s humanoid robot designed to help with everyday tasks, is set to enter production by the end of 2026, with Musk saying Tesla could eventually make one million a year.In his X post, Musk wrote:Musk’s explanation came as a reply to a post shared by another user who shared a video from a Cybercab production facility and wrote:Musk's comments match what Tesla may have been telling its employees. According to an earlier report by Business Insider, the company's VP of AI software told staff on Tesla's Autopilot and Optimus teams that 2026 would be the ""hardest year"" of their lives during an all-hands meeting in October 2025.At the same time, Musk also told investors that it would take a while to reach that goal, as the company was having to build almost the entire supply chain from scratch, with production moving at the speed of the “slowest, dumbest, least lucky thing out of 10,000 unique items.”This is not the first time Tesla has faced a difficult road as it planned on expanding an ambitious new product. The company went through a famously difficult period, which Musk called ""production hell,"" while building its Model 3 EV in 2017. Musk and other employees ended up sleeping on the factory floor as they struggled to expand production of the mass-market model.Tesla also faced production challenges with the Cybertruck, the company's last new vehicle. The electric pickup's unique design and stainless steel-clad structure made it highly challenging to produce at scale, and Musk acknowledged in 2023 that Tesla had “dug its own grave” with the Cybertruck's design.The electric truck also serves as a warning for Musk's ambitious production goals. Musk's predictions that Tesla could produce 250,000 Cybertrucks a year eventually fell short, with industry data showing the company sold just over 20,000 Cybertrucks in the US last year.The company also launched an autonomous ride-hailing service in Austin in June 2025. Still, the fleet has only a small number of Model Y robotaxis on the road in the city and has yet to remove human safety monitors from its vehicles entirely.","Elon Musk has shared an update on Tesla’s Cybercab robotaxi and Optimus robot production capabilities.

South Korean startups are not happy: ‘Why do we have to be first?’





South Korea officially rolled out the AI Basic Act, marking what the government describes as the world’s first comprehensive legal framework for artificial intelligence (AI). The move, however, has reportedly sparked immediate pushback from local startups that fear “regulatory risk” could stifle innovation before it even begins. According to a report by news agency Reuters, through this act, the country aims to secure its place as a top three global AI powerhouse.This also means that the launch also puts South Korea ahead of the European Union (EU), whose landmark AI Act is being implemented in slower phases through 2027. Seoul’s unified law consolidates 19 separate regulatory proposals and is now fully operational across both the public and private sectors.Under the South Korea’s AI laws, companies must ensure human oversight in “high-impact” AI areas such as nuclear safety, the production of drinking water, transport, healthcare and financial uses such as credit evaluation and loan screening.Another rule says that AI companies are required to provide users advance notice about products and provide clear labelling or watermarking for AI-generated output, which is difficult to distinguish from reality.The rules also provide minimum one-year grace period during which no administrative fines will be issued but the startup community is sounding the alarm. According to a survey by the Startup Alliance, only 2% of AI-focused startups feel they have a formal compliance plan in place. Moreover, about half of them admit they do not fully understand the new law.“There’s a bit of resentment — why do we have to be the first to do this?” Lim Jung-wook, co-head of the Startup Alliance, was quoted as saying. Founders are concerned about the law’s “vague” language, fearing it may force them to adopt overly cautious development strategies.President Lee Jae-myung, meanwhile, expressed sympathy for these concerns, urging policymakers to maximise the industry’s potential through institutional support while “pre-emptively managing anticipated side effects.”The Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) has launched a dedicated AI Act Support Desk to help companies determine their regulatory status. If companies fail to comply after the grace period, they may be fined up to 30 million won ($20,400), which the government notes is significantly more “moderate” as compared to penalties in the EU’s framework.","South Korea officially rolled out the AI Basic Act, marking what the government describes as the world’s first comprehensive legal framework for artificial intelligence.

First Lady's 'True' Motive EXPOSED | WATCH

Read First Lady Melania Trump’s full speech on Age of Imagination

We are living in the Age of Imagination.

The Age of Imagination is a new era, powered by artificial intelligence, where one’s curiosity can be satisfied almost magically, in seconds. You are fortunate to have the capability to fulfill your dreams through the power of learning, with AI serving as the primary engine for creative exploration.

History reminds us that curiosity is the driving force behind every great achievement. The world’s greatest minds – our writers, architects, scientists, and painters – all had endless interest about human nature, and they all questioned that which was yet to be answered.

Are you ready to produce your own movie? Do you want to build the next Dress to Impress empire? Have you ever wondered how to become the next master artist? Create your own song?

Every giant, at some point in time, questions the status quo. Their singular vision pushes humanity in a new direction.

Artificial intelligence is changing today’s world, and your curiosity should serve as the driving force. For the first time in history, the young girl dreaming of becoming a fashion designer and the young boy who wants to stand-up his cool animated superhero series can do so, from their own home.

Artificial Intelligence provides all the tools needed to implement your creative vision – today. You can develop movie characters, scripts, fashion, music, art – the entire ecosystem. All with AI.

But, what do you need to start? You need to harness your Imagination. In the new AI era, the most powerful skill is knowing what to ask, why it matters, and how to think beyond the first answer.

I encourage you to be stubbornly curious, think outside the box, and question everything.

Creators must stretch their minds to think differently. The world of possibility is endless, and AI is extending the conceptual in ways never dreamed of before. In the past, memorization unlocked opportunity. Today, your curiosity will open new doors to meaning, innovation, and leadership.

But we must remember, although artificial intelligence can generate images and information, only humans can generate meaning and purpose. Deep thinking, patience, and staying curious are where purpose begins.

Today, I urge you to take action: use AI to unlock new parts of your imagination. Lead with your ideas, stay sharp, but remember – never surrender your thinking to AI.

Choose to let your imagination drive your intellectual progress. But never use AI as a quick solution. Be intellectually honest with yourself – use AI as a tool – but do not let it replace your personal intelligence.

Pursue understanding with passion like no generation before. Make an impact.





First Lady Melania Trump has spoken on the shifting landscape of work and education as the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has sparked concern over job displacement. She said that while the technology is hollowing out traditional roles rooted in memorisation, it is also elevating a new set of human skills to be at forefront of the global economy. Trump’s message to the next generation is clear: the most valuable asset in the modern world is not technical coding or data processing, it is the ability to ask the right questions.“In the new AI era, the most powerful skill is knowing what to ask, why it matters, and how to think beyond the first answer,” Trump said at the recently held Zoom Ahead: AI for tomorrow's leaders event.“I encourage you to be stubbornly curious, think outside the box, and question everything,” she added.

What Terry Reintke said in her speech

European Parliament freezes EU‑US tariff deal





Tesla CEO Elon Musk has sent a 'suicide message' to European leaders. Responding to a post on X, formerly Twitter, Elon Musk wrote, ""Why are the EU politicians so insistent on Europe committing suicide?"" Musk was responding to a reply to a video posted by Terry Reintke, co-president of the Greens/EFA group in the European Parliament. In the video, she is talking about the need of unity among European nations and why, as per her, US President Donald Trump does not like a United Europe. Replying to this video, X user Hunter Ash, wrote: Actually Trump just wants you to stop committing cultural and economic suicide.Reintke speech comes amid escalating US-EU trade tensions over Greenland acquisition proposals. In the speech, she claims to contrast Trump's ""egoism and brute power politics"" with the EU's emphasis on multilateral cooperation, universal healthcare, and workers' rights as models for international order.Elon Musk has not been a fan of European Union (EU). In a post in December 2025, he asked for abolition of EU. ""The EU should be abolished and sovereignty returned to individual countries, so that governments can better represent their people,"" wrote Musk. He was joined in his opposition by several top members of the Trump administration, including the president himself, who said Europe was ""heading in a very bad direction"".Terry Reintke, co-president of the Greens/EFA group in the European Parliament, posted the video of her plenary speech criticizing Donald Trump's post-inauguration tariff threats against six EU nations, framing them as attacks on Europe's potential as a global force for democracy and social welfare.""“Europe must stand strong and united against the US President’s threats. You stop a bully only by standing firm and showing strength. For now, a trade deal is off the table. A strong European response means triggering the Anti-Coercion Instrument and targeting US Big Tech and its enormous profits in the EU. Discussions on Europe’s strategic autonomy must now translate into actions. Europe urgently needs to become independent from the US. As the world’s largest single market, the EU has the power to stand up to the US President, it just needs to use it,"" Reintke said.The European Parliament has decided to halt work on implementing the grinding trade‑tariff agreement reached this summer between Brussels and Washington: “If he wants access to the single market at zero tariffs, be reliable,” Manfred Weber, president of the European People’s Party, said. Trump’s threats to Greenland and the EU have given new vigour to a pro-European alliance that seemed to be dying.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has sent a'suicide message' to European leaders.

He fears unchecked AI could lead to our extinction, lamenting the world's insufficient seriousness regarding these profound risks. Hinton stresses an urgent need for research to ensure peaceful coexistence as AI rapidly approaches and surpasses human intelligence.

“If we create them so they don't care about us, they will probably wipe us out.”

""very sad""

""It makes me very sad that I put my life into developing this stuff and that it's now extremely dangerous and people aren't taking the dangers seriously enough,""

""We've never been in this situation before of being able to produce things more intelligent than ourselves,""

Dangers Of AI: Is ChatGPT Quietly Harming Your Mental Health? | Global Pulse

“The idea that you could just turn it off won't work,”

Why Geoffrey Hinton thinks regulating AI now may be more complicated than ever

“It would have been developed without me. I don't think I made any decisions that I wouldn't make the same way if I had the same knowledge,”

“We're at a very crucial point in history when we're going to develop things more intelligent than ourselves fairly soon. We haven't done the research to figure out if we can peacefully coexist with them. It's crucial we do that research,”





Computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton, known as the ‘Godfather of AI’, has warned about the biggest AI mistake humans can make now. In a recent interview on BBC Newsnight, Hinton noted that the biggest mistake humans can make will be failing to invest in research into how to coexist with the intelligent systems they created. He warned,Hinton also described feelingabout the technology that he helped create and what he says is the world's failure to take its growing risks seriously.Hinton said in the interview.He added that humanity is approaching a critical moment as researchers move closer to building machines more intelligent than humans.Hinton added, noting that many experts believe that AI will surpass human intelligence within the next 20 years, while in many areas, it already has.Once that happens, he said, controlling such systems may become far more difficult than many assume.Hinton mentioned, adding that a sufficiently advanced AI could persuade humans not to shut it down.Hinton helped create the neural networks that form the foundation of modern artificial intelligence and has become one of the field's most vocal critics as AI systems grow more powerful and widespread.He has predicted that AI could cause widespread job losses, fuel social unrest, and eventually outsmart humans. Hinton has even said that researchers should focus more on how advanced systems are trained, including ensuring they are designed to protect human interests.Hinton noted that he is even worried that AI is being released at a time when countries are finding it harder to work together. He also pointed to the rise of authoritarian politics, which makes strong regulation more difficult. Hinton compared the need to manage AI to global agreements that control chemical and nuclear weapons.Even with these concerns, Hinton said he would not take back his work on AI.he added.Hinton said he is still hopeful about how AI can help improve education and healthcare. He mentioned AI tutors and progress in medical imaging as examples of how the technology could be helpful. However, Hinton stressed that action is needed quickly.he explained.","Geoffrey Hinton, known as the ‘Godfather of AI’, has warned about the biggest AI mistake humans can make now.

Several tech leaders have highlighted AI-led job cuts but also pointed out that the technology has the capacity to create entirely new roles. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has predicted an unexpected gold rush in certain types of low-paying jobs. Speaking at the World Economic Forum 2026 in Davos, Switzerland, Huang declared that the massive infrastructure required to power the AI data centres will transform traditional 'blue-collar' jobs into six-figure careers.Huang argued that the $7 trillion global push to build data centers and “AI factories” represents the largest infrastructure buildout in human history, essentially pointing out that the AI will not be confined to software engineers but also people who are physically building these massive centres.“First of all, uh this is the largest infrastructure buildout in human history. That's going to that's going to create a lot of jobs. And it's it's wonderful that that the jobs are related to tradecraft. We're going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steel workers and network technicians and people who who install and fit out the equipment and all of these jobs we're going to in the United States we're seeing quite a significant boom in this area.The salaries have gone up nearly double. And so we're talking about six figure salaries for for people who are building uh chip factories or computer factories or AI factories,” he said in conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, emphasising that the path to a high-paying career is changing.“And we have a great shortage in that and and I'm really delighted to see so so many people in so many countries really recognizing this important area. You know, everybody everybody should be able to make a great living,” he added.Adding to Huang’s prediction, BlackRock's Larry Fink said, “I’ve even told members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians that we need to build out AI data centers. We just don’t have enough.”Last year in October, Huang said demand for electricians, plumbers and carpenters will rise sharply as the construction of data centres accelerates.“If you’re an electrician, you’re a plumber, a carpenter—we’re going to need hundreds of thousands of them to build all of these factories. The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a boom. You’ve going to have to be doubling and doubling and doubling every single year,” Huang told Channel 4 News in the UK.The Nvidia CEO also said he would choose physical sciences over software if he were a student today. “For the young, 20-year-old Jensen, that’s graduated now, he probably would have chosen…more of the physical sciences than the software sciences,” he said.",Jensen Huang said the massive infrastructure required to power the AI data centres will transform traditional 'blue-collar' jobs into six-figure careers.

"As OpenAI is 'about to fall apart' predictions make headlines, Sam Altman goes to Middle East to participate in ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/as-openai-is-about-to-fall-apart-predictions-make-headlines-sam-altman-goes-to-middle-east-to-participate-in-/articleshow/127149007.cms,"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is reportedly seeking a $50 billion investment from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds amidst warnings of the AI company's rapid decline. Despite a $500 billion valuation, OpenAI faces significant financial challenges, talent exodus, and a lawsuit from Elon Musk, as competition intensifies and AI hype potentially peaks.

What investor George Noble warned about OpenAI

“completely unsustainable.”

Here’s George Noble’s full note on OpenAI

“OPENAI IS FALLING APART IN REAL TIME

I've watched companies implode for decades.

This one has all the warning signs.

OpenAI declared ""Code Red"" in December.

Altman sent an internal memo telling employees to drop everything because Google's Gemini 3 is eating their lunch. Salesforce CEO

Marc Benioff

publicly ditched ChatGPT for Gemini after using it for two hours.

ChatGPT traffic fell in November. Second month-over-month decline of 2025. Meanwhile Gemini jumped to 650 million monthly active users.

The company that was supposed to build AGI can't keep its chatbot competitive.

But the real story is the money...

OpenAI lost $12 BILLION in a single quarter according to Microsoft's own fiscal disclosures.

Deutsche Bank estimates $143 billion in cumulative negative cash flow before the company turns profitable.

Their analysts put it bluntly: ""No startup in history has operated with losses on anything approaching this scale.""

They're burning $15 million per day on Sora alone.

$5 billion annually to generate copyright-infringing memes.

Even Sora's lead engineer admitted the ""economics are currently completely unsustainable.""

Here's the big math problem nobody wants to discuss:

It's going to cost 5x the energy and money to make these models 2x better.

The low-hanging fruit is gone.

Every incremental improvement now requires exponentially more compute, more data centers, more power.

Reports suggest OpenAI's large training runs in 2025 failed to produce models better than prior versions.

GPT-5 launched to widespread disappointment. Users called it ""underwhelming"" and ""horrible.""

OpenAI had to restore GPT-4o within 24 hours because users preferred the old model.

Altman had promised GPT-5 would make GPT-4 feel ""mildly embarrassing."" Instead, users complained it was worse at basic math and geography.

They've released GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2 since.

Same complaints each time: too corporate, too safe, robotic, boring.

The talent exodus makes this even worse:

CTO Mira Murati. Gone.

Chief Research Officer

Bob McGrew

. Gone.

Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever.

Gone.

President

Greg Brockman

. Gone.

Half the AI safety team departed. Multiple executives reportedly cited ""psychological abuse"" under Altman's leadership.

And now Elon Musk is suing for up to $134 billion.

A federal judge just ruled the case goes to jury trial in April. There's ""plenty of evidence"" that OpenAI's leaders promised to maintain the nonprofit structure that Musk funded.

Musk provided $38 million in early funding based on those assurances.

Now he wants his share of the $500 billion valuation.

OpenAI called it ""harassment."" But the judge disagreed.

Here's what I think happens next:

The AI hype cycle is peaking.

The diminishing returns are becoming impossible to hide.

Competitors are catching up.

The lawsuits are piling up.

OpenAI needs to generate $200 billion in annual revenue by 2030 to justify their projections.

That's 15x growth in five years while costs keep exploding.

Even Sam Altman admitted investors are ""overexcited"" about AI.

His exact words: ""Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money.""

If I were running an AI startup with good traction right now, I'd be looking for an exit. Sell into the hype before the music stops.

My positioning:

I'm not touching OpenAI-adjacent plays at these valuations. The risk profile is astronomical.

If you're exposed to the Magnificent 7 through AI infrastructure bets, consider trimming.

The gap between promised revolution and delivered reality has never been wider.

The smart money is rotating into sectors where valuations actually reflect fundamentals.

Small and mid-caps are trading near decade lows relative to Big Tech while earnings growth is only marginally lower.

Markets can price risk. But they can't price chaos.

And OpenAI is chaos dressed up in a $500 billion valuation.”

AI and global imbalance

Alex Karp believes AI will destroy these jobs





Palantir CEO Alex Karp has issued a stark warning about Europe’s lagging technology adoption during a conversation with BalckRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum. Karp praised the artificial intelligence simply for its ability to bolster civil liberties and transform healthcare, but he also expressed deep concerns over structural resistance of Europe in embracing digital innovation.Karp also made some pointed remarks at Europe’s political inertia. “The tech adoption in Europe is a serious and very, very structural problem,” he said. “What scares me the most is, I haven’t seen any political leader just stand up and say we have a serious and structural problem that we are going to fix.” He contrasted this with the U.S. and China, which he said have both found scalable models for AI deployment.Karp highlighted Palantir’s role in supporting hospitals across the globe and noted that many face intake inefficiencies and staffing shortages. “They are working in a low-margin environment,” he said, “but every single one has a different way of processing patients.” He further added that AI can streamline these systems and allow hospitals to process cases “10 to 15 times faster,” ultimately saving lives.Contrary go the popular belief, Karp argued that AI improves transparency ad fairness. “It bolsters civil liberties,” he said, pointing to AI’s ability to reveal whether patients were processed based on economic status or background.“We can granularly show why someone came in, why they were taken, why they were rejected — and do it in a way that makes business sense.”When asked if AI would deepen global inequality, Karp acknowledged that America and China are accelerating far ahead. “They both work at scale,” he said. “And I think that is very likely to accelerate way beyond what most people believe is possible.” He warned that the long-term impact of AI is being underestimated, with discount rates on its societal transformation “way too high.”As reported by Business Insider, speaking during a panel at the World Economic Forum, Karp revealed that his own academic background which is a philosophy degree from Haverford College, a law degree from Stanford, and a Ph.D. in social theory from Germany, cautioned that such qualifications may no longer be viable. “AI will destroy humanities jobs,” Karp said. “You went to an elite school, and you studied philosophy — hopefully you have some other skill, because that skillset is going to be very hard to market. ”Karp believes that workers with technical and vocational training will be in then highest demand. He quoted battery manufacturing as an exampple, nothing that technicians in such industries are “very valuable, if not irreplaceable.” “There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training,” Karp told BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who moderated the discussion.","Palantir CEO Alex Karp has issued a stark warning about Europe’s lagging technology adoption. “The tech adoption in Europe is a serious and very, very structural problem,” he said.

Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary has responded to Elon Musk ’s call for buying the Ireland-based airline group with a pointed lesson on ‘European reality’. He provided an explanation into the complexities of international aviation law and effectively grounding the billionaire's hypothetical takeover. His comments came after the Tesla CEO called him “idiot” and an “insufferable chimp”, and launched a viral poll asking his 232 million followers if he should purchase the Irish budget carrier“As a non-European he [Musk] can't acquire or take ownership of the company. European Union (EU) rules mean that European Airlines, like American Airlines in the states, must be owned and controlled by Europeans and in the states they insist that they're you're not supposed to be owned and controlled by Americans as well, so it's good knock about stuff,” O'Leary said in an interview this week.However, he welcomed any investment by Musk, saying that it will be a better deal for the SpaceX CEO than X (formerly Twitter).“Elon Musk is very welcome to buy shares in Ryanair, I think it'd be a great investment for Elon Musk, certainly a better investment than X has been for him,” the Ryanair CEO added.The response comes follows a week of heated rhetoric on X (formerly Twitter), during which Musk labeled O'Leary an “idiot” and an “insufferable chimp” following the airline's refusal to adopt Starlink satellite internet.“I think I probably agree with him. I have four teenage children who regularly call me an idiot and insufferable chimp. The good news, though, is that it has delivered a dramatic increase in footfall coming to the Ryanair website over the last five days,” O’Leary said.“We have seen a significant increase in bookings, and as a result, we've launched a “big idiots seat sale” for the current three days where people can buy Reiner tickets for just 17 quid and travel during January, February, March or April. So it's all good stuff, and if it helps Reiner bookings and help Reiner sales, I'm all in favour of it,” he added.The CEO also announced that Ryanair will send a free round-trip ticket to the X office.“To encourage him, we're sending a round trip to the Twitter offices.

Kevin O’Leary’s China warning for America





Canadian billionaire and investor Kevin O’Leary has now issued a blunt warning to job seekers. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) O’Leary said that of you are not on LinkedIn, the employers will notice but not in a good way. O’Leary emphasised that the first stop for recruiters is LinkedIn and a profile missing from the professional networking platform is considered to be a ‘red flag’. “First stop when we’re hiring? LinkedIn. No profile? That’s a red flag. We check your posts, your history, your digital footprint... everything.If you want to lead, work remotely, or grow your career, you must understand how social media really works,” wrote O’Leary.O’Leary is of the opinion that hiring managers now scrutinise not just the work history but also a candidate’s entire online presence. He has urged the professionals to treat their digital profiles as part of their personal brand, especially in a job market increasingly shaped by remote work and online visibility.As per O’Leary, understanding how social media works is no longer optional for career growth. “If you want to lead, work remotely, or grow your career, you must understand how social media really works,” he said.The comments made by O’Leary highlight a broader shift in hiring practices, where digital presence and personal branding play a growing role in recruitment decisions.Along with this, he also shared some insights of his personal productivity habits and evolving views on career success. O’Leary revealed that he wakes up at 5 a.m. and that to without an alarm. He follows global news, exercise daily and maintains a strict routine and diet which helps him to stay focused.Recently, O’Leary raised alarm on America’s ability to sustain its artificial intelligence boom, bluntly declaring that the United States lacks the physical infrastructure to power the technology it pioneered. In a post shared on social media platform (formerly known as Twitter) O’Leary argued that while AI productivity has fuelled record highs in the S&P 500 across all 11 sectors over the past two years, the U.S. energy grid is dangerously stagnant compared to China’s aggressive expansion.“Here’s our problem… We have no power,” O’Leary said. He contrasted America’s grid stagnation with China’s rapid buildout, noting that Beijing has added 500 gigawatts of power in the last 24 months, while the U.S. has built “zero.” Without massive infrastructure upgrades, O’Leary warned, the U.S. cannot sustain the energy-hungry data centers required for the next phase of AI.","Canadian billionaire and investor Kevin O’Leary has now issued a blunt warning to job seekers. He has urged the professionals to treat their digital profiles as part of their personal brand. ‘If you want to lead, work remotely, or grow your career, you must understand how social media really works,’ he said.

Tony, I am so deeply grateful for everything you have done for me over the last four decades.

I still remember my early days at Oracle, searching for leadership and a way to move my career forward. I saw your Personal Power infomercial and bought the cassettes; suddenly, my daily commute was transformed by your inspiration and ideas. I even remember staying home an entire weekend to re-listen to the 30-day program as a ""home seminar""—the insights I gained were life-changing.

That was the moment I realized I needed to experience your events in person, which led me even deeper into building my own leadership models. It was at Date with Destiny that I made the firm decision to leave Oracle and start my own company. We even had a brief conversation about it then.

Fast forward twenty six years: Salesforce now has 80,000 employees, generates over $41B in revenue, and stands as the largest enterprise software company in the world. I truly could not have done it without you by my side. As you know we always over estimate what we can do in one year and underestimate what we can do in a couple of decades.

As you know, when I started Salesforce, I also created the 1-1-1 model—committing 1% of our equity, time, and product to the community. That model has now resulted in over $1B in grants, 10 million hours of volunteerism, and 50,000 nonprofits running on our platform for free. Your work delivering billions of meals continues to inspire me to stretch even further; our programs to protect the oceans and plant one trillion trees are born from your belief that business can be the greatest platform for change.

Tony, I started this letter with gratitude, and I will end it the same way. When I reached my most difficult moments, you were there. When I reached my highest heights, you were there. You know that as those phone calls and texts for help were always quickly answered. Tony, business and politics are temporal, but relationships are eternal—and yours is one I carry with me always. Congratulations on everything you are doing. I look forward to a wonderful future together.





Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff shared a ‘thanks note’ on X (formerly Twitter) to motivational speaker and coach Tony Robbins, crediting his early motivational programs for transforming his commute at Oracle and inspiring the decision to found Salesforce in 1999. “Tony, I am so deeply grateful for everything you have done for me over the last four decades,” Benioff writes in the post adding “I saw your Personal Power infomercial and bought the cassettes; suddenly, my daily commute was transformed by your inspiration and ideas.”The note also highlighted Salesforce's growth to 80,000 employees and over $41 billion in annual revenue, attributing much of its success, including the 1-1-1 philanthropy model that has donated $1 billion and supported 50,000 nonprofits, to Robbins' influence on ambitious long-term thinking.“Salesforce now has 80,000 employees, generates over $41B in revenue, and stands as the largest enterprise software company in the world.

5 Key things you missed at Apple iPhone launch event

Learning from Humane's costly mistakes





Apple is developing a wearable AI pin about the size of an AirTag, according to The Information. The device packs dual cameras, three microphones, and a speaker into a thin, circular aluminum-and-glass shell—all designed to capture and respond to what's happening around you. The pin has a standard lens and a wide-angle camera on the front for snapping photos and videos. Audio comes through a built-in speaker, while the three mics pick up ambient sound. There's a physical button along one edge for controls, plus a magnetic charging pad on the back that works like an Apple Watch charger.Apple could roll this out as soon as 2027, with plans for around 20 million units at launch. The company might be speeding up development to compete with OpenAI, which is expected to announce its own AI hardware later this year. The Information notes the project is still in early stages, though, and Apple could pull the plug if it doesn't meet expectations.The pin would likely work with Apple's upcoming Siri overhaul. The voice assistant is getting transformed into a ChatGPT-style AI chatbot, powered partly by Google's Gemini model through a partnership Apple announced recently.AI wearables haven't exactly had a smooth start. Humane's AI Pin—built by ex-Apple employees—crashed and burned spectacularly. The company sold fewer than 10,000 units before shutting down and offloading its assets to HP for $116 million. Reviews slammed it for sluggish performance and half-baked features.Apple's track record with new product categories is obviously stronger, but it'll need to avoid the privacy concerns and practical limitations that sank Humane. For now, it's just a rumor—Apple hasn't commented on the report.","Report: Apple is developing a wearable AI pin the size of an AirTag.

How the rankings are determined

Why Nvidia’s rise stands out

What this ranking says about the tech industry

(Data source: Rankings based on market capitalisation data compiled by CompaniesMarketCap.)





By the beginning of 2026, the global stock market will have made it very clear who is in charge of technology right now. The companies that are building the digital infrastructure, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing are no longer just supporting players. They are the ones who are making the whole market talk. Investors are putting their money on companies that make the tools that power modern computers, like advanced chips and big software platforms.NVIDIA is at the heart of this change. The company used to be best known for making graphics cards for gamers, but now it is the backbone of the AI economy. Its growth has been so great that it is now the most valuable tech company on the market. CompaniesMarketCap has put together a list of the biggest companies, and Nvidia is at the top. Apple and Microsoft are still on the list, but the order has changed. The rankings show how quickly the tech world is changing.The tech company NVIDIA is worth the most in the world. Big businesses and governments use the company's specialized chips to run data centers, AI models, and machine learning systems. It is a key player in the AI race because demand for its hardware is always higher than supply.Microsoft is still one of the most important tech companies in the world. Its strengths are in enterprise software, cloud services through Azure, and the fact that it uses artificial intelligence in many of its products. It stays near the top because of smart partnerships and steady income.Apple is in this position because it can make a lot of money from hardware, services, and ecosystems. Growth has slowed down compared to previous years, but investors are still confident because the company has a loyal customer base and a growing services business.Alphabet is still doing well because it has the best AI research, ads, and search. Google is one of the most valuable tech companies in the world because it invests in cloud infrastructure and AI tools.Amazon is worth a lot of money because of Amazon Web Services, which is still a big part of cloud computing around the world. AWS keeps making a lot of money, even though its retail business isn't as profitable.Meta has won back investors' trust by cutting costs and putting more money into AI-driven content systems and advertising. Its platforms are still the most important ones for digital communication and online advertising around the world.TSMC is a very important link in the global tech supply chain. It is the best maker of advanced chips and makes processors that many top tech companies, such as NVIDIA and Apple, use.Tesla is still considered a tech-driven company because it focuses on AI, software, and automation in cars. Investor interest is linked to its long-term goals in self-driving cars and energy systems.Samsung is strong because it makes a lot of different types of technology, like semiconductors, consumer electronics, and displays. Its chip division helps it stay competitive in the global tech race.Oracle is the last company in the top 10 list because it does well in both cloud services and business software. It doesn't deal with customers as much as some of the other companies on the list, but it does make steady money from long-term business clients.Market capitalization, which is the total value of a company's shares on the stock market, is what the rankings are based on. This number changes every day because the prices of stocks go up and down. CompaniesMarketCap uses publicly available stock market data to keep track of this information and change the rankings as needed.Nvidia's growth has come from behind-the-scenes infrastructure, unlike brands that focus on consumers. Nvidia's specialized processors are in high demand as AI systems get bigger and more complicated. Investors see the company as more than just a chipmaker; they see it as an important part of the digital economy.The 2026 rankings show a clear trend. Investors are more interested in companies that build core technology infrastructure than in companies that only make consumer goods. Artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and semiconductor manufacturing are now the most valuable things in the market.These rankings are likely to change as technology continues to transform industries worldwide. NVIDIA's current position at the top indicates that the tech market is evolving its definition of leadership.","CompaniesMarketCap has put together a list of the biggest companies, and Nvidia is at the top.

Google Gemini powers the chatbot, may run on Google's servers



What the new Siri chatbot can do







Apple is preparing to overhaul Siri from a voice assistant into a conversational AI chatbot, marking the most dramatic change since it launched in 2011. The overhaul, internally called Campos, will debut with iOS 27 later this year and replace Siri's existing interface entirely, according to Bloomberg.Users will still activate the chatbot using familiar methods—saying ""Siri"" or holding the iPhone's side button—but the experience will mirror ChatGPT and Google Gemini's conversational style. Apple tested the chatbot as a standalone app but plans to embed it directly into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS instead, integrating it across the operating system.The new Siri will run on Google's Gemini models following a partnership Apple finalized earlier this month. Bloomberg reports the companies are discussing running Campos on Google's cloud infrastructure rather than Apple's Private Cloud Compute—a significant departure from the privacy-focused approach Apple promoted when it unveiled its AI plans.Apple chose Google after evaluating OpenAI and Anthropic. Anthropic's Claude was initially the top contender, but negotiations broke down over pricing. The Google deal is reportedly worth around $1 billion annually and builds on the companies' existing search partnership.iOS 27’s Siri will work with both voice and text, handling tasks like content generation, file analysis, summarization, and coding help. It'll integrate with Apple's core apps—Photos, Mail, Messages, Music—and access their content to respond to requests. Apple is also developing a feature letting Siri view open windows and adjust device settings.Apple plans to announce the chatbot at its June developer conference, with iOS 27 testing to follow. A more capable version of current Siri will arrive first in iOS 26.4, delivering Apple Intelligence features originally promised in 2024. The chatbot marks Apple's most aggressive move yet to close the gap with rivals in the AI race.","Apple is preparing to overhaul Siri from a voice assistant into a conversational AI chatbot.

Meta shuts down Horizon Workrooms

Meta announced layoffs in December 2025





Meta chief technology officer (CTO) Andrew Bosworth is at Davos, Switzerland, for the ongoing World Economic Forum's annual meeting. Meta CTO spoke about a range of things at the event including layoffs at the company's Reality Labs division and shutting down of a number of studios that were working on VR titles. Bosworth said that the company is cutting its workforce because VR headset sales have failed to take off. “We’re still continuing to invest heavily in this space, but obviously, VR is growing less quickly than we hoped,” Bosworth told Alex Health in a podcast on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. He added, “And so you want to make sure that your investment is right-sized.”The layoffs Meta's Reality Labs division come just over four years after Facebook changed its name to Meta. In October 2021, Mark Zuckerberg changed Facebook’s name to Meta, reflecting his view that the future of work, play and socializing was going virtual, the company is making a major course correction. Meta is cutting about 10% of staff who focus on metaverse-related VR projects as part of its Reality Labs unit. As analysts say, it seems that Zuckerberg has changed his mind about what the word 'Metaverse' actually means: Mobile yes, smart glasses yes, but maybe not VR.A report in New York Times said that layoffs, amounting to more than 1,000 jobs, will impact about 10% of the hardware division, which makes Quest VR headsets, and the Horizon Worlds virtual social network.The studios that are closing as part of the latest changes reportedly include Armature Studio, Twisted Pixel, and Sanzaru, as well as a technical unit called Oculus Studios Central Technology. Jobs are also said to be being cut at other studios including Ouro Interactive, which Meta debuted in 2023 to build first-party content for Horizon Worlds.Earlier this month, Meta also shut down Horizon Workrooms, envisioned as a virtual space for workers to collaborate. The company announced it’s shutting that space down: “Meta has made the decision to discontinue Workrooms as a standalone app, effective February 16, 2026,” reads the note on its help page. Meta will also no longer sell its headsets and software as a service for businesses, another help page reads: “We are stopping sales of Meta Horizon managed services and commercial SKUs of Meta Quest, effective February 20, 2026. ” For Meta Horizon managed services, the company says that existing customers can continue to access those through January 4, 2030, and that licenses will be free after February 16, 2026.Meta laid the groundwork for these layoffs in December, when the company said that it would be shifting resources within Reality Labs’ budget away from its VR initiatives toward its endeavors with AI glasses and wearable devices. “This is part of that effort, and we plan to reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year,” a Meta spokesperson said, without commenting specifically on the layoffs.","Meta announced layoffs in December 2025.

What is Claude’s Constitution

“Claude’s constitution is the foundational document that both expresses and shapes who Claude is. It contains detailed explanations of the values we would like Claude to embody and the reasons why. In it, we explain what we think it means for Claude to be helpful while remaining broadly safe, ethical, and compliant with our guidelines.

The constitution gives Claude information about its situation and offers advice for how to deal with difficult situations and tradeoffs, like balancing honesty with compassion and the protection of sensitive information.

Although it might sound surprising, the constitution is written primarily for Claude. It is intended to give Claude the knowledge and understanding it needs to act well in the world.”

“Claude itself also uses the constitution to construct many kinds of synthetic training data, including data that helps it learn and understand the constitution, conversations where the constitution might be relevant, responses that are in line with its values, and rankings of possible responses.

All of these can be used to train future versions of Claude to become the kind of entity the constitution describes.

This practical function has shaped how we’ve written the constitution: it needs to work both as a statement of abstract ideals and a useful artifact for training.”

What’s new in Claude’s new constitution

Broadly safe: not undermining appropriate human mechanisms to oversee AI during the current phase of development;

Broadly ethical: being honest, acting according to good values, and avoiding actions that are inappropriate, dangerous, or harmful;

Compliant with Anthropic’s guidelines: acting in accordance with more specific guidelines from Anthropic where relevant;

Genuinely helpful: benefiting the operators and users they interact with.

In cases of apparent conflict, Claude should generally prioritize these properties in the order in which they’re listed, the company said.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on AI-led job cuts





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently warned that artificial intelligence (AI) may lose “social permission” if it fails to deliver tangible results in areas like health care, education and productivity. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella discussed AI’s massive energy footprint, stating that the use will be tolerated only if AI passes tests to improve people's lives. If the AI models failed this test, they risk losing public trust.“We will quickly lose even the social permission to actually take something like energy, which is a scarce resource, and use it to generate these tokens,” Satya Nadella said, adding “If these tokens are not improving health outcomes, education outcomes, public sector efficiency, private sector competitiveness across all sectors, small and large.”During the conversation, Nadella called AI as the latest chapter in a long arc of computing. He compared AI to the internet, mobile technology and cloud computing. But he kept coming back to the idea that AI must move beyond experimentation and hype, Benzinga reports.He said that access to reliable power grids, data centers and energy storage will play a deciding factor in which countries benefit most from AI diffusion.Energy storage and battery efficiency advancements have become a critical component of sustainable growth as AI-driven data centres expands globally.“All of these token factories are part of the real economy, connected to the grid, connected to the telco network,” Nadella said. “That's what's going to drive at scale, whether it's in the global south or in the developed world.”“If you buy my entire argument that we've got a new commodity–it’s tokens–and the job of every economy and every firm in the economy is to translate these tokens into economic growth, then if you have a cheaper commodity, it's better,” he saidWhen pressed by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink about AI-driven benefits coming at the cost of jobs, Satya Nadella acknowledged the fear, but argued that the bigger question is whether AI is used to expand human capability.“Going and thinking of these as somehow living outside of the realm of human agency is probably not the right way to think about it,” Nadella said, adding “In the early 80s, if somebody had come to us and said that four billion people are going to wake up every morning and start typing, you would have said ‘Why?'” Nadella said. “We have a typist tool that’s good enough we don’t need four billion people”.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella warned that artificial intelligence (AI) may lose “social permission” if it fails to deliver tangible results in areas like health care, education and productivity.

Deloitte is reportedly doing a major workforce shakeup. Deloitte has announced a major shake-up to its workforce structure. As reported by Business Insider, the company has revealed that it will change job titles for all its 181,500 US employees starting June 1, 2026. The Big Four consulting firm shared its plan in an internal presentation and described the latest move as part of a broader modernisation effort in response to shifts driven by artificial intelligence. The company also said that the employees will be informed about their new titles on January 29 and the complete rollout will begin with Deloitte’s next financial year. The new changes will apply across all divisions in the company.According to the report Business Insider, along with the overhaul, Deloitte is also introducing a new senior leadership designation. Presently, the firm’s top ranks are partners, principals and managing directors. Starting June this year, a new role titled ‘leaders’ will join the group, marking a significant update to the hierarchy of the company.“We are modernising our talent architecture to provide a more tailored experience reflective of our professionals’ broad range of skills and the work they do,” a Deloitte spokesperson told Business Insider.The consulting firm has shared that its present talent architecture is “outdated” and built for a more homogenous consulting workforce. However, with AI in the picture, Deloitte mentioned that the clients are demanding new skills and capabilities, while employees are seeking a more tailored career experiences.By redesigning the job titles, the company aims to better match the roles with responsibilities and clarify career levels to make sire consistency for employees performing similar work. Importantly, the firm emphasised that day-to-day work, leadership structures, and compensation philosophy will remain unchanged.Earlier, the consultants at Deloitte made progress via a ladder of analyst, senior analyst, consultant, senior consultant, manager, and senior manager before reaching the PPMD ranks. But under the new system, these titles will become more specific, incorporating references to “job families” and “sub-families.”For example, a current senior consultant could be retitled as:Internally, employees will also receive alphanumeric codes to indicate job levels — such as L45 for senior consultants and L55 for managers.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai has announced a special ‘free offer’ for students. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Pichai has announced that the students can now prepare for the SAT for free using Google’s Gemini AI. In the post, Pichai revealed that learners ca take full-length SAT practice exams directly inside the Gemini app at no additional cost. The feature of the Gemini app uses vetted material from The Princeton Review and offer instant feedback once a test is completed.“Helpful update for students, you can now take full practice SATs for free in the @GeminiApp .It uses vetted content from @ThePrincetonRev and gives you feedback straight away. Starting with the SAT today, but more tests are on the way!,” wrote Pichai.Students can now access the new tool by simply prompting Gemini with, “I want to take a practice SAT test.” The AI then offers a full-length, on-demand exam within the app. After completing the task, Gemini breaks down the performance by topic and will also highlight the strengths, weaknesses and areas that need improvement.“When you complete a practice test in Gemini, you’ll receive immediate feedback highlighting where you excelled and where you might need to study more.For anything you don’t understand, you can ask Gemini to explain the correct answer. By helping you identify specific knowledge gaps, Gemini empowers you to turn those insights into action — creating a customized study plan that can help you walk into your exam with confidence,” said Google in a blog post.Learners are also allowed to ask for follow-up questions and request explanations for specific answers, making the experience interactive and personalised. In a blog post, Google said the goal is to help students “identify specific knowledge gaps” and turn those insights into a customized study plan designed to boost confidence ahead of test day.The SAT announcement comes just days after Google disclosed that Gemini will also power Khan Academy’s Writing Coach, a tool designed to guide students through the writing process rather than generate full assignments.Google has been gradually working on expanding Gemini’s role in the sector of education.

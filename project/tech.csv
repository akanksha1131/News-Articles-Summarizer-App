Elon Musk has announced a major Neuralink Breakthrough. The Billionaire said that his brain-computer interface company Neuralink can possibly restore full body functionality. Elon Musk's brain implant company Neuralink will start ""high-volume production"" of brain-computer interface devices and move to an entirely automated surgical procedure in 2026, Musk said in a post on the social media platform X on Wednesday. “I am confident at this point that restoring full body functionality is possible with Neuralink,” the Tesla and SpaceX founder said in a post on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter. “Neuralink can essentially help bridge communications from the cortex, past the point in the neck or spine, where the nerves are damaged. It is possible from a physics standpoint to physically restore full body functionality,” he said in a video post.The breakthrough focuses on the motor cortex, restoring “full body functionality” for people with severed spinal cords. The motor cortex technology feature was first announced by Elon Musk in 2022, and the testing began in humans in the same year.According to Musk, any device that can be controlled via computer or phone can be controlled by a Neuralink implant.The device includes a chip that replaces a small piece of bone and is connected to the brain via a series of thin, threaded electrodes. The company's N1 implant includes 1,024 electrodes distributed among 64 threads, according to the company's website. “Neuralink will start high-volume production of brain-computer interface devices and move to a streamlined, almost entirely automated surgical procedure in 2026. Device threads will go through the dura without the need to remove it. This is a big deal,” he shared on X.Neuralink eyes mass brain implant production in 2026In September 2025, Neuralink announced that it had implanted its device in 12 patients. The year 2025 also saw Neuralink raising $650 million in Series E funding, led by investors including ARK Invest, Sequoia Capital, and Founders Fund, valuing the company at approximately $9 billion.On January 1 this year, Musk's California-based neurotechnology company announced taking major steps toward restoring vision, with a brain implant that allows the visually impaired, even those blind from birth.Blindsight, Neuralink’s brain chip aimed at restoring vision, received “breakthrough device” designation from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2024. The company is expected to begin high-volume production of the device this year.Elon Musk said that Blindsight will help people who have lost both eyes, and they will be able to see. He also claimed that, provided the visual cortex remains intact, the device can restore vision even in people who have been blind since birth. ""Blindsight will enable those who have total loss of vision, including if they've lost their eyes or the optic nerve, or maybe have never seen, or even blind from birth, to be able to see again,"" said Musk. Thanking US-FDA, Musk wrote, ""To set expectations correctly, the vision will be at first be low resolution, like Atari graphics, but eventually it has the potential be better than natural vision and enable you to see in infrared, ultraviolet or even radar wavelengths, like Geordi La Forge. Much appreciated, @US_FDA.""","Elon Musk's brain implant company Neuralink will start ""high-volume production"" of brain-computer interface devices and move to an entirely automated surgical procedure in 2026.

CES 2026: Samsung puts OLED screens on cassettes and turntables that have AI in them,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ces-2026-samsung-puts-oled-screens-on-cassettes-and-turntables-that-have-ai-in-them/articleshow/126337922.cms,"Samsung Display is turning heads at CES 2026 with retro-inspired AI OLED Cassette and Turntable concepts. These devices blend vintage audio aesthetics with modern OLED screens, showcasing the technology's versatility. The cassette features a 1.5-inch round display, while the turntable boasts a larger 13.4-inch circular screen, offering interactive music experiences and visual moods directly on the units.

Samsung's retro concepts are part of a bigger OLED showcase





Samsung Display has cooked up something nostalgic for CES 2026. The company is showing off two retro-inspired concept devices—the AI OLED Cassette and AI OLED Turntable—that take vintage audio design and give it a modern twist with OLED screens. It's part of Samsung's effort to show that its display technology can work in pretty much any gadget you can think of, even ones that look like they belong in the '80s.The AI OLED Cassette features a compact 1.5-inch round OLED display, styled to look like a classic audio cassette. Images show it sporting a smartwatch-style interactive screen alongside what appears to be a status display. Meanwhile, the AI OLED Turntable steps things up with a much larger 13.4-inch circular OLED that seems to be touch-controlled, though Samsung hasn't revealed exactly what you'd use such a big round screen for on a turntable-inspired device.Both devices fall under Samsung's ""AI Edge Vision Station"" at CES, where the company is showing off various speaker-type AI assistants with displays. The idea is that instead of relying on external smart devices like traditional Bluetooth speakers, these concepts let you see music recommendations, pick songs, and even set visual moods right on the device itself.Samsung is positioning these as proof that OLED's flexibility—it can be curved, spherical, or circular—opens up creative possibilities that LCD simply can't match.While it's unclear if either product will actually hit shelves, they're certainly conversation starters.The company is also unveiling more practical innovations at CES, including ultra-thin laptop displays, 4,500-nit QD-OLED TVs, and automotive screens. But the cassette and turntable? Those are pure fun, showing Samsung isn't afraid to experiment with form factors that challenge conventional thinking about what a display should look like.","Samsung's AI OLED Cassette and Turntable show off the technology's versatility.

Palo Alto Networks' top exec calls AI Agents 2026's biggest insider threat that an 'impressed' Salesforce CEO says may rename the company after,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/palo-alto-networks-top-exec-calls-ai-agents-2026s-biggest-insider-threat-that-an-impressed-salesforce-ceo-says-may-rename-the-company-after/articleshow/126337744.cms,"When Chinese spies 'told' Claude to break into about 30 companies





AI agents are seen as one of the biggest productivity tools by technology companies. From Microsoft to Amazon and more, all technology companies are talking about the potential of AI agents. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff went to the extent of saying that he might rename the company 'Agentforce'. In December last year, a Salesforce employee told Business Insider that the company might change its official corporate name to Agentforce. Later in an interview, Salesforce CEO Benioff confirmed this is a possibility. ""It might,"" Benioff said and added, ""That would not shock me."" Salesforce CEO said that now customers don't want to hear about the cloud anymore and that he learned during recent focus groups ahead of the company's annual Dreamforce conference in October. Instead, clients want to talk about AI agents.""I dropped the word cloud totally,"" he said. ""I did it at Dreamforce. Did you notice I never used it in the keynote? We learned in focus groups customers don't talk about cloud anymore. They just want to talk about their agentic interface."" However, Palo Alto Networks Chief Security Intel Officer Wendi Whitmore does not seem to agree with Benioff. In an interview to The Register, Whitmore said that AI agents represent the new insider threat to companies in 2026.""The CISO and security teams find themselves under a lot of pressure to deploy new technology as quickly as possible, and that creates this massive amount of pressure - and massive workload - that the teams are under to quickly go through procurement processes, security checks, and understand if the new AI applications are secure enough for the use cases that these organizations have,"" Whitmore told The Register. ""And that's created this concept of the AI agent itself becoming the new insider threat,"" she added.""When we look through the defender lens, a lot of what the agentic capabilities allow us to do is start thinking more strategically about how we defend our networks, versus always being caught in this reactive situation,"" Whitmore said.Whitmore, along with just about every other cyber execs that The Register spoke to for the report, pointed to the ""Anthropic attack"" in October 2025 as an example. Chinese cyber spies used Anthropic's Claude Code AI tool to attempt digital break-ins at about 30 high-profile companies and government organizations – and the government-backed snoops ""succeeded in a small number of cases,"" according to a report from the AI company. The mid-September operation targeted large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers, and government agencies.While Whitmore doesn't anticipate AI agents to carry out any fully autonomous attacks this year, she does expect AI to be a force multiplier for network intruders. ""You're going to see these really small teams almost have the capability of big armies,"" she said. ""They can now leverage AI capabilities to do so much more of the work that previously they would have had to have a much larger team to execute against.""","Palo Alto Networks Chief Security Intel Officer Wendi Whitmore said that AI agents represent the new insider threat to companies in 2026.

"Claude maker Anthropic’s founder, Daniela Amodei, on competing with fewer resources: We always had a fraction of what…",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/claude-maker-anthropics-founder-daniela-amodei-on-competing-with-fewer-resources-we-always-had-a-fraction-of-what/articleshow/126337100.cms,"Anthropic's co-founder Daniela Amodei champions a ""do more with less"" philosophy, prioritizing efficient algorithms and judicious resource use over massive infrastructure spending. While competitors invest heavily, Anthropic aims to lead with powerful models by focusing on superior training data and reasoning, challenging the prevailing scale-driven AI race. This strategy bets on smarter deployment, not just bigger budgets.

“I think what we have always aimed to do at Anthropic is be as judicious with the resources that we have while still operating in this space where it’s just a lot of compute.

Anthropic has always had a fraction of what our competitors have had in terms of compute and capital, and yet, pretty consistently, we’ve had the most powerful, most performant models for the majority of the past several years.”

How Anthropic’s Daniela Amodei and her brother are betting against their own views

""The compute requirements for the future are very large. So our expectation is, yes, we will need more compute to be able to just stay at the frontier as we get bigger,”

""A lot of the numbers that are thrown around are sort of not exactly apples to apples, because of just how the structure of some of these deals are kind of set up,""

""We have continued to be surprised, even as the people who pioneered this belief in scaling laws. Something that I hear from my colleagues a lot is, the exponential continues until it doesn't. And every year we've been like, 'Well, this can't possibly be the case that things will continue on the exponential' — and then every year it has,”

“scaling is not necessarily the only thing that matters”

“the person who wins, wins regardless of cost.”

“What happens when the curve reverses?”





Anthropic President and co-founder Daniela Amodei has said that her company follows a governing principle to ""do more with less"" to remain competitive in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. In a recent interview, Amodei clarified that, although competing firms such as OpenAI have committed around $1.4 trillion to infrastructure and chips, Anthropic aims to spend wisely and deploy efficient algorithms.Speaking with CNBC, Amodei, who is also the sister of the company’s CEO and another co-founder, Dario Amodei, said,This strategy challenges the current trend in Silicon Valley, where many AI companies are raising huge sums and building massive data centres to achieve success through scale. Amodei noted that the startup aims to be carefuk with its resources that it has while still operating in a sector that requires significant compute power.By prioritising smarter deployment over massive physical expansion, the company believes it can stay at the technological frontier without attempting to outbuild every other laboratory.Daniela Amodei and her brother, Dario Amodei, Anthropic's CEO and former Baidu and Google researcher, contributed to building the approach they're now challenging. Dario helped promote the scaling paradigm that guides the current AI model race, the strategy that increasing compute, data, and model size improves models predictably. This pattern has become the financial foundation supporting hyperscaler spending, chip valuations, and private market investments in AI companies still working toward profitability.However, Anthropic is trying to prove that it can disprove the logic that the next competition phase will simply be between the entities that can pay more for larger pre-training computations. Anthropic’s approach focuses on superior training data, superior reasoning in post-training models, and products that will lead to lower computing costs and improved adoption. However, Anthropic is not working under constrained budgets because it currently possesses about $100 billion in computing resources, which is set to increase.Amodei said.However, the company argues industry numbers aren't directly comparable, and certainty about ""right"" spending levels is less solid than it appears.she said, describing pressure to commit early for future hardware.Even insiders who shaped the scaling thesis have been surprised by consistent performance growth.Amodei explained.Daniela distinguished between technology and economic curves. Technologically, Anthropic sees continued progress, but questions remain about the pace of adoption. ""Regardless of how good the technology is, it takes time for that to be used in a business or sort of personal context. The real question to me is: How quickly can businesses in particular, but also individuals, leverage the technology?"" she noted. OpenAI focuses on establishing campuses, while Anthropic can easily move around based on costs and demand.Both companies are gearing up for potential IPOs while raising capital and improving their computational infrastructure. If funding for scale continues, OpenAI's approach may remain the norm. But if efficiency is promoted, the approach of Anthropic may gain the upper hand.Instead, it's a bet thatand thatThe “exponential” growth of improvements will continue “until it doesn’t,” said Amodei. The question for 2026 is","Anthropic's co-founder Daniela Amodei champions a ""do more with less"" philosophy, prioritizing efficient algorithms and judicious resource use over massive infrastructure spending.

iPhone Fold expected price







Apple is expected to launch its first foldable smartphone next year. Now, the long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders offering a clear look at the design of first foldable iPhone. As per the YouTube channel Front Page Tech and popular tipper Ice Universe, the design of Apple’s first foldable iPhone may resemble to Google’s Pixel Fold. As per the images leaked online, the yet-to-launch foldable iPhone is said to feature a book-style foldable design.As per the leaks, the upcoming foldable iPhone is said to feature a large internal display and a smaller cover screen. The renders also highlight a minimal crease along with fold area where rival devices like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold have often drawn criticism. The design appears to prioritize durability and a seamless viewing experience, aligning with Apple’s reputation for premium hardware aesthetics.“The comparison of the design of the Samsung Galaxy Wide Fold and the Apple iPhone Fold is almost identical, with the only difference being the R-angle. Samsung is more square, while Apple is more rounded. Do you prefer the square one or the rounder one?,” wrote Ice Universe.Early leaks suggest that the first foldable iPhone may look and function differently from the current iPhone lineup. It is expected that the foldable iPhone may ditch the Face ID in order to accommodate the thinner foldable design. It is also said that the company may include a 24MP under-display selfie camera which will offer a cleaner and uninterrupted look to the display. The is also tipped that the foldable iPhone may feature another 24MP camera on the cover display making it easier for the users to take selfies or answer video calls.On the back, the foldable iPhone may feature a dual-lens setup with two 48MP sensors — one standard and one ultrawide — but no telephoto lens. This simplified camera system seems to be a design trade-off to maintain the slim build that a foldable phone requires. While the camera specs may sound modest compared to Apple’s Pro models, the focus for this device appears to be on delivering a sleek design, new display technology, and the flexibility of a foldable form factor.Multiple online rumours suggest that the upcoming Foldable iPhone may be priced around $2,399.","The long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders.

Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Speaking on Google DeepMind: The Podcast, Hassabis said many early-stage companies are now raising tens of billions dollars before even launching product. He believes that this trend exposes cracks in the valuation model. “Some startups basically haven’t even got going yet,” Hassabis said. “It’s sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. My guess is probably not, at least not in general.” This increase in speculative funding has drawn comparisons to past bubbles, such as the dot-com boom and the crypto frenzy, where companies raised massive sums on hype rather than proven business models.Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google, which he said are backed by “a lot of real business.” While Big Tech’s AI bets are supported by revenue streams and infrastructure, many startups are relying solely on investor enthusiasm.He added that AI is “overhyped in the short term” but “underappreciated in the medium to long-term,” suggesting that while the technology’s potential is profound, the current funding frenzy may not reflect sustainable growth.Reflecting on DeepMind’s own early days, Hassabis noted how technological shifts often swing from skepticism to obsession, inflating valuations quickly. “It’s almost an overreaction to the underreaction,” he said, pointing out that investor sentiment can flip dramatically once a technology gains traction.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO also made his stand clear on the debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent. Scaling laws suggest that the more data and compute an AI model receives, the smarter it becomes.",Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google are backed by “a lot of real business”,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126055439,imgsize-37614,width-400,resizemode-4/time-person-of-the-year-cover.jpg"

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Fear-driven leadership powers AI chip giant's success

Seven-day workweeks extend beyond executive suite





Despite leading the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang operates in constant fear of failure. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business."" The co-founder, who has led the chipmaker since 1993, said this feeling of vulnerability ""doesn't leave you"" despite the company's recent milestone of becoming the first public firm to reach a $5 trillion valuation in October.Huang's unconventional leadership approach stems from near-death experiences in the 1990s when Nvidia faced bankruptcy multiple times. He recalled flying to Japan to inform Sega that a contracted graphics chip was flawed and the deal should be canceled, while simultaneously admitting Nvidia needed the final $5 million payment to survive. Sega converted the funds into an investment, providing the lifeline that kept the company afloat.""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,"" Huang explained. The CEO maintains his intense work schedule by waking at 4 a.m.daily to read emails for hours, processing several thousand messages each day. This routine continues through holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas.Huang's relentless work ethic has influenced his family, with both adult children Madison and Spencer working at Nvidia seven days a week. The siblings, who are in their 30s, initially pursued different careers before joining the company as interns in 2020 and 2022.Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter, driven by surging demand for AI chips that power technology from Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta. However, Huang told Rogan that scale hasn't changed his mindset: ""The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity—it doesn't leave you.""","Jensen Huang, CEO of $4.4 trillion AI chip giant Nvidia, lives in constant fear of bankruptcy.

How Google may have helped Reddit to become more popular than TikTok in UK,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-google-helped-reddit-to-become-more-popular-than-tiktok-in-uk/articleshow/126334599.cms,"Reddit has surged in the UK, now reaching 60% of internet users, surpassing TikTok. This growth is fueled by Google's algorithm changes prioritizing forum discussions and a partnership where Reddit data trains AI models. Users, especially Gen Z women, increasingly seek authentic advice on the platform, contributing to its diverse appeal and community growth.

How Reddit was able to achieve this milestone

“Reddit started with this perception, rightfully so, for a male skew gaming and tech as the anchor. Reddit has become very diverse – it is gender-balanced in the UK now … what’s interesting is that one in three users on the platform are Gen Z women.""

“Gen Z are very open to looking online for advice around these life stage moments, like leaving home and renting for the first time, which happens a little bit later for some of this generation. It’s a very safe place to ask questions about balancing a cheque book, or how to pay for a wedding,”

“You see these accidents of AI slop and AI advice – Reddit doesn’t have that. It’s not clean. It’s messy in that it has lots of different pieces of advice that you have to sift through. It’s not manicured down to one answer for you, but that’s kind of the point,”

“Reddit is really honest and I think that’s one of the things that makes Reddit. Every person who joins Reddit is a moderator, because you get to vote up or down on a post – and a down vote is incredibly powerful. ‘Be civil’ is one of the most common rules in communities,”





Reddit has overtaken TikTok to become the fourth most-visited social media service in the UK. According to Ofcom data, the platform now reaches 60% of UK internet users, up from 33% in 2023. This growth is primarily linked to changes in Google ’s search algorithms, which now prioritise helpful information from discussion forums in search results, a report claims.A major driver of this shift is a partnership between Google and Reddit. The search engine uses Reddit’s data to train its artificial intelligence (AI) models. Reddit is also currently the most cited source in Google’s AI search summaries. This connection directs more web traffic to Reddit forums. The platform has a similar agreement with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, which helps keep the site visible to people looking for information online.User habits are also changing, as more people seek out advice from real humans rather than automated feeds. This is especially true for users aged 18 to 24, with more than three-quarters of that group now visiting the site. In the UK, more than half of Reddit’s audience is female, with many users focusing on specific communities dedicated to skincare, beauty, and parenting.In a statement to The Guardian, Jen Wong, Reddit’s chief operating officer (COO), said she spent a lot of time in the UK gardening subreddit. Wong noted:she added.Wong said the company wants people to visit Reddit directly, rather than finding it through search engines. She also said Reddit is different from AI-made content.Wong explained.Arguments and heated discussions are still common on Reddit. Wong said this is part of the platform’s culture, but each subreddit has its own rules and moderators.she continued.As Reddit has become more popular, the UK government has created its own account, UKGovNews, over the past year. It has shared posts about the cost of living, train ticket prices, and immigration. Steve Reed also recently hosted an “ask me anything” session on the platform.UK-based subreddits focused on pregnancy and parenting have doubled in size over the past year. Many fans of Premier League clubs now watch matches while following live discussions on their team’s subreddit. According to company data, the main Premier League subreddit has gained more than a billion views in the last year.Reddit has also become an important place to discuss women’s football, which often receives less coverage than men’s football. Views on subreddits for Arsenal Women and the Lionesses have doubled in the past year.","Reddit has overtaken TikTok to become the fourth most-visited social media service in the UK.

When Elon Musk said Tesla is ‘screwed’





In 2008, Tesla was on the brink of a financial collapse and CEO Elon Musk had just surveyed an ‘army’ of rejected cars. Frustrated by the revelation, an angry Musk said “I want names named. so if someone's always on the hide seat and is always the root cause for problems, they will not be a part of this organisation for long term. It’s not okay to be a part of this company”. “If somebody can't get happy, get divorced,” he continued, adding “Speak(ing) from personal experience”. Notably, Musk himself was going through his divorce with his first wife, Justine Musk.Elon Musk has been married and divorced twice, involving two marriages and three divorce proceedings. He married Justine Musk in 2000. The couple had six children together, including one child who died in infancy. The duo divorced in 2008, the same year Musk had his companies Tesla and SpaceX close to bankruptcy.In 2010, Musk married British actress Talulah Riley. The couple divorced in 2012 but remarried in 2013. Their second marriage ended in divorce in 2016.Tesla CEO has not married since. He was later in a long-term relationship with musician Grimes, with whom he has children, but the two were never married.The above comments were made during a tense internal meeting where Colette Niazmand, Tesla marketing executive, told Musk that people found faults with the Tesla Roadster and the company realised that the car “had substandard parts”.Video from the meeting has surfaced online recently. In the video, one of Tesla executives can be seen telling Musk “What's going on here is the team has been doing a little bit of rework today. I got a message last week that if Roadster can't sustain the company by March, then…That's it. And that scares me”.Musk, who became angry by that point, said, “We need to get the company to cash flow positive in six to nine months. Well, we're screwed. It’s really pedal to metal here. Each month it passes literally costs us tens of millions of dollars”.","Elon Musk has been married and divorced twice, involving two marriages and three divorce proceedings.

Why Xiaomi decided to livestream YU7 teardown





Xiaomi founder, chairman, and CEO Lei Jun held the first live broadcast of 2026 this week. In the broadcast, Xiaomi CEO invited company engineers to tear down the company's Tesla rival -- Xiaomi YU7 -- on camera. Xiaomi's electric SUV YU7 launched in June 2025, and is the company's second mainstream electric vehicle after the SU7. The livestream, which lasted four to five hours, was reportedly presented as response to online discussions and viral criticism regarding Xiaomi’s vehicles.Xiaomi CEO Jun dismantled the Xiaomi YU7 vehicle to address public scrutiny and showcase the car’s build quality. The roughly five-hour broadcast is said to have drawn widespread attention from Chinese viewers. According to a report in Carsnewschina, ""These included misquotes about the YU7's range, viral clips suggesting ""200 km/h instant braking,"" videos of wheels detaching during collisions, small-font marketing disclaimers, and manipulated social media content such as the so-called “green belt incident. ” Other points included a false rumor that Xiaomi restricted farmers from selling its products and questions about the YU7’s build quality as the company’s second mainstream EV.Lei Jun clarified each point, explained the engineering rationale behind design choices, and encouraged fair, fact-based reviews.""Engineers carried out a live teardown of a green Xiaomi YU7 standard model that rolled off the production line in December 2025. During the teardown, engineers dismantled the vehicle step by step to its bare body shell. The process began with the removal of the four doors and two hoods, followed by the interior and exterior components, the chassis and electric drivetrain, and then the front compartment, thermal management system, instrument panel and wiring harness. It offered a detailed view of key structures, including the Xiaomi YU7’s integrated die-cast body, door side-impact beams and the layout of its electric powertrain.Lei said that Xiaomi had previously decided to respond to the controversy, believing that strong products would speak for themselves. However, following growing feedback from users, the company has decided to respond more directly and promptly to concerns. Lei also welcomed independent reviewers to conduct their own teardowns of Xiaomi vehicles, calling for fair and objective assessments and not to go into exaggerated criticism aimed at generating online traffic.There have been safety concerns raised about YU7's doors. Responding to these, Xiaomi engineers said that the YU7 uses mechanical pull cables for both interior and exterior handles. They added that in extreme collisions, even if both the main and auxiliary batteries fail, a dedicated backup power source allows the door locks to switch to independent power and mechanical control. The doors can still be opened mechanically from outside, while the interior handles remain operable at all times.","Xiaomi founder, chairman, and CEO Lei Jun held the first live broadcast of 2026 this week.

Why Nvidia, according to Michael Burry, is hurting America

Michael Burry is betting against AI





One of America's biggest investor Michael Burry has warned the country on Nvidia. Michael Burry is the same investor who hit headlines with his correct prediction on 2008 housing crisis in the US and the ensuing global economic slowdown. According to Burry, China's rapidly accelerating power-generation buildout gives it a structural edge in artificial intelligence race if the industry continues relying on increasingly energy-intensive chips. Burry said that Nvidia has a ""death grip"" on AI development in the US, citing its extensive investments and agreements with many major AI companies and startups.In a series of posts on X, formerly Twitter, Burry said that America is on the wrong path if its AI strategy continues to rely on increasingly energy-intensive Nvidia Corp chips. ""Power hungry Nvidia chips are not the way forward,"" he wrote. He shared a chart that showed China's installed electricity generation capacity that has surged far beyond that of America and Europe since the early 2000s. ""It is not just the total power advantage,"" Burry wrote. ""It is the slope.""Michael Burry shared 'Why China will win AI in one chart'. He wrote: Power hungry Nvidia chips are not the way forward for the US.It is not just the total power advantage. It is the slope. In a follow-up post, Burry argued that Nvidia's dominant role in AI computing across the US has locked the industry into a path of higher power consumption. ""Nvidia's development roadmap is essentially a power consumption roadmap,"" he stated, adding that innovation has increasingly become about ""how to power and to cool bigger, hotter silicon. ""He said that efficiency improvements have failed to keep pace with the sheer growth in computing being deployed, pushing electricity needs ever higher.Burry contrasted this to China's infrastructure push. ""U.S. transmission grid development is actually decelerating due to permitting issues, while China is building transmission at will to match power output,"" he said.That mismatch, he warned, leaves U.S. companies investing heavily in an AI arms race they are ""structurally positioned to lose"" if power-hungry scaling remains the dominant strategy.Burry said that the U.S. must pivot away from brute-force approaches centered on massive data centers and instead focus on more efficient designs. ""The U.S. needs to get away from bigger and bigger power-hungry chips and innovate with AI-tuned ASICs like nobody's business,"" he wrote.In its quarterly 13-F filing released in November, Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management revealed that it has acquired put options, which secure the right to sell an asset at a given price by a certain date, on a pair of AI heavyweights: Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR). According to the filing, Scion now owns the right to sell 5 million Palantir shares and 1 million Nvidia shares, which at the time of filing had a combined value of just shy of $1.1 billion.Responding to the news in an interview to CNBC, Palantir CEO Alex Karp called the idea of shorting Palantir and Nvidia ""bats--- crazy,"" as they are two of the only companies ""making all the money"" in the AI sector. ""Alex Karp blasts ‘Big Short’ investor Michael Burry as ‘bats--- crazy’ for bets against Palantir, Nvidia."" Karp said that those engaging in shorts of Palantir, like Burry, may be engaging in ""market manipulation. ""","Investor Michael Burry has warned the country on Nvidia.

French Gates said transition to Microsoft wasn’t ‘easy’





Bill Gates’ ex-wife Melinda French Gates once called Microsoft a ‘little company’. During an interview with LinkedIn in March 2025, French Gates shared that during internship at IBM , her hiring manager offered a job offer, but she had already interviewed at Microsoft. “My hiring manager at IBM, a female, said to me, ‘Okay, are you ready to accept the job offer?’ And I said, ‘Well, I have one more company to go interview—this little company, Microsoft. It was tiny,” French Gates said during the interview.“And she said, ‘If they give you an offer, you should take it’,” Gates recalled adding “And it dumbfounded me”.Melinda French Gates eventually joined Microsoft and went on to work at the company for nine years. During her time there, she played a key role in the company’s growth and rose to the position of general manager of information products. Her career at Microsoft also contributed significantly to her personal wealth. With an estimated net worth of $17.4 billion, French Gates currently ranks among the 10 richest women in the United States.During the interview, Gates recalled how moving to Microsoft which was on the West Coast means she had to uproot her life. “I didn’t know anybody in Seattle. It was moving to the West Coast, but I was so excited about what they were doing. I was like, ‘I want to be part of that,’” she said.Sharing advice for others, especially women, Gates said “I remind them all the time you can pivot careers. You can change. You can go over here. “It’s not like one or two paths that carry you forward, even though you had plans before this.”","Melinda French Gates said transition to Microsoft wasn’t ‘easy’ French Gates played a key role in the company’s growth and rose to the position of general manager of information products.

CES 2026: What to expect from tech's biggest show this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ces-2026-what-to-expect-from-the-biggest-tech-show-this-year/articleshow/126332555.cms,"CES 2026 kicks off January 6 in Las Vegas with the tech industry's biggest names showing their latest gadgets. This year's show will be heavy on AI—expect it in everything from cameras to cars. Smart glasses are making a big push, TVs are getting brighter with new display tech, robots are getting smarter, and laptops are getting new chips. Plus, there'll be foldable phones and plenty of weird gadgets that may never actually exist.

AI and a lot of AI

Glasses that tell to be smart

Television to get brighter and bolder

Robots for every room and task

Laptops from practical to wild concepts

Smartphones for the adventurous

The weird, wild, and wonderful





The world's largest tech show—the Consumer Electronics Show, or CES—begins next week, i.e., on January 6 in Las Vegas, where tech companies will spend four days, showing off their newest gadgets and setting the agenda for the year ahead.If you've been following the news, you’ll know the announcements have already begun. Every tech brand you can think of: Samsung , LG, Sony , Intel, AMD, and Nvidia will showcase their latest tech, with press conferences starting Sunday. And as every year, this year's event promises the usual spectacle of TVs, laptops, and smart home gadgets, but with one unavoidable thread running through everything: artificial intelligence.But worry not, if you haven’t been keeping up with the internet, here’s a rundown of what to expect from the show floor at CES 2026.If there's one certainty about CES 2026, it's that AI will be everywhere. Companies will weave artificial intelligence into virtually every product category, from washing machines and refrigerators to cameras, cars, and beyond. The challenge for attendees and consumers alike will be separating genuinely useful AI applications from what critics call ""AI slop""—features added simply to check a marketing box.Expect a barrage of AI-powered devices, like smart home devices with more conversational voice assistants, and wearable AI accessories in various forms including wristbands, pendants, and camera-equipped devices.Smart glasses are poised to be one of the show's biggest trends. After what many sees as a successful year for Meta's Ray-Ban collaboration, CES 2026 will feature an avalanche of eyewear attempting to balance style, utility, and functionality.The variety will be staggering: glasses with mono and dual-lens waveguide screens, camera-free models for privacy-conscious consumers, ""AI glasses"" optimized for photos and audio, and video glasses offering XR features without the bulk of traditional headsets. Expect the usuals: TCL, Rokid, Xreal, and Even Realities to showcase their visions for what smart glasses should be, though a definitive blueprint remains elusive.TVs have always been the staple of CES. This year’s the word is around the town is that micro RGB LED technology will dominate the TV conversation at CES 2026. Both Samsung and LG have pre-announced their new lineups featuring this backlighting innovation, which uses red, green, and blue LED clusters instead of traditional white or blue LEDs to produce wider colour ranges that can even surpass OLED displays.Samsung is expanding its Micro RGB TV range to include 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, 100-, and 115-inch models after last year's debut of a $30,000 115-inch version. LG counters with its first Micro RGB evo TVs in 75-, 86-, and 100-inch sizes, boasting certifications for 100 percent colour gamut coverage. Hisense and Sony are also expected to reveal their RGB LED offerings.LG is also entering Samsung's ""art TV"" territory with its Gallery TV, available in 55- and 65-inch sizes, displaying artwork when not in use. For gamers, LG will showcase 5K displays with built-in AI upscaling, while Samsung counters with a 6K monitor promising glasses-free 3D.Robotics will be a centrepiece of CES 2026, moving from science fiction concepts to increasingly practical applications. Robot vacuums continue their rapid evolution, with models featuring retractable arms like the Roborock Saros Z70, legs for climbing over small ledges like the Dreame X50, and even stair-climbing capabilities shown at recent tech shows.Beyond floor cleaning, LG will introduce CLOiD, a humanoid home automation robot, while companies showcase pool cleaners, lawn mowers, and other automated helpers with ever-wilder capabilities. The integration of computer vision and world models—AI systems that understand physical space—should make these robots more competent at navigating homes and workplacesHyundai is also coming to the show, and its focus will be on in-cabin car technology and robotics.Aside from the big names, several others are expected to be on the show floor, showing off their new and flashy robots. Whether it's Samsung's long-delayed Ballie (announced twice before but never shipped) or entirely new concepts, CES 2026 will show robotics moving from novelty to necessity.CES traditionally brings laptop announcements from every major manufacturer except Apple, and 2026 will be no different. Expect refreshed versions of consumer and business laptops built around Intel's Panther Lake, Qualcomm's Snapdragon X2, and potentially new AMD processors. Gaming laptops may see fewer updates this year without new Nvidia graphics cards expected, though integrated graphics in the latest chips from Intel and Qualcomm could still impress.But beyond spec bumps, CES is where manufacturers also showcase radical ideas. LG will showcase its ultralight Aerominium laptops, that as the name implies uses Aerominium, and LG says it'll make these ones even lighter than its Gram laptops. Lenovo is rumoured to reveal a rollable gaming laptop and a SteamOS version of its Legion Go 2 handheld. The show typically features dual-screen, foldable, and other clever uses of screen real estate—hopefully moving past the concept stage to actual products.CES isn't known for mainstream smartphone launches those come later from Apple, Samsung, and Google. But the show attracts ""unusual"" with experimental features. The biggest hope is Samsung's Galaxy Z Trifold, which just launched in Korea and seems primed for a global debut on CES's big stage.This double-folding device with two hinges opens into a proper 10-inch tablet, potentially delivering on the promise of leaving laptops behind. Other unconventional devices and foldable concepts from smaller manufacturers should also appear, previewing what mobile technology might look like later this year.CES wouldn't be CES without its share of oddball gadgets that make you wonder ""why?"" and ""how much?"" in equal measure. Expect to see exoskeletons designed to help hikers and bikers tackle tougher terrain with less effort, LED face masks promising to make you look younger, and translation devices you wear on your face to seem smarter in conversations.Lego will make its first CES appearance in eight years, showcasing a new product line. A plethora of gadgets that will range from the genuinely useful to the unnecessarily connected—because apparently, everything from your toothbrush to your toilet needs an app now.There will be fitness wearables for pets that monitor their health and help locate them when they escape, over-the-counter hearing aids with AI, and probably at least one product that makes you question whether we've gone too far with technology. These head-turning concepts may never make it past the prototype stage, but they're part of what makes CES equal parts innovation showcase and circus of the future.","CES 2026 kicks off January 6 in Las Vegas with the tech industry's biggest names showing their latest gadgets. This year's show will be heavy on AI—expect it in everything from cameras to cars. Smart glasses are making a big push, TVs are getting brighter with new display tech, robots are getting smarter, and laptops are getting new chips. Plus, there'll be foldable phones and plenty of weird gadgets that may never actually exist.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126332555,imgsize-902510,width-400,resizemode-4/126332555.jpg"

The tax that's got billionaires running for the exit







David Sacks, the White House AI and crypto czar has now made another bold prediction. Sacks feels that time has come when Miami can replace New York as America’s financial capital and Austin could also dethrone San Francisco as the tech hub. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Sacks argued, “As a response to socialism, Miami will replace NYC as the finance capital and Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.” The comments made by Sacks has once again reignited the debate across tech and venture capitalist circles drawing support from contrarians skeptical of coastal dominance.The idea of Miami and Austin supplanting New York and San Francisco is not new. During the time of the pandemic, remote work led to migration to Texas and Florida as both the places are driven by lower taxes, cheaper living costs and more spaces. Austin gained a lot of importance due to the relocation of Tesla and Oracle. Along with these two companies, tech giants Google and Facebook also expanded their footprints. Sacks has long argued that high taxes, heavy regulation, and leftward politics are pushing talent and capital out of legacy centers.His latest comments coincided with the inauguration of Zohran Mamdani as New York City’s first socialist mayor, a symbolic backdrop to his prediction.Cratf Ventures, David Sacks’ own firm has already opened an office in Austin and Sacks himself is relocated there. With this relocation, Sacks joins the group of high-profile tech leaders including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Dell CEO Michael Dell and Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale, who have embraced Texas as a new innovation hub.On the other hand, recently, Thiel Capital, founded by billionaire investor Peter Thiel, announced it is expanding in Miami, underscoring the city’s growing appeal as California considers a wealth tax that could hit billionaires retroactively in 2026.The wealth tax proposal, pushed by healthcare union SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, would retroactively apply to anyone living in California on January 1, 2026. That means billionaires have just hours to establish residency elsewhere if they want to avoid it. For Page, whose net worth stands at roughly $258 billion, the tax bill could exceed $12 billion. Thiel, worth about $27.5 billion, would face a tab of more than $1.2 billion.The measure needs enough signatures to reach the November 2026 ballot, but some wealthy Californians aren't willing to gamble. Tech investor Chamath Palihapitiya warned the tax would trigger ""an exodus of the state's most talented entrepreneurs,"" adding he's giving ""serious consideration"" to moving to Texas.","David Sacks, the White House AI and crypto czar has now made another bold prediction.

Pivotal Research raises Google stock price target





Analysts at Pivotal Research warned in a recent note to clients that should ChatGPT-maker OpenAI may cut its spending or face other issues due to its mounting obligations. “It is likely to temporarily get pretty ugly for AI stocks and the market in general,” warn analysts in the research note. “We believe the shakeout, if it happens, will mirror 2000 and will inevitably be a healthy weeding out process leaving fewer much more dominant competitors, with Google leading the way,” says the note.Pivotal analysts expects Google Gemini to gain market share against OpenAI. Google’s partnership with Apple AI is likely to accelerate gain in Gemini's marketshare over ChatGPT. The research firm's note suggests that this trend could put pressure on OpenAI by 2026, potentially forcing the competitor to reduce capital expenditures due to ""massive obligations and likely falling OpenAI share."" Pivotal Research also points to Google’s TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) technology as offering ""a sustainable competitive advantage"" that could become a significant value driver through sales to outside parties and potentially taking market share from Nvidia.Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak reportedly believes that Google's tensor processing units could become a ""material driver of value"" as Google sells its chips to third parties.In October, Anthropic struck an agreement with Google to access up to 1 million TPUs. Last month, a report from The Information suggested that Meta Platforms (META) is in talks to spend billions on Google's chips. According to the report, Google Cloud executives said that the company's TPU business could generate up to 10% of the annual revenue that Nvidia does. Wlodarczak believes Google's semiconductor advancements could take share from Nvidia and drive down the cost of its chips.Pivotal Research has raised its price target on Google-parent Alphabet stock to $400 from $350 while maintaining a 'Buy' rating, citing continued momentum in the company’s core business lines. The research firm highlights Alphabet’s search business as a ""resilient cash cow with pricing power"" that drives the company’s Gemini AI technology. Pivotal notes that as Gemini takes search share, the economics with device manufacturers improve compared to traditional search partnerships, potentially boosting margins. This aligns with Alphabet’s strong financial performance, with revenue reaching $385.48 billion and growing at 13.42% year-over-year.""Google appears to be the best positioned of its peers to monetize AI investment internally and externally,"" Wlodarczak wrote, citing the success of Gemini, the core search business and the custom silicon business.","Pivotal Research raised its price target on Google-parent Alphabet stock to $400 from $350 while maintaining a 'Buy' rating.

Deleting data from broker databases reduces the possibility of identity theft, fraud and sophisticated AI impersonations. Personal safety: thirdly, limiting the availability of home addresses and family data provides a layer of protection against stalking and data leaks.

How DROP works

Residents of California must verify their eligibility, through the California Identity Gateway. Users can verify their status directly or via Login.gov.

Users provide basic identifiers.

One submission initiates the 90-day countdown for all registered brokers.





The State of California has officially launched the Delete Request and Opt-out Platform (DROP), a state-run service that will allow millions of residents to control their personal information by forcing hundreds of data brokers to delete their records. Positioned as a fast, free, and secure tool, DROP targets the sprawling industry of data brokers – companies that collect and sell all your data to other entities. This tool allows a single submission to reach over 500 registered data brokers simultaneously.Under California law, once a request is submitted via DROP, data brokers have a strict 90-day window to comply and delete the user's information.According to Official website of the State of California, there are three primary benefits for residents using the platform:While the service is currently restricted to California residents, the platform includes provisions for “Authorized Representatives.” This allows parents to submit requests for their minor children and family members to assist elderly relatives.To address potential concerns about state data collection, the platform emphasises that the information entered into DROP is never sold and is used exclusively to fulfill the deletion request.“Your information is only used to complete your request. It won’t be sold or shared for any other reason. You choose what information to provide. Data brokers only need basic information to find and delete the information they have about you. The personal information you give to DROP is protected and stored in a secure format,” the website said.Starting August 1, 2026, the 90-day deletion requirement becomes legally enforceable for all brokers receiving requests through the system.","The State of California has officially launched the Delete Request and Opt-out Platform (DROP), a state-run service that will allow millions of residents to control their personal information.

BUD has reported sales of 2.25 million BEVs in 2025, a 28% jump from the previous year. Tesla, by contrast, sold 1.64 million units, an 8.5% decline. This is the first time since 2018 that Tesla has lost its crown as the top BEV seller.The rise of BYD has been fuelled by its diverse product lineup which ranges from $200,000 supercars to the $7,800 Seagull hatchback. Along with this, the technological innovation including five‑minute EV charging and free autonomous driving features also played an important role in the growth of the company. Also, the strong international expansion with its plans to open 1,000 new stores in Europe after outselling Tesla there for the first time in May 2025.The company, once backed by Warren Buffett, also shipped 4.6 million vehicles in 2024 when plug‑in hybrids were included — a segment Tesla does not compete in.The downturn of Tesla comes amid a turbulent year. The Q4 sales of the company fell by 16% year‑over‑year after the U.S. removed a $7,500 EV tax credit in September, triggering an industry‑wide slump. Also, the sales of the company collapsed in Europe amid backlash over Musk’s political views. Additionally, in China, Tesla faced intense competition from a wave of affordable, high‑tech EVs led by BYD.Despite its success, BYD has faced headwinds:Still, BYD’s global ambitions and expanding footprint suggest it is well‑positioned to maintain momentum.","The rise of BYD has been fuelled by its diverse product lineup which ranges from $200,000 supercars to the $7,800 Seagull hatchback.

What is J-1 exchange visa Elon Musk used to move to the US



Elon Musk’s early career in the US questioned



Citizenship status of Elon Musk’s children





Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that he holds only American passport, and plans to live and die in the US. Musk’s statement was shared by X (formerly Twitter) user DogeDesigner who quoted the tech billionaire as saying: “I hold one passport now & forever: America. I will live & die here. Or Mars (part of America).”Elon Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa on June 28, 1971. His mother, Maye Musk is a Canadian citizen that enabled him to get Canadian citizenship in 1989 at the age of 17. In the same year, he enrolled at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario. In 1992, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania in the United States under a J-1 Exchange Visit.A J-1 visa is a US exchange visitor visa that allows foreign nationals to visit the country to take part in approved cultural and educational exchange programmes. It is commonly used by students, researchers, teachers, interns, trainees, professors, scholars and medical residents.J-1 visa holders usually come to the US for a fixed period, depending on their programme. In some cases, they must return to their home country for at least two years after the programme ends before applying for certain other US visas or permanent residency. This is known as the two-year home residency requirement.Now the world’s richest person, Musk became a naturalized US citizen in 2002.In 2024, the Washington Post reported that Musk began his career working illegally in the US when he was building a Silicon Valley startup in the 1990s. Video of the then US President Joe Biden referencing the report’s claims went viral on X. Responding to one such video, the tech billionaire denied working without authorization in the US.“I was in fact allowed to work in the US,” Musk wrote, accusing Biden of lying.Elon Musk has 12 children with three different partners. Many of his children are US citizens by birth, having been born on American soil. They may also hold Canadian citizenship through their mothers.","Elon Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa on June 28, 1971.

Google shares 5 ways AI agents may reshape work in 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-shares-5-ways-ai-agents-may-reshape-work-in-2026/articleshow/126321336.cms,"5 ways AI agents will transform the work in 2026



1. AI agents will help everyone be more productive.

Google Search AI Mode launched in India: Does it really make your search smarter?

2. Agentic workflows will become a core part of business processes.

3. Agents will bring five-star experiences to life for everyone.

4. AI agents will supercharge security operations.



5. Companies will double down on training an AI-ready workforce.





As we step into 2026, Google has shared a live blog listing 5 ways artificial intelligence (AI) agents will reshape the work. Releasing its 2026 AI Agent Trends Report, the tech giant said “We’re moving away from abstract, future-gazing possibilities, and focusing on delivering tangible business value right now. AI agents can now understand a goal, semi-autonomously develop a multi-step plan, and take actions on your behalf — all under your expert guidance and oversight.” Here’s a look at the five key trends that are defining where agents will fundamentally reshape business and drive new value in 2026Employees will now be able to delegate tasks to different AI agents to reach their goals, shifting their daily work from routine execution to higher-level strategic direction. AI is already becoming a core driver of work from the start: More than 57,000 team members at Telus are regularly using AI and saving 40 minutes per AI interaction. Meanwhile, Suzano, the world's largest pulp manufacturer, developed an AI agent with Gemini Pro that translates natural language questions into SQL code — resulting in a 95% reduction in the time required for queries among 50,000 employees.Multiple agents in a system can collaborate, coordinate and communicate to automate complex, multi-step processes.This sophisticated automation goes far beyond chatbots to answer questions, so AI can support specific functions with higher business value.In 2026, we’ll see businesses start connecting agents according to their needs and requirements, running entire workflows from start to finish. For example, Salesforce and Google Cloud are building cross-platform AI agents using the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol — a leap forward in establishing an open, interoperable foundation for agentic enterprises.The era of scripted chatbots and reactive customer service is coming to an end. In the coming year, we’ll see agents speeding up this shift — establishing hyperpersonalized, “concierge-style” service as the new standard for customer interactions.For example, global manufacturer Danfoss is using AI agents to automate email-based order processing, automating 80% of transactional decisions and reducing the average customer response from 42 hours to near real time.In a modern security operation center (SOC), human analysts are often overwhelmed by a constant stream of data and alerts. AI agents offer security teams the extra power and coverage they need to identify and respond to threats even faster. Macquarie Bank provides efficient, proactive fraud protection and digital self-service capabilities with Google Cloud AI, directing 38% more users towards self-service and reducing false positive alerts by 40%.We predict 2026 will be the year AI agents take over the most taxing security operations work, automating manual tasks like alert triage and investigation. This will allow human analysts to dedicate their focus to their most critical work: hunting threats and developing next-generation defenses.Adopting the latest AI technology and tools is only the first step. The biggest challenge — and the most critical factor for success — is people. During 2026, organizations will move from simply buying AI to building an AI-ready workforce, transitioning away from one-off training toward developing adaptable, continuous learning plans. These programs provide hands-on practice with real-world scenarios, allowing employees to build the AI skills they need at their own pace and on their own schedule.",Google has released its 2026 AI Agent Trends Report. It lists 5 ways artificial intelligence (AI) agents will reshape the work in 2026. Companies will double down on training an AI-ready workforce.

Minnesota Somali fraud





Reacting sharply to an online video allegedly threatening his life, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has declared war. A Somali-American woman recently said during a TikTok livestream that the tech billionaire is “about to die” soon, stating she “wouldn't worry too much about him. ” A clip from the livestream was shared on X (formerly Twitter) by user DogeDesigner. The tech billionaire, who appeared to take the comment as death threat, replied saying “Then it is war”.The livestream was posted by a Somali TikToker who went by the name ""Dowza.z”. According to a Fox News report, the account has since been deleted. In the video, the TikToker is seen switching back and forth from speaking in Somali and English, discussing Musk’s recent criticisms of Somali-run businesses engaged in rampant fraud in Minnesota. But her statement on Musk was said in English.Interestingly, Musk has pinned the post on this Twitter timeline which has now crossed more than 44 million views so far.Popular conservative account Libs of TikTok also shared the clip on Twitter, urging that the FBI ""should definitely look into this."" DogeDesigner also shared post, writing “Protect Elon Musk at all costs.”Sharing an X post, conservative commentator Eric Daugherty wrote, ""When fraud is exposed - it's always the fraudsters who yell and complain the loudest.Their THEFT will come to an end.""Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee posted on his personal X account, ""Deport her immediately,"" adding, ""She shouldn’t be here.""Recently, the Trump administration launched a probe into Minnesota's ""Feeding Our Future"" $250 million fraud scheme that allegedly targeted a children's nutrition program the Department of Agriculture funded and that Minnesota oversaw during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

When Steve Jobs got idea from luxury fashion mogul



The IBM manager who told Melinda French Gates to join Microsoft



Indra Nooyi got her inspiration from pop culture







Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Apple founder Steve Jobs, billionaire and philanthropist Melinda French Gates, and former Pepsi Co chief executive Indra Nooyi have at least two things in common: first, that they have led or worked in the world’s biggest companies, and second, they have all got life-changing advice from unlikeliest of places and people – ranging from a competing hiring manager to an elderly gardener in Tokyo.For Jensen Huang, CEO of the world’s biggest company by market cap Nvidia, has previously shared that the secret to corporate endurance didn't come from a tech seminar, but from a temple garden in Japan. While observing an elderly gardener meticulously tending to moss with a pair of bamboo tweezers, Huang asked how he could possibly maintain such a vast property with such a tiny tool.“He said something that is perfect. He said, ‘I have plenty of time.’ That’s the best career advice I can give you…Most of the time, I wait for things to come to me. I’m rarely chasing things,” Huang recalled at the Chinese American Semiconductor Professional Association in 2023, as per a report by Fortune.When Apple was considering moving away from big-box retailers like Sears, Jobs sought advice from Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH. Arnault was a master of high-end brick-and-mortar luxury, and encouraged Jobs to pursue the then-radical idea of standalone Apple Stores.“Everybody thought it’s completely crazy to sell Apple products in a shop,” Arnault recalled during a 2016 interview at the Oxford Union. He said that even Michael Dell, Dell Technologies CEO, thought it would never work.“I must say, I was myself a little doubtful of selling [iPods in shops]…But it was working,” he added.Melinda French Gates is now one of the world's leading philanthropists but she owes her start at Microsoft to a woman who was supposed to be hiring her for IBM. After interning at IBM for two summers, French Gates was ready to sign her full-time offer when she mentioned she had one final interview with a ""tiny"" Seattle startup.“My hiring manager at IBM said to me, ‘If they give you an offer, you should take it,’” French Gates recalled. The manager explained that the rapid growth at Microsoft would allow a young recruit to ascend the ranks much faster than the established hierarchy at IBM.She took the advice, moved to the West Coast, and spent nine years at Microsoft, ultimately becoming a key architect of the company’s rise into a $3.6 trillion titan.Unlike French Gates and Huang, unconventional advice can also come from television screen.Indra Nooyi, the former PepsiCo CEO, credited the TV show Sex and the City with teaching her about female leadership. Watching the 94-episode run, Nooyi was struck by the ""sisterhood"" of the characters.“They never judged each other; they supported each other,” Nooyi said in 2019, using the show as a blueprint for reducing unconscious bias and internal competition among women in the workplace.","Jensen Huang, CEO of the world’s biggest company by market cap Nvidia, has previously shared that the secret to corporate endurance didn't come from a tech seminar, but from a temple garden in Japan.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

“We believe initial versions of the robot will likely have a limited set of performable tasks. Given Tesla’s competitive advantages in embodied AI and manufacturing scale, we expect the company to be a formidable competitor in the space.”

How Tesla's Optimus robot may still need to learn indoor movement and user safety



""All of the activities were 'learnt direction from human videos,'”

""Even a child could clear a dinner table,""

""with a humanoid, if you cut the power, it's inherently unstable so it can fall on someone, for a factory, a warehouse or agriculture, legs are often inferior to wheels.”

“Who wouldn't want their own personal C-3PO/R2-D2? This is why I say human. Old robots will be the biggest product ever. Because everyone is gonna want one, or more than one.""





Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot may not be as advanced yet as the company’s CEO, Elon Musk , has suggested. Although Musk has assured investors that a robot could generate infinite revenue for Tesla and become its most vital product, a report shows it still has a long way to go to achieve such ambitious projections. Last year, Musk placed major bets on Optimus, envisioning a future where these robots work in factories, handle household tasks, perform surgeries, and even help colonise Mars. He has suggested manufacturing millions of robots annually and claims they could eliminate poverty and the need for work, though each robot is currently made by hand.However, Optimus still requires significant development before it can replace humans on a widespread scale as Musk envisions, a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report suggests. During public appearances, the robot is often remotely controlled by human engineers rather than operating independently, the report notes. Tesla engineers have even struggled to create robot hands that match human sensitivity and dexterity, the report added. Additionally, some employees within Musk's companies have also reportedly questioned whether the robots are actually helpful for routine business operations, such as manufacturing.Some analysts find it hard to put a value on Tesla’s humanoid robot plans because the industry is still very new, so they leave it out of their financial forecasts, the report continues. Even ARK Invest, which is very optimistic about Tesla and expects its share price to rise sharply, did not include the Optimus robot in its 2029 estimates, as it does not expect the robot to be a successful commercial product until later.In an email sent to WSJ, Tasha Keeney, a director at ARK Invest, wrote,According to the report, Tesla is facing a major challenge in teaching Optimus to navigate indoor spaces without tripping or falling onto people or pets. The company tried to solve this by hiring people to wear cameras and backpacks and collect training data during 24/7 shifts. Tesla even trained the robots to walk through the Tesla offices. The robots frequently toppled over to the point that the engineers had to come to pick them up.In October 2024, Musk revealed his vision at the Warner Bros. soundstage in California. Five Dancing Optimus bots performed to the song ""What Is Love"" by Haddaway. Others bartended wearing cowboy hats and bow ties. But in the background, something else was brewing, the report notes.While some robots were programmed to dance, others were actually controlled by engineers wearing bodysuits and VR headsets. Each robot required several engineers: one to teleoperate its movements, one with a laptop, and others to monitor its performance, the report added.Inside Tesla's lab, Optimus showed promise with simple tasks. In May 2025, the company released a video of Optimus putting trash in bins, vacuuming, and moving car parts.according to the company. Despite this progress, some Tesla engineers doubted the robot's usefulness in a factory, believing most jobs are better suited to task-specific robots.Berkeley roboticist Ken Goldberg highlighted to WSJ that the core challenge is to give robots human-like dexterity and environmental understanding.Goldberg noted, showing how far robots must go.Some competitors argue that legs are the problem. Standard Bots CEO Evan Beard, whose company sells wheeled robots, explained to WSJ thatTesla has abandoned its original factory deployment timeline and is working on the third generation. Still, Musk envisions Optimus as a household helper.In November 2025, Musk said,","Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot may not be as advanced yet as the company’s CEO, Elon Musk, has suggested.

Xu Bo, the billionaire founder of one of China’s largest mobile gaming empires, is reportedly attempting to biologically engineer a US-born dynasty. According to a recent report, the 48-year-old chairman of Guangzhou Duoyi Network, who has reportedly fathered more than 100 children, is seeking to father dozens of children via American surrogates to inherit his $1.1 billion fortune, and then get some of them married to Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s kids.A report in The Wall Street Journal claimed that several Weibo accounts linked to Xu have written that “Having more children can solve all problems” and fantasized about Xu’s children marrying Elon Musk’s children. Forbes claimed that even Bo has fantasized about his American kids marrying Musk’s children in the future.In November last year, Xu’s ex-girlfriend alleged that he had 300 children living around the world – a claim that has been outrightly denied by his company. Another Weibo account verified (by The Wall Street Journal) as being operated by Xu wrote in 2023 that he hoped to have “50 high-quality sons.”“Xu Bo had several children (all of mixed Chinese and Jewish descent) who were taken away in the United States due to sabotage by feminists and malicious rulings by a female judge,” the account posted in April 2024, seeming to refer to the confidential hearing that Xu had attended the year before.“Later, appeals were filed, and all the cases that went to trial were won. I heard that another case was won today, and one child was awarded to Xu Bo; he has already received the child,” the account added.While the company admits that Xu has utilised surrogacy services, they maintain that only 12 of the alleged 100-plus children were born in the United States.","Xu Bo is the founder of Guangzhou Duoyi Network, one of China’s largest mobile gaming empires.

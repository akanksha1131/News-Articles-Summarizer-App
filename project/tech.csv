Meta has ‘Donald Trump warning’ for EU on WhatsApp and Instagram



Apple removes hundreds of apps in EU, reason: DSA



Apple, Google and Microsoft share one common problem in Europe and it is their Size. The same problem or tough challenges in Europe now seems set to haunt Facebook-owned WhatsApp. Reason: The instant messaging platform WhatsApp has surpassed a key user threshold outlined in the European Union’s tech regulations, requiring it to take greater action against illegal and harmful online content. The messaging service, owned by Meta Platforms , disclosed in a February 14 filing that it averaged 46.8 million monthly active users in the EU over the six-month period ending December 2024—exceeding the 45 million user benchmark set by the Digital Services Act (DSA).According to a report by news agency Reuters, European Commission spokesperson, Thomas Regnier, confirmed the milestone, stating, ""WhatsApp has published user numbers above the threshold for designation as a Very Large Online Platform under the Digital Services Act.""With this classification, WhatsApp now has four months to comply with stricter regulations under the DSA. These include identifying and assessing risks related to illegal content, fundamental rights, public security, and child protection. Companies that fail to meet these requirements could face fines of up to 6% of their global annual revenue.Meta’s other major platforms, Facebook and Instagram, are already subject to these regulations. Meanwhile, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Meta's global policy director Joel Kaplan have been vocal critics of the EU’s tech policies, even seeking backing from former US President Donald Trump.Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Kaplan said Meta will not hesitate to seek the US President Trump's intervention if the European Union unfairly targets the company with its digital regulations. Kaplan emphasized Meta's commitment to fighting misinformation while acknowledging differing perspectives on what constitutes false information. The company has introduced Community Notes to enable user-driven fact-checking across its platforms.Meta has already faced over €2 billion in EU penalties for violating antitrust and data protection rules, and is currently under investigation for potential breaches of the Digital Services Act regarding minor protection.Earlier this week, Apple removed the apps that have not so far complied with the trader requirement in the European Union from the App Store. The company said that the apps that have been removed will not be allowed back in the ‌App Store‌ until trader status is provided and verified by Apple.","WhatsApp now has four months to comply with stricter regulations under the DSA.

Microsoft's new chip gives 'hope' quantum computing companies after Nvidia CEO's one sentence wiped billions for them,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsofts-new-chip-gives-hope-quantum-computing-companies-after-nvidia-ceos-one-sentence-wiped-billions-for-them/articleshow/118430378.cms,"What is Quantum computing



The Big Debate on Quantum computing timeline



What Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said



Quantum computing stocks rallied on Thursday, February 20, after software giant Microsoft revealed its new Majorana 1 chip, reigniting the debate about the technology's timeline. Microsoft asserts this chip demonstrates that practical quantum computing is ""years, not decades"" away, contradicting recent claims from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang that it's still two decades off. This announcement aligns Microsoft with Google and IBM, who also predict a much sooner arrival for widespread quantum computing applications.The Majorana 1 chip, nearly two decades in development, utilizes the elusive Majorana fermion, a subatomic particle theorized in the 1930s. This particle's unique properties make it less susceptible to the errors that plague current quantum computers, a significant hurdle in the technology's advancement. Microsoft's claims of reduced error rates are supported by a forthcoming paper in the journal Nature.Quantum computing promises to revolutionize computation by performing calculations currently impossible for even the most powerful supercomputers. This potential includes the ability to crack existing encryption methods, posing both opportunities and risks for cybersecurity. The core challenge lies in controlling qubits, the quantum equivalent of classical bits, which are highly unstable and error-prone.The contrasting timelines offered by tech leaders have created uncertainty in the market. Nvidia's CEO's January prediction of a two-decade timeline caused turmoil for quantum computing stocks, wiping out billions in market cap -- ending a year-long rally. The stocks of Quantum Computing companies witnessed monthly losses in January, ending a year-long rally that saw them outperform the tech-focused Nasdaq, as well as that of Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft.During Nvidia's analyst day at CES trade show in Las Vegas (US) in January this year, CEO Jensen Huang said that “very useful” quantum computers are likely decades away and may take 15-30 years. He told analysts that quantum computers would need 1 million times the number of quantum processing units, called qubits, that they currently have. This one sentence of his sent shock waves, throwing stocks of Quantum computing companies in a free fall. So much so that the selling frenzy even took toll on companies with similar names: Quantum Corp, a data management company, gained more than 670% last year, only to drop about 60% so far in 2025. Quantum-Si Inc, a life science company developing protein sequencing platforms, too witnessed a fall.Nvidia CEO's comments contrasted with Google's assertion that commercial applications are only five years away, and IBM's projection of large-scale quantum computers by 2033. Microsoft's new chip and its accompanying claims now bolster the argument for a more imminent arrival of practical quantum computing.","Quantum computing stocks rallied on Thursday, February 20, after Microsoft revealed its new Majorana 1 chip.

Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has cautioned that Europe risks becoming a technological “museum” if it fails to relax its stringent regulations on artificial intelligence (AI) and embrace a more deregulated approach.Speaking at the Techarena event in Stockholm, Kristersson expressed concerns about Europe's economic growth lagging behind that of the US and China over the past two decades, as per CNBC.“I think we really need to step up in Europe ... the American economy, Chinese economy have been growing far faster compared to the European economies over the last 20 years,” the PM said.“If we don’t change that, Europe will actually become some kind of a museum compared to other parts of the world,” he warned.Recently, various European leaders at the recent Paris AI Action Summit emphasised the need for Europe to become more competitive in the global AI landscape. French President Emmanuel Macron announced a 109 billion euros investment in AI, including commitments from both international and domestic investors.Macron likened the scale of this investment to the $500 billion Stargate private AI investment venture. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also stated that the EU plans to mobilize a total of 200 billion euros for AI investment across the continent.In contrast to Europe's approach, US leaders have emphasized a less regulatory approach. At the Paris summit, Vice President JD Vance argued that Europe's focus on AI regulation could stifle its growth potential and encouraged European allies to view AI with optimism rather than apprehension.“To create that kind of trust, we need international regulatory regimes that fosters the creation of AI technology rather than strangles it, and we need our European friends in particular to look to this new frontier with optimism rather than trepidation,” Vance told attendees at the Paris summit.",Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has cautioned that Europe risks becoming a technological ‘museum’ if it fails to relax its stringent regulations on artificial intelligence.

“The SEBI circular on

API usage

and algo trading is out. What you need to know:

If you’re a retail trader using broker APIs to automate trades, you can do so as long as your order frequency is below an exchange-prescribed threshold. This limit is yet to be decided.

If you’re selling algos or strategies to other traders, you’ll need to partner with a broker and get yourself registered with the exchanges to do so.

Marketplaces, where people share algos for a fee, can’t publish strategies without exchange registration as well as an RA license.

The exchanges will publish their own circulars with operational details by April 1.”

SEBI's latest ALGO trading rules | The Daily Brief #163

What SEBI’s new algo trading rules say



Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India 's (SEBI) new rules. In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Kamath explained SEBI ’s new regulations concerning algorithmic trading for retail investors, a move that significantly alters market participation. Kamath highlighted that retail traders selling trading strategies or algorithms must now partner with a broker and register with stock exchanges. Furthermore, platforms facilitating the sharing of algorithms for a fee will need both exchange registration and a research analyst (RA) licence.In the X post, Kamath wrote:In the comment section of the post, he also shared the link to an article which explains the latest SEBI algo trading regulations in details.SEBI’s newly announced framework will allow retail investors to engage in algo trading—an opportunity previously limited to institutional players. The move comes in response to rising demand from retail participants and aims to strike a balance between accessibility and risk management.Under the updated regulations, brokers must secure exchange approval for each algorithm and ensure that all automated orders include a unique identifier for audit tracking. Any modifications to an approved algorithm will also require regulatory clearance. Retail investors developing their algorithms will only need to register them if their order execution frequency exceeds a specified threshold.SEBI has categorised algorithms into two types: “white box” algos, where the logic is transparent and replicable, and “black box” algos, which operate without disclosure. Providers of black box algos will be required to obtain a Research Analyst (RA) license and maintain detailed research documentation.Set to take effect on August 1, these new rules are expected to transform India’s algo trading landscape—expanding automation for retail traders while introducing stricter compliance measures to uphold market integrity .","Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath is helping traders understand the Securities and Exchange Board of India's new rules.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle



Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

No, It’s Overhyped Yes, It’s a Game-Changer

DeepSeek available on Amazon Bedrock

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek, saying that the company was specifically impressed with some of the training techniques that the Chinese AI startup has used to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model.“Well, I'd say a few things because there are a few questions built into that. First of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeek has done,” Jassy said while replying to a question during Amazon Q4 earnings call.“I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training -- reinforcement learning being earlier and without the human-in-the-loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning,” he added.Jassy also highlighted “some of the inference optimisations” that DeepSeek did, saying they “were also quite interesting.”During Google-parent Alphabet latest earnings call, the company's CEO Sundar Pichai also praised DeepSeek’s AI advancements but emphasised Gemini's efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. He also highlighted Google’s focus on optimising its AI model deployment.Jassy also said that DeepSeek’s AI model is available on Amazon Bedrock .“And I think if you run a business like AWS and you have a core belief like we do, that virtually all the big generative AI apps are going to use multiple model types, and different customers are going to use different models for different types of workloads. You're going to provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock. And it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeek was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker faster than you saw from others,” he added.He also believes that the cost of inference will decrease, making it easier for companies to integrate inference and generative AI into all their applications.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has heaped praise on DeepSeek.

Asmita Patel accused of re-routing money

Securities & Exchange Board of India ( SEBI ) has seized Rs 53.67 crore from Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd along with five other entities.

Asmita Patel is also at risk of losing another Rs 104.6 crore it collected from course fees, which SEBI believes were part of unregistered advisory services.”The investigation was initiated by SEBI after receiving complaints from 42 participants of these courses. In addition to impounding the Rs 53.67 crore, SEBI has issued a show-cause notice questioning why Rs 104.6 crore, collected as fees for various programs, should not also be seized.SEBI has sent an interim order directing the school, Asmita Jitesh Patel, and Jitesh Jethalal Patel to cease offering unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services. The entities have also been barred from accessing the securities market.The order also uncovered that fees collected from participants were routed through entities such as King Traders (proprietor: Sagar Dhanjibhai), Gemini Enterprise (proprietor: Suresh Parmashivam), and United Enterprises (proprietor: Jigar Rameshbhai Dawada). SEBI stated that this was a regular practice and not an isolated incident, making all six entities jointly and severally liable for the Rs 53.67 crore earned from course fees.The regulator further demanded that the notices explain why they should not be ordered to disgorge Rs 104.6 crore, along with interest. SEBI's order noted that the fees collected for LMIT, MPAT, and OM courses, as well as other programs provided by the school, were earned under the guise of unregistered advisory and research analyst services.The order reads, “The aforesaid amount includes not only the amount collected as fees by the Noticees for LMIT, MPAT and Options Multiplier (OM) courses but also includes the fees collected by the Noticees for the other courses offered by the Noticee no.1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading )through which it carried out unregistered investment advisory and research analyst services along with interest”.Kamlesh Varshney, SEBI's Whole-Time Member, highlighted in the order “Examination revealed that, prima facie, the Noticee no. 1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading) along with the Noticee no.2 (Asmita Jitesh Patel) and the Notice no.3 (Jitesh Jethalal Patel) devised a scheme wherein students/investors/participants were lured to trade in specific stocks and told to open trading account with ABC Ltd.

How this issue is affecting users



“as soon as Android Auto connects and I attempt to interact with the screen, my OnePlus 12 reboots.”

“I’ve tried everything I can think of, but nothing works. It’s like I’ve been scammed out of a good feature in my brand-new car.”

“I’m having the same issue with a 2021 Audi Q5 and a OnePlus 12 running AA 13.5. It only becomes responsive after I interact with the phone while it’s connected to Android Auto. Otherwise, it soft-reboots and then reconnects automatically,”

“this issue only started about a week ago. Before then, Android Auto worked flawlessly. Now, it reboots my phone seemingly out of nowhere.”

“After the January 27, 2025, update, wireless Android Auto stopped working for me. Wired connections are fine, but I’ve seen other users reporting the same problem.”

“I have to restart my phone to reconnect Android Auto every time I turn off the car or disconnect the phone.”

Some Android Auto users are reportedly experiencing a frustrating issue. As per user complaints , this issue is forcing their phones to unexpectedly reboot when they are trying out wireless connections for their car systems. This problem appears to have arisen after the release of Android Auto versions 13.4 and 13.5, leading to a significant increase in user complaints, particularly on Reddit (spotted by Android Authority).However, Google has yet to acknowledge the issue, one user also suggested a workaround to temporarily mitigate the issue. Affected users can update to the latest Android Auto version, 13.7, which was recently released. However, users who still experience problems should check the Google Play Store for an update. It's also important to note that, most complaints appear to originate from those using version 13.5.One Reddit user described their experience, stating,Another user noted:Several others have reported similar issues with their devices restarting or malfunctioning when connected to Android Auto wirelessly.a third user highlighted.A fourth user claimed thatIn addition to the reboot problem, some users have reported that their wireless connectivity is completely broken, with 9to5Google uncovering similar complaints on Google’s support forums.A Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra owner wrote:Other forum users confirmed the issue, mentioning that they must restart their phones every time they disconnect or turn off the car:","Some Android Auto users are reportedly experiencing a frustrating issue.

WhatsApp, the messaging platform owned by Meta Platforms, has surpassed the user threshold set by the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA), requiring the company to take on greater responsibility for combating illegal and harmful online content.In a February 14 filing, WhatsApp reported having approximately 46.8 million average monthly active users in the EU during the latter half of 2024. This exceeds the DSA's 45-million-user threshold that designates a platform as a ""Very Large Online Platform"" (VLOP), as per news agency Reuters.European Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier confirmed this designation.“We can indeed confirm that WhatsApp has published user numbers above the threshold for designation as a Very Large Online Platform under the Digital Services Act,” said Regnier.As a VLOP, WhatsApp now has four months to comply with the DSA's requirements. These include identifying and assessing systemic risks related to illegal content, fundamental rights, public security, and the protection of minors.Non-compliance can result in fines of up to 6% of a company's global annual revenue. Meta's other platforms, Facebook and Instagram, are already classified as VLOPs under the DSA.Recently, Meta's top policy executive warned that the tech giant would not hesitate to involve the US President Trump if European Union regulators unfairly target the company, signaling an escalation in tensions between American tech firms and European authorities.Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Meta's Global Policy Director Joel Kaplan stated that while the company remains committed to operating within EU laws, it would alert the U.S. government to any perceived discriminatory treatment, Bloomberg reported.The strong stance comes as Meta faces mounting regulatory pressure in Europe. The company, which owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has already incurred over 2 billion euros in EU fines for violations of antitrust and data protection regulations.

A recent report by Australia’s online safety regulator, eSafety, has revealed that children across the country are easily bypassing age restrictions imposed by social media platforms. The findings come ahead of a landmark government ban, which will prohibit social media access for children under 16 by the end of 2025.The study, which combined a national survey of children aged 8 to 15 and responses from eight major social media services, highlights a widespread failure of platforms to enforce existing age restrictions. Despite most platforms setting a minimum age of 13, 80% of children aged 8 to 12 in Australia actively used social media in 2024. The most popular services include YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat.The report also found that 95% of teenagers under 16 had accounts on at least one of the surveyed platforms. Most social media platforms rely solely on self-declared ages at sign-up, without additional verification measures. With Australia’s upcoming ban on social media use for children under 16, the government is expected to tighten enforcement measures and push platforms to enhance their age verification systems.According to the eSafety report, 80% of Australian children aged 8 to 12 used social media platforms in 2024. The most commonly accessed platforms include:Among these, YouTube is the only platform that officially allows under-13 usage, but only when linked to a family account with parental supervision. However, the report found that none of the 8 to 12-year-olds who created accounts faced shutdowns for being underage.For teenagers under 16, the rate of social media usage is even higher, with 95% of them having an account on at least one of the eight surveyed services.The eSafety report highlights that most social media platforms fail to implement effective age verification measures. While seven of the eight platforms surveyed required users to enter their date of birth at sign-up, they did not verify the information in any way.The platforms included in the survey were:The lack of robust age verification means that children can easily bypass restrictions by entering a false date of birth.The report also found that only a few platforms actively monitor underage users. TikTok, Twitch, Snapchat, and YouTube have automated tools to detect users under 13, while other platforms—despite having the technology—did not implement such measures.Some platforms offered pathways for users to report accounts belonging to underage individuals, but there was no standardized process across all services.In November 2024, the Australian government approved a ban on social media use for children under 16, making it one of the strictest age-related regulations worldwide. The ban is scheduled to take effect at the end of 2025.The new policy will require:Julie Inman Grant, Australia’s eSafety Commissioner, emphasized that more work is needed to ensure compliance before the ban takes effect. She stated:While the government is pushing for stronger age verification measures, enforcing the under-16 ban poses significant challenges. Many platforms have resisted implementing stricter verification processes, citing concerns over:Experts suggest that social media companies may have to adopt document-based verification systems, AI-powered age estimation technology, or parental consent mechanisms to comply with the new rules.With the ban taking effect in late 2025, platforms will need to invest significantly in compliance measures. Failure to adhere to the new regulations could result in:Several companies have begun researching age verification improvements, but the extent of their efforts remains unclear.","A recent report by Australia’s online safety regulator, eSafety, has revealed that children across the country are easily bypassing age restrictions imposed by social media platforms.

Not the first-time layoff

TikTok is reportedly laying off global staff at its trust and safety unit which handles content moderation , a report has said, adding that the job cuts are a part of a restructuring. The news comes at a time when the company is on the clock, facing a ban in the country.Citing three sources familiar with the matter, news agency Reuters reported that Adam Presser, operations head of the app who also oversees the unit, sent a memo out to staff on Thursday notifying them of the move.The layoffs began the same day for teams in Asia and Europe, Middle East and Africa, two of the sources added.The move comes as TikTok's fate remains up in the air. The popular short video app used by nearly half of all Americans went dark briefly last month, before a law took effect on January 19 that required its Chinese owner ByteDance either to sell it on national security grounds or face a ban.In January last year, TikTok Shou Chew testified before Congress alongside Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg and other tech and media heads in a hearing where lawmakers accused the companies of failing to protect children from escalating threats of sexual predation on their platforms.Replying to questions from Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, TikTok's CEO had said that the company would spend more than $2 billion on trust and safety efforts.In October last year, the company laid off hundreds of employees from its global workforce, including a large number of staff in Malaysia as it shifts focus towards a greater use of AI in content moderation.TikTok says it has 40,000 trust and safety professionals worldwide.","TikTok is reportedly laying off global staff at its trust and safety unit which handles content moderation.

Microsoft unveils Majorana 1 quantum computing chip: Read what CEO Satya Nadella has to say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-unveils-majorana-1-quantum-computing-chip-read-what-ceo-satya-nadella-has-to-say/articleshow/118416648.cms,"Why this is significant for quantum computing

What is topoconductor

Read Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s take on Majorana 1 quantum computing chip

A couple reflections on the quantum computing breakthrough we just announced...

Most of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed.

After a nearly 20 year pursuit, we’ve created an entirely new state of matter, unlocked by a new class of materials, topoconductors, that enable a fundamental leap in computing.

It powers Majorana 1, the first quantum processing unit built on a topological core.

We believe this breakthrough will allow us to create a truly meaningful quantum computer not in decades, as some have predicted, but in years.

The qubits created with topoconductors are faster, more reliable, and smaller.

They are 1/100th of a millimeter, meaning we now have a clear path to a million-qubit processor.

Imagine a chip that can fit in the palm of your hand yet is capable of solving problems that even all the computers on Earth today combined could not!

Sometimes researchers have to work on things for decades to make progress possible.

It takes patience and persistence to have big impact in the world.

And I am glad we get the opportunity to do just that at Microsoft.

This is our focus: When productivity rises, economies grow faster, benefiting every sector and every corner of the globe.

It’s not about hyping tech; it’s about building technology that truly serves the world.

Microsoft has unveiled Majorana 1, the world’s first quantum chip built on a new Topological Core architecture. This innovation marks a significant step towards developing quantum computers capable of addressing complex, real-world problems within years, rather than decades, as previously anticipated.The key to this advancement is the use of the world's first topoconductor, a revolutionary material that allows for the observation and control of Majorana particles. This capability enables the creation of more stable and scalable qubits, the fundamental units of quantum computers.Microsoft draws a parallel between the invention of semiconductors, which revolutionised modern electronics, and the potential of topoconductors to transform quantum computing. The company believes that topoconductors and the chips they enable pave the way for quantum systems capable of scaling to a million qubits, unlocking the ability to tackle the most challenging industrial and societal problems.This new architecture used to develop the Majorana 1 processor offers a clear path to fit a million qubits on a single chip that can fit in the palm of one’s hand, Microsoft said.The topoconductor, also known as a topological superconductor, represents a unique class of material capable of generating an entirely new state of matter. This state is not a conventional solid, liquid, or gas, but rather a topological state. Microsoft is leveraging this unique property to create a more stable and robust type of qubit. This “topological qubit” offers significant advantages: it is fast, compact, and can be digitally controlled without the compromises inherent in current qubit designs.As per Microsoft, this breakthrough required developing an entirely new materials stack made of indium arsenide and aluminium, much of which the company designed and fabricated atom by atom. The goal was to coax new quantum particles called Majoranas into existence and take advantage of their unique properties to reach the next horizon of quantum computing, Microsoft said.","Microsoft has unveiled Majorana 1, the world’s first quantum chip built on a new Topological Core architecture. This innovation marks a significant step towards developing quantum computers capable of addressing complex, real-world problems within years, rather than decades. The key to this advancement is the use of the world's first topoconductor, a revolutionary material.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118416672,imgsize-79304,width-400,resizemode-4/118416672.jpg"

In a surprising move, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), co-founded by Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan , has announced the termination of its Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) programs. This decision comes just weeks after the organisation assured its staff that it would continue supporting DEI efforts, marking yet another U-turn in Zuckerberg's recent series of policy shifts.The announcement was made in an internal email by CZI's Chief Operating Officer, Marc Malandro, who cited regulatory and legal changes as the primary reasons for dismantling the DEIA team. The organisation will also halt its social advocacy funding , which previously provided grants for racial equity and immigration reforms.CZI's decision to end its DEIA programs aligns with a broader shift in focus towards science philanthropy , particularly in the fields of biology and artificial intelligence. Malandro stated that the organisation would now issue grants for projects in these areas, moving away from its previous commitments to social advocacy.The move has sparked concerns among CZI employees, especially given the recent elimination of DEI programs at Meta, Zuckerberg's tech giant. Despite earlier reassurances from CZI's HR executive that Meta's changes would not impact CZI, the organisation has now made a complete reversal.In addition to ending its DEIA programs, CZI has also canceled its Science Diversity Leadership Awards, which provided $1.5 million grants to underrepresented researchers, and its Diverse Slate Practice, which ensured that candidates from diverse backgrounds were considered for job openings.","The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), co-founded by Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, has terminated its Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) programs.

Government orders ban on 119 apps on Google Play Store on national security ground; most apps linked to China and HongKong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/government-orders-ban-on-119-apps-on-google-play-store-on-national-security-ground-most-apps-linked-to-china-and-hongkong/articleshow/118407272.cms,"Majority of apps are still available for download, but may ..

The government has reportedly issued orders to block 119 mobile apps, primarily video and voice chat platforms linked to Chinese and Hong Kong developers. According to a report in Moneycontrol that quotes a now deleted listing on the Harvard University-operated Lumen Database . The ban comes after the year 2020, when the government implemented similar bans on popular Chinese apps including TikTok and ShareIt, citing national security concerns. On June 20, 2020, the Indian government banned almost 100 Chinese apps. Similar bans on Chinese and China-linked apps followed in 2021 and 2022 as well; but in much smaller numbers.The blocking orders, reportedly issued under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, also affect some apps from Singapore, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Section 69A empowers the central government to restrict public access to online content for national security and public order reasons. Officials told the publication that orders under the same are confidential.MoneyControl reports that the majority of the apps remain available to download, and only 15 apps have been removed from the Google Play Store so far.Of the 119 apps ordered to be blocked by the Indian government, only three were specifically identified in the report. ChillChat, a Singapore-based video chat and gaming platform developed by Mangostar Team, boasts over one million downloads and a 4.1-star rating on the Google Play Store. The Chinese-developed ChangApp, created by Blom, was also named among the affected applications. The third identified app, HoneyCam, is operated by Australian company Shellin PTY Ltd and features content review mechanisms including automated filtering and manual oversight.Three affected developers told MoneyControl they learned about the ban through Google and expressed willingness to work with Indian authorities to address concerns. ChillChat, a Singapore-based app with over one million downloads, reported that the blocking would significantly impact their Indian users' daily communications and entertainment activities.The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has not publicly disclosed specific security concerns related to these applications. Google's disclosure on the Lumen Database, which was published on February 18 but has since been deleted, did not specify the timeline for enforcing the remaining blocks.","The government has reportedly issued orders to block 119 mobile apps, primarily video and voice chat platforms linked to Chinese and Hong Kong developers.

What Satya Nadella wrote about Quantum Computing



A couple reflections on the quantum computing breakthrough we just announced...

Most of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed.

After a nearly 20 year pursuit, we’ve created an entirely new state of matter, unlocked by a new class of materials, topoconductors, that enable a fundamental leap in computing.

It powers Majorana 1, the first quantum processing unit built on a topological core.

We believe this breakthrough will allow us to create a truly meaningful quantum computer not in decades, as some have predicted, but in years.

The qubits created with topoconductors are faster, more reliable, and smaller.

They are 1/100th of a millimeter, meaning we now have a clear path to a million-qubit processor.

Imagine a chip that can fit in the palm of your hand yet is capable of solving problems that even all the computers on Earth today combined could not!

Sometimes researchers have to work on things for decades to make progress possible.

It takes patience and persistence to have big impact in the world.

And I am glad we get the opportunity to do just that at Microsoft.

This is our focus: When productivity rises, economies grow faster, benefiting every sector and every corner of the globe.

It’s not about hyping tech; it’s about building technology that truly serves the world.

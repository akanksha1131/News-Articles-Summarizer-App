(TSMC) in building the supply chain of the global AI chip industry. “When Nvidia comes up with new, more advanced GPUs, it requires more HBM chips,” Chey explained. “That's why SK hynix is working hard to keep up. Developing advanced HBM products and maintaining high yields is challenging, so closer cooperation with Nvidia is essential,” he added.","SK Hynix is a key supplier of high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to Nvidia.

Netflix's Gaming Struggles

Of the 24 titles currently listed on Netflix's ""Interactive Specials"" page, only four will survive the cut:

Netflix is reportedly set to bid farewell to most of its interactive shows and films., only a handful of titles will remain accessible on the platform, the company confirmed the same to The Verge. Netflix's foray into interactive storytelling began in 2017 with ""Puss in Book: Trapped in an Epic Tale."" The platform quickly gained recognition for its innovative titles, particularly the mind-bending ""Black Mirror: Bandersnatch.""However, despite initial enthusiasm, the format didn't quite take off as expected. Several interactive titles, including those based on popular franchises like ""Carmen Sandiego"" and ""Boss Baby,"" along with experimental series like daily trivia shows and multiplayer games, will be removed from the platform.Netflix spokesperson Chrissy Kelleher told the publication that while the technology behind interactive content served its purpose, the company is now prioritizing other technological advancements. This decision aligns with the recent departure of former gaming boss Mike Verdu, who is now focusing on generative AI for games at Netflix.The delisting of interactive content is just one piece of Netflix's broader gaming strategy. While the platform has a growing library of mobile games, including titles based on popular reality TV shows, it has faced setbacks in other areas.The closure of the AAA game studio: Netflix recently shut down its ambitious AAA game studio before it could release a single game. The company's game streaming beta, despite expanding to the US over a year ago, remains in a testing phase.Netflix recently announced that vice president of Global Public Policy Dean Garfield, and chief communications officer Rachel Whetstone are leaving the company.

Airtel, Reliance Jio, Vodafone-Idea: Who owes how much

Bharti Airtel has reportedly urged the Department of Telecommunications DoT ) to ensure a level playing field for all telecom operators. According to a report in Economic Times, the letter comes as the government considers Vodafone-Idea 's (Vi) plea for a waiver of bank guarantees (BGs) on spectrum payments.In the letter to DoT, Airtel said that it supports the proposed waiver, but any regulatory reform must have a ""non-discriminatory"" framework across all telcos, without considerations such as the financial health of particular operators. The ET report says quoting officials aware of the matter.Airtel reportedly highlights its own significant spectrum acquisitions and the subsequent BG obligations, arguing for a consistent regulatory framework. Vodafone-Idea, grappling with financial challenges, has sought government intervention to alleviate its burden and secure additional credit from banks. The proposed BG waiver would provide much-needed relief for the struggling telco.Airtel telco reportedly cited the 2021 telecom reforms which treated all the telecom players equally with no special benefit to any one company.Earlier this year, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), representing all private telcos, too had written to the DoT, seeking to do away with the need of BGs for auctions conducted before 2022. The DoT is currently reviewing the BG waiver proposal, with a draft cabinet note suggesting a potential compromise. Under this proposal, telcos could opt for a BG waiver in exchange for pre-paying three additional months of spectrum payments.The amount of Reliance Jio's annual bank guarantee (BG) requirement for past auctions could be to the tune of Rs 4,000 crore while the amount for Airtel could be around Rs 3,000 crore. Both the companies have been clearing past spectrum dues by pre-paying instalments in a bid to save interest costs. Having raised Rs 24,000 crore via equity, Vodafone-Idea now wants to raise Rs 25,000 crore more via loans and another Rs 10,000 crore in BGs or letters of credit to continue its capital expenditure to compete effectively against Airtel and Reliance Jio.",Bharti Airtel has reportedly urged the Department of Telecommunications DoT ) to ensure a level playing field for all telecom operators.

How PTI ran Fact Check on the fake news

Plunging a new low, Canada recently linked Union home minister Amit Shah to attacks on Sikh separtists in Canada. The country's Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister David Morrison alleged that Shah ordered a campaign of violence, intimidation and intelligence-gathering targeting Sikh separatists inside Canada. Indian government vehemently rejected Morrison's claims, terming them ""absurd and baseless"" allegations will have serious consequences for bilateral ties.Now, some Pakistan-based social media users shared a graphic card to claim that the Interpol had put India's Union Home Minister on its 'wanted list'. A Pakistan-based Facebook page named ' Khaber.tv ' shared on November 1 a graphic card carrying Shah's photo and wrote: ""Credible sources have informed that Indian Home Minister Amit Shah has recently been added to Interpol's wanted list. Shah is in hot waters after Canada's Deputy Foreign Minister accused him of authorising killing operations against Canadian Sikh nationals.""News agency PTI did a Fact Check on the graphic. The Fact Check Desk ran the viral graphic card through Google Lens. The search results through Google Lens did not fetch any credible news report corroborating the claim.In the next part of its investigation, the desk reportedly searched Interpol's official website using the keyword 'Amit Shah' across pages but could not find any information about the global agency issuing any such notice.PTI's investigation has made it clear that the international police organisation has not issued any notice mentioning home minister Amit Shah, and the graphic card shared on social media by some Pakistani channels is completely fake.","Some Pakistan-based social media users shared a graphic card to claim that the Interpol had put India's Union Home Minister on its 'wanted list' India's Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister David Morrison alleged that Shah ordered a campaign of violence, intimidation and intelligence-gathering targeting Sikh separatists inside Canada.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114957043,imgsize-30016,width-400,resizemode-4/114957043.jpg"

In the digital age, technology has brought about numerous advancements, but it has also opened the door to sophisticated cybercrimes. Recently, Bengaluru witnessed a concerning instance of cyber fraud involving deepfake videos of two prominent Indian businessmen: Infosys co-founder N. R. Narayana Murthy and Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani . As per reports, these fraudulent videos were used as bait to deceive two individuals, leading to collective financial losses amounting to approximately Rs 95 lakh. The incidents shed light on the increasing risks associated with deepfake technology and the importance of verifying online content before engaging with it. This detailed report covers the nature of the scam, the modus operandi of the fraudsters, and the ongoing investigation by authorities.Two separate cases have been reported to the Cyber Economic and Narcotics (CEN) South police station in Bengaluru. Both incidents involved fraudulent schemes where victims were misled by videos that appeared to feature Narayana Murthy and Mukesh Ambani, promoting lucrative investment opportunities.In the first instance, a woman from Banashankari encountered a video on social media that promoted a trading platform, promising substantial returns on investments. The video appeared credible, featuring Narayana Murthy, which increased her trust in the platform. Key details of this case include:The second case involved a retired employee who also came across a video on a social media platform promoting a similar trading platform. The video seemed authentic and convincing, featuring Mukesh Ambani discussing investment opportunities. Details of this case include:The fraudsters employed deepfake technology to create or misuse videos featuring well-known business leaders. These videos were designed to appear legitimate, using the likenesses and voices of respected figures to lend credibility to their scams. The tactics used included:Authorities suspect that the fraudsters might have used actual video footage of Narayana Murthy and Mukesh Ambani from public events, such as stakeholder meetings or corporate addresses, and manipulated them to suit their narrative. Deepfake technology, which uses artificial intelligence to create hyper-realistic but falsified videos, allows scammers to make it appear as though prominent figures are endorsing products or schemes they have no connection to.These cases underscore the critical importance of verifying online content and exercising caution when approached with investment opportunities.

Cashify CEO Mandeep Manocha: Our core mission is to extend the life of devices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/cashify-ceo-mandeep-manocha-our-core-mission-is-to-extend-the-life-of-devices/articleshow/114955911.cms,"Let's start with Cashify's journey, can you tell us bit about the same?

Mandeep Manocha is co-founder and CEO of Cashify, a leading online marketplace for refurbished electronics . With over 12 years at the helm, Mandeep has guided Cashify 's growth Prior to Cashify, he founded and led ZazzyBox and Manak Waste Management. His experience also includes a stint in investment banking at Lehman Brothers. Mandeep holds a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from Panjab University. In an interaction with Times of India, Mandeep talked about Cashify's growth over the years, refurbished market and importance of sustainability. Excerpts:We started in 2013-2014, Our motivation was simple: we were driven by the idea of preventing e-waste. We saw a huge opportunity to extend the life of used devices. My co-founders and I come from a waste management background. We started a company in 2009 and spent a significant amount of time on actual waste management projects, including setting up and running a plastic and rubber waste recycling factory for two or three years. We became interested in electronic waste, but we realized that e-waste isn't really e-waste until it sits unused in your house.There were two reasons: First, we believe that our consumers are everywhere. They're both online and offline. Second, because we buy used devices, we refurbish and resell them. We realized about four years ago that trust was missing in the refurbished space. To build trust, we needed a physical touch-and-feel store where people could experience the phones firsthand. Every phone we sell could be different, so having a physical store helps people build trust. These offline stores also serve as service centers. At Cashify, we are also investing in technology to further streamline our operations and enhance the customer experience.As for numbers, our stores are spread across the top 90 cities in the country. We have stores in all major cities like Bangalore, Delhi, etc., as well as smaller cities like Agra, Meerut, and other tier two and tier three cities.Yes, one can. But, we accept devices up to a certain age. For older devices, we offer a recycling program. This means that we will take your old, but we may not be able to give you a value for it. We have a service where we will pick it up from your doorstep, send it to an authorized e-waste recycler, and send you a certificate of destruction via email.Right now, we only do it for phones. We will be launching laptop recycling soon.Our core mission is to extend the life of devices, reducing the need for new production and minimizing e-waste. By refurbishing and reselling, we aim to contribute to a more sustainable future. We are also exploring initiatives like recycling programs and partnerships with brands to promote e-waste awareness. Cashify is committed to making a positive impact on the environment and providing affordable, high-quality devices to its customers. By choosing refurbished, you're not just saving money but also contributing to a greener future. We work with all OEMs in the country. Whichever OEM you name, we are there at the backend.Interestingly, it's benefited us. People are opting for refurbished devices as a more affordable alternative. We have seen a surge in demand for our refurbished products.We have our own state-of-the-art facility in Noida where we refurbish devices. Our expert technicians meticulously inspect and repair each device. We wanted to have one concentrated facility because refurbishing operations cannot be run in a very decentralized manner. Managing spare parts is a huge challenge. Noida has all those phone manufacturers, trained manpower, and spare parts easily available. Cashify also offers warranties on our refurbished products, it ranges from six to twelve months, depending on the model.We work closely with major retailers to provide buyback and refurbished device solutions. This includes partnerships with OEMs and retailers like Croma, Vijay Sales, Reliance Digital, and Apple authorized resellers.I wouldn't say it's the biggest season, but it's definitely a good one. We see a significant spike in the number of old phones coming to us. During that one month, the inflow of devices increases by at least 3-4 times.Yes, I recommend that people sell their devices as soon as they buy a new one. People often think they'll use their old device as a spare or hand it down, but that doesn't usually happen. They end up putting it in a drawer. Ideally, you should sell it immediately when you upgrade so you can get the best value. If you keep it in a drawer, it will eventually become e-waste and you won't get anything for it. These are valuable resources that are lying unused in people's homes. By selling them, you can extend their life and make them available to others. We've seen that this brings happiness to a lot of people. People are happy to buy an old iPhone 11 or iPhone 12 at a lower price. I've seen people from various demographics who are thrilled to get a phone like that for 25,000 rupees, which they couldn't afford new.","Mandeep Manocha is co-founder and CEO of Cashify, a leading online marketplace for refurbished electronics.

The 2024 Nvidia AI Summit in Mumbai saw Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar rubbing shoulders with Jensen Huang , CEO of AI giant Nvidia. While the summit focused on strengthening India's AI capabilities, their encounter ended with a surprising discussion – martial arts.Kumar, a known martial arts enthusiast, shared a photo on social media X, formerly known as Twitter, where he and Huang pose playfully in a fighting stance.

""Very few countries have this amazing natural resource called IT and computer science expertise,"" he said.The event, where the U.S. company unveiled plans to supply Reliance Industries and other Indian firms with its AI chips, had to be reportedly delayed for more than half an hour due to the crowd that one Nvidia employee said was ""easily a few thousand"".Nvidia CEO Huang and Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced a strategic partnership to build state-of-the-art AI infrastructure in India at the summit.

Ambani emphasised that India's aspirations, combined with the visionary leadership of the Indian Prime Minister, have set the stage for a digital revolution.

Google launching products for competing platforms



Google's Quick Share file-transfer service may soon be available for iPhone and Mac users. A recent code change that was discovered in the project's source code repository suggests that this feature will allow users to easily share files between Android and Apple devices. Quick Share, introduced in 2020, utilizes a local network connection to quickly transfer files between devices and works only between Android and Windows devices. It comes pre-installed on most Android phones and Chromebooks and can be easily installed on Windows PCs. However, iOS and macOS users have been unable to utilise this convenient feature. The recent code changes suggest that Google is actively working to expand Quick Share's compatibility to include Apple's operating systems.According to a report by Android Authority’s Mishaal Rahman, a recent bug fix in Google's Nearby Connections code hints at the possibility of Quick Share coming to iOS and macOS. The fix addresses an issue with localised device names, specifically mentioning its benefit for Quick Share on Apple's platforms, even though there's no official Quick Share app for them yet.While this could indicate Google's plans to bring Quick Share to iOS and macOS, it's also possible that they are simply fixing bugs proactively or laying the groundwork for future development. The exact intentions remain unclear as Quick Share's source code is not publicly available.While Google hasn’t officially confirmed plans for Quick Share on iOS and macOS, it wouldn't be a surprise as the company has already released the feature for Windows. However, achieving widespread adoption on Apple platforms presents a challenge.Distributing Quick Share as a standalone app may also face hurdles in convincing iPhone users to download it while integrating it into existing Google apps could be difficult due to permission limitations on iOS. Despite these challenges, expanding Quick Share to Apple devices could promote cross-platform compatibility and benefit users across ecosystems.","Google's Quick Share file-transfer service may soon be available for iPhone and Mac users. A recent code change that was discovered in the project's source code repository suggests that this feature will allow users to easily share files between Android and Apple devices. Quick Share, introduced in 2020, utilizes a local network connection to quickly transfer files between devices.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114952147,imgsize-11968,width-400,resizemode-4/114952147.jpg"

Despite the massive selloff that has seen Berkshire 's Apple holdings plummet to $69.9 billion from $174.3 billion at the end of last year—a steep 60% decline—the tech giant remains the conglomerate's largest investment, aligning with Buffett 's statement at May's annual meeting where he cited tax considerations as a key driver behind the sales. Warren Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway continued dramatic reduction of its Apple stake in the third quarter, selling roughly a quarter of its remaining shares while building its cash reserves to a record $320.3 billion. The latest quarter saw Berkshire's Apple position drop further from $84.2 billion, even as Apple's stock climbed over 10% during the period. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of reduction in Apple holdings.The extensive selloff represents a significant shift for the Oracle of Omaha , who once ranked Apple as Berkshire's second-most important business after its insurance operations. The 93-year-old investor had previously praised Apple's loyal customer base and the iPhone 's indispensable nature, comparing consumers' attachment to their smartphones to their cars.Earlier this year, Buffett surprised investors by cutting Berkshire's Apple stake by nearly half in the second quarter. The move has drastically reduced Apple's weight in Berkshire's portfolio from nearly 50% at the end of 2023 to about 30% currently. The proceeds have contributed to Berkshire's record cash pile of $320.3 billion, with most funds invested in Treasury bills.Some investors have found significance in Berkshire now holding exactly 400 million shares of Apple—the same amount it owns of Coca-Cola , one of Buffett's longest-held investments. This identical share count has sparked speculation that Buffett may have reached his desired long-term position in Apple, though the company has not confirmed this theory.Berkshire reported third-quarter operating earnings of $10.1 billion, down from $10.7 billion a year ago. The majority of its cash reserves—$288 billion—is invested in short-term Treasury bills.","Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway continued dramatic reduction of its Apple stake in the third quarter.

The company's market share, however, declined to 31.7% from 37.7% in the same quarter last year, despite positive sales during the back-to-school season for its new iPad Air model.Samsung secured the second position with 7.1 million units shipped and 18.3% year-over-year growth, driven primarily by its low-end Galaxy A9 models and commercial deployments. Amazon made a notable comeback to the top three, recording the highest growth among major vendors at 111.3%, shipping 4.6 million units during its Prime Day promotional events.Huawei and Lenovo rounded out the top five, shipping 3.3 million and 3.0 million units respectively. Huawei saw 44.1% growth, while Lenovo's shipments increased by 14.7%, with significant improvements in commercial market performance.Industry analysts attribute the market's recovery to several factors, including device refreshes and preparation for holiday season sales.

“The university is silent to state that use of AI would amount to ‘plagiarism’ and thus, the petitioner cannot be prosecuted for what is not explicitly prohibited.”

“Section 2(d)(vi) of the

Copyright Act

, 1957, makes it amply clear that, arguendo, if the Petitioner did even use AI, the copyright of the artistic work would lie with the petitioner, and thus the allegation of violation of copyright, fails,”

A law student has reportedly filed a lawsuit against OP Jindal Global University . The law school accused the student of using artificial intelligence (AI) to answer exam questions and subsequently failed him in the course. Kaustubh Shakkarwar , pursuing a Masters of Law (LLM) degree, denies the allegations and claims he answered the questions independently.According to a report by Bar and Bench, Shakkarwar appeared for the ""Law and Justice in the Globalising World"" exam on May 18. On June 25, the university's Unfair Means Committee informed him that his answers were ""88% AI-generated,"" leading to his failure in the subject.The lawsuit challenges the university's decision and its method of determining AI-generated content. Justice Jasgurpeet Singh Puri of the Punjab and Haryana High Court has also listed the matter for further hearing on November 14.As per the report, Shakkarwar also has a background in law and AI. He previously worked as a law researcher with the Chief Justice of India and currently runs his own AI platform related to litigation, in addition to practising Intellectual Property law.Shakkarwar argued in court that the university lacks a clear policy prohibiting the use of AI-generated content in examinations, challenging the basis of his failing grade.Shakkarwar moved the plea through advocate Prabhneer Swani who said:He further defended his exam answers, asserting that they were his original work and not AI-generated. He argued that the university provided no evidence to support their claim of AI assistance.Moreover, he challenged that AI is merely a tool, and copyright cannot be attributed to AI-generated content. He emphasised that plagiarism requires a violation of copyright, which cannot be established in this case.Shakkarwar added.","Kaustubh Shakkarwar is pursuing a Masters of Law (LLM) degree at OP Jindal Global University.

A Pakistan-affiliated hacking group, known as Transparent Tribe or APT36, is targeting Indian entities with an increasingly sophisticated malware called ElizaRAT, as reported by Checkpoint Research . The malware, first disclosed in September 2023, has evolved to include enhanced evasion techniques and advanced command and control capabilities.According to the report, the threat actor conducted three distinct campaigns between late 2023 and early 2024, each employing different variants of ElizaRAT to gather information from targeted systems. All variants specifically checked for India Standard Time zone settings, indicating a clear focus on Indian targets.In the first campaign, the attackers utilised Slack channels for command and control communication and introduced a new payload called ApoloStealer , designed to collect and exfiltrate desktop files. The second campaign, dubbed "" Circle ,"" launched in January 2024 with improved detection evasion capabilities and relied on virtual private servers for communication instead of cloud services.The third campaign leveraged Google Drive for command and control operations while deploying specialised information-stealing payloads. The malware typically spreads through executable files shared via Google Storage links, likely distributed through phishing attacks.Transparent Tribe, which has previously targeted Indian government organisations, diplomatic personnel, and military facilities, demonstrates increasing sophistication in its cyber espionage efforts. The group has adapted its tactics to use popular cloud services like Google, Telegram , and Slack to disguise its malicious activities within normal network traffic.","Pakistan-affiliated hacking group, known as Transparent Tribe or APT36, is targeting Indian entities with an increasingly sophisticated malware called ElizaRAT.

The advent of the internet has transformed our lives, providing unprecedented convenience and connectivity. With this shift, digital payments have become integral to daily transactions in India, contributing to the country’s rapid technological evolution. However, this digital boom has also paved the way for sophisticated online scams that prey on unsuspecting users. From classic phishing schemes to more complex scams like SIM swapping and digital arrest fraud, these deceptive practices can have devastating financial and personal impacts. Here you can explore some of the most prevalent online scams in India, explains how they work, and provides actionable steps to protect yourself from falling victim.The UPI (Unified Payments Interface) refund scam is a widespread and deceptive scheme where fraudsters trick individuals into returning money that was never legitimately transferred to them. The scam begins when a perpetrator sends a payment to the victim’s UPI account and subsequently claims that it was sent by mistake, often citing urgent reasons like medical emergencies or essential expenses. If the victim agrees to refund the amount, the scammer reverses the initial transaction, leaving the victim out of pocket.Phishing scams involve fraudsters posing as reputable organisations to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information. These scams usually come in the form of emails, SMS, or fake websites that appear almost identical to legitimate ones. The messages often carry an urgent tone, warning recipients that their account may be suspended or announcing a fake reward. Once victims click on the provided link, they are directed to a fraudulent site where they are asked to enter personal details like login credentials and payment information.In a SIM swap scam, fraudsters gain control of a victim’s phone number by convincing mobile service providers to activate the scammer’s SIM card. This allows the scammer to intercept calls and SMS messages, including OTPs (one-time passwords), giving them access to bank accounts and other linked services. Often, this scam is facilitated through collusion with insiders at telecom companies or by using forged documents.These scams involve fraudulent websites or sellers that lure customers with deals that seem too good to be true. Victims may provide their payment information only to receive counterfeit products, inferior items, or nothing at all. Scammers often create websites that mimic well-known retailers or advertise heavily on social media to attract potential victims.This scam involves fraudsters impersonating law enforcement officials and falsely accusing victims of being involved in illegal activities. The fraudsters use threats of legal action or ""digital arrest"" to create panic, coercing victims into making payments or revealing personal information. Payments are typically requested through digital means like UPI to avoid detection.With the push for KYC compliance by banks and financial institutions, scammers are exploiting the process. They pose as representatives from banks or telecom providers and claim that the victim’s account will be suspended if KYC information is not updated immediately. Victims are directed to provide personal information through a fraudulent link or phone call, sometimes resulting in unauthorised access to their bank accounts.","The advent of the internet has transformed our lives, providing unprecedented convenience and connectivity.

Last year, Spotify Wrapped was released on November 29.Along with Spotify, other music streaming platforms such as YouTube Music and Apple Music also release their yearly summaries. YouTube Music's yearly summary is called Recap and it includes a personalised playlist and stats that summarises users’ top artists, songs and more from the past year.Meanwhile, Apple Music’s annual summary is called Replay that provides a yearly summary of a user's listening habits, including their top songs, artists, albums and genres.

We are committed to upholding industry food safety standards and are focused on not compromising on product quality at any stage of the supply chain.

I am not sure why just these small number of mushroom packets worth Rs 7,200 (out of the crores of inventory in the warehouse), which were never going to make it to customers, are being talked about the media, while we got an A+ rating. Maybe some people benefit from the virality which they get at the expense of pulling down the Zomato brand.

What worked well between Jobs and Cook

Tim Cook , the current CEO of Apple , has often credited Steve Jobs for shaping his leadership style. In a recent interview, Cook discussed the profound impact Jobs had on him, revealing how working with the visionary co-founder changed his perspective and provided invaluable lessons.When asked in an interview with the Wall Street Journal about the lessons he learned about management from Steve Jobs, Cook said that he taught him the value of innovation and that change in views is needed to succeed.“He taught me the value of innovation, the fact that small teams could do amazing things. I looked at the size of the iPod team initially, I looked at the size of the iPhone team,” Cook noted in his “first job interview in a while.”“These were very small teams in the scheme of things. Hiring the best people to surround you that challenge you, that have skills that you don't, and being confident with that.”Cook also praised Jobs’ ability to be open-minded and adaptable, saying that he admires Jobs’ capacity to change their opinions quickly when presented with new information, a quality that many people lack.“And also not to be married to my past views, you know, not to be so proud you can't change your mind when you're presented with new evidence and things. He could change like this (snaps finger). I initially was sort of taken aback by that, and then I became so enamoured with it,” Cook noted.“Very few people have that skill because they get married to their past views, and I thought it was a brilliant skill,” Cook added.Tim Cook also said that both of them changed each others’ minds. “Oh, he changed my mind about a lot of things and he changed his mind about a lot of things,” Cook noted.“He loved to debate, and he loved someone to debate him, and you could always change his mind if you had the best idea. We changed each other's minds. That's the reason it worked so well,” he added.","Tim Cook, the current CEO of Apple, has often credited Steve Jobs for shaping his leadership style.

Mental Health in the Digital Workplace,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mental-health-in-the-digital-workplace/articleshow/114933230.cms,"As technology takes a front seat in shaping modern work environments, it’s not without consequences on employee mental health. A report by Indian HR tech provider Keka sheds light on an unsettling reality: nearly 60% of employees feel unsafe sharing mental health concerns at work. This finding, part of Keka's “The New Age of Work - Trends, Technology & Talent” report, underscores a critical issue for tech-driven industries worldwide, as mental health often remains overshadowed by a focus on productivity and digital transformation.In a world where AI and automation are rapidly redefining HR roles, 41% of recruitment tasks are expected to be automated by 2030. While AI’s role is largely seen as enhancing HR capabilities rather than replacing human oversight, there’s a significant push toward integrating AI insights with personalized mentorship to support employee retention. Yet, despite advancements in HR technology , only 15% of employees feel comfortable discussing their mental health in the workplace, indicating a substantial gap in employee support .The report, based on insights from 8,725 HR professionals and C-suite executives across India, the US, Germany, the UK, and the UAE, emphasizes emotional intelligence as a key skill for the future. About 29% of HR practitioners identified emotional intelligence and empathy as essential for HR professionals by 2030. This emphasis on a ""human touch"" is a response to the growing reliance on data and AI in the workplace, where 32% of business leaders prioritize data-driven strategies but find it challenging to align these metrics with broader business goals.Vijay Yalamanchili, CEO of Keka, highlighted this intersection of technology and empathy, stating that the “future of HR lies at the intersection of technology and human touch.” As HR leaders evolve, balancing technological proficiency with empathy will be essential in creating safe, supportive work environments for employees.In addition, fostering inclusivity across diverse, multigenerational workforces is increasingly seen as critical to employee performance. Bridging generational gaps and promoting an inclusive culture can have a profound impact on overall well-being, according to 37% of respondents. Keka's report outlines a roadmap for HR leaders, advocating for the responsible use of AI and the adoption of upskilling initiatives that prioritize both employee engagement and mental well-being.","Nearly 60% of employees feel unsafe sharing mental health concerns at work.

Zara & H&M are facing tough time because Shein and Temu are said to undercut prices and turnaround time of these fast fashion retailers in Europe, where ultra-fast fashion has become the new thing.

Why is Temu under investigation in Europe

Chinese online shopping giants Shein and Temu have changed the face fashion ecommerce in the Europe and US. In the United States (US), Shein and Temu have been giving tough time to Amazon; in Europe it is Zara and H&M. The low prices and high assortment offered by Temu and Shein make established retailers in Europe -- like Zara and H&M -- pale in comparison.Now it seems, Temu may be under scanner in Europe. Chinese online retailer Temu is reportedly facing a European Union investigation over suspicions it’s failing to prevent the sale of illegal products. According to a report by news agency AP, the 27-nation bloc's executive arm -- the European Commission -- has opened its investigation against Temu. This comes five months after Temu was added to the list of “very large online platforms” needing the strictest level of scrutiny under the bloc's Digital Services Act .The European Commission is said to be investigating the platform for potential violations of the Digital Services Act (DSA), specifically regarding consumer protection, fair competition, and data privacy.The EU's concerns center around the sale of non-compliant goods, addictive design features, and transparency of recommendation algorithms. Regulators are particularly worried about the ease with which ""rogue traders"" can resurface on the platform after being suspended.Temu, owned by Chinese e-commerce giant Pinduoduo , has responded by affirming its commitment to complying with EU regulations and protecting consumer interests. However, the company now faces the possibility of significant fines if the investigation uncovers serious violations.This scrutiny comes amid a broader European effort to regulate tech giants and ensure a fair digital marketplace. Other platforms like AliExpress , X, and TikTok have also faced similar investigations, highlighting the EU's determination to enforce stricter rules on online businesses.","Chinese online retailer Temu is reportedly facing a European Union investigation over suspicions it’s failing to prevent the sale of illegal products.

What Apple and Amazon said



A UK tribunal has ruled in favour of Apple and Amazon. The court has dismissed a mass lawsuit that accused the companies of colluding to remove resellers of new Apple products from Amazon's website in the UK. The lawsuit, brought by consumer law academic Christine Riefa on behalf of nearly 36 million British consumers, alleged that the agreement between Apple and Amazon limited competition and inflated prices for consumers. However, the tribunal concluded that the agreement did not breach competition law, clearing both companies of the charges.According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Riefa's legal team claimed that Apple and Amazon struck a deal in 2018 to exclude the majority of resellers offering Apple and Beats-branded products from Amazon's UK marketplace, thereby limiting competition for those items.Apple and Amazon argued that the case, valued at £494 million ($602 million) plus interest, lacked merit and urged the Competition Appeal Tribunal to dismiss it.The tribunal determined that the case could not proceed because Riefa failed to demonstrate ""sufficient independence or robustness"" to represent the claimant class, particularly concerning third-party litigation funding.The Competition Appeal Tribunal's decision to deny certification, an initial step in such litigation, is uncommon given the relatively low threshold for certification.In a separate US lawsuit, Apple and Amazon sought dismissal but were denied in June 2023. The case highlighted that following Apple's 2018 agreement with Amazon, the number of Apple resellers on the platform plummeted by 98%, from nearly 600 to just 7.Apple also has the right to screen Authorized Apple Resellers to ensure the maintenance of high service standards.",A UK tribunal has ruled in favour of Apple and Amazon.

The iconic animated series The Simpsons has long fascinated fans for its uncanny ability to seemingly predict real-world events. From smartwatches to global political developments, the show’s creators have unintentionally earned a reputation as time-traveling prophets. Adding to this legacy is a bizarre new claim that has taken social media by storm. A viral video suggests that The Simpsons foretold a global internet outage on January 16, 2025. While many dismiss it as lighthearted entertainment, the rumor has sparked curiosity and humour online.The viral video, which claims to be from an episode of The Simpsons, suggests a complete internet shutdown coinciding with Donald Trump’s inauguration as U.S. President. The video humorously attributes this global outage to a white shark chewing through an underwater cable, blending absurdity with speculation. Adding to the inaccuracies is the claim that this event aligns with Trump’s inauguration, which is officially scheduled for January 20, 2025, rather than January 16. Despite these glaring errors, the video has captivated viewers, sparking debates, memes, and jokes across platforms.The online reaction to the supposed prediction has been overwhelmingly humourous. Social media users have shared their comedic takes, with one user joking about running out of mobile data and another commenting, “If this happens, I’ll finally get a break from work-from-home!” While the majority see the claim for what it is—a fabricated tale meant for laughs—it has undeniably entertained millions. The video has also reignited discussions about how The Simpsons continues to influence pop culture through its seemingly prescient content.While the shark-chewing-cable scenario in the video adds to the absurdity of the claim, it does touch upon a real-world issue: marine life occasionally interfering with underwater internet cables. Instances of sharks and other sea creatures damaging these cables have been documented, prompting tech companies to reinforce their infrastructure. For example, Google has taken measures to wrap its undersea cables with materials similar to Kevlar, reducing the likelihood of damage caused by marine animals. However, such incidents are highly localized and unlikely to trigger a global outage.","A viral video suggests that The Simpsons foretold a global internet outage on January 16, 2025.

Google faces first probe under UK’s new competition rules: Read company's response,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-faces-first-probe-under-uks-new-competition-rules-read-companys-response/articleshow/117272858.cms,"Poll How Important Is It for Governments to Regulate Big Tech Companies? Not Very Important, Let the Market Decide Very Important, to Ensure Fair Market Practices

What Google has to say

Today, the CMA has announced that it will assess whether Google Search has “Strategic Market Status” (SMS) under the new Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers regime, and what new requirements Google Search may have to follow. We look forward to engaging constructively and laying out how our services benefit UK consumers and also businesses, as well as the trade-offs inherent in any new regulations.

People across the UK trust Google Search to help them find what they need. Search also helps millions of British businesses to grow and reach customers in innovative ways. Google’s products, including Search, helped to provide an estimated £118 billion in economic activity in 2023 in the UK, supporting over a million businesses across the country. Google Search and Ads are also helping UK businesses to export over £20 billion worth of goods and services across the world.

Digital services like Search will power new economic development in the UK. Indeed, the CMA itself recognises that “Search is vital for economic growth”. We welcome the recognition of the importance of digital technologies to power growth, and the need to align regulatory decisions with the Government’s growth mission.

A pro-innovation, evidence-based regime will help UK consumers and businesses by expanding options, reducing prices, and opening new markets. The alternative of overly prescriptive digital competition rules would end up stifling choice and opportunity for consumers and businesses.

We will do our best to advocate for new rules that benefit every business and let people in the UK benefit from helpful, cutting-edge services.

The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched an investigation into Google 's search services, marking the first major probe conducted under the country's newly implemented Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act (DMCC).Under the act, designed to curb anti-competitive behavior in digital markets, the CMA will assess whether Google holds “strategic market status” (SMS) under the DMCC. This designation will grant the regulator the authority to impose significant changes on Google's operations to prevent anti-competitive practices.Sarah Cardell, the CMA’s chief executive, emphasised the importance of ensuring a “level playing field” in the search market, particularly as artificial intelligence is revolutionising online search behaviour.“It’s our job to ensure people get the full benefit of choice and innovation in search services and get a fair deal — for example in how their data is collected and stored,” Cardell said.“And for businesses, whether you are a rival search engine, an advertiser or a news organisation, we want to ensure there is a level playing field for all businesses, large and small, to succeed,” she added.Google said it will do its best to advocate the new rules.

Why should you install Windows 11

Microsoft has announced that it will stop support for Microsoft 365 apps on Windows 10 later this year, effectively aligning the end of support for the operating system on October 14. This move is part of Microsoft’s push to encourage users to upgrade to Windows 11.“Microsoft 365 Apps will no longer be supported after October 14, 2025, on Windows 10 devices. To use Microsoft 365 Applications on your device, you will need to upgrade to Windows 11,” the company stated in a blog post.While Office applications will continue to function after October 14, Microsoft warns of potential performance and reliability issues over time.At CES last week, Microsoft declared 2025 ""the year of the Windows 11 PC refresh,"" emphasizing the importance of upgrading existing Windows 10 PCs over other consumer electronics purchases.“We believe that one of the most important pieces of technology people will look to refresh in 2025 isn’t the refrigerator, the television or their mobile phone.

Champagne’s husband, Jesse Sciuto , who is an US Navy personnal also responds to the post adding to the playful banter. Meanwhile, some users compared the post to the end-of-year performance reviews.In the LinkedIn post , Champagne wrote: “I had multiple clear-cut career accomplishments in 2024. My husband? Zero.No certifications.No college courses completed.No documentary features.No awards.“How do you *do* that?!” I asked from across the dining table, “how are you able to go through a whole year without doing any of these sort of things and be OK?”He didn’t have a response.There is so much to unpack and learn from an exchange like this.Specifically—what’s standing in the way of MY ability to be content without conventional markers of accomplishment?My gut says that this is a question that many people, namely high-performing women, grapple with too.I don’t have an answer, but I’m curious what your thoughts are:Could you go a year without a single new certification, interview, award, promotion and be OK with yourself for it?Would you think of a colleague, direct report, manager, friend, or spouse differently for not doing so?”Replying to his wife’s post, Sciuto wrote: “I'm Stacey's husband... hi. First off: the point of Stacey's post is that she approves of my lack of quals/certs and wishes she could reach my level of zen.One of the best parts of the Navy is that they have told me exactly what they value and what they want me to achieve, so I already did all of that. I'm dual warfare qualified, have a STEM Master's, and I've completed all qualifications and requirements for my current rank and the next rank. Civilians don't have that luxury. Stacey has to constantly compete and guess what could help her or give her the edge. That sounds like a nightmare to me. I want to see a manual and a checklist.I had 10 pretty rough years and then spent two years at grad school. In January last year I, a communications officer in the Navy, started a job trying roll out a CRM tool to a massive organization. That same month I learned what CRM stood for.I spent the last year learning my vastly new job, getting back into shape, and enjoying my hobbies. I do all of our grocery shopping and cook all of our meals (because I love to cook) which has freed up time for Stacey so she could continue to be the amazing badass she is.

On Monday (January 13), both the website and app became non-functional, displaying error messages like “error: Something went wrong” to users. This development adds to the challenges faced by the company as it continues to grapple with its struggle for survival.Kabeer Biswas moving to lead Flipkart's quick commerce segment, Minutes, has been seen as a major shift in the industry. Despite raising over $450 million in funding, including a significant $200 million injection from Reliance Retail in early 2022, Dunzo has faced mounting financial difficulties1. The company's operational footprint has drastically reduced over the past two years, with widespread layoffs and salary delays.Once a pioneering player in India's quick commerce space, Dunzo had been facing stiff competition from well-funded rivals like Zepto, Blinkit, and Instamart. The company's efforts to secure additional equity funding fell through, leading to significant downsizing and the eventual shutdown of its digital platforms.Both Reliance Retail and Google, key stakeholders in Dunzo, had previously explored acquiring the struggling startup during its funding crisis. However, those deals faltered due to investor resistance to relinquishing the brand1. Additionally, the company's creditors have taken legal action, approaching the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) over unpaid dues.The departure of Kabeer Biswas, the last remaining co-founder, underscores the turmoil within the company. Former executives, including co-founders Mukund Jha and Dalvir Suri, had already exited the company, leaving behind a depleted workforce.As the quick commerce industry continues to evolve, Dunzo's decline serves as a cautionary tale for startups navigating the competitive landscape. Flipkart’s acquisition of Kabeer Biswas highlights the shifting dynamics and fierce competition within the sector.","Reliance-backed hyperlocal delivery platform Dunzo went offline shortly after its last remaining co-founder and CEO, Kabeer Biswas, left the company to join Flipkart.

Sam Altman’s sister accuses him of sexual abuse; family responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chatgpt-maker-openai-ceo-sam-altmans-sister-accuses-him-of-sexual-abuse-family-responds/articleshow/117038723.cms,"Poll How Can Society Better Prevent Sexual Abuse? Stronger Legal Actions and Support More Education and Awareness

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's statement

Our family loves Annie and is very concerned about her well-being. Caring for a family member who faces mental health challenges is incredibly difficult. We know many families facing similar struggles understand this well.

Over the years, we've tried in many ways to support Annie and help her find stability, following professional advice on how to be supportive without enabling harmful behaviors. To give a sense of our efforts, we have given her monthly financial support, directly paid her bills, covered her rent, helped her find employment opportunities, attempted to get her medical help, and have offered to buy her a house through a trust (so that she would have a secure place to live, but not be able to sell it immediately). Via our late father's estate, Annie receives monthly financial support, which we expect to continue for the rest of her life.

Despite this, Annie continues to demand more money from us. In this vein, Annie has made deeply hurtful and entirely untrue claims about our family, and especially Sam. We've chosen not to respond publicly, out of respect for her privacy and our own. However, she has now taken legal action against Sam, and we feel we have no choice but to address this.

Over the years, she has accused members of our family of improperly withholding our father's 401k funds, hacking her wife, and ""shadowbanning"" her from various websites including ChatGPT, Twitter, and more. The worst allegation she has made is that she was sexually abused by Sam as a child (she has also claimed instances of sexual abuse from others). Her claims have evolved drastically over time. Newly for this lawsuit, they now include allegations of incidents where Sam was over 18.

All of these claims are utterly untrue. This situation causes immense pain to our entire family. It is especially gut-wrenching when she refuses conventional treatment and lashes out at family members who are genuinely trying to help.

We ask for understanding and compassion from everyone as we continue to support Annie in the best way we can. We sincerely hope she finds the stability and peace she's been searching for.

Meta ends DEI programs, shifting to merit-based hiring amid employee concerns

Alignment with political shifts

Meta , the parent company of Facebook , Instagram, and Threads, has recently undertaken a series of sweeping changes to its policies and operations. These adjustments, which include decisions affecting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, content moderation practices, and facilities management, have sparked widespread discussion. According to reports from Fox News Digital and The New York Times, these changes appear to reflect Meta’s evolving stance on workplace policies and platform governance, prompting a mix of support, criticism, and employee dissatisfaction.One of the most visible policy shifts was the removal of tampons from men’s restrooms across Meta’s offices in Silicon Valley, Texas, and New York. This decision, reported by The New York Times, impacts nonbinary and transgender employees who may require such amenities. The company has not provided detailed explanations for this change, leaving room for speculation and concern among affected staff and advocates.Meta has also revamped its approach to content moderation. In a move toward ""restoring free expression,"" the company ended its third-party fact-checking program in the United States. The program, which had been central to Meta’s efforts to combat misinformation, is being replaced by a ""community notes"" system similar to the model used by Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter). This crowdsourced moderation framework is intended to allow users to collaboratively add context to potentially misleading posts.Critics argue that the elimination of fact-checking may leave the platform vulnerable to the unchecked spread of misinformation. However, Meta contends that the previous system had ""gone too far"" and impeded open discourse.Meta has discontinued its primary DEI initiatives , a decision that Joel Kaplan, Meta’s Chief Global Affairs Officer, defended as a step toward merit-based hiring. Kaplan stated that recruitment would focus on individual qualifications rather than considerations of race or gender. While Meta frames this shift as a move to promote fairness and broaden candidate pools, internal communications reveal that LGBTQ staff members and other employees have expressed dissatisfaction, with some announcing their departure from the company.The broader implications of this policy change extend beyond recruitment. Critics worry that the absence of structured DEI programs could lead to reduced support for underrepresented groups within Meta’s workforce.Another notable change involves the removal of transgender and nonbinary customization options from the Messenger application. This move has fueled concerns about Meta's commitment to inclusivity. Internal reports indicate that LGBTQ+ employees feel alienated by these decisions, and many have raised questions about the company’s long-term priorities regarding diversity and inclusion.These policy changes come amid what many observers see as a broader alignment with the political climate in the United States, particularly with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. Critics suggest that Meta’s decisions may reflect a strategic effort to gain favor with the administration by adopting positions that align with its ideological leanings. This perception is further reinforced by the company’s public emphasis on restoring ""free expression"" and its distancing from progressive DEI initiatives.Internally, the response from Meta employees has been mixed. While some staff members view the changes as necessary to streamline operations and foster innovation, others feel disillusioned by what they see as a retreat from Meta’s prior commitments to inclusivity and progressive values.Externally, Meta’s actions have drawn significant criticism from advocacy groups, public figures, and industry analysts. Some argue that these changes undermine the progress made in fostering a more equitable workplace and responsible content moderation practices.","Facebook's parent company, Meta, has made a series of changes to its policies and operations.

iPhone SE 4 may have a new name

Apple may introduce the new iPhone SE and iPad 11 by April 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. A report previously suggested that these devices would launch alongside iOS 18 .3 and iPadOS 18.3, but Gurman clarified that while the products are being developed on the same software ""train,"" their release may not coincide with the updates. Instead, Gurman stated that Apple is targeting a release “before iOS 18.4,” offering a more specific timeframe for the highly anticipated devices.Taking to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Gurma wrote “Yes, the new iPads and iPhone SE replacement are being developed on the iOS 18.3 train - but that doesn’t mean they launch together this month”. Adding further, he said “It means they’ll launch before iOS 18.4, by April if all goes to plan.”According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, iPhone SE 4 may be rebranded as the iPhone 16E . The naming speculation originated from Chinese social media platform Weibo user Fixed Focus Digital and was later corroborated by leaker Majin Bu on X (formerly Twitter). While neither source has an established track record with Apple rumors, the potential rebranding would align the budget model more closely with Apple's flagship iPhone 16 lineup. The potential name change would mark a significant shift from Apple's previous ""SE"" branding for its budget iPhone line.The device is rumored to receive a major redesign, adopting the modern aesthetics of the iPhone 14 and moving away from the dated iPhone 8-style design of the current SE model. Key upgrades include a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID authentication, and a USB-C port, replacing the Touch ID button and Lightning connector found on the current model.Sources indicate the device will feature a single 48-megapixel rear camera, 8GB of RAM, and Apple's latest A-series chip to support new AI features. The company is also expected to implement its first in-house designed 5G modem in the device.","Apple may introduce the new iPhone SE and iPad 11 by April 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.

Why this '10-day delay' is significant in the case

“totally broken organisation…”, Elon Musk to SEC on complaint

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk , alleging that the billionaire committed securities fraud in 2022 by failing to disclose his growing stake in Twitter, a report has said. The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX acquired Twitter for $44 billion in late 2022, subsequently renaming it X.The SEC contends that Musk intentionally delayed disclosing his ownership stake, allowing him to acquire shares at “artificially low prices” before the market reacted to his involvement, reports CNBC.The civil complaint – filed in US District Court in Washington, D.C. – adds that prior to the acquisition, Musk amassed a significant stake in the company, which exceeded the 5% threshold that requires mandatory public disclosure within 10 days. Musk delayed this disclosure, enabling him to purchase shares at a lower price point.This delayed disclosure allowed “him to underpay by at least $150 million for shares he purchased after his financial beneficial ownership report was due.”“On April 4, 2022, eleven days after a report was due, Musk finally publicly disclosed his beneficial ownership in a report with the SEC, disclosing that he had acquired over nine percent of Twitter’s outstanding stock. That day, Twitter’s stock price increased more than 27% over its previous day’s closing price,” the complaint says.Explaining the fraud, the SEC argues that investors would likely have bid up Twitter’s stock price had they been aware of Musk's growing interest in the company.Last month, Musk revealed that the SEC had issued a ""settlement demand,"" pressuring him to agree to a deal, including a fine, within 48 hours to avoid facing multiple charges. Meanwhile, Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro, denied the allegations, labeling the lawsuit a “sham” and a result of the SEC's “multi-year campaign of harassment.”In a post on X following the lawsuit's filing, Musk denounced the SEC as a “totally broken organisation”.“Totally broken organization. They spend their time on shit like this when there are so many actual crimes that go unpunished,” he said.","The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk, alleging that the billionaire committed securities fraud in 2022.

What the joint statement said



“The United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea join together to provide a new warning to the blockchain technology industry regarding the ongoing targeting and compromise of a range of entities across the globe by Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) cyber actors. The DPRK’s cyber program threatens our three countries and the broader international community and, in particular, poses a significant threat to the integrity and stability of the international financial system. Our three governments strive together to prevent thefts, including from private industry, by the DPRK and to recover stolen funds with the ultimate goal of denying the DPRK illicit revenue for its unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. The advanced persistent threat groups affiliated with the DPRK, including the Lazarus Group, which was designated by the relevant authorities of our three countries, continue to demonstrate a pattern of malicious behaviour in cyberspace by conducting numerous cybercrime campaigns to steal cryptocurrency and targeting exchanges, digital asset custodians, and individual users. In 2024 alone, our governments have individually and jointly attributed multiple thefts, denominated in virtual asset value in U.S. dollars, to the DPRK: DMM Bitcoin for $308 million, Upbit for $50 million, and Rain Management for $16.13 million. The United States and the Republic of Korea additionally attribute to the DPRK, based on detailed industry analysis, thefts last year against WazirX for $235 million and Radiant Capital for $50 million. As recently as September 2024, the United States government observed aggressive targeting of the cryptocurrency industry by the DPRK with well-disguised social engineering attacks that ultimately deploy malware, such as TraderTraitor, AppleJeus and others. The Republic of Korea and Japan have observed similar trends and tactics used by the DPRK. Additionally, agencies from our governments have published multiple notifications on the DPRK information technology (IT) workers that also present an insider threat to private sector partners: the United States on May 16, 2022, and May 16, 2024, the United States and the Republic of Korea on October 18, 2023, the Republic of Korea on December 8, 2022, and Japan on March 26, 2024. The United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea advise private sector entities, particularly in blockchain and freelance work industries, to thoroughly review these advisories and announcements to better inform cyber threat mitigation measures and mitigate the risk of inadvertently hiring DPRK IT workers. Deeper collaboration among the public and private sectors of the three countries is essential to proactively disrupt these malicious actors’ cybercrime operations, protect private business interests, and secure the international financial system. Cooperative public-private efforts in the United States through the Illicit Virtual Asset Notification (IVAN) information-sharing partnership, the Cryptoasset and Blockchain Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Crypto-ISAC), and the Security Alliance (SEAL) are examples of newly established mechanisms to facilitate information-sharing and incident response. The Republic of Korea and the United States also co-host a series of public-private symposiums to strengthen coordination between the government and private sector in disrupting the DPRK’s illicit revenue generation, including on November 17, 2022, May 24, 2023, and August 27, 2024. In Japan, the Financial Services Agency, in collaboration with the Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association (JVCEA), warned relevant businesses about the risk of crypto-asset thefts and requested self-inspections on September 26 and December 24, 2024. The United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea will continue to work together to counter the DPRK’s malicious cyber activities and illicit revenue generation, including by imposing sanctions on DPRK cyber actors and collaborating to improve cybersecurity capacity across the Indo-Pacific region. The United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea reaffirm their commitment to combatting cyber threats posed by the DPRK and enhancing their coordination through the trilateral working groups.”

Japan , South Korea and the US have issued a joint statement blaming North Korea and its Lazarus Group for the $235 million hack of India's largest crypto exchange, WazirX. This cyberattack, which occurred in July 2024, resulted in WazirX losing nearly 45% of its crypto assets and halting its operations. The three countries pledged to continue collaborating to counter North Korea's cyberattacks and illegal revenue generation through sanctions and improved cybersecurity measures in the Indo-Pacific region. This statement provides support for WazirX and highlights the growing international concern about North Korea's cyber activities. The statement was also shared by Nischal Shetty , founder and CEO of WazirX, on social media platform X (earlier Twitter).The statement shared by the US Department of State read:","Japan, South Korea and the US have issued a joint statement blaming North Korea and its Lazarus Group for the $235 million hack of India's largest crypto exchange, WazirX.

Zerodha warns how you may lose all your bank savings by giving phone to a stranger for that 'just one call',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zerodha-warns-how-you-may-lose-all-your-bank-savings-by-giving-phone-to-a-stranger-for-that-just-one-call/articleshow/117269793.cms,"

How giving phone to strangers can scam you

How to stay safe against Quick Call Trap scams

Never hand your phone to strangers

If you do, make the call yourself and put the call on speaker for them to talk

Check your phone’s setting regularly. Make sure any call forwarding is disabled

Never share OTPs with others

Zerodha recently shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) to raise awareness about a new type of scam that preys on people’s goodwill. The post explains how scammers approach unsuspecting individuals, requesting to borrow their phones under the pretense of an emergency call. It further states that the ‘simple act of kindness’ by lending your phone might seem harmless, but it can cause serious damage.“Have you ever handed over your phone to a stranger in need of “just one call”? This simple act of kindness could cost you your entire savings. From intercepting your OTPs to draining your bank accounts, scammers can cause serious damage without you even realizing it. In this video, we explain how these scammers operate, who they target, and most importantly, how you can protect yourself,” the post says.The post also has a video explaining how these scams work, identifying the common tactics scammers use, their target demographic, and the crucial steps people can take to protect themselves from falling victim. Called the ‘ Quick Call Trap ’, the scam begins when you hand over your smartphone to a stranger for a quick call. The stranger, who requested your smartphone on the pretext of emergency, then installs a suspicious app or accesses your payments apps like GPay, Paytm to get personal information. They can also change settings on your phone to forwards your calls and messages to their number.Initially, victims may not see any signs of tampering on their phone. But once these scammers have access to your calls and messages, they intercept OTPs, passwords or your personal information to make unauthorized transactions from your bank accounts. These fraudsters may also change passwords of your banking apps or social media accounts — all without the victim realizing it.The video further warns that typical targets of these scams are those who “are less comfortable with technology”.Some of the tips are:","Zerodha shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) to raise awareness about a new type of scam.

Pixxel to expand Firefly constellation



Google-backed Indian space tech startup Pixxel has successfully launched three of its six hyperspectral imaging satellites , marking a significant milestone for both the company and the country’s growing private space sector.The satellites – which are a part of the Firefly constellation – have been launched on a SpaceX rocket from California. The launch took place at 1915 GMT (just after midnight in India) from the Vandenberg Space Force Base.The satellites, called Fireflies, are currently the world’s highest-resolution commercial-grade hyperspectral satellites. They bring precision to monitor the planet and set “a new benchmark for hyperspectral imaging capabilities.”The satellites have a 5-metre resolution – attained for the first time in a hyperspectral spacecraft – making Fireflies six times sharper than the 30-metre standard of most existing hyperspectral satellites. This allows them to capture fine details that are said to be previously invisible to conventional systems, the company says.Pixxel, a five-year-old startup backed by Google , leverages hyperspectral imaging technology (relating to the measurement of light across a wide range of wavelengths for each pixel in an image) to capture highly detailed data across hundreds of light bands.This advanced technology has numerous applications across various sectors, including agriculture, mining, environmental monitoring and defense.By analyzing this data, industries can gain valuable insights, such as optimising crop yields in the agricultural sector, tracking resources effectively, and monitoring environmental concerns like oil spills with greater precision.“This launch marks the first phase of Pixxel’s commercial constellation, with three additional Firefly satellites scheduled to launch in Q2 2025,” the company said.“Together, these satellites will deliver comprehensive, real-time data collection and analysis, equipping industries and governments with insights to address global concerns, manage resources responsibly, and drive climate action,” it added.Pixxel plans to expand its constellation, adding 18 more satellites to the six already launched. The company has already secured approximately 65 clients, including major players like Rio Tinto, British Petroleum, and the Indian Ministry of Agriculture, with some clients already paying for data from its demonstration satellites, as per news agency Reuters.Apart from Google – which was a part of a $36 million round of funding in the Bengaluru-based spacetech startup in 2023, companies like Accenture and Canada’s Radical Ventures, have also invested in Pixxel.Google CEO Sundar Pichai said at the Google For India 2022 annual event that the company will invest $300 million in homegrown startups.","Google-backed Indian space tech startup Pixxel has successfully launched three of its six hyperspectral imaging satellites.

A handwritten letter by the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs has recently been auctioned for an astonishing $500,312.50 (INR 4.32 crore), drawing attention to a lesser-known spiritual side of the tech visionary. The letter, written on February 23, 1974—Jobs’ 19th birthday—offers a profound glimpse into his aspirations and beliefs, particularly his interest in Zen Buddhism and the spiritual significance of India. The auction coincided with the visit of Jobs’ widow, Laurene Powell Jobs , to the Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 in Prayagraj, India, fulfilling her late husband's long-held dream.In the letter addressed to his childhood friend Tim Brown, Jobs expressed his desire to attend the Kumbh Mela, a grand Hindu pilgrimage and festival celebrated by millions. He wrote, ""I wish to go to India for the Kumbh Mela, which starts in April. I will be leaving sometime in March, not really certain yet."" The letter, closing with ""Shanti, Steve Jobs,"" provides a touching testament to his deep connection with Hindu philosophy and spirituality. It also includes a poignant note about Jobs having ""cried many times,"" offering a rare glimpse into his emotional depth.Jobs’ spiritual journey brought him to India for seven months, a transformative period during which he sought solace at the ashram of Neem Karoli Baba in Uttarakhand. Although the revered saint had passed away a year before Jobs’ arrival, the teachings and atmosphere of the ashram at Kainchi Dham deeply influenced him. Immersing himself in Indian culture and spirituality, Jobs adopted local customs, which he reflected on upon returning to the United States. He described his transformed appearance: ""My head had been shaved, I was wearing Indian cotton robes, and my skin had turned a deep, chocolate brown-red from the sun.""The letter, auctioned by the international house Bonhams, was hailed as a piece of history, offering a personal and philosophical view of one of the world’s most influential entrepreneurs. It has been exactly 51 years since Jobs penned the letter, yet its insights remain timeless, showcasing his quest for meaning beyond material success.Steve Jobs’ untimely passing on October 5, 2011, due to complications from pancreatic cancer, meant he never fulfilled his dream of attending the Kumbh Mela. However, his widow, Laurene Powell Jobs, honored his wish by attending the Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 in Prayagraj. Guided by Swami Kailashanand Giri, who gave her the Hindu name ""Kamala,"" Laurene embraced the spiritual practices of the festival. Accompanied by a 40-member team, she participated in meditation, Kriya Yoga, and Pranayama, embodying the ethos that had drawn her late husband to India decades earlier.The Maha Kumbh Mela, held every 12 years, is a celebration of India’s profound spiritual heritage, drawing millions of devotees from around the globe. Laurene’s participation underscores the universal appeal of the event, bridging cultural and spiritual worlds.Steve Jobs’ brief yet impactful spiritual journey in India has long been credited with shaping his approach to life and work, influencing his quest for simplicity and focus, traits that defined Apple’s revolutionary products. The auctioned letter and Laurene Powell Jobs’ visit to the Maha Kumbh Mela serve as poignant reminders of the enduring impact of his spiritual explorations.As millions gather at the Maha Kumbh Mela, Jobs’ legacy continues to resonate—not just as a pioneer of technology, but as a seeker of deeper truths, driven by curiosity and an unyielding desire to connect with the essence of life.","A handwritten letter by the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs has recently been auctioned for an astonishing $500,312.50.

Successful tech billionaires are often admired not just for their business acumen but also for the disciplined routines they follow. Their morning habits, ranging from mindfulness practices to strategic decision-making, set the tone for their productivity and creativity. These rituals highlight the importance of aligning daily schedules with personal energy cycles, mental clarity, and physical health. Here's an in-depth look at how some of the biggest names in the tech industry begin their days, showcasing the unique approaches that have become integral to their success.As per reports, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk keeps his mornings simple, waking up around 7 a.m. He starts by checking his phone for business updates and occasionally indulging in a doughnut, though he often skips breakfast altogether. Musk values efficiency and splits his day into intervals to manage his time effectively. While his mornings are straightforward, they set the stage for the high-intensity demands of his day, allowing him to focus on critical tasks.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos prefers a relaxed start to his mornings. Without using an alarm clock, he begins the day by spending time with his family, sharing breakfast with his children and engaging in light activities such as reading the newspaper, as reported. Notably, Bezos avoids phones during these hours, emphasizing the importance of being fully present. Known for his culinary curiosity, his breakfast sometimes includes unconventional items like octopus with green garlic yogurt. Bezos has identified 10 a.m. as his peak cognitive time, reserving this period for critical decision-making and important meetings, thus optimizing his brain’s sharpest hours.Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg begins his day at 8 a.m. by checking Facebook, Messenger, and WhatsApp—platforms he created and continues to oversee. A fitness enthusiast, Zuckerberg has traded running for jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts, prioritizing physical activity to maintain energy and focus. He simplifies his wardrobe by wearing similar outfits daily, a strategy designed to conserve mental energy for important decisions. His approach reflects a balance of physical fitness and efficiency in daily life.Apple CEO Tim Cook is known for his early rising habit, waking up as early as 3:45 a.m. He spends the first hour of his day reading hundreds of emails from customers and employees, ensuring he remains connected to his company’s ecosystem. Cook then heads to the gym for an hour-long workout, emphasizing the importance of physical health. Remarkably, he avoids checking his phone during his exercise routine, staying fully present.Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, is a believer in maximizing morning productivity. Starting his day with a shot of espresso, Altman spends his most alert hours tackling tasks that require focus. He uses a full-spectrum LED light for enhanced alertness, especially during his email catch-up sessions. While he doesn’t wake up early, Altman is mindful of his energy levels and adjusts his activities accordingly, switching tasks or taking breaks when his attention wanes. Afternoons are reserved for meetings, preserving his mornings for deep, uninterrupted work.Snapchat co-founder Evan Spiegel begins his mornings at 5 a.m. with a period of solitude, which he calls ""Evan time."" This includes meditation, stretching, and cardio exercises to center his mind and body. After showering and applying a turmeric and peppermint face mask, he sits down with his family for breakfast while catching up on financial news. Spiegel’s routine underscores the value of mindfulness and self-care in achieving a balanced and productive day."," Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, and others share their morning rituals.

Meta is working on building some of the most important technologies of the world. AI, glasses as the next computing platform and the future of social media. This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams.

I’ve decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster. We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year, but now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle, with the intention of back filling these roles in 2025. We won’t manage out everyone who didn’t meet expectations for the last period if we’re optimistic about their future performance, and for those we do let go, we’ll provide generous severance in line with what we provided with previous cuts.

We’ll follow up with more guidance for managers ahead of calibrations. People who are impacted will be notified on February 10 or later for those outside the U.S.

Facebook parent company Meta has announced plans to layoff about 5% of its lowest performers. According to a report by Bloomberg, the company intends to backfill their roles this year. The announcement has been made by company CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a memo.The company expects to reach 10% of “non-regrettable” attrition by the end of the current performance cycle, which includes roughly 5% non-regrettable attrition from 2024, as per the memo.“This means we are aiming to exit approximately another 5% of our current employees who have been with the company long enough to receive a performance rating,” the company said.These layoffs mark Meta's most significant workforce reduction since the elimination of 21,000 jobs in 2022 and 2023.","Facebook parent company Meta has announced plans to layoff about 5% of its lowest performers.

According to sources close to the project, Amazon aims to differentiate itself through cost efficiency and high-performance benchmarks.The model is being developed by Amazon's AGI team under head scientist Rohit Prasad , with a clear objective of ranking among the top 5 AI models in external performance evaluations. These benchmarks will assess critical skills in software development and mathematical reasoning, including the SWE and Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard.Notably, Amazon has prioritized creating a model that is significantly more affordable than existing alternatives. The company's previous Nova models were already reported to be at least 75% cheaper than third-party models available through its Bedrock AI development platform.This development comes at a fascinating moment in Amazon's AI strategy, particularly given its substantial $8 billion investment in Anthropic.","The Nova model will introduce a ""hybrid reasoning"" approach that can generate both rapid responses and complex, extended thinking within a single system.

Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta Platforms , Snapchat , TikTok and other tech companies are calling on the Australian government to reconsider its decision to exempt YouTube from its landmark legislation banning social media access for children under 16.As per news agency Reuters, competitors argue that YouTube exposes children to the same risks as other platforms, including algorithmic content recommendations, social interaction features, and potentially harmful content.The law, passed in November, requires social media platforms to bar logins by minors or face hefty fines of up to A$49.5 million ($31 million). YouTube was exempted from this law based on its classification as an educational tool and its allowance within family accounts with parental supervision.Meta said that Meta said a young person with a YouTube account also experiences exposure to harmful content.‚ÄúYouTube's exemption is at odds with the purported reasons for the law and we call on the government to ensure equal application of the law across all social media services,‚Äù Meta stated in a blog post.TikTok expressed concerns that exempting YouTube would create an ""illogical, anticompetitive, and short-sighted"" law, urging consistency across all platforms.Snapchat echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the need for fair and impartial application of exclusions.‚ÄúThere must be a fair and impartial application of exclusions and all services should be held to the same standard,‚Äù Snap Inc said.Meanwhile, YouTube has maintained that its moderation efforts are becoming more robust and that it has broadened its definition of harmful content detected by its automated systems.","Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta Platforms, Snapchat, TikTok and other tech companies are calling on the Australian government to reconsider its decision to exempt YouTube.

The government has updated the passport application process with stricter rules. As part of these changes, children born on or after October 1, 2023 must provide a birth certificate as the sole proof of their date of birth. This change follows the implementation of the Registration of Births and Deaths (Amendment) Act, 2023 and is aimed to make the verification process simpler and more consistent. However, for those born before October 1, 2023, the rules remain the same, allowing applicants to continue using alternative documents like school leaving certificates, PAN cards, driving licenses, or extracts from service records as proof of birth.Under the new regulations, only birth certificates issued by municipal corporations, the registrar of births and deaths, or any authorized body under the Registration of Births and Deaths Act , 1969, will be accepted. The new rule will take effect once it is published in the official Gazette.Also read: Zepto CEO Aadit Palicha corrects Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal in an open LinkedIn post: ‚ÄòWith due respect, this statement is‚Ä¶‚Äô The government has also made several changes to the passport's format and security features. One significant update is the removal of the applicant's residential address from the last page of the passport. Instead, this information will now be embedded in a barcode that immigration officers can scan when needed, reducing the risk of personal details being misused.In addition to this, the government has introduced a new color-coded system for passports. White passports will be issued to government officials, red passports will be designated for diplomats, and blue passports will continue to be the standard for ordinary citizens. The policy regarding the inclusion of parents' names on passports has also been revised. In a move that benefits individuals from separated or single-parent families, the last page of the passport will no longer display parental details, ensuring that applicants are not required to disclose unnecessary personal information.To meet the increasing demand for passport services, the government has announced plans to expand the number of Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs) from 442 to 600 over the next five years, making passport services more accessible across the country.","The government has updated the passport application process with stricter rules.

What European officials have to say

In a sharp critique of European digital regulations, US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Brendan Carr condemned the European Union‚Äôs (EU) Digital Services Act (DSA) as a potential threat to free speech , arguing that the law is fundamentally at odds with American democratic principles.Speaking at the Mobile World Congress this week, Carr described the DSA as ‚Äúincompatible with America's free speech tradition,‚Äù potentially escalating tensions between US tech policy makers and European regulators, news agency Reuters reported.‚ÄúThere is some concern that I have with respect to the approach that Europe is taking with the DSA ( EU Digital Services Act ) in particular,‚Äù said the Republican commissioner appointed by US President Donald Trump.‚ÄúIf there is an urge in Europe to engage in protectionist regulations, to give disparate treatment to US technology companies, the Trump administration has been clear that we are going to speak up and defend the interests of US businesses,‚Äù Carr stated.Carr‚Äôs comments follow similar criticisms by other US officials, including Vice President JD Vance, who previously denounced European content moderation efforts as ‚Äúauthoritarian censorship‚Äù during an AI summit in Paris.The DSA, which became effective last year, aims to create a safer online environment by requiring tech giants to more aggressively tackle illegal content, including hate speech and child sexual abuse material.However, European officials strongly rejected Carr's accusations.‚ÄúThe aim of our digital legislation, for example the DSA, is the protection of fundamental rights,‚Äù spokesperson Thomas Regnier said.‚ÄúWe all agree on the need to ensure that the internet is a safe place, as VP Vance put it at the AI Action Summit in Paris,‚Äù Regnier added.Carr has requested briefings from major tech companies like Apple, Meta, and Alphabet about how they plan to reconcile the DSA with American free speech principles.","FCC Chairman Brendan Carr criticises EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) DSA requires tech giants to more aggressively tackle illegal content, including hate speech and child sexual abuse material.

How Elon Musk is a Canadian citizen



Can petition really revoke Elon Musk's Canadian citizenship



Revoke Elon Musk's Canadian Citizenship. So says a petition signed by more than 250,000 Canadian citizens and residents. The parliamentary petition urges Canada to revoke Elon Musk‚Äôs citizenship and passport. The petition, which opened to signatures late last week, accuses Musk of acting against Canada's national interest and undermining its sovereignty. Elon Musk is one of the closest associates of the US President Donald Trump, who plans to levy a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports next month. Trump has also proposed annexing the country as the 51st state, is ‚Äúagainst the national interest of Canada,‚Äù the petitioners claim.‚ÄúHe has used his wealth and power to influence our elections,‚Äù the petition claims. ‚ÄúHe has now become a member of a foreign government that is attempting to erase Canadian sovereignty.‚ÄùTesla CEO Elon Musk, however, later deleted the post. It is not certain why he deleted the post, considering he has been quite vocal about his opinion on a range of issues even if it is opposed by many.The petition is addressed to Justin Trudeau and sponsored by Charlie Angus , a member of Parliament for the left-of-center New Democratic Party. A petition, initiated on February 20 and currently supported by over 250,000 Canadian signatures, will remain available for signatures until June 20.Meanwhile, Musk's daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson, said in a post on Threads, ""I‚Äôm ngl this Canadian ‚Äô51st state‚Äô s**t has upped my Canadian patriotism by about 5000000%‚Äù.Born in Pretoria, South Africa, Elon Musk holds both Canadian and US citizenship. He has previously said that he obtained a Canadian passport as a teenager through his mother, Maye Musk, who was born in Canada. Musk received US citizenship a decade after arriving in the US on a student visa.No, very unlikely. It is mostly symbolic and has no legal force. The petition to revoke Musk‚Äôs citizenship is open until June 20, 2025. Post this, the petitions will have to certify that at least 500 of its signatures are legitimate. From there, the petition must wait until a new session of parliament opens before it can be presented to the House of Commons for debate.Under Canadian government rules, citizenship may be revoked if a person commits fraud, misrepresents themselves, or deliberately conceals information on an immigration or citizenship application.","Petition urges Canada to revoke Elon Musk‚Äôs citizenship and passport.

Infosys had terminated approximately 350-400 trainees on February 7, citing their inability to clear internal assessments after three attempts. The company emphasised that performance evaluations are a standard part of its globally recognised training program.In its interim report, the Karnataka Labour Department clarified that the state government cannot intervene in the selection or evaluation processes of private companies. The department also noted that Infosys had adhered to its policies by providing outplacement services, severance pay , and counselling to the trainees who were let go.Labour Minister Santhosh Lad ordered an inspection of Infosys campuses in Mysuru and Bengaluru, conducted by a team led by G Manjunath. The review of hiring documents revealed that while more than 600 students from the 2022 batch moved forward, 329 failed a required test. Government officials also raised concerns about Infosys's terminology.Despite the clean chit, NITES has expressed dissatisfaction with the findings and warned of potential protests. The union continues to advocate for stronger protections for trainees and employees in the IT sector, calling for greater transparency and fairness in hiring and evaluation practices.","The Karnataka Labour Department has officially given Infosys a clean chit regarding the recent layoffs of trainees at its Mysuru campus.

Nor are these funding resumption actions due to pressure from K-Mart (I‚Äôm not promoting him to Target yet) Favs or some legacy news journalist. I give zero fucks what the legacy press says and have made that abundantly clear.

There are two parts to resuming funding:

1. Releasing the pause on the contracts. That was done ~2 weeks ago regarding Ebola/diseases and foodstuffs, which were part of a large block of paused contracts. What I said at the cabinet meeting was accurate.

2. The money itself getting processed through various State, Treasury and Fed accounts and then ultimately getting to the recipient‚Äôs bank account. This takes a few weeks.

AOC slams Elon Musk, calls him a 'leech on the public' over social security stance

‚ÄúThis guy is a leech on the public. No matter how many billions he gets in tax cuts and government contracts, it will never be enough for him. Now he‚Äôs going after the elderly, the disabled, and orphaned children so he can pocket it in tax cuts for himself. It‚Äôs disgusting.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you actually write these, or am I replying to your intern?‚Äù

Public and political reactions

A heated political confrontation has erupted between Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk , following his recent remarks on Social Security. Musk, who has played a key role in the Trump administration‚Äôs cost-cutting initiatives through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), labeled Social Security the ‚Äúbiggest Ponzi scheme of all time‚Äù during an appearance on Joe Rogan‚Äôs podcast.Ocasio-Cortez, a vocal critic of Musk, responded with sharp criticism, calling him a ‚Äúleech on the public‚Äù and accusing him of prioritizing tax cuts for billionaires over the well-being of vulnerable Americans. This latest exchange is part of a long-standing conflict between the two, with AOC frequently challenging Musk‚Äôs influence in government and his involvement in federal contracts. The dispute raises broader questions about Musk‚Äôs expanding role in government decision-making and the impact of his cost-cutting measures on public services.During his appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Musk claimed that Social Security operates as a Ponzi scheme, suggesting that its financial structure is unsustainable. He also echoed a widely debunked assertion previously made by former President Donald Trump, stating that ‚Äúmillions and millions of people over 100 years old‚Äù were still receiving Social Security benefits.Musk further alleged that a simple search of the Social Security database revealed that 20 million deceased individuals were still listed as alive. However, these claims contradict government data. According to a 2024 report from the Social Security Administration (SSA), only 1% of payments made between 2015 and 2022 were improper, with most of those payments going to living recipients rather than deceased individuals.His comments immediately drew backlash, particularly from lawmakers who view Social Security as a crucial safety net for retired workers, people with disabilities, and low-income individuals. Currently, approximately 69 million Americans rely on Social Security benefits, making it one of the most significant federal programs in the United States.Shortly after Musk‚Äôs podcast appearance, Ocasio-Cortez took to X (formerly Twitter) to criticize him. She accused Musk of benefitting from government subsidies and contracts while simultaneously advocating for policies that would dismantle social safety programs.Her comments reflect growing concerns among some lawmakers about Musk‚Äôs influence within the federal government, particularly through his role in the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).Musk has been closely involved with DOGE, an agency created under the Trump administration to reduce federal spending. Under Musk‚Äôs leadership, DOGE has implemented widespread staff layoffs, a reduction in government real estate holdings, and significant cuts to federal contracts.One of the most controversial moves involved layoffs at the Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs (FDA) medical devices division, which raised alarms about potential risks to public health and safety. Following backlash, some of these employees were later reinstated.Ocasio-Cortez has been particularly vocal about Musk‚Äôs involvement in these decisions, questioning his qualifications to make such impactful changes:she told her colleagues in the House Energy and Commerce Committee.Beyond his role in government cost-cutting, Musk‚Äôs companies‚ÄîSpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, and The Boring Company‚Äîhave received billions of dollars in federal contracts and subsidies. Ocasio-Cortez has repeatedly pointed to these financial benefits as evidence of Musk‚Äôs deep reliance on public funds, despite his frequent criticism of government programs.Last month, she called for greater transparency in federal spending, particularly in the defense sector, where Musk‚Äôs companies hold lucrative contracts.Musk dismissed AOC‚Äôs remarks with a sarcastic response on X:The dispute between Ocasio-Cortez and Musk has further polarized public opinion. Supporters of Musk argue that his cost-cutting measures are necessary to reduce government inefficiency and that his companies have contributed significantly to technological advancements. Critics, however, believe that his approach prioritizes corporate interests over public welfare, particularly when it comes to essential programs like Social Security.Musk‚Äôs involvement in government decision-making continues to be a topic of debate, raising concerns about the influence of billionaires in shaping public policy. Meanwhile, Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive lawmakers are pushing for increased scrutiny of federal contracts and greater protection for social programs.","A heated political confrontation has erupted between Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk.

What the company said about the livestream issue



‚ÄúWe experienced technical and live stream issues on Hulu which impacted some Oscars viewers. We apologise for the experience.‚Äù

Hulu 's first-ever livestream of the Academy Awards reportedly ended prematurely. This issue, which occurred due to a scheduling system error, cut off the Oscars 2025 streaming before the announcement of Best Actress and Best Picture awards.According to a report by the news agency AP, viewers were met with an error message stating the event was over, causing widespread frustration and outrage online. This technical glitch caused many to miss the final moments of the awards ceremony, including the announcements of Mikey Madison (Best Actress) and ""Anora"" (Best Picture) as winners.The streaming platform also experienced issues at the start of the show, with some users unable to log in, highlighting a series of technical difficulties during Hulu's Oscars debut, the report added. This suggests that some viewers may have also missed the show‚Äôs musical intro performed by ‚ÄúWicked‚Äù stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande.In a written statement sent to AP, the company wrote: Disney also mentioned that a complete replay of the event is now accessible on Hulu and Hulu on Disney+, the combined streaming package. This replay even includes the final moments of the Oscar broadcast.Hulu's entry into covering the Oscars comes as more streaming services are investing heavily in live broadcasts of high-profile events, spanning from awards shows and pop culture highlights to major sporting events such as the Super Bowl.However, this is not the first time that a major streaming platform has faced live event challenges. Hulu's recent stumble is one of several similar incidents.For example, Netflix users experienced streaming and buffering issues during the widely-watched Mike Tyson versus Jake Paul fight in November 2024.

The Tesla service center in Brooklyn, typically a quiet and inconspicuous location, became the focal point of a large-scale protest this past weekend. Demonstrators gathered outside, waving placards and voicing their opposition to Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his growing involvement in U.S. politics.The protest was part of a broader movement known as the ‚ÄúTesla Takedown‚Äù, which has been ongoing since early February. Demonstrations have been taking place at Tesla stores and service centers worldwide, with protesters criticizing Musk‚Äôs increasing influence in government and far-right politics. This latest wave of protests marks a shift in public sentiment, as Tesla‚Äîa brand once celebrated for its innovation‚Äîis now at the center of political controversy.The Brooklyn protest was one of many held across the United States, with similar gatherings reported in major cities like Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Tucson, Cleveland, Columbus, and Ann Arbor. Protesters claim that Musk‚Äôs political actions and financial contributions to the Trump administration have raised serious concerns about corporate influence in government policies.On Sunday, March 2, a crowd of demonstrators assembled outside Tesla‚Äôs Brooklyn service center, chanting slogans and holding signs that readandSome protesters even referenced Musk‚Äôs involvement in government by carrying a satirical sign with an image of Kabosu, the Shiba Inu dog that inspired the popular ‚ÄúDoge‚Äù meme, captioned withDespite the cold weather, the demonstration attracted a large number of participants, including students, activists, and concerned citizens. Several passersby expressed support, with some Tesla owners honking their car horns in solidarity. NYPD officers were also present, monitoring the gathering, but there were no immediate reports of altercations.In Manhattan, however, protests took a more intense turn. A rally outside Tesla‚Äôs showroom resulted in nine arrests, highlighting the increasing tensions between demonstrators and law enforcement.Much of the public outrage stems from Musk‚Äôs deepening ties with the Trump administration. Reports indicate that Musk has been actively involved in cabinet meetings and government decision-making, despite not holding an official position. Additionally, he serves as the head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)‚Äîa role that has led to significant restructuring within federal agencies.Critics argue that Musk‚Äôs leadership in DOGE has resulted in the dissolution of long-standing government institutions and the dismissal of thousands of public employees, including career officials who had spent decades in service. Moreover, recent financial records suggest that Musk has contributed approximately $288 million to Trump‚Äôs reelection campaign, further fueling concerns about corporate influence in politics.Protesters believe that Musk‚Äôs involvement in government poses a threat to democracy, with many calling for his removal from policy-making roles. Emily Waters, a professor at Parsons School of Design, emphasized the importance of citizen activism, stating:Similarly, Becca, a student from New York, urged people to take action, saying:Over the past month, grassroots organizations like Action Network and Indivisible have played a key role in mobilizing demonstrators. Social media platforms such as BlueSky and Threads have also been instrumental in spreading awareness and organizing events.Even public figures have begun to distance themselves from Tesla. Singer Sheryl Crow recently announced that she had sold her Tesla Model 3, donating the proceeds to NPR, an organization that Musk has previously threatened to defund. Similarly, actor and filmmaker Alex Winter stated that the protests are not necessarily aimed at Tesla as a company, but rather at Musk‚Äôs political influence.While it remains unclear how these protests will affect Tesla‚Äôs sales, the company has already been facing challenges in 2025. Tesla‚Äôs global sales have been declining, with increased competition from other electric vehicle manufacturers such as Ford, General Motors, and BYD.Tesla is also dealing with operational and strategic shifts, including:Despite these developments, industry analysts suggest that growing public discontent with Musk could impact Tesla‚Äôs brand perception and consumer trust.","Demonstrations have been taking place at Tesla stores and service centers worldwide.

In an Economic Times article today, Deepinder Goyal - whom I deeply respect as an entrepreneur - made an inaccurate statement about Zepto. His words were that Quick Commerce was burning 5,000 Crores per quarter of which ""substantially more than half of this is by Zepto"" - implying that we are losing substantially more than 2,500 Crores per quarter.

This statement is verifiably untrue and it will be clear when we publicly file our financial statements. However, I know Deepinder, and I know he has only good intentions; this quote could have been taken out of context or said as an honest mistake.

Deepinder started

when I was 5 years old and he has become a role model for the Indian startup ecosystem. I have personally read all of his blogs and it's a privilege to learn from and compete with Zomato. Our genuine intention is to build the Indian startup ecosystem together in good-faith, and build a world-class product for the Indian consumer üôè

To all the journalists reaching out to me now, we will refrain from commenting on this again to avoid an unnecessary public back-and-forth. Thanks everyone!

Zepto CEO Aadit Palicha recently took to professional networking platform LinkedIn to dispute statements made by Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal .

LTIMindtree links managers‚Äô salary hikes to a new competency tests that assess ‚Ä¶,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ltimindtree-links-managers-salary-hikes-to-a-new-competency-tests-that-assess-/articleshow/118703055.cms,"LTIMindtree, one of India's leading IT services companies, has introduced a new appraisal system that links salary hikes for middle and senior-level managers to the successful completion of competency tests. This move aims to ensure that managers stay updated with the latest technologies and maintain high standards of performance.According to a report by Economic Times, the new system, part of the ""My Career My Growth"" (MCMG) framework, requires managers, project leads, and lead architects to pass a skills test in coding and mathematics. The appraisal process is now divided equally between project performance and the competency exam, with each component carrying 50% weightage.An LTIMindtree spokesperson explained, ""Our performance management process integrates competency-linked goals alongside project-specific goals. We believe both are equally important in assessing the overall annual performance of our talent, and as a result, they carry equal weightage."" The spokesperson added that the MCMG framework helps employees identify growth opportunities and set clear milestones for their career progression.The competency tests are designed to evaluate the technical skills required for various projects, ensuring that senior management remains proficient in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. This initiative is expected to enhance productivity and efficiency within the company.However, some employees have expressed concerns that the new system may be a cost-cutting measure to limit pay hikes. Despite these concerns, LTIMindtree maintains that the tests are essential for fostering skill enhancement and objective evaluation.‚ÄúThe test is around whatever skillsets we possess that is required for our project, these are technical tests, certifications, etc needed to fulfil a project to meet the demand from clients,‚Äù one of the employees told ET.The test weighs on 50% of the appraisal for project leads, managers and lead architects, while the other 50% is dependent on their projects and KRAs (key result areas), another employee confirmed.","LTIMindtree has introduced a new appraisal system that links salary hikes for middle and senior-level managers to the successful completion of competency tests.

Google‚Äôs Chrome extension cleanup affects more uBlock Origin users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/googles-chrome-extension-cleanup-affects-more-ublock-origin-users/articleshow/118701665.cms,"Impact on users

Google has begun disabling several popular Chrome extensions , including the widely-used ad blocker uBlock Origin , as part of its transition to the new Manifest V3 specification. This move has sparked significant backlash from users and developers alike, who argue that the changes benefit advertisers at the expense of user control over online content.According to a report by The Verge, the transition to Manifest V3, which Google claims is designed to improve privacy and security, restricts certain extension capabilities, making it harder for ad blockers like uBlock Origin to function effectively. While uBlock Origin Lite will remain available, its ad-filtering capabilities will be limited due to the new restrictions.Users have reported that Chrome has automatically disabled older extensions, displaying notifications that they are ""no longer supported."" This change is part of Google's ongoing efforts to phase out Manifest V2, which officially lost support in October 2023. Extensions that have not been upgraded to Manifest V3 are being disabled or removed from the Chrome Web Store.The impact of this transition extends beyond Chrome, affecting other Chromium-based browsers like Microsoft Edge and Brave. While Brave has confirmed it will offer limited support for ad blockers after the transition, Firefox has stated it will continue to support Manifest V2 extensions, providing a potential alternative for users who rely on ad-blocking tools.As Google continues to roll out Manifest V3, users and developers are voicing their concerns about the implications for online privacy and user control. The debate over the balance between security and functionality in browser extensions is likely to continue as the transition progresses.","Google has begun disabling several popular Chrome extensions, including the widely-used ad blocker uBlock Origin.

Google has announced a significant update to its Gemini platform, renaming ' Gemini Extensions ' to simply 'apps' in the latest beta version of its application. According to a report by 9to5Google, the change is implemented in version 16.8, aims to make the feature more familiar and user-friendly by aligning it with a term that is widely recognised.The rebranding effort is reflected throughout the Gemini interface, including the account menu and the page for enabling and disabling each tool. While the functionality of these tools remains unchanged, the new terminology is expected to resonate better with users who are more accustomed to the concept of 'apps' rather than 'extensions,' which is typically associated with web browsers.Despite the name change, some users have expressed concerns that 'apps' may not be as fitting for certain categories, such as 'Utilities,' where 'extensions' seemed more appropriate. Additionally, the update includes a minor modification to the home page, where the model being used is now displayed in a small pill-shaped icon with a chevron, improving the overall user interface.This update is part of Google's ongoing efforts to enhance user experience and streamline its services. The new naming convention is expected to roll out gradually, with the full implementation anticipated in the coming weeks.","Google has announced a significant update to its Gemini platform, renaming'Gemini Extensions'to simply 'apps' in the latest beta version of its application.

Chip demand is reducing in the auto sector



Microchip Technology has announced it will cut around 2,000 jobs, or about 9% of its workforce, in response to slowing demand. According to a report by Reuters, the chipmaker's headcount reductions will primarily affect its factories in Oregon and Colorado in the US. Layoffs will also occur at the Arizona-based company‚Äôs backend facility in the Philippines, the report noted.As per the report, Microchip is also planning to close its Arizona factory to address the decreased demand and reduce excess inventory. With this move, the company expects to cut overall inventory by over $300 million by March 2026.However, Microchip anticipates incurring between $30 million and $40 million in costs related to the layoffs, including severance and restructuring expenses, the report added. The company also said the job cuts will be revealed to employees this month and fully implemented by the end of the June quarter.All this is expected to cut the company‚Äôs ongoing operating expenses by nearly $90 million to $100 million per year, the report claims. In addition to the nearly $90 million in annual cash savings from the Arizona fab closure disclosed in December, further layoffs at various facilities are projected to reduce employment-related costs at Microchip's factories by an additional $25 million.Microchip‚Äôs automotive customers have faced challenges clearing their chip inventories after stockpiling supplies during pandemic-related disruptions. As a result, the chip company's shares dropped by over 36% in 2024.Microchip has also revealed plans to sell its integrated circuit die to a Chinese partner. The partner will test, assemble, and market the products under a Chinese brand. Similarly, rival chipmakers like Allegro Microsystems have initiated efforts to localize their supply chains in China.Meanwhile, rising US-China tensions are also posing risks for chipmakers that rely on revenue from China, a key market for many auto industry suppliers.","Microchip Technology has announced it will cut around 2,000 jobs, or about 9% of its workforce, in response to slowing demand.

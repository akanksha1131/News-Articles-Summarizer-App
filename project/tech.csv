In Manhattan's Midtown Lord & Taylor building, some employees might not have designated workspace until May, while Dallas-based staff were told to expect delays until March or April.The situation appears to contradict Amazon's initial return-to-office guidance. ""For the vast majority of employees, assigned workspaces will be available by January 2, 2025,"" the internal guidance stated. ""If your assigned workspace isn't ready by January 2, we still expect everyone to begin fully working from the office by that date.""Employees report struggles with the current three-day hybrid model, citing issues with shared desks, overcrowded corporate canteens, and scarce conference rooms for confidential calls or team meetings. ""The company has added a feature to its room reservation tool that requires workers to attest they actually plan to use the space, an apparent effort to crack down on squatters looking for a quiet place to work,"" one employee noted.The space crunch comes three months after CEO Andy Jassy announced the controversial mandate requiring employees to work from office five days per week. The policy has faced resistance from employees who say they've proved their effectiveness while working remotely and prefer flexible arrangements common among tech industry peers.To address immediate space needs, Amazon has leased temporary offices from WeWork in New York and Silicon Valley. The company had previously paused several office development projects during the pandemic, including developments in Bellevue, Nashville, and Arlington, Virginia.An Amazon spokesperson said the delays primarily result from building reconfigurations needed to accommodate full-time office workers, rather than a shortage of available office space. The company maintains that the ""vast majority"" of employees will have desk space by January 2, and is communicating directly with affected employees about specific return dates in their locations.","Amazon is postponing its mandatory five-day return-to-office policy for thousands of corporate employees due to insufficient workspace.

"The words from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella that became 'bombshell' for Nvidia's stock, the AI industry's biggest growth story of 2024",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-words-from-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-that-became-bombshell-for-nvidias-stock-the-ai-industrys-biggest-growth-story-of-2024/articleshow/116481911.cms,"The red flags in AI chips demand

Nvidia recently fell from second-most valuable company to third. As recently as November, it was the No. 1. Now the No. 1 and No. 2 spot belong to Apple and Microsoft, respectively. While Nvidia stock climbed 2.5% in pre-market trading today, it is still not to its super high levels. While analysts see Nvidia shares in correction mode, there are arrange of factors responsible for this.And of these, one is reported to be a comment of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella . Nadella recently said that the company has ample chip supply, potentially impacting demand for Nvidia's AI chips. In an interview, Nadella stated, ""Power yes...I am not chip supply constrained."" This suggests that Microsoft, a major Nvidia customer, may have overinvested in AI chips during the initial ChatGPT boom.""We bought all over the place,"" Nadella said, acknowledging the aggressive approach taken to meet the surge in demand for AI services. He emphasized that this was a temporary measure and that the situation is now stabilizing.Nvidia's stock price has declined recently, falling 11.34% from its 52-week high. While the company experienced a similar correction earlier this year and subsequently rebounded, concerns remain.Hedge fund manager Doug Kass, who reportedly has a short position on Nvidia, highlighted the potential negative impact of Microsoft's chip surplus. According to a report in Marketwatch, he noted that the initial frenzy of AI chip purchases may have led to overinvestment, and that ongoing demand for these chips may not justify continued rapid growth in the supply chain. “Apparently, they all got caught off guard in the beginning; nobody wanted to be left behind; they had the money and piled in with zero caution with no regard to how much they spent, and what they spent it on. These were also big projects that are now largely completed,” said Kass, adding that the additional power Microsoft needs won’t be cheap either.Kass also expressed concerns about the commercial viability of projects like Microsoft's Copilot, questioning whether the anticipated revenue will materialize. He emphasized that even if end-user demand for AI services is strong, the initial surge in chip purchases will likely be followed by a period of more moderate demand. “Even if there were significant end demand for what these projects were selling, chip demand would have to taper just due to the math of getting the lump sum of projects first and then just followed by what underlying demand allows for. Without booming end demand for the final product, I am not sure how the supply chain can keep growing to the moon. Especially from the levels it is,” said Kass.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently said that the company has ample chip supply.

Reimagining HR and Hiring with AI

Return to Office and Addressing Industry Disruptions

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reportedly plans to increase its hiring of fresh graduates from engineering campuses in the upcoming fiscal year (FY26), exceeding the current year's commitment of 40,000. TCS' Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad told Economic Times that this decision is driven by optimistic growth projections. The IT giant is on track to onboard the planned 40,000 freshers in FY25, providing training in cutting-edge technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Generative AI (GenAI).""I expect that number to go up a bit more in FY26,"" Lakkad stated, noting that the company's planning for the next fiscal year has already commenced.TCS, known for its strong cash generation, is also increasing its focus on hiring higher-level professionals. This move aligns with the company's observation of robust growth in certain business verticals. “From the demand side, certain verticals are doing well. We expect to have broad-based growth coming in,” Lakkad said.This positive outlook follows a period of renewed growth for TCS and other leading IT companies, with increased revenue and deal pipelines in the first half of the current fiscal year. Most companies have resumed campus hiring after a pause of over a year.While hiring fresh graduates remains a cornerstone of TCS's strategy, the company is also investing in training students during their final semesters. This proactive approach aims to make them industry-ready upon graduation.""We collaborate with hyperscalers, enterprise solution providers, and other technology vendors,"" Lakkad explained. ""We've established a tripartite arrangement involving ourselves, the technology vendor, and academic institutions to offer specialized courses during the students' final semesters, ensuring their swift integration into the workforce.""Lakkad emphasized that AI and GenAI are transforming every aspect of the HR function, from talent acquisition and development to engagement and deployment. TCS is leveraging AI to streamline recruitment processes. AI-powered tools assist in refining job descriptions, filtering candidate profiles to identify the best matches, and conducting more efficient interviews. AI can also analyze technical skills, assess soft skills, and provide valuable feedback for talent development initiatives. Furthermore, TCS is utilizing AI to enhance employee support through its ""TCS Buddy"" platform. This AI-powered system provides employees with easy access to company policies and information.As for the business and technology disruptions impacting hiring in the people-heavy outsourcing industry, Lakkad said, “We have been through multiple technology cycles in the last 30 years. And when this question comes, the answer always is basically about the change in the nature of the jobs rather than the reduction in the job content or reduction in the number of people required to do that job,” Lakkad said adding that one will be able to do things faster and so more jobs will be needed to be done which will require people.TCS has implemented a return-to-office policy, encouraging employees to work from the office five days a week. This policy is linked to incentives and aims to foster a stronger workplace culture, facilitate collaboration, and provide valuable learning opportunities for employees.Regarding the potential impact of global capability centers (GCCs) on hiring, Lakkad does not foresee a significant reduction in hiring volumes. Instead, he believes that the nature of jobs will evolve.Lakkad also expressed confidence that the growth of GCCs will not significantly impact TCS's business. While GCCs are increasing their in-house technology capabilities, they will continue to rely on IT service providers like TCS for specialized services and expertise.","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reportedly plans to increase its hiring of fresh graduates from engineering campuses in the upcoming fiscal year.

What is digital arrest scam



How to identify a digital arrest scam

Unexpected Contact from ‘Officials’: Be cautious if someone claims to be from government agencies like the police, CBI, income tax officers, or customs agents, contacts you. Be cautious especially if they claim urgent legal action is being initiated or warranted. They might allege that you or one of your family members is involved in a serious crime like money laundering, tax evasion, or drug trafficking.

Fear-based language and urgency: Scammers may request video calls, disguising themselves in police uniforms, using government logos, or creating official-sounding background noise to appear legitimate. They often threaten arrest or immediate legal action, demanding a quick response and using legal terms to sound convincing. In some cases, they create a police station-like set up to further convince victims of their credibility.

Request for sensitive information or payment: Scammers may ask for personal information or demand large sums of money, promising that this will clear up your involvement in the alleged crime. They may also coerce you to transfer money to their account until the investigation is complete. Terms like “clearing your name”, “assisting with the investigation”, or “refundable security deposit/escrow account” might be used by them to persuade you into transferring money to specified bank accounts or UPI IDs.

Tips to stay safe

Pause and Verify: If you receive unexpected calls or messages about legal issues, take a moment to verify. Stay calm, as scammers rely on fear and urgency. Real government and law enforcement agencies will never ask for money or investigate cases through phone or video calls. Always confirm the caller’s identity and consult trusted sources before taking any action.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme. In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

“Outrageous”: Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon on Arm’s demand in legal battle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/outrageous-qualcomm-ceo-cristiano-amon-on-arms-demand-in-legal-battle/articleshow/116478073.cms,"Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon

What is the case all about

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon has testified in a legal battle against chip designer Arm Holdings , terming Arm’s demands in licensing dispute “outrageous”. He also accused the British semiconductor and software design company of misleading Qualcomm's customers, including Samsung , by falsely claiming that a license to use Arm's technology would expire in 2025.“That was not good for Qualcomm, our customers, or frankly, for Arm,” Amon told jurors, while clarifying that the license actually extends until 2033, as per a Bloomberg report.During cross-examination, Amon affirmed that Qualcomm will honour valid licensing agreements and refuted Arm's claim that Qualcomm knowingly violated the terms of its license.The dispute centers on a licensing agreement for Arm's chip technology, which is crucial to the electronics industry. In 2021, Qualcomm acquired Nuvia that developed a custom processor but licenses the base Arm architecture.Arm contends that the licensing agreement it had with Nuvia should have been renegotiated after the acquisition and demanded that Qualcomm destroy any designs acquired in the deal. Qualcomm, however, argues that its existing license with Arm covers its use of Nuvia’s technology.Reportedly, Amon justified purchasing the company by telling Qualcomm’s board that the company can save as much as $1.4 billion per year on payments to Arm by switching away from Arm’s computing core designs to those based on work by Nuvia and its team.Amon also criticised Arm's demand for the destruction of Nuvia's technology, calling it “outrageous” and an unprecedented move in the tech industry.Qualcomm has used Nuvia’s technology and talent to push into the PC market by powering Microsoft’s Copilot+ PCs to better compete with Apple’s MacBook offerings.In an interview earlier this year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella praised Apple for doing “a fantastic job of really innovating on the Mac.”“We're going to outperform them. We finally feel we have a very competitive product,” Nadella noted.","The dispute centers on a licensing agreement for Arm's chip technology, which is crucial to the electronics industry.

The European Union's data privacy authorities have imposed a $263 million fine on Meta, Facebook’s parent company, for a 2018 data breach that exposed millions of user accounts. The breach exploited vulnerabilities in Facebook's code, allowing hackers to steal digital keys, or access tokens, that granted control over user accounts. Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), Meta's lead privacy regulator within the EU, issued the penalty after a detailed investigation. The case underscores the EU's commitment to enforcing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), one of the world's strictest privacy laws. Meta plans to appeal the decision, maintaining that it acted swiftly and transparently to address the breach.The breach occurred in September 2018, when hackers exploited a series of bugs in Facebook’s ‘View As’ feature. This tool allowed users to see how their profiles appeared to others, but flaws in its code enabled attackers to steal access tokens. These tokens, essentially digital keys, granted attackers complete control over user accounts without needing passwords.The attack escalated through connected accounts, spreading from one Facebook friend to another. Initially, Facebook estimated that 50 million accounts were affected. However, further investigation revealed that around 29 million accounts were compromised, including 3 million in Europe.Upon discovering the breach, Facebook reported the issue to law enforcement, including the FBI, and informed data protection regulators in Europe and the United States. The company also promptly fixed the vulnerabilities in the ""View As"" feature and notified affected users.Despite these efforts, the Irish Data Protection Commission found Meta in violation of GDPR regulations. The inquiry concluded that Meta failed to adequately secure user data and allowed multiple infringements of GDPR, resulting in the $263 million fine. Alongside the financial penalty, the DPC issued formal reprimands and administrative directives to Meta.Meta, however, disputes the decision and plans to appeal. In a statement, the company highlighted its proactive response, asserting that it acted transparently and took immediate corrective measures.Under GDPR, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission serves as the lead privacy regulator for Meta, as the company’s European headquarters are in Dublin. This is not the first time Meta has faced scrutiny from the DPC. The watchdog has previously levied fines on the tech giant for data-related violations, demonstrating its active role in ensuring compliance with GDPR across the EU.The General Data Protection Regulation, implemented in 2018, grants EU citizens significant control over their personal data and imposes strict obligations on companies to protect that data. The law allows for fines of up to 4% of a company’s global revenue for serious violations.The $263 million penalty against Meta is part of the EU’s broader effort to hold tech giants accountable for safeguarding user data. The case reinforces the importance of robust data security measures and transparent practices in handling breaches.","Facebook's parent company, Meta, has been fined $263 million for a 2018 data breach.

How stolen data in 2022 LastPass breach may be making hackers rich,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-stolen-data-in-2022-lastpass-breach-may-be-making-hackers-rich/articleshow/116473779.cms,"What LastPass has to say

LastPass hacking in 2022

LastPass continues to haunt users. As per a report, hackers have now exploited stolen data to launch a new wave of attacks, resulting in the theft of $5.36 million in cryptocurrency from over 40 different crypto wallets.According to Blockchain expert ZachXBT (via Tom’s Guide), the latest attacks stem from the data breach that occurred two years ago. The hackers have reportedly swapped the stolen cryptocurrency for Ethereum and then transferred it to various exchanges, converting it into Bitcoin.This essentially makes it virtually impossible for victims to recover their funds. This latest incident follows previous attacks linked to the LastPass breach , which resulted in the theft of $4.7 million in cryptocurrency in 2023 and another $6.4 million in 2024.ZachXBT highlighted that some users may have stored their cryptocurrency seed phrases or keys in LastPass, making them vulnerable to these attacks.In a statement, LastPass' CTO and CSO Christofer Hoff said that the company has not found any definitive evidence directly connecting these thefts to the LastPass breach.“A year has passed since initial claims surfaced alleging a link between certain cryptocurrency thefts and the 2022 LastPass security incidents. In that time, LastPass has investigated these claims and to date is not aware of any conclusive evidence that directly connects these crypto thefts to LastPass. Because we take any claims regarding the security of LastPass and our customers seriously, we continue to invite any security researchers who believe they may have evidence to contact the LastPass Threat Intelligence team at securitydisclosure@lastpass.com,” Hoff was quoted as saying.LastPass suffered a major security breach in 2022 in which source code, API tokens and MFA seeds as well as keys were exposed.","LastPass suffered a major security breach in 2022 in which source code, API tokens and MFA seeds as well as keys were exposed.

We are working to trace the origin of the sender. While their servers or domains have been traced to European or Middle Eastern countries, the actual origin remains unconfirmed, as the emails were sent using VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) or proxy servers. Though nothing suspicious has been found in any of the threats so far, we cannot take any of them lightly. Each message was taken seriously, and thorough checks were conducted, following all security protocols.”

What Delhi Police said about VPNs and proxy servers that affect investigations



“For example, if we are talking to each other, it's direct connectivity, but if we are connected through a VPN, our communication happens via multiple domain servers,”

Delhi has been grappling with a series of bomb threats targeting schools, hospitals, airports, and airlines since May. Despite over 50 such incidents, police investigations have been hampered as cybercriminals used VPNs and proxy servers, which mask the true origin of the threats.According to a report by the news agency PTI, Delhi Police have sought assistance from international agencies like Interpol and written to service providers like Google and VK to obtain IP addresses but have met with limited success. Former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has also raised concerns about the lack of progress in the investigations.A specialised unit within the Delhi Police Special Cell has been assigned to investigate the recent spate of bomb threats targeting schools in the city. Over the past week, several Delhi schools have also received bomb threat emails, leading to security checks being conducted in at least five separate incidents.In a statement to PTI, one of the officers involved in the investigation said:The officer further explained that VPN networks operate like a web on the internet, obscuring the direct connection between the origin and the server.he added.Delhi has been facing a series of bomb threats since May, targeting schools, hospitals, government installations like Tihar Jail, and even international flights.In October, over 150 flights operating from Delhi received bomb threat messages sent via X, with the sender using VPN networks to mask their identity. Despite registering 16 separate cases, Delhi airport police have yet to make a breakthrough in their investigations.","Delhi has been grappling with a series of bomb threats targeting schools, hospitals, airports, and airlines since May.

Since, the website has decided to not follow the state’s age verification laws, it will be illegal to use it, thus Pornhub is shutting doors to its users in the state.Florida users visiting the platform are now encountering prominent warnings stating, ""YOU WILL LOSE ACCESS TO PORNHUB IN 14 DAYS,"" followed by an explanation of the new requirements under state law HB3.PornHub's parent company, Aylo, argues that device-level verification would be more effective. ""The best solution to make the internet safer, preserve user privacy, and prevent children from accessing adult content is performing age verification at the source: on the device,"" the company told Florida Politics.The law requires websites to provide ""anonymous age verification"" for content that ""appeals to the prurient interest"" based on community standards.

After implementing ID verification in Louisiana, PornHub reported an 80% traffic decline. ""These people did not stop looking for porn. They just migrated to darker corners of the internet that don't ask users to verify age, that don't follow the law, that don't take user safety seriously, and that often don't even moderate content,"" Aylo stated.Florida joins Texas, Utah, Arkansas, Virginia, Montana, North Carolina, Mississippi, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, and Nebraska in implementing such restrictions.","Pornhub announced it will no longer be available in the state of Florida starting January 1, 2025.

Following the Amazon playbook

Dropbox CEO, Drew Houston, has revealed his company's adoption of a unique meeting strategy popularised by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos: the ""memo-first"" approach. By sharing detailed memos before meetings, participants can come prepared and engage in more focused discussions. Houston explained that this method eliminates the need for lengthy presentations and allows for deeper understanding and collaboration.“We've all been in those meetings where someone's presenting, you've already read the slide, but you have to wait for the person verbally to catch up, or someone interrupts and asks a question, but the question's answered a couple slides later. And one way or another, the presentation format kind of limits how many people you can have in a room to have an effective conversation,” said Houston at an episode of the podcast The Logan Bartlett Show.Houston added that PowerPoint presentations can often shift the focus from the content to the delivery. This can lead to less effective and efficient meetings. “How compelled you are by the presentation is less about the merits of their arguments and more about their skill at presenting and thinking on their feet, so there's a bit of a distortion or bias that comes in that way,"" added Houston.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos famously banned bullet points and PowerPoint presentations from senior leadership meetings in 2004. Instead, he requires executives to submit six-page narrative memos. These memos are then silently read by all attendees at the start of the meeting, fostering a more focused and productive discussion.At Dropbox, meetings start with a 10-20 minute silent reading session of the shared document. Attendees are encouraged to leave comments and feedback directly in Dropbox Paper. To further streamline the process, the company has even implemented a form at the end of the document for attendees to provide overall feedback and ratings.""In that 10 or 20 minutes, you can get much higher fidelity download to everybody in the room than you could get in an hour of just talking about it and interrupting each other,” said Houston.The memo-first approach may not be a one-size-fits-all solution. However, its adoption by leading companies like Dropbox and Amazon underlines its potential benefits.","Dropbox CEO Drew Houston reveals his company's adoption of a unique meeting strategy popularised by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

""I've been trying to get an Apple search deal for like 10 years, and so when Tim finally did a deal with Sam, I was the most thrilled person,"" Nadella revealed in a recent podcast.Apple and OpenAI announced a partnership back at WWDC this year, that integrates ChatGPT across Apple's ecosystem, including iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.The Microsoft chief's enthusiasm stems from his company's dual relationship with OpenAI as both an investor and commercial partner. ""It's better to have ChatGPT get that deal than anybody else because we have both a commercial and investor relationship with OpenAI,"" he explained.This revelation comes months after Nadella's testimony at Google's antitrust trial, where he disclosed Microsoft's extensive efforts to replace Google as Apple's default search engine. The attempts included an extraordinary offer to drop the Bing brand name from Apple devices and even a proposal to sell Bing to Apple around 2020.During the trial, Nadella emphasized the crucial importance of being Apple's default search provider, describing it as a ""game changing"" opportunity. ""Whomever they choose, they king-make,"" he stated. He also suggested that Apple leveraged Microsoft's interest to ""bid up the price"" in their negotiations with Google, which currently pays Apple approximately $8 billion annually for the default search position.While Microsoft did briefly succeed in powering Apple's Siri and Spotlight searches between 2013 and 2017, they never secured the coveted Safari browser default position. Apple's services chief Eddy Cue maintained that Google remained their choice simply because it provided ""the best search results.""Now, with OpenAI's new relationship with Apple, Nadella sees a silver lining in Microsoft's decade of unsuccessful attempts, suggesting that the outcome aligns with Microsoft's strategic interests through its OpenAI partnership.",Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says he's been trying to get an Apple search deal for 10 years.

Brad Smith, who is also the Big Tech company’s vice chair and top legal officer, told the Financial Times that cyber security “deserves to be a more prominent issue of international relations” and appealed to the US president-elect to send a “strong message”.“I hope that the Trump administration will push harder against nation-state cyber attacks, especially from Russia and China and Iran,” Smith said. “We should not tolerate the level of attacks that we are seeing today.”Ransomware attacks against US businesses have surged in recent years, often perpetrated by criminal gangs that Smith said were “tolerated . . . and in some cases even facilitated” by the Russian government.Recently, US law enforcement agencies accused China of mounting a widespread cyber espionage campaign, by breaking into several American telecoms networks in the run-up to this month’s election.Smith said Joe Biden’s administration had made “tremendous progress in strengthening cyber security protections” but added: “There’s more steps that are needed, especially in dissuading and deterring these other countries from unleashing these cyber attacks.”A recent Microsoft study found that its customers face more than 600mn cyber attacks every day, with criminal gangs and “nation-state groups” increasingly teaming up to share tools and even conducting joint operations.Smith testified before the US Senate in September that Russia, China and Iran had stepped up their digital efforts to interfere in global elections this year, including in the US.However, Microsoft’s own security standards have come under fire in recent months. A damning report by the US Cyber Safety Review Board in March said its security culture was “inadequate”, pointing to a “cascade . . . of avoidable errors” that last year allowed Chinese hackers to access hundreds of email accounts, including those belonging to senior US government security officials, that were hosted on Microsoft’s cloud systems. Post this, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella reportedly told employees that the company would prioritise security “above all else”, including by tying staff remuneration to security.","Brad Smith said cyber security ‘deserves to be a more prominent issue of international relations’ He appealed to the US president-elect to send a ‘strong message’ to Russia, China and Iran.

Who is Nima Momeni

Bob Lee killing 'shocked' Silicon Valley

San Francisco DA Jenkins calls out Elon Musk

Conflicting accounts and key evidence

Prosecution's Argument:

Defense's Argument:

A San Francisco jury convicted Nima Momeni , a 40-year-old tech consultant, of second-degree murder in the stabbing death of Bob Lee, the renowned founder of Cash App. Lee, 43, a prominent figure in the tech world, was killed in April 2023. Momeni, who was facing first-degree murder charges, now faces a sentence of 16 years to life in prison. His attorney, Tony Brass, has stated his intention to appeal the verdict.The tragic incident unfolded in the early morning hours of April 4, 2023, when Lee was found bleeding profusely in a doorway on a San Francisco street. He had sustained stab wounds to the hip and heart and had called 911 for help before succumbing to his injuries at a hospital.According to his Linkedin page, Nima Momeni is the owner of Expand IT. His profile describes the company as providing IT solutions in the Bay Area since 2010.Lee, a highly respected figure in the tech community, was known for his contributions to Google Android and Square's Cash App. He later served as a top executive at MobileCoin. His untimely death, which occurred while he was visiting San Francisco from his new home in Miami, shocked the tech world and sparked widespread concern about safety in the city.The killing of Bob Lee, a well-respected and influential figure in the tech industry, had a significant impact. It sparked widespread discussion about safety concerns in San Francisco and fueled speculation about the city's post-pandemic challenges.District Attorney Brooke Jenkins expressed relief at the jury's verdict, stating that she feared a mistrial. Momeni is scheduled to be sentenced in February or March.San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins reportedly thanked the attorneys who prosecuted the case outside the courtroom after the guilty verdict was read. ""I knew was confident that we had the best two handling this case,"" Jenkins said, as per a report in SFGate. ""And I think the verdict was a testament to the hard work they put in, to the great lawyers that they are, and to their commitment to justice and to making sure that this family received justice.""Tesla CEO Elon Musk , after Lee was stabbed in April 2023, reportedly blamed the widely discussed attack on San Francisco’s governance. He wrote on X, “Violent crime in SF is horrific and even if attackers are caught, they are often released immediately. Is the city taking stronger action to incarcerate repeat violent offenders @BrookeJenkinsSF?”""I think that hopefully now, we have once again established what truly happened here. We all know that after Bob Lee was murdered, Elon Musk took to Twitter to make an effort to really shame San Francisco, and to make it seem like this was about lawlessness in San Francisco and about what's going on in our streets,"" Jenkins said.“After Elon Musk’s tweet, within 24 hours, it had 6 million views worldwide,” Jenkins said, “and that inhibits San Francisco from being able to thrive. And he was incorrect.”The prosecution and defense presented starkly different narratives of the events leading to Lee's death.Prosecutors argued that Momeni, driven by anger over Lee's alleged involvement in his sister's drug abuse, fatally stabbed Lee with a paring knife.Momeni's lawyers maintained that he acted in self-defense, claiming that Lee lunged at him with the knife after a ""bad joke"" during a social gathering.Key evidence in the case included DNA evidence found on the knife handle, which matched Momeni's DNA. The prosecution emphasized the lack of a 911 call from Momeni, casting doubt on his self-defense claim.","Nima Momeni, a 40-year-old tech consultant, was convicted of second-degree murder in the stabbing death of Bob Lee, the founder of Cash App. Lee, 43, a prominent figure in the tech world, was killed in April 2023.

Netflix faces $5 million fine for ‘hiding’ data usage details from customers in Europe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/netflix-faces-5-million-fine-for-hiding-data-usage-details-from-customers-in-europe/articleshow/116445355.cms,"""Furthermore, customers did not receive sufficient information when they asked Netflix which data the company collects about them.

“Since this investigation began over five years ago, we have cooperated with the

What Dutch privacy watchdog said against Netflix



“A company like that, with a turnover of billions and millions of customers worldwide, has to explain properly to its customers how it handles their personal data. That must be crystal clear. Especially if the customer asks about this. And that was not in order.”

Netherlands’ Data Protection Authority (AP) has reportedly imposed a €4.75 million ($4.9 million) fine on Netflix . The Dutch privacy watchdog claimed that the streaming giant failed to adequately inform users about its data practices between 2018 and 2020.In a statement to the news agency Reuters, the DPA said that its investigation, which started in 2019, showed that ""Netflix did not inform customers clearly enough in its privacy statement about what exactly Netflix does with those data.”the privacy watchdog added.In an emailed statement to Reuters, a Netflix spokesperson said:Netflix, which has since revised its privacy policy and enhanced its information disclosure, is reportedly contesting the fine. However, the streaming giant has not yet responded to a request for comment.In a statement to another news agency AFP, AP chairman Aleid Wolfsen said:The data protection authority also stated that Netflix provided unclear or inadequate information in several areas. The watchdog highlighted that Netflix was not transparent about the reasons for collecting personal data, the sharing of data with third parties, the data retention period, and the security measures employed for data transfers outside Europe.","Netherlands’ Data Protection Authority (AP) has reportedly imposed a €4.75 million ($4.9 million) fine on Netflix.

What TP-Link has to say

The US government reportedly is investigating Chinese router manufacturer TP-Link over potential national security risks , with authorities considering a ban on the sale of its home internet devices in the US as early as next year.Citing people familiar with the matter, a report by the Wall Street Journal said that concerns have arisen about the security of TP-Link routers after a recent Microsoft analysis revealed that a Chinese hacking group has compromised thousands of these devices to launch cyberattacks against Western targets, including government organisations, think tanks, and defense contractors.Notably, TP-Link holds a dominant position in the US home and small business router market with a 65% share, the report said, adding that its routers are widely available on Amazon.com and are even used by the Defense Department and other federal agencies.The sources also claim that TP-Link routers often ship with security vulnerabilities that the company fails to address promptly. Furthermore, TP-Link has been criticised for its lack of engagement with security researchers who identify these vulnerabilities.TP-Link, which operates in the US through a California-based unit, maintains that it takes security seriously and addresses known vulnerabilities.“We welcome any opportunities to engage with the U.S. government to demonstrate that our security practices are fully in line with industry security standards, and to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to the US market, US consumers, and addressing US national security risks,” the spokeswoman was quoted as saying..Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington criticised the US investigation, accusing it of using national security as a pretext to “suppress Chinese companies”He added that China will “resolutely defend” the lawful rights and interests of Chinese firms.",The US government reportedly is investigating Chinese router manufacturer TP- Link over potential national security risks.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s blog post





Amazon AI chief Rohit Prasad is leaving the company at the end of year. Confirming his exit, CEO Andy Jassy shared a blog post where he said that the e-commerce company is reorganizing the artificial generative intelligence (AGI) unit. Jassy also said that Amazon is adding an expansive division that will also include its silicon development and quantum computing teams. The new unit, he said, will be led by Peter DeSantis, a 27-year Amazon veteran currently serving as a senior vice president in its cloud unit.Rohit joined Amazon in 2013 during the early days of Alexa, and has helped build Alexa as a conversational AI. Recognizing Rohit Prasad’s work tenure, Jassy said he helped Alexa grow from an ambitious idea into a service that now touches hundreds of millions of customers' lives every day. “Rohit has built a strong team, differentiated technology, growing customer momentum, and a culture of ambitious invention. He’s been missionary, passionate, and selfless, and I'm grateful for his leadership, his technical vision, and everything he's built here. Thank you, Rohit,” he said in the post.“At Amazon, we often start new businesses in parts of the company where there’s an initial customer need, and as they grow and get momentum, we assess where they’re best situated to maximize potential for customers and Amazon over the long term.I believe we are at this inflection point with several of our new technologies that will power a significant amount of our future customer experiences,” Andy Jassy writes in the post.“I’ve asked Peter DeSantis to lead a new organization that drives our most expansive AI models (e.g. Nova—and the team we’ve called “AGI”), silicon development (e.g. Graviton, Trainium, Nitro), and quantum computing,” he added.At Amazon, we often start new businesses in parts of the company where there’s an initial customer need, and as they grow and get momentum, we assess where they’re best situated to maximize potential for customers and Amazon over the long term. I believe we are at this inflection point with several of our new technologies that will power a significant amount of our future customer experiences.I’ve asked Peter DeSantis to lead a new organization that drives our most expansive AI models (e.g. Nova—and the team we’ve called “AGI”), silicon development (e.g. Graviton, Trainium, Nitro), and quantum computing.I cannot think of a better leader for this organization than Peter. Peter has been at Amazon for over 27 years, and led some of the most transformative technologies in computing history. Peter was the leader of Amazon EC2 when we launched this revolutionary service in 2006, and built out that excellent team over many years. Under his leadership, we launched Block Storage, File Storage, Load Balancing, Networking, and Monitoring services that AWS customers continue to rely on to run their infrastructure. In 2015, Peter spearheaded the acquisition of Annapurna Labs, our outstanding team that builds our custom silicon, and continues to manage that team. In 2016, we asked Peter to lead our AWS Infrastructure team, who’s responsible for all of our data centers, networking, hardware, and associated supply chain. To give you an idea of scale, our infrastructure stretches across 38 geographic regions and 120 Availability Zones around the world. In 2021, Peter moved to lead all of our AWS Utility Computing services (e.g., compute, storage, database, analytics, various AI services, messaging, etc.), the combination of which is widely recognized as the industry leader and standard-setter in the cloud.Peter combines unusual technical depth with a track record of solving problems at the edge of what’s technically possible—and delivering technologies that operate reliably at massive scale. Peter embodies our leadership principles. His ability to invent, think big but be neck-deep in the details, insist on the highest standards, learn and be curious, focus on what matters to customers, and be right much of the time are among the many traits that make him so effective. With our Nova 2 models just launched at re:Invent, our custom silicon growing rapidly, and the advantages of optimizing across models, chips, and cloud software and infrastructure, we wanted to free Peter up to focus his energy, invention cycles, and leadership on these new areas. Peter will report directly to me.As part of this organizational change, Pieter Abbeel will lead our frontier model research team (the team that builds the base model) in AGI. Pieter is one of the world's leading AI researchers, and co-founder of Covariant, which pioneered the first commercial foundation model for robotics. His deep expertise in generative AI and reinforcement learning makes him well-suited to advance Amazon's AI research as we push the boundaries of what's possible for customers. Pieter will also continue his ongoing work with our Robotics team. Peter will share the rest of the organizational design shortly.Peter’s very strong leaders in AWS Utility Computing will continue to lead what they’ve been leading, with a few additional responsibilities. Matt Garman will share the new AWS structure in a follow-up note.Finally, I want to recognize Rohit Prasad, who has decided to leave Amazon at the end of this year. Rohit joined Amazon in 2013, during the early days of Alexa, to help us build a conversational AI that could make customers' lives easier. Rohit helped Alexa grow from an ambitious idea into a service that now touches hundreds of millions of customers' lives every day. For the past two years, Rohit has led the creation of Amazon Nova and our AGI organization, building twelve state-of-the-art foundation models with industry-leading price-performance that are now being used by tens of thousands of companies across almost all industries and use cases. Rohit has built a strong team, differentiated technology, growing customer momentum, and a culture of ambitious invention. He’s been missionary, passionate, and selfless, and I'm grateful for his leadership, his technical vision, and everything he's built here. Thank you, Rohit.The path ahead is full of opportunity. With the foundation that's been built, the traction we’re seeing, and Peter's leadership bringing unified focus to these technologies, we're well-positioned to lead and deliver meaningful capabilities for our customers. I'm excited about what this team will build and how these foundational technologies will help shape Amazon's future.Andy","Amazon AI chief Rohit Prasad is leaving the company at the end of year.

Bill Gates to AI companies: You are over valued and a reasonable percentage will ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-to-ai-companies-you-are-over-valued-and-a-reasonable-percentage-will-/articleshow/126049687.cms,"Bill Gates on AI valuations



Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

Bill Gates emphasised that AI remains a transformative force







Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has once again cautioned that many artificial intelligence companies with very-high valuations will not survive in what he described as a “hyper competitive” industry. As reported by CNBC, speaking at the Abu Dhabi Finance Week in an interview with CNBC’s Tanya Bryer, Gates said that the investors should brace themselves for corrections as the fear of an AI bubble is intensifying day-by-day. Gates also highlighted that the hyper-competitive nature of AI means that only a fraction of companies will emerge as long-term winners. Gates said that “a reasonable percentage of those companies won’t be worth that much.”“AI is the most important thing going on,” Gates said, but stressed that inflated valuations do not guarantee success. “Does it mean all of these companies with high valuations will be winners? No, it’s going to be hyper competitive,” he explained. He added: “AI is only a bubble in the sense that not all of these valuations will end up going up. Some of them will go down… A reasonable percentage of those companies won’t be worth that much.Companies like Tesla, Palantir presently trade at price-to-earnings ratios above 200 compared with an S&P 500 average of about 25. The disparity has fueled investor concerns, with global markets dipping in November amid fears of an AI bubble.“AI is a deeply profound technology that will reshape the world. There’s not the slightest doubt about that,” he said. He pointed to AI’s potential in healthcare, education, and agriculture, areas where his foundation is actively investing.Despite all these concerns, Gates has reaffirmed his belief in the transformative potential of AI. He also described it as “a deeply profound technology that will reshape the world,” with applications across health, education, and agriculture.“Is this profound and real and is going to provide all of these benefits? Absolutely, nobody should have any doubt about that,” Gates said. As 2026 approaches, Gates’ vision is clear: AI must be used not just to drive profits, but to deliver tangible benefits for humanity.",Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has once again cautioned that many artificial intelligence companies with very-high valuations will not survive in what he described as a “hyper competitive” industry.

Roblox confirms it contacted Russian Communications watchdog

Why Roblox is banned





US gaming platform Roblox said it is prepared to change some of its features in Russia, reports news agency Reuters. This comes as the company seeks to reverse a ban imposed earlier this month by Russian Communications watchdog Roskomnadzor citing safety concerns. As per the report, Roskomnadzor said the company has now reached out to discuss compliance with Russian regulations.Interfax news agency quoted the watchdog saying “If this isn't just a statement, but a genuine willingness on the platform to change its approach to ensuring children's safety online, then Roskomnadzor will interact with the platform as it does with any other service that complies with Russian law”.In a statement to Reuters, a Roblox spokesperson said it was ready “to temporarily limit communication features in Russia and to revise our content moderation processes to address the legal requirements necessary to restore our community’s access to the platform”.""Roblox intends to continue dialogue with Roskomnadzor as access to the platform is restored, including discussions around additional compliance measures that may be considered over time,"" the spokesperson added.Roskomnadzor said Roblox had promised to take the necessary measures ""to remove destructive and dangerous information and prevent criminal activity and user communications on the platform"".The Roblox spokesperson said: ""Roblox is deeply committed to the safety of our users, with a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent harmful content on our platform.""Russia is not the only country that has banned Roblox. The gaming platform has been banned by several countries including Iraq and Turkey over child safety. The countries have expressed concerns about predators exploiting the platform to abuse children.Russian officials say the ban is meant to protect against what they describe as an “information war” from Western countries and culture that undermines traditional Russian values.",US gaming platform Roblox said it is prepared to change some of its features in Russia.

Despite leading Nvidia to become the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation, CEO Jensen Huang admits he operates in constant anxiety, working every single day including holidays. His fears may be justified—this week alone, Nvidia lost $250 billion in market value after reports emerged that Meta is in advanced talks to buy billions worth of competing chips from Google , threatening the chipmaker's decade-long dominance in AI hardware.""The phrase '30 days from going out of business'—I've used for 33 years,"" Huang revealed on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. ""The feeling doesn't change. The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity—it doesn't leave you.""Huang's anxiety isn't unfounded paranoia—it's scar tissue from survival. In the mid-1990s, Nvidia discovered fatal flaws in its first graphics chip while developing technology for Sega's gaming console. With funds evaporating, Huang flew to Japan for an excruciating conversation: he told Sega's CEO the product wouldn't work and the deal must end, but simultaneously begged for the final $5 million payment to prevent bankruptcy.Remarkably, Sega converted it into an investment, giving Nvidia the lifeline that eventually built a trillion-dollar empire.That near-collapse experience now fuels Huang's relentless schedule. He wakes at 4 a.m. daily to read ""several thousand emails,"" works seven days a week without exception—""including Thanksgiving, Christmas""—and admits he's ""always in a state of anxiety."" His motivation? ""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed. Failure drives me more than greed.""Huang's paranoia might be wisdom. Nvidia made the rare move of issuing a public defense after The Information reported that Meta—planning up to $72 billion in AI spending this year—is negotiating massive purchases of Google's tensor processing units (TPUs). The news triggered a 6% stock plunge, erasing roughly $250 billion in value, while Alphabet shares surged 4%.""Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry—it's the only platform that runs every AI model,"" the company declared on X, breaking its usual silence on competitors. But Google's latest Gemini 3 AI model, trained entirely on TPUs rather than Nvidia chips, is being hailed by industry leaders as potentially superior. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff publicly announced he's switching from ChatGPT after three years, calling Gemini 3 the better product.The threat is existential to Nvidia's 90% market share in AI accelerators. If Google captures even a fraction of the hundreds of billions being spent on AI processors—particularly from customers like Meta—it would represent the first serious crack in Nvidia's dominance.Huang's work ethic has infected his family: both his children, Madison and Spencer, now in their thirties, work at Nvidia after joining as interns in 2020 and 2022. ""Now we have three people working every day,"" Huang said.For a CEO who never stopped running scared despite building a $4.5-trillion empire, the market turmoil caused by Google likely only confirmed what he's believed for 33 years: you're always 30 days from going out of business.","Jensen Huang is the CEO of Nvidia, the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation.

How to apply for e-passport





The Ministry of External Affairs rolled out e-passport service under the Passport Seva Programme (PSP V2.0). With the new system, the government aims to facilitate faster, more secure, and smooth travel for all Indian passport holders. While the existing ones remain valid till their expiry, anyone applying for a passport will get a chip-enabled passport by default, irrespective of whether they apply in India or abroad.As explained by the external affairs ministry in a press release, the e-Passport is a hybrid passport that combines both paper and electronic elements. It features an embedded Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip and an antenna, which store and secure the holder’s data in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards.Critical information printed on the data page is also stored electronically on the chip, enabling enhanced security and authentication, the ministry says. Going forward, all newly issued passports will be e-Passports, while existing non-electronic passports will remain valid until their expiry, it added.As mentioned above, any Indian citizen who is eligible for a regular passport can apply for e-passport.The process of applying for an e-passport is the same as that of applying for a regular passport. Applicants are required to first register on the official Passport Seva portal using their personal details. After completing the registration, they must fill in the online application form carefully and pay the prescribed fee through the available payment options.Once the payment is completed, applicants are required to book an appointment at a nearby Passport Seva Kendra or Post Office Passport Seva Kendra, based on their location and slot availability. On the scheduled date, the applicant must visit the selected centre in person for document verification.During the appointment, biometric details of the applicant are captured. This includes taking fingerprints and a photograph, which are used for identity verification and are later embedded securely into the e-passport’s electronic chip.After the verification process is completed and the application is cleared, the e-passport is printed with the embedded chip that stores the holder’s biometric and personal details. The finished e-passport is then dispatched and delivered to the applicant’s registered residential address through the postal system.","The Ministry of External Affairs rolled out e-passport service under the Passport Seva Programme (PSP V2.0) The new system aims to facilitate faster, more secure, and smooth travel for all Indian passport holders.

Jamie Dimon, CEO of America’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase CEO has once again warned that artificial intelligence (AI) will eliminate jobs in the long run. Speaking in an interview with Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures, Dimon urged workers to focus on human skills such as critical thinking, emotional intelligence and communication to stay relevant in the future workforce. He said individuals should build skills that machines cannot easily copy. These include problem-solving, emotional understanding, creativity, and clear communication.Jamie Dimon said that while companies have been cautious about hiring in recent months, this slowdown is not being driven by AI. He also said he does not expect the technology to cause large job losses in the immediate future.“For the most part, AI is going to do great stuff for mankind, like tractors did, like fertilizers did, like vaccines did,” Dimon said during the interview. “You know, maybe one day we’ll be working less hard but having wonderful lives.”At the same time, Jamie Dimon stressed that AI will eventually replace some jobs and that people must prepare for this shift. Notably, this is not the first time Dimon has warned about AI eliminating jobs. He has previously warned that automation will change the nature of work. In November 2025, Dimon said AI could help people in developed countries move toward a much shorter workweek of around three-and-a-half days over the next 20 to 40 years.Dimon also said that AI must be regulated properly to limit its risks, just as earlier technologies were brought under rules to protect society. He said both governments and companies have a shared responsibility to manage the impact of AI on workers.“We—government and we the companies, society—should look at how do we phase it in a way that we don’t damage a lot of people,” he said. He pointed to past examples where factory closures hurt entire towns and said better support could have reduced the damage. “You can retrain people, relocate people, income assistance, early retirement,” he added.While warning about future job losses, Dimon also said AI is already creating new jobs in the short term. He said the growth of AI requires large investments in infrastructure, including construction work and fibre-optic networks, which will generate employment.","Jamie Dimon, CEO of America’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase CEO has once again warned that artificial intelligence will eliminate jobs in the long run.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently hinted at building data centres in space. In an interview with Fox News, Pichai said that the company is working on quantum computing, adding “in that spirit, one of our moon shots is to, how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun”.Sundar Pichai’s video from the interview was shared by X (formerly Twitter) user - Bourbon Capital in an online post. It caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who replied to the post with a single word. “Interesting”, Musk wrote.“At Google, we are always proud of taking moon shots,” Pichai said, adding “... Waymo … has been over a decade in the making.”“We're working on quantum computing, in that spirit, one of our moon shots is to, how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun,” he continued.Pichai further said that the company wants to “put these data centers in space closer to the sun”, and will take “first step in 2027”.“We'll send tiny racks of machines and have them in satellites, test them out, and then start scaling from there. But there's no doubt to me that a decade or so away will be viewing it as a more normal way to build data centers,” Sundar Pichai said in the interview.Notably, this echoes Musk's November 2025 announcements that SpaceX will pioneer orbital data centers using next-gen Starlink satellites, positioning them as the lowest-cost AI compute option within five years.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company is working on quantum computing.

The company emphasized that its India website is not yet live and is not accepting orders.

Elon Musk’s Starlink To Begin Trials in India

Starlink’s residential connection includes 30-day trial and plug-and-play setup to cost Rs 34,000

SpaceX Gateway network to span across six cities, and Bengaluru office expands





Starlink has officially denied that Indian pricing, calling the incident a technical glitch rather than an intentional reveal. Lauren Dreyer, Vice President of Starlink Business Operations, clarified in a post on X that the company's India website is not yet live and is not accepting orders.She explained that a configuration error caused internal dummy test data to briefly appear publicly, which was quickly corrected once discovered. Dreyer emphasized that Starlink has not announced official pricing for India and any figures currently circulating online are inaccurate. The company remains focused on obtaining final government approvals before launching service in the country, and both the website and ordering system will stay inactive until the regulatory process is complete.Elon Musk's Starlink has revealed the residential satellite internet pricing for India at Rs 8,600 monthly, plus a Rs 34,000 hardware kit, as the SpaceX subsidiary prepares for commercial operations. The service targets households in remote and underserved areas with promises of unlimited data, 99.9% uptime, and weather-resistant connectivity where traditional broadband infrastructure fails to reach.Following regulatory clearance from the Department of Telecommunications in July, Starlink is positioning itself to challenge established players Jio-SES and Eutelsat OneWeb in India's satellite communications sector.The residential plan, priced at a monthly subscription cost of Rs 8,600 offers unlimited data without usage caps or throttling, addressing critical connectivity gaps in rural regions. Starlink's system requires minimal installation effort, with users simply powering on equipment and pointing it skyward to establish connections. However, the hardware kit will cost customers Rs 34,000, which the company says is a one time fees. The company guarantees over 99.9% uptime and all-weather functionality, crucial features for areas experiencing frequent service disruptions.New customers receive a 30-day trial period, allowing households to evaluate performance before long-term commitment. This trial provision acknowledges the premium pricing structure, which places Starlink among India's higher-cost broadband options despite targeting underserved markets.Business subscription pricing remains unannounced, with enterprise-focused plans expected as commercial rollout advances.Starlink is deploying gateway earth stations across Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, and Noida to enable satellite-to-ground communications. These relay installations are essential for maintaining low-latency connections and service reliability across India's varied geography.The company posted four specialist positions at its Bengaluru office in October, recruiting talent in payments, accounting, treasury, and tax operations as part of infrastructure expansion. This direct-to-consumer strategy distinguishes Starlink from competitors concentrating on enterprise clients, potentially reshaping internet accessibility in regions where fiber deployment remains economically unviable.","Elon Musk’s Starlink To Begin Trials in India. residential connection includes 30-day trial and plug-and-play setup to cost Rs 34,000 per month.

Elon Musk prefers keeping his companies private and Tesla lesson



Analysts says Elon Musk’s ventures have hit ‘private market ceiling’







Elon Musk has not officially confirmed plans for a SpaceX IPO in 2026, yet analysts have already begun speculating about what may have driven the Tesla CEO to take his aerospace company public. Musk, already the world's richest person, recently reached another historic milestone by becoming the first individual to achieve a net worth of $600 billion. Forbes attributed this surge to reports that SpaceX is considering going public at a valuation of $800 billion. However, an IPO would subject the company to intense regulatory scrutiny and shareholder pressures contrary to Musk's preference of keeping the autonomy of private ownership.According to a report by Fortune, if SpaceX goes public, it will rake in billions and will be subjected to scrutiny, criticism and regulatory hurdles. Musk has a bunch of private companies: Neuralink, xAI and the Boring Company. The first thing he did after buying Twitter was to take it private. Keeping his companies private helps Musk run his businesses the way he likes and without much public scrutiny.Only Tesla is a public company that has attracted scrutiny time and again.In 2018, he famously tweeted he was considering taking Tesla private in 2018 and that led to an SEC investigation and litigation with shareholders. The Tesla board also pressured Musk to step away from DOGE and focus on his company.SpaceX has already secured more private capital than nearly any company in history, the report said, raising over $10 billion, Fortune cited PitchBook as saying. However, private markets have limitations.PitchBook emerging technology analyst Ali Javaheri said that in privately-owned firms, about $2 trillion to $3 trillion in capital remains available for deployment, however, global public equity markets hold between $100 trillion and $150 trillion“SpaceX has effectively hit the ceiling of what private markets can support.

World’s smallest programmable robots enter the microbial world



Source: University of Michigan News

How these tiny robots swim without moving parts



How light and nano-computers give these robots intelligence



How microscopic robots sense temperature and move together







Robots have officially stepped into a domain that was once reserved for microbes. The United States researchers unveiled the world's smallest fully programmable, autonomous robots so small that they can easily perch on a fingertip without being noticed. Made possible with a collaboration between the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Michigan, this microscopic robot swims through liquid, detects temperature changes, makes simple decisions, operates continuously for several months in power from light alone, despite its infinitesimal dimensions, representing a big leap for robotics because it combines motion, sensing, and computation at an unprecedented scale. Beyond the technical leap, the finding opens up new opportunities for medicine, environmental monitoring, and micromanufacturing, domains where machines must work unobtrusively, collaboratively, and independently in places humans simply cannot reach.For decades, robotics research has advanced steadily in size and intelligence, yet the challenge of shrinking robots to the scale of bacteria had not been solved.Electronics got smaller, but true robotic behaviour, autonomous movement, sensing, and decision-making were hard to realise at microscopic scales. Measuring about 0.2 by 0.3 by 0.05 millimetres in size, the newly developed robots fall squarely within the microbial world. This means that at such a scale, water acts less as a fluid and more like a thick gel, which renders traditional swimming or propulsion systems useless. The Penn-led team succeeded in engineering motion at tiny scales, enabling these robots to move reliably in liquid environments. It effectively opens an entirely new category of robotics, where machines can function in biological and chemical spaces previously inaccessible to technology.Perhaps the most remarkable thing about these robots is that they can swim without propellers, joints, or any moving parts whatsoever. At microscopic length scales, mechanical motion becomes inefficient and prone to breakage. Instead of pushing against the water, the robots move the fluid around them. The robots run a small electric field that gently nudges charged ions in the surrounding liquid. When ions budged, they took water molecules nearby with them, creating thrust that propelled the robot forward. This clever form of electrokinetic propulsion allows the robots to move smoothly through fluid while staying very durable. With no mechanical wear and tear, the robots could operate for months at a time and easily be manipulated using laboratory tools, like micropipettes, which make them practical for real-world microscale applications.Intelligence on this scale was enabled by ultra-miniaturised computers developed at the University of Michigan. These microprocessors run on just 75 nanowatts of power, about 100,000 times less than a smart watch. To achieve that, engineers had to rethink entirely how software works. The normal computing instructions were compressed into super-efficient commands designed specifically to move and sense. Most of each robot's surface is smothered in miniature solar cells, which harness light for power while also serving as receivers for optical signals. Light pulses not only keep the robot going but also program it. Each robot bears a unique identifier, which allows researchers to address individual machines in a group, even while they're swimming.Far from passive devices, these robots boast a temperature-sensitive sensor that can detect minute changes in temperature of as little as one-third of a degree Celsius. In response to heat, the robots swim where it is warmer or otherwise signal changes through distinctive movements. The researchers liken this activity to the ""waggle dance"" used by honeybees to communicate. Operating en masse, the robots can coordinate their motion, moving in whiplash patterns similar to schooling fish. Such collective behaviour foreshadows swarms of microscopic robots able to map temperature changes in real time, detect chemical gradients, or monitor biological environments-all by their own devices after being deployed. Why these microscopic robots could change medicine and industryThe implications of this breakthrough go far beyond the lab: because each robot costs about a penny to manufacture and can run on its own for long periods, enormous swarms of them could be deployed simultaneously. In medicine, future versions might navigate bodily fluids to monitor temperature, deliver medication or detect early signs of disease. In environmental science, they could track subtle changes in water quality or temperature far beyond what current sensors can manage.","World’s smallest programmable robots enter the microbial world.

What USTR said to EU about its regulations against American tech companies

What EU said about US warning

“Our rules apply equally and fairly to all companies operating in the EU. We will continue to enforce our rules fairly and without discrimination.”

“continue to engage”





The US is ‘not happy’ with the European Union ’s (EU) strict rules against major tech companies. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has warned the EU that it will impose sanctions on European tech companies if the bloc continues its current regulatory approach toward American technology giants. In a post shared on the micro-blogging site X (formerly Twitter), USTR officials specifically named Spotify, SAP, Siemens and other companies as potential targets for reciprocal measures in response to what they described as discriminatory taxes, fines, and lawsuits affecting corporations such as Google , Apple, and Meta.The US trade agency stated that it is prepared to enact fees and restrictions on service providers to counter European policies. Washington contends that while European entities operate without hindrance in the United States, American businesses face harassment and a lack of meaningful engagement from Brussels regarding regulatory disputes.This ultimatum complicates ongoing efforts to establish a trade framework between the two governments. The Trump administration has hinted that it will escalate pressure to secure a reduction in oversight from European regulators, signalling a departure from previous diplomatic attempts to resolve the friction.In the X post, USTR wrote: “The European Union and certain EU Member States have persisted in a continuing course of discriminatory and harassing lawsuits, taxes, fines, and directives against U.S. service providers. U.S. services companies provide substantial free services to EU citizens and reliable enterprise services to EU companies, and they support millions of jobs and more than $100 billion in direct investment in Europe. The United States has raised concerns with the EU for years on these matters without meaningful engagement or basic acknowledgement of U.S. concerns.In stark contrast, EU service providers have been able to operate freely in the United States for decades, benefitting from access to our market and consumers on a level playing field. Some of the largest EU service providers that have hitherto enjoyed this expansive market access include, among others:— Accenture— Amadeus— Capgemini— DHL— Mistral— Publicis— SAP— Siemens— SpotifyIf the EU and EU Member States insist on continuing to restrict, limit, and deter the competitiveness of U.S. service providers through discriminatory means, the United States will have no choice but to begin using every tool at its disposal to counter these unreasonable measures. Should responsive measures be necessary, U.S. law permits the assessment of fees or restrictions on foreign services, among other actions. The United States will take a similar approach to other countries that pursue an EU-style strategy in this area.”Responding to the X post, Thomas Regnier, a spokesman for the European Commission, said to the New York Times:He also noted that the EU willwith the United States on implementing their trade agreement.This comes after European authorities recently hinted at their willingness to reduce specific tech regulations to support economic growth and the development of AI. However, EU officials have shown less flexibility in modifying key rules concerning social media and anticompetitive practices, which are frequently the focus of American objections.Earlier this month, US President Trump and other American officials criticised the bloc for the regulators' decision to fine Elon Musk's X with almost $140 million for violating digital transparency rules. An ongoing separate investigation of X in the EU could also result in additional fines and penalties.","US Trade Representative (USTR) has warned the EU that it will impose sanctions on European tech companies if the bloc continues its current regulatory approach toward American technology giants.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI issued ‘Code Red’ after Google launched the Gemini 3.0 AI model.

“misleading”

“inadequate,”

“significant risks and costs”

“full backstop”

“it does not, and never has.”

""superior, more certain value.”

Read the full letter Warner Bros Discovery board sent to its shareholders

“Dear Fellow Shareholders,

As your Board of Directors, we are committed to acting in your best interest. In this spirit, in October, we launched a public review of strategic alternatives to maximise shareholder value. This followed three separate proposals from Paramount Skydance (“PSKY”), as well as interest from multiple other parties.

That thorough process, overseen by the Board with the assistance of independent financial and legal advisors, as well as our management team, led to the company entering into a merger agreement with Netflix on December 4, with the substantial benefits to WBD shareholders described below. Having failed to submit the best proposal for you, our shareholders, PSKY launched an offer nearly identical to its most recently rejected proposal.

As a Board, we have now conducted another review and determined that PSKY’s tender offer remains inferior to the Netflix merger. The Board continues to unanimously recommend the Netflix merger, and that you reject the PSKY offer and not tender your shares.

Below, and in more detail in our 14D-9 filing, we highlight the many reasons for the Board’s determination. None of these reasons will be a surprise to PSKY given our clear, and oft-repeated, feedback on their six prior proposals.

The terms of the Netflix merger are superior. The PSKY offer provides inadequate value and imposes numerous, significant risks and costs on WBD.

The value we have secured for shareholders through the Netflix merger is extraordinary by any measure.

Our agreement with Netflix gives WBD shareholders $23.25 in cash, plus $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock (based on a collar range of $97.91 - $119.67 in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing), plus the additional value of the shares of Discovery Global and the opportunity to participate in future potential upside following Discovery Global’s separation from WBD.

The entire Board is confident in our recommendation that Netflix represents the best value-creating path for shareholders.

PSKY has consistently misled WBD shareholders that its proposed transaction has a “full backstop” from the Ellison family. It does not, and never has.

PSKY’s most recent proposal includes a $40.65 billion equity commitment, for which there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind. Instead, they propose that you rely on an unknown and opaque revocable trust for the certainty of this crucial deal funding.

Despite having been told repeatedly by WBD how important a full and unconditional financing commitment from the Ellison family was – and despite their own ample resources, as well as multiple assurances by PSKY during our strategic review process that such a commitment was forthcoming – the Ellison family has chosen not to backstop the PSKY offer.

And a revocable trust is no replacement for a secured commitment by a controlling stockholder.

The assets and liabilities of the trust are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change. As the name indicates, revocable trusts typically have provisions allowing for assets to be moved at any time. And the documents provided by PSKY for this conditional commitment contain gaps, loopholes and limitations that put you, our shareholders, and our company at risk.

Amplifying the concerns about the credibility of the equity commitment being offered by PSKY, the revocable trust and PSKY have agreed that the trust’s liability for damages, even in the case of a willful breach, would be capped at 7% of its commitment ($2.8 billion on a $108.4 billion transaction).

Of course, the damage to WBD and its stockholders were the trust or PSKY to breach their obligations to close a transaction would likely be many multiples of this amount.

WBD’s merger agreement with Netflix is a binding agreement with enforceable commitments, with no need for any equity financing and robust debt commitments. The Netflix merger is fully backed by a public company with a market cap in excess of $400 billion with an investment grade balance sheet.

The debt financing for the PSKY bid relies on an unsecure revocable trust commitment as well as the credit worthiness of a $15 billion market cap company with a credit rating at or only a notch above “junk” status from the two leading rating agencies.

The financial condition and creditworthiness of PSKY, which, if its proposed transaction were to close, would have a high gross leverage ratio of 6.8x 2026E debt to EBITDA with virtually no current free cash flow generation before synergies, raise substantial risks for its acquisition of WBD.

Such debt levels reflect a risky capital structure that is vulnerable to even potentially small changes in the PSKY or WBD business between signing and closing.

Additionally, PSKY contemplates $9 billion in synergies from the mergers of Paramount/Skydance and their offer for WBD. These targets are both ambitious from an operational perspective and would make Hollywood weaker, not stronger.

The Board’s review was full, transparent and competitive – establishing a level playing field that fostered a rigorous and fair process.

The Board repeatedly engaged with all parties, including extensive engagement with PSKY and its advisors over the course of nearly three months. We held dozens of calls and meetings with its principals and advisors including four in-person meetings and meals between David Zaslav and David and/or

Larry Ellison

and provided multiple opportunities for PSKY to offer a proposal that was superior to those of the other bidders, which PSKY never did.

After each bid, we informed PSKY of the material deficiencies and offered potential solutions. Despite this feedback, PSKY has never submitted a proposal that is superior to the Netflix merger agreement.

Despite PSKY’s media statements to the contrary, the Board does not believe there is a material difference in regulatory risk between the PSKY offer and the Netflix merger.

The Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the PSKY offer with its regulatory advisors.

The Board believes that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material. The Board also notes that Netflix has agreed to a record-setting regulatory termination cash fee of $5.8 billion, significantly higher than PSKY’s $5 billion break fee.

The PSKY offer is illusory.

The offer can be terminated or amended by PSKY at any time prior to its completion; it is not the same thing as a binding merger agreement.

The first paragraph of the offer states it is “subject to the conditions set forth in this offer to purchase (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time)” and continues on the next page, “we reserve the right to amend the Offer in any respect (including amending the Offer Price)”.

In addition, the offer is not capable of being completed by its current expiration date, due to the need for, among other things, global regulatory approvals, which PSKY indicates may take 12-18 months.

Nothing in this structure offers WBD shareholders any deal certainty.

The PSKY offer provides an untenable degree of risk and potential downside for WBD shareholders.

There will be additional costs associated with PSKY’s offer that could impact shareholders.

When considering the PSKY offer at this juncture, it is important to note that its acceptance could incur significant additional costs to shareholders – all of which PSKY has ignored in their communications.

WBD would have to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee, which PSKY has not offered to reimburse. In addition, WBD would incur approximately $1.5 billion in financing costs if we do not complete our planned debt exchange as agreed to with certain of our debtholders, which would not be permitted by the PSKY offer.

This additional $4.3 billion in potential costs represents approximately $1.66 per share to be borne by WBD shareholders if the offer does not close.

We look forward to moving ahead with our combination with Netflix and delivering the compelling and certain value it will create for shareholders. We urge you to carefully read the 14D-9 filed with the SEC this morning and available on our website, which more fully details the strategic review process and the Board’s reasons for its recommendation to you.

Sincerely,

The Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors”





Warner Bros Discovery’s (WBD) board of directors have unanimously rejected a $108 billion hostile takeover bid bid worth $108 billion from Paramount Skydance.

In the letter, WBD's board of directors also warned shareholders that Paramount Skydance is being deceitful when it says it enjoys afrom the Ellison family, when in reality, as it said,This comes after Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners withdrew from the Paramount Corporation's bid group. The Paramount Corporation bid is still backed by $24 billion from the Gulf states. This is in addition to $1 billion from China's Tencent and a collaboration agreement with Redbird Capital Partners.

The acquisition involves the film and television production entities owned by Warner Bros, including HBO and HBO Max, but does not include Discovery Global. The board of directors is then pursuing the Netflix merger with a total equity price of $72 billion due to its more reliable path to stockholder returns.In the letter sent to WBD’s shareholders, the company’s board of directors wrote:",Warner Bros Discovery board sent a letter to its shareholders on December 4.

Anti-aging influencer Bryan Johnson targets immortality by 2039; explains why AI is the reason,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/anti-aging-influencer-bryan-johnson-targets-immortality-by-2039-explains-why-ai-is-the-reason/articleshow/126038214.cms,"Johnson explains why AI will be the reason for the immortality target



AI-driven biomarker measurement creates a closed-loop system for tracking and improving longevity interventions.

Organ cloning experiments—Johnson says he is growing thousands of his own organ samples in dishes—will allow drugs to be tested safely and rapidly.

He believes AI’s accelerated innovation makes 2039 a realistic deadline for achieving immortality.

Read Byran Johnson’s complete post here

I’m going to try and achieve immortality by 2039.

One year of time passes and I remain the same biological age.

I invite you to join me.

The search for the fountain of youth is the oldest story ever told. It’s been the dream of dreamers for millennia but always painfully out of reach.

For the first time in the history of life on earth, in just the past 24 months, the window has opened for a conscious being to realistically strive for this goal.

It is an absolutely insane moment.

We currently do not know how 2039 immortality will be achieved. There are new, promising therapies that can turn back the clock decades, but they’re buggy. Sometimes they mistakenly cause cancer. We gotta fix that.

But we know immortality is possible because nature has already solved it. This isn’t a physics problem like trying to travel faster than the speed of light, it’s a biological engineering problem that evolution has cracked multiple times.

The freshwater hydra constantly regenerates its own cells and doesn’t succumb to senescence. It is effectively ageless. The ""immortal jellyfish"" (Turritopsis dohrnii) can revert its cells back to a youthful state and restart its life cycle indefinitely. Lobsters produce an especially active form of an enzyme called telomerase that preserves their telomeres and keeps their DNA from degrading as they age. We need to port the software to humans.

2039 is a reasonable target because of the accelerated, AI-driven rate of innovation. AI is morphing from assistant to scientist. It is powering current researchers with previously unimagined capabilities to enhance discovery and development.

That, coupled with enhanced biomarker measurement, creates a closed-loop system of improvement that will speed things up dramatically.

This is what I’ve been doing for six years. As crude as longevity technology is today, the improvements I’ve personally seen are stunning.

I started as a worn-down, inflamed, aged 42 year old who’d broken himself on the rocks of American food slop and entrepreneurship martyrdom. Six years later, my body largely operates at elite 18 year old levels. That includes my cardiovascular system, fertility, strength, and hormones.

Not all is well though. I have mild to moderate hearing loss in my left ear that we can’t fix and my brain is anatomically age 42 (I’m 48).

Still, unreal results.

My team and I did this by following the scientific method. We measured the biological age of every organ. We referenced the best scientific evidence on how to slow aging and rejuvenate. We methodically completed these protocols and measured again. Rinse and repeat.

We could do so much more and faster if we had better measurement and better therapies. Both of which are cooking all over the world right now.

To speed things up now, I’m currently having thousands of Bryan Johnson organ clones built in a dish. This will allow me to test drugs and other molecules against my biology to accelerate learning and save my body from potential mishaps.

Yes, we’ll make mistakes. Hopefully they won’t be fatal. And of course there’s always bad luck to contend with. But I trust in fate and I believe that destiny is going to grant the human race the pleasure of achieving the ultimate: immortality.

While immortality would certainly be cool, the real (secret) objective is to focus our collective attention on a positive goal. Something that helps us feel hope and excitement for the future. I personally love the idea of having a child-like mind, 18-year-old physical vibrancy, and a lifetime of wisdom.

This 2039 goal is as much about AI as it is about us humans. It’s about how we survive giving birth to superintelligence.

It’s kind of a big deal. We haven’t done it before. A lot can go wrong.

I figure that one of the best ways to improve the probability that we build safe AI, and don’t kill each other in the meantime, is to transform our shared aspirations from yolo to don’t die.

Right now, we are a suicidal species. We do all kinds of really primitive shit. We unnecessarily kill ourselves with what we eat and how we live our lives. Companies make profits from killing other people with their products.

We trash the only home we have. We celebrate these things as virtue. It’s really fucked up and backward. Soon enough we’ll realize just how infantile we are right now.

The 2039 goal points us in the right direction.

To say yes to life and no to death. Defiance even.

If you’re interested in doing this with me, I’ll continue to share everything I do for free. I’m also going to build this out in Blueprint. We’ll help you do exactly what I’m doing, at a fraction of the cost and effort, alongside an aligned and motivated community.

I think this is the coolest goal imaginable. I find it hard to believe that of all the people who’ve lived, it’s us who get the opportunity to have this moment.

I pray that we have the courage to appreciate the sacredness of our existence. I pray that we will be brave enough to defend her amidst the onslaught of all the forces that would try to end her.

We don’t know, but we may be the only intelligent life to exist in our corner of the galaxy. I pray we will be warriors, caretakers and stewards of existence and honor the gift that has been bestowed on us.





Tech entrepreneur and anti-aging influencer Bryan Johnson has now announced that his most ambitious target of achieving biological immortality can be achieved by 2039. In a long post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Johnson explained that artificial intelligence will be the key driver of this radical vision, accelerating breakthroughs in biotechnology and anti-aging therapies. Johnson, who has become known for his “Blueprint” anti-aging regimen, claimed that despite another year passing, his biological age has not advanced. He described this as proof that science is beginning to make the once-mythical “fountain of youth” attainable. “For the first time in the history of life on earth, the window has opened for a conscious being to realistically strive for this goal,” Johnson wrote.Johnson believes that AI is evolving from assistant to scientist, allowing researchers to find out and test therapies at unsaid speed.",Bryan Johnson says he will try to achieve immortality by 2039.

A Texas project tied to OpenAI and Oracle could use electricity equivalent to 750,000 homes.

Another Meta site could match the needs of 1.2 million households.





US senator Bernie Sanders has once again escalated his criticism of the artificial intelligence boom and has asked for a halt on new AI data center construction. Sanders has also accused the tech billionaires including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates for driving the AI expansion for “dangerous reasons. ” In a video posted on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Sanders warned that AI and robotics are growing faster than the society can adapt.“AI and Robotics are the most transformative technologies in the history of humanity,” he said, cautioning they will affect “every man, woman and child” in the country.Sanders singled out Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Peter Thiel, and other tech leaders, arguing they are pushing AI to consolidate wealth and power rather than protect working families. “These very, very rich men are not losing sleep over job losses or inequality,” he added.Sanders also echoed the warnings from tech leaders that AI could displace millions of jobs. Sanders asked, “If AI and robotics eliminate millions of jobs and create massive unemployment, how will people survive if they have no income?” He also raised concerns about children becoming socially isolated and emotionally dependent on AI instead of human relationships.Sanders also raised concerns about AI’s impact on human relationships, noting that teenagers increasingly rely on AI companions. “If kids today have AI as their best friends… what kind of change does that mean for humanity?”Sanders also warned about the cooperation between AI companies and the U.S. military could erode privacy. “How far away are we from a small number of people having access to the email that you’ve sent out, every phone call that you’ve been on, really every aspect of your life? We’re not far.”Sanders’ moratorium call zeroes in on the massive electricity demands of AI infrastructure.Experts estimate data centers already account for 5% of U.S. electricity use, a figure expected to rise sharply as AI adoption accelerates. Sanders warned taxpayers could ultimately bear the burden of subsidizing these projects.","US senator Bernie Sanders has escalated his criticism of the artificial intelligence boom.

‘Video training method incapable of teaching touch’



Future of robotics will different than what is predicted: Rodney Brooks







Rodney Brooks, the roboticist who co-founded iRobot, has issued a warning: The vision of humanoid robots as catchall assistants is “pure fantasy thinking”. This comes as investors pour billions into the race to build human-like machines and Tesla CEO Elon Musk envisions that the company’s “Optimus robots will be able to play the piano and be able to thread a needle”. Brooks argues that despite the hype surrounding companies like Tesla and Figure, current technology faces a biological barrier – dexterity.According to a blog post by Brooks (spotted by Fortune), the primary reason today’s robots cannot replicate human function is their inability to master the complexity of human touch.Brooks explains the biology of the human hand, saying it is an engineering marvel that contains 17,000 low-threshold mechanoreceptors which pick up light touches and become denser toward the fingertips. Brooks says artificial intelligence (AI) has successfully mastered speech recognition and image processing due to vast available datasets, but sensing touch cannot be learnt through datasets.“We do not have such a tradition for touch data. Today’s humanoid robots will not learn how to be dexterous despite the hundreds of millions, or perhaps many billions of dollars, being donated by VCs and major tech companies to pay for their training,” Brooks wrote.Brooks took aim at the training methodologies employed by Musk’s Tesla and the AI-robotics company Figure, saying that the use of videos in which humans are performing tasks to train their robots will not translate into physical dexterity.“If the big tech companies and the VCs throwing their money at large-scale humanoid training spent only 20% as much but gave it all to university researchers, I tend to think they would get closer to their goals more quickly,” Brooks stated.Brooks contradicted Musk’s prediction that Tesla will start selling its Optimus robots by 2026 by saying that in 15 years, successful robots will look nothing like people but will likely sport wheels, multiple arms and possibly five-fingered hands, even if the industry continues to market them as “humanoid.”“A lot of money will have disappeared, spent on trying to squeeze performance, any performance, from today’s humanoid robots. But those robots will be long gone and mostly conveniently forgotten,” he predicted.","Rodney Brooks, the roboticist who co-founded iRobot, has issued a warning: The vision of humanoid robots as catchall assistants is “pure fantasy thinking” Brooks argues that despite the hype surrounding companies like Tesla and Figure, current technology faces a biological barrier – dexterity.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126037371,imgsize-111478,width-400,resizemode-4/man-and-robot.jpg"

Tesla bull Ross Gerber has been a longtime Tesla supporter and it has once again made some candid remarks about CEO Elon Musk . Speaking at the Chasing Finance podcast, Gerber said, “I’m not a fan of Elon. But I’m not going to deny the fact he builds great products.” Gerber who is the co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki wealth and Investment Management has often been seen as one the Tesla’s most vocal bulls. Yet in recent months, he has grown increasingly critical of Musk’s leadership.In November, Gerber blasted Tesla for spending money to promote Musk’s $1 trillion compensation package, even as the company struggled to sell cars. Large investors, including Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, opposed the pay plan, citing dilution risks and Musk’s outsized influence. Despite his frustrations, Gerber acknowledged Musk’s relentless work ethic and ability to build companies that command investor premiums. “He’s built some big companies and he’s succeeded,” Gerber said.Gerber conceded that many investors continue to back Musk because of his track record and vision.“There’s a lot of people who have a belief that Elon’s robots are the future,” he said. “And they’re willing to invest at a massive premium based on Elon’s ability to execute.”Gerber Kawasaki co-founder and Tesla Bull Ross Gerber recently shared a post on X, slamming the Tesla board who, he alleges it of acting solely for CEO Elon Musk’s interests. Gerber remarks come as the electric car maker’s crucial annual general meeting (AGM) approaches on November 6. During the AGM, the company is expected to reach a decision on Musk’s $1 trillion compensation package, one of the largest in corporate history.In the post, Gerber wrote: “I’ve never seen a worse BOD than tesla. It's so transparent that they all represent Elons interests and zero representation of the other 85% of the company. It's absurd to basically give Elon Musk $1 trillion of teslas shareholder value for a set of arbitrary goals. Based around a threat to leave too.”In September this year, the Tesla board proposed a $1 trillion compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk. The newly proposed award is roughly 18 times the size of the 2018 pay package.","Gerber Kawasaki co-founder and Tesla Bull Ross Gerber slammed the Tesla board who, he alleges it of acting solely for CEO Elon Musk's interests.

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.He warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft’s AI CEO, said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things that Copilot can’t do’ He also said Copilot is ‘amazing for vision.

From Clinic to Crop: How AI solutions built in India are going global,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/from-clinic-to-crop-how-ai-solutions-built-in-india-are-going-global/articleshow/126034070.cms,"“We [Google] are really doing a lot of work in making AI truly inclusive and our team in India does a lot of work. Our mission at Google DeepMind is to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity,” Dr.

Manish Gupta

, senior director at Google DeepMind, told The Times of India.

“Being in India, where so much of humanity resides, we take that humanity part very seriously. We do a lot of work in making solutions for people who speak different languages and come from different cultures. We are also doing a lot of work to ultimately make these solutions scale and more efficient so that they can serve billions of people,” he said.

“And also we are applying these AI models and capabilities to tackle societal problems, like in agriculture, health and learning. So that we can serve the hundreds of millions of people in a country like India, great benefit, and then we can take those solutions to other parts of the world,” he added.

The India advantage



“We have AI models with very powerful multi-modal capabilities, and we have these reasoning capabilities that these models are beginning to develop. And now, agentic capabilities is the next step so that we can move well beyond even just responding to questions from users. You can start to actually solve problems for users. So, this is kind of a whole new paradigm that is emerging in AI augmenting human capability and finally, what we are very heartened by, is the way in which India as a country is adopting AI to solve real world problems,” Gupta said.

“We are already seeing signs that these solutions have been developed in India first – for things like diabetic retinopathy, for skin related conditions – these solutions are developed for India, they can be taken to other parts of the world. We recently launched some of these solutions in multiple countries in Southeast Asia and have plans to take them to other parts of the world. So it’s heartening to see the kind of problem you solve for India and then, in the process you solve for the world,” he added.

“These models already provide a very very powerful foundation because they've been trained on millions of images, lots of text data, basically multi-modal data on a global level. Startups are developing stronger solutions on top of Gemma. And then, we are closely collaborating with partners to scale these solutions. And then many of them can be taken to other parts of the world,” Gupta told TOI.

Agriculture – In your language



“We have AI models with very powerful multi-modal capabilities, and we have these reasoning capabilities that these models are beginning to develop,” Gupta explains. “Agentic capabilities are the next step so that we can move well beyond even just responding to questions from users. You can start to actually solve problems for users.”

“We’ve been collecting speech data from different corners of India and the eventual goal is to collect data from each and every one of the 773 districts. So already that very diverse data that we made freely available. It covers over 110 Indian languages, and for 35 of those languages, this is the first ever speech data, for at least 22 of those languages, this is the first ever digital data,” he explained.

“So a similar approach is being taken with healthcare where our partners are now collecting data from a very rich diversity of users. For example, for skin condition, its very important for the model to be able to cover a rich diversity of colour tones. So, a lot of it really starts with collecting very rich diversity of data, and then as you build these models, you have to subject them to very rigorous testing to make them robust,” Gupta noted.

India: Land of opportunity and challenges



“There is no shortage of challenges. One is how to make these models more effective and make them even more powerful and build agents that are able to automatically kind of start exploring tougher problems,” he said.

“There's a need to make these models much more energy efficient. There is a need to make these models much more free of biases. There is a need to make these models more culturally aware, because let's say you're responding to a user in Assam. You shouldn't just respond in and think in English and simply translate that response into Assamese. You should respond to the user rooted in the cultural context of that user. So, how do you make these models understand different cultures? There's a lot of work being done in our teams,” Gupta added.

“We were amongst the first companies to formulate a set of principles for responsible AI. We’re not stopping there. We have been coming up with these things, like the frontier safety framework. We subject the model to a high level of rigor. One of the ways you do that is through things like red teaming where you have teams that are kind of tasked to attack the model in very novel ways, to do something, which is unsafe,” Gupta explained.

“We think AI is the biggest and most powerful force ever in humanity's history, it is going to be the most powerful technology enabler. Even bigger than electricity and fire,” Gupta noted.

“The way AI is augmenting human capability, it's like, there's no bounds to the kind of problems that we can solve… those intractable problems that previously we felt could not be tackled or thought of as too expensive to tackle…It's no longer a barrier. You can use the power of AI to tackle those problems,” he concluded.

Conclusion



“In India, there’s no shortage of areas in which we can help people. We have innovators developing these solutions by using AI, so there's that opportunity for India to become a global leader right from the start,” Gupta summarised.





For a past couple of years, India has served as a unique enabler for Google . Going from a massive consumer market, it quickly became something more: a laboratory for innovation born out of necessity. Tech enthusiasts remember the launch of Google Tez (now Google Pay). It was built for India, solving the problem of the payment ecosystem as India ushered on the path of becoming a digital-first economy. It worked so well that the underlying architecture influenced Google’s payment strategy globally. Similarly, “Two-wheeler mode” in Google Maps was a direct response to the chaotic, weaving traffic of Indian cities. This feature later found its way to other nations where motorbikes rule the roads.These were the “Solve for India” years. Today, however, a new and more profound shift is occurring. We are moving to ‘make in India for the world’, especially in deep-tech and artificial intelligence (AI). At the recent “Lab to Impact” dialogue in Delhi, supported by the India AI Impact Summit 2026, Google unveiled a suite of collaborations that signal this strategy.From detecting diabetic retinopathy in rural eye camps to monitoring crop health in vast agricultural belts, India is no longer just a market; it is the engine room for AI solutions that are waiting to be launched in different parts of the world.Why India? The answer lies in the complexity of the demographic. It has multiple official languages, hundreds of dialects, extreme economic disparities and a healthcare infrastructure – from world-class hospitals and under-resourced rural clinics. For an AI researcher, this is the ultimate training ground. If an AI model can accurately transcribe a spoken language, or identify a skin condition on diverse skin tones, it is robust enough to work almost anywhere.He said that the abundance of areas in which Google can help people provides an opportunity for India to become a global leader.One of the significant announcements from Google’s event involves the digitisation of Indian healthcare. In India, patient data is often trapped in paper files, handwritten prescriptions, and siloed hospital systems. This fragmentation leads to poor patient history tracking and inefficient treatment.Google is working with the National Health Authority (NHA) to deploy advanced AI capable of converting millions of these fragmented, unstructured medical records—including doctor’s scribbled clinical notes—into the international, machine-readable FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard.Furthermore, Google announced a $400,000 funding injection to build India’s Health Foundation Models using MedGemma. In a first step, startups like Ajna Lens will collaborate with the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to build models for dermatology and OPD triaging.When asked about the architecture of the India Health Foundation Models being built using MedGemma and the kind of data being used to train these models, Gupta said these models already have strong foundation and partners create AI solutions.Beyond healthcare, agriculture presents the next massive dataset for Indian AI. Google.org is providing $2 million to Wadhwani AI to develop Garuda, a new Indian language model specifically for agriculture. This model will power AgriVaani, a multilingual AI assistant that offers farmers advice on crop management and pest detection.This aligns with Gupta’s vision of the next evolution of AI: ""Agentic capabilities.""In the context of an Indian farmer, this doesn't just mean asking the AI ""What is this bug?"" It means the AI identifies the pest, assesses the weather forecast, checks the soil data, and recommends a specific, locally available remedy.However, none of this will work if the AI speaks only in English. India’s linguistic diversity provides an opportunity and for this, Google announced a $2 million contribution to establish the Indic Language Technologies Research Hub at IIT Bombay. This builds on work like Project Vani, where Google has been collecting speech data from the deepest corners of India.The ""Lab to Impact"" event underscored a strategy of deep partnership. Google.org announced $8 million in funding for four government-established AI Centers of Excellence at premier institutes like IISc Bangalore (health), IIT Kanpur (urban governance), IIT Madras (education), and IIT Ropar (agriculture).Creating from India to the world is a monumental task. While Gupta didn’t touch infrastructure problems in the Indian context, he said that the real challenge lies in making AI models and solutions more effective and efficient.When talked about the problems regarding hallucinations – a response by an AI program that appears to be accurate but that contains inaccurate or misleading information – Gupta told TOI that Google has always taken a very responsible approach to AI.While talking about the socio-economic impact of AI, or effect of AI in well-being, health, education, culture, jobs, income, businesses and infrastructure, Gupta affirmed, saying it is the biggest and most powerful technology enabler.The narrative has shifted and India is no longer just a beneficiary of technology trickling down from Silicon Valley – it is a source of sophisticated AI solutions.The solutions emerging from an ecosystem that has immense linguistic diversity are proving that if technology can deliver impact here, it can work anywhere. Google is turning India’s unique challenges into a research advantage, and its partners are writing the playbook for the rest of the world.","Google DeepMind is working to make AI more inclusive in India.

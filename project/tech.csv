Business Insider, citing sources familiar with the matter, reported the layoffs include the company’s security division.The publication claims that a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed the job cuts but declined to specify the number of employees affected by it. The spokesperson reiterated Microsoft's dedication to “high performance talent,” signaling a stricter approach to performance management.“At Microsoft we focus on high performance talent,"" the spokesperson was quoted as saying.“We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action,” the spokesperson added.The spokesperson also noted that roles vacated due to performance issues are often backfilled, suggesting that the overall headcount might not be significantly impacted.

MakeMyTrip part-payment feature for international flights: How it works



MakeMyTrip has launched an option that will allow users to conveniently book international flights with a part payment option. The domestic online travel company claims that this new feature has seen strong adoption among travellers booking both long-haul and short-haul international flights, particularly for tickets exceeding Rs 1 lakh. This initiative promises to build on MakeMyTrip's commitment to providing new and user-friendly travel solutions . The company reports positive initial feedback and expects the feature to further enhance the travel booking experience for its customers.Commenting on the part payment option, Saujanya Shrivastava , Chief Operating Officer – Flights, Holidays & Gulf at MakeMyTrip, said:The newly introduced Part Payment Option allows travellers to secure confirmed bookings by paying just 10–40% of the total fare upfront. The exact percentage depends on factors such as the airline, travel route and booking window.The remaining balance can be paid either before the travel date or within 45 days of booking, whichever is earlier, without any additional charges. This feature addresses a common challenge for travellers, especially larger families or groups, by easing the burden of upfront payments for international flights. Once the full payment is made, users can modify confirmed bookings according to fare rules.Apart from this, the online travel booking platform also offers features including ‘ Zero Cancellation ,’ which provides coverage for cancellations due to unforeseen events and ‘Fare Lock,’ which allows customers to lock flight prices for a small fee, securing the fare for 4 hours to 15 days.Additionally, the ‘Free Date Change’ feature lets travellers reschedule flights up to two hours before departure, offering flexibility and convenience.","MakeMyTrip has launched an option that will allow users to conveniently book international flights with a part payment option.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has not met with the US President-elect Donald Trump. Huang stated in a Bloomberg interview he has not received an invitation and will be delighted to meet him.When asked if he had been invited to visit Mar-a-Lago , Trump's Palm Beach resort, Huang responded, “Not yet but I would be delighted to go see him and congratulate him and do everything we can to help this administration succeed.”Huang’s comments highlight his willingness to engage with the incoming administration and offer support in any way possible.Trump said at one of his news conferences last month that everybody wants to be his friend.“One of the big differences between the first term, in the first term, everybody was fighting me. In this term, everybody wants to be my friend,” Trump said.“I don't know, my personality changed or something,” he added.Several tech billionaires, including CEO of Facebook parent company Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, have met Trump at Mar-a-Lago following his victory in the November presidential election.Trump has enjoyed a warm reception from business leaders as he prepares to take office for the second time.In December, a report by The New York Times said that Apple CEO Tim Cook also met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, marking the first time that Apple’s chief has met with the president-elect since his win. Other reports claimed that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was also due to meet Trump at his resort.Citing sources, The Information claimed that Pichai may not “make any direct overtures to Trump about the antitrust lawsuit or other regulatory topics.”Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reported that Elon Musk has emerged as a key 'gatekeeper,' making it necessary for those seeking a meeting with Trump to go through the Tesla CEO first. This situation has reportedly complicated matters for OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whose strained relationship with Musk has made it even more challenging for him to secure a meeting.","Huang said he has not received an invitation to visit Mar-a-Lago.

In a surprising turn of events, Errol Musk, the father of tech billionaire Elon Musk , has publicly advised the people of the United Kingdom to disregard his son’s recent comments on British politics. Speaking to LBC News, Errol Musk expressed his disapproval of Elon’s foray into UK political discourse, emphasising that wealth and fame should not lend undue weight to his opinions. The controversy revolves around Elon Musk’s statements on social media, where he criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other political figures over their handling of a sensitive issue involving ""Pakistani grooming gangs."" The incident has sparked widespread debate, drawing reactions from political leaders, public figures, and Elon’s father himself.In his interview, Errol Musk made it clear that he believes his son’s comments should not be given undue attention. “Just don’t listen to him, that’s all. I’d say don’t worry about it. Tell him to get lost,” he said. He went on to downplay the significance of Elon’s remarks, asserting that the billionaire’s opinions hold no more value than those of countless others expressing similar sentiments online.“People don’t have to listen to what he says. I mean he’s just a person. The fact that he has money or something, he’s a billionaire or something to that effect—I mean, hundreds of thousands of people are tweeting the same things or saying the same things as he is,” Errol Musk added, as per reports. His comments reflect a broader concern about the influence of high-profile individuals on public discourse.Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and owner of X (formerly Twitter), stirred controversy when he accused UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer of being complicit in the actions of ""Pakistani grooming gangs."" These gangs, predominantly consisting of men of South Asian origin, were implicated in the systematic sexual abuse of young girls in northern English towns such as Rochdale, Rotherham, and Oldham between 2008 and 2013.Musk alleged that Starmer, who served as head of the UK’s prosecution service during the period, prioritized political gains over justice for victims. In a series of posts on X, Musk stated, “Starmer must go and he must face charges for his complicity in the worst mass crime in the history of Britain.” He further claimed that many individuals in positions of power in the UK should face legal consequences for their alleged roles in covering up the scandal.Musk also directed criticism at UK safeguarding minister Jess Phillips, labeling her a “rape genocide apologist” and accusing her of failing to address issues related to child abuse. He called for a new inquiry into the grooming gangs, despite the conclusion of a years-long national investigation into child sexual exploitation in 2022.Prime Minister Keir Starmer firmly rejected Musk’s accusations, describing them as baseless and harmful. Without directly naming Musk, Starmer criticized those spreading misinformation, stating, “Those who are spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible are not interested in victims; they’re interested in themselves.”Starmer warned that such rhetoric could have dangerous consequences, including threats and intimidation against public figures. “We have seen this playbook many times—whipping up intimidation and threats of violence, hoping that the media will amplify it. When the poison of the far right leads to serious threats to Jess Phillips and others, then in my book a line has been crossed,” he added.Elon Musk’s involvement in UK politics has drawn international attention, with reactions ranging from support to criticism. On X, Musk conducted a poll asking whether Americans should “liberate” the British from their “tyrannical government,” further fueling the controversy.French President Emmanuel Macron also weighed in, expressing concerns about Musk’s growing interference in European political matters. Macron’s remarks echo broader apprehensions about the influence of high-profile individuals like Musk on sensitive political issues.","Elon Musk’s father, Errol, has publicly advised the people of the United Kingdom to disregard his son's recent comments on British politics.

This new approach will allow users to call out potentially misleading posts and provide additional context, rather than relying on independent fact-checking organisations.""We're going to get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X, starting in the US,"" Zuckerberg said in a video. ""We've reached a point where it's just too many mistakes and too much censorship. It's time to get back to our roots around free expression ,"" he said.Zuckerberg cited the need to prioritise free expression and reduce mistakes in content moderation as reasons for the change. He acknowledged that the recent US elections played a role in this decision, describing them as a ""cultural tipping point"" towards prioritising speech.""The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritising speech, so we’re going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies and restoring free expression on our platforms,” the Meta CEO said.The policy reversal also includes lifting some restrictions on discussions around sensitive topics such as immigration and gender identity.

iPhone SE 4: Apple may launch iPhone SE 4 and iPad 11 by April this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/apple-may-launch-iphone-se-4-and-ipad-11-by-april-this-year/articleshow/117042093.cms,"Representative Image



iPhone SE 4 may have a new name

Apple may introduce the new iPhone SE and iPad 11 by April 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. A report previously suggested that these devices would launch alongside iOS 18 .3 and iPadOS 18.3, but Gurman clarified that while the products are being developed on the same software ""train,"" their release may not coincide with the updates. Instead, Gurman stated that Apple is targeting a release “before iOS 18.4,” offering a more specific timeframe for the highly anticipated devices.Taking to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Gurma wrote “Yes, the new iPads and iPhone SE replacement are being developed on the iOS 18.3 train - but that doesn’t mean they launch together this month”. Adding further, he said “It means they’ll launch before iOS 18.4, by April if all goes to plan.”According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, iPhone SE 4 may be rebranded as the iPhone 16E . The naming speculation originated from Chinese social media platform Weibo user Fixed Focus Digital and was later corroborated by leaker Majin Bu on X (formerly Twitter). While neither source has an established track record with Apple rumors, the potential rebranding would align the budget model more closely with Apple's flagship iPhone 16 lineup. The potential name change would mark a significant shift from Apple's previous ""SE"" branding for its budget iPhone line.The device is rumored to receive a major redesign, adopting the modern aesthetics of the iPhone 14 and moving away from the dated iPhone 8-style design of the current SE model. Key upgrades include a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID authentication, and a USB-C port, replacing the Touch ID button and Lightning connector found on the current model.Sources indicate the device will feature a single 48-megapixel rear camera, 8GB of RAM, and Apple's latest A-series chip to support new AI features. The company is also expected to implement its first in-house designed 5G modem in the device.","Apple may introduce the new iPhone SE and iPad 11 by April 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.

EU court ‘fines’ European Commission for violating data privacy rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/eu-court-fines-european-commission-for-violating-data-privacy-rules/articleshow/117058926.cms,"Why EU court has fined the commission

A court in the European Union (EU) has sent a strong message on data protection to the European Commission (EC). In what can be termed as a landmark ruling, the EU General Court has ordered the Commission to pay damages to a German citizen for violating the bloc's own data protection rules.The court ordered the Commission to pay 400 euros ($412) in damages to the individual. While the fine is small, the decision is significant because it marks the first time an EU institution has been held financially liable for breaching the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).The case stemmed from the citizen's use of the “Sign in with Facebook” option on an EU webpage to register for a conference. The court found that the Commission transferred the user's IP address to Facebook parent company Meta Platforms in the US.This transfer essentially violated the GDPR regulations, as it lacked adequate safeguards for personal data. The GDPR – the first of its kind – is considered one of the world's strongest data privacy laws, and major companies like Klarna, Meta and LinkedIn have faced hefty fines for non-compliance.In 2023, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission fined Meta a record 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) for violating EU privacy laws by transferring the personal data of Facebook users to servers in the US, thereby violating EU’s data protection rules (GDPR).It also ordered the company to stop transferring data collected from Facebook users in Europe to the US. Regulators also said Meta failed to comply with a 2020 decision by the EU’s highest court that user data in the US was not sufficiently protected from American spy agencies.","The EU General Court has ordered the Commission to pay damages to a German citizen for violating the bloc's own data protection rules.

“The European Commission has fined Meta ... for breaching EU antitrust rules by tying its

online classified ads

service Facebook Marketplace to its personal social network Facebook and by imposing unfair trading conditions on other online classified ads service providers. All

Facebook users

automatically have access and get regularly exposed to Facebook Marketplace whether they want it or not.”

What Meta said about EU's claims



“Facebook users can choose whether or not to engage with Marketplace, and many don't. The reality is that people use Facebook Marketplace because they want to, not because they have to. It is disappointing that the Commission has chosen to take regulatory action against a free and innovative service built to meet consumer demand.”

Meta is set to test a new feature that will allow users to browse eBay listings on Facebook Marketplace and complete purchases. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, this test will launch in Germany, France, and the US at first. This move is a part of Facebook’s parent company's response to an $840 million fine imposed by the European Commission in November 2024 for anti-competitive practices related to Facebook Marketplace, the report added. With this new feature, the social media major aims to address the Commission's concerns which will give eBay sellers access to Facebook's vast user base and provide Marketplace users with a wider selection of products.In 2024, The European Commission fined Meta $840 million for giving Facebook Marketplace an unfair advantage over competitors. The EU claimed that Meta used its dominance in social networking to boost Marketplace by integrating it with Facebook, giving it access to millions of users and allowing it to collect data on competitors.In a statement, the European Commission said:The European Commission also accused Meta of imposing unfair trading conditions on competing online classified ad services that advertised on Facebook or Instagram. This allowed Meta to use data from these competitors' ads to benefit Facebook Marketplace, giving it an additional advantage in the market.Responding to the EU allegations, the company said:",The European Commission fined Meta $840 million for giving Facebook Marketplace an unfair advantage over competitors.

What is this new labeling system

Amazon, Google and Samsung to participate in programme

The US government is introducing a labeling system for smart devices , such as smart thermostats, baby monitors, app-controlled lights and other internet-connected devices, that will rate these items on cybersafety criteria.“Each one of these devices presents a digital door that motivated cyber attackers are eager to enter,” US Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber Anne Neuberger said, as per news agency Reuters.Called “US Cyber Trust Mark”, it will provide consumers an identification to see if connected devices are cybersecure. Under this voluntary programme, manufacturers will have to place a label on their products if they meet federal cybersecurity standards. This means that customers in the US choose smart devices that are less susceptible to hacking.“The White House launched this bipartisan effort to educate American consumers and give them an easy way to assess the cybersecurity of such products, as well as incentivise companies to produce more cybersecure devices, much as EnergyStar labels did for energy efficiency,” the White House said.These labels will feature a distinctive shield logo and QR codes for additional security information. By scanning the QR code, consumers can access more cybersecurity details, including information on software updates from manufacturers to combat new cyberthreats, according to Justin Brookman, director of technology policy at Consumer Reports.Industry participants include Amazon, Best Buy, Google, LG Electronics USA, Logitech and Samsung. According to Neuberger, the products bearing the label should be available this year as manufacturers start submitting their devices for approval.First proposed by the Biden administration 18 months ago and approved last year by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the program will be led by the FCC. Last month, the FCC selected 11 companies and organisations to oversee the technical designation of products bearing the labels.","Called ‘US Cyber Trust Mark’, it will provide consumers an identification to see if connected devices are cybersecure.

Police arrested a Gujarat businessman inside the Ram temple complex in Ayodhya for taking photographs with smart glasses. Jani Jaikumar from Vadodara bypassed security checkpoints along the Ram Janmabhoomi path, reaching the Singhdwar. A security watcher apprehended him while he was taking pictures using the smart glass, valued at approximately Rs 50,000.Police have not identified the brand and model which the accused used to click photographs inside the temple. However, considering the price tag revealed by the Police it is likely that the man was wearing Meta smartglasses.Photography and videography inside the Ram temple are banned for security purposes. In May last year, Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra and the Ayodhya administration announced a complete ban on mobile phones in the Ram Janmabhoomi temple premises. The ban is aimed to minimise the risk of potential misuse of devices for recording or transmitting sensitive information.SP (Security) Balramachari Dubey told TOI: “The man is presently in custody and being interrogated. The specs cam is priced at around Rs 50,000. UP special security force jawan Anurag Bajpai, who apprehended the youth, will be rewarded.”Incidentally, the attacker behind the recent New Year’s Day tragedy on Bourbon Street in New Orleans also used Meta smart glasses to record and plan his assault. FBI New Orleans Special Agent in Charge Lyonel Myrthil revealed that the attacker stayed in a rental home starting October 30, where he spent days recording videos while biking through the French Quarter.Though he wore the Meta smart glasses during the attack, they were not activated at the time. The glasses were later recovered from his body following his death.Smart glasses are becoming increasingly popular in India, offering features like hands-free calling, audio streaming, and augmented reality experiences. Here are some options available in the Indian market:These glasses feature guided audio, multi-functional touch controls, and up to 9-hour playtime. They are designed for both men and women.Everyday smartglasses combining premium eyewear and audio. They offer hands-free calls, voice assistant integration, and swappable frames with blue cut and prescription lenses.A heads-up AR display built exclusively for pairing with your iOS or Android device, designed to optimize workflows and provide real-time updates.These glasses come with blue light filtering and polarized lenses, low latency audio, built-in mic and speakers, and touch and voice assistant compatibility.While not officially launched in India, these glasses offer features like dual cameras, open-ear speakers, and touch controls.

“The future of mobility shouldn’t be limited to just cars. Or just one car company, for that matter,” Toyoda said.

Toyota is investing $44 million in Japanese rocket company Interstellar Technologies to compete with Elon Musk 's SpaceX . The carmaker aims to help Interstellar build low-cost rockets for the expanding commercial space market. This investment is made through Toyota's Woven by Toyota division and includes a position on Interstellar's board.While the US and China launch dozens or even over a hundred rockets annually, Japan's successful launches remain in the single digits. Interstellar, which aims for 30 annual launches by the early 2030s, acknowledges the need for a ""structural transformation"" of Japan's space industry. The company plans to leverage Toyota's manufacturing expertise to create a ""high-quality, cost-effective, and scalable"" rocket production process.Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda hinted at the investment at CES in Las Vegas, emphasizing the company's broader interest in transportation innovation beyond cars, even suggesting competition with SpaceX. This aligns with Toyota's existing space-related activities, including a 2019 collaboration with JAXA on a lunar rover for NASA's Artemis program.The Interstellar investment is part of a wider trend of companies seeking to capitalize on the growing demand for satellite launch capabilities. The Japanese government is also supporting this sector with a ¥1 trillion strategic fund for space-related startups, manufacturers, and research institutions.Despite these efforts, Japan faces challenges, including geographical limitations for launch facilities. Recent setbacks, like Space One Co.'s failed commercial rocket launch, highlight the difficulties of achieving orbit. However, Woven CEO Hajime Kumabe emphasized at CES that Toyota's ""craftsmanship expertise"" will be a valuable asset to Interstellar's rocket manufacturing, framing the investment as an expansion of mobility across land, sea, and air.

What the proposed laws say and punishment

The UK government has announced that it will criminalise the creation and sharing of sexually explicit deepfake images . The government will also introduce a new rule under which perpetrators will be charged for both creating and sharing these images. The move aims to strengthen protections for women and girls against image-based abuse.“Predators who create sexually explicit ‘deepfakes’ could face prosecution as the Government bears down on vile online abuse as part of its mission to make our streets safer,” the government said, adding, “The proliferation of these hyper-realistic images has grown at an alarming rate, causing devastating harm to victims, particularly women and girls who are often the target.”The proposed legislation will make it a criminal offense to create deepfakes without consent, punishable by up to two years in prison. This move closes a gap in existing laws, which currently only criminalise the sharing or threat of sharing intimate images, including deepfakes.The UK government will also create new offences for the taking of intimate images without consent and the installation of equipment with intent to commit these offences.Victims Minister Alex Davies-Jones emphasised the urgency of addressing this issue, citing that one in three women in the UK have been victims of online abuse.“This demeaning and disgusting form of chauvinism must not become normalised, and as part of our Plan for Change we are bearing down on violence against women – whatever form it takes. These new offences will help prevent people being victimised online. We are putting offenders on notice – they will face the full force of the law,” said Davies-Jones.These new offences follow the UK government’s action in September 2024 to add sharing intimate image offences as priority offences under the Online Safety Act.",The UK government has announced that it will criminalise the creation and sharing of sexually explicit deepfake images.

Analysts want Elon Musk back fulltime as Tesla CEO

Tesla is set to unveil its first-quarter earnings after the market closes on Tuesday, April 22. Both investors and analysts are eagerly anticipating insights into the electric vehicle giant’s financial health, 2025 sales outlook, and potential product roadmap updates. The report comes at a pivotal moment for Tesla, as it navigates a challenging start to the year marked by declining stock prices, tariff uncertainties, and questions about CEO Elon Musk ’s expanding influence in the Donald Trump administration.Tesla’s stock has plummeted 53% from its all-time high in December 2024, when shares surged following President Donald Trump’s election victory. The automaker faces mounting pressure to address concerns about softening demand, production hurdles, and the potential impact of Trump’s proposed trade tariffs on its global supply chain and pricing strategy. Wall Street will be closely watching for clarity on how these factors could affect Tesla’s profitability and competitive edge in the EV market.Adding intrigue to the earnings release, Tesla has fueled speculation by subtly rebranding its traditional post-earnings analyst call as a “company update” in its press release. The cryptic wording caught the attention of Tesla’s fervent fanbase, with some theorizing that major announcements—potentially related to autonomous driving technology, the Cybercab robotaxi, or new vehicle models like the refreshed Model Y or an affordable compact EV—could be on the horizon. When a prominent Tesla enthusiast on X asked followers to weigh in on the change, Tesla’s official X account playfully responded, “We secretly enjoy reading the theories y’all are coming up with,” further stoking anticipation.“Tesla’s earnings call is always a high-stakes event, but this one feels different,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. “Investors want hard numbers on volume growth and margin outlook, but they’re also looking for Musk to address the elephant in the room: how his White House ties and Trump’s trade policies will shape Tesla’s future.”Musk’s role as a close advisor to President Trump has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest and whether his political involvement could distract from Tesla’s operations. The company’s ambitious 2025 plans, including the ramp-up of Cybertruck production and the launch of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software in Europe and China, will also be under scrutiny as Tesla seeks to maintain its lead in the fiercely competitive EV market.Analysts expect Tesla to report adjusted earnings of $0.58 per share on revenue of $23.4 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates, reflecting modest growth from the year-ago quarter. However, guidance for 2025 vehicle deliveries—projected to hover between 1.9 million and 2.1 million units—will likely take center stage, as will any updates on Tesla’s cost-cutting measures and battery production advancements.","Tesla is set to unveil its first-quarter earnings after the market closes on Tuesday, April 22.

'Trump Effect' ...

Mark Zuckerberg's Education Ventures

The Primary School , a no-cost private institution in the Bay Area co-founded by Priscilla Chan , wife of Facebook parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg , will reportedly cease operations following the 2025-2026 academic year, concluding roughly ten years of service to 543 students. First reported by Bloomberg, the impending closure was disclosed in a statement posted on the school's website recently. In a move aimed at preserving its legacy, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the billionaire couple's philanthropic arm, has committed $50 million to invest in the communities the school serves -— specifically East Palo Alto, Belle Haven, and the East Bay region near San Francisco -- over the subsequent few years.""This was a very difficult decision, and we are committed to ensuring a thoughtful and supportive transition for students and families over the next year,"" the online statement conveyed. Carson Cook, a spokesperson for The Primary School, stated there would be no further comment beyond the official announcement.Pediatrician Priscilla Chan, 40, co-established The Primary School in 2016, implementing an ""integrated health and education model"" designed to support families and children from birth through high school, according to the organization's tax filings. The school's inaugural middle school cohort commenced in 2023.The most recent tax documentation indicates that over 95% of The Primary School's students in East Palo Alto identify as under-represented minorities. The filing also revealed the nonprofit held assets exceeding $30 million as of the end of June 2023.The Primary School is among several educational endeavors recently initiated by prominent billionaires. Elon Musk , Jeff Bezos, and Larry Ellison have all established schools in recent years. Musk's nonprofit, the Musk Foundation, has contributed $237 million to his technology-focused primary and secondary school in Austin, named Ad Astra, with future aspirations for a university. Ad Astra collaborates with the same entity that assisted Ellison in establishing his Hala Kahiki Montessori school in Lanai, Hawaii, an island largely owned by the Oracle co-founder. Amazon.com founder Bezos has created a network of Montessori-inspired preschools catering to children in underserved communities.The closure of The Primary School coincides with significant strategic shifts within Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms Inc. as the 40-year-old founder appears to be aligning his business interests more closely with the Trump administration. Recent appointments to Meta's board include longtime Trump allies Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, and Dina Powell McCormick, who served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser during his first term.Furthermore, Zuckerberg has appointed a Republican strategist as chief of global affairs, eliminated Meta’s US fact-checking program, rolled back the company’s hate-speech policies, and discontinued key diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at both Meta and CZI. This contrasts with The Primary School's documented commitment to diversity, which included conducting a diversity audit in June 2020 following the Black Lives Matter protests and forming a DEI task force in the fall of that year.","The Primary School will cease operations following the 2025-2026 academic year, concluding roughly ten years of service to 543 students.

Full text of Google's memo:



Today, a U.S. district court issued a mixed decision in our advertising technology case with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). We asked Lee-Anne Mulholland, VP of Regulatory Affairs, for her thoughts.

Give us an overview of the court's decision today.

The court delivered a mixed ruling in the DOJ's lawsuit focused on some of our ad tech. It rejected key parts of the DOJ's case: The court found our advertiser tools don't harm competition and our acquisitions of DoubleClick and AdMeld were not anticompetitive. But it agreed with the DOJ's claims about one of our publisher tools. In other words, we won half, lost the other half.

For those unfamiliar, what's the focus of this case?

This case is focused on the tools we provide to advertisers and publishers for third-party display advertising on the web. While these tools are valuable for those customers, they represent a narrow part of our advertising business — separate from Search and YouTube ads. Specifically, it looked at whether some of our advertising technology — tools that connect advertisers (like retailers) and ad sellers (typically website owners) — violated antitrust law; as well as whether our acquisitions in this space were anticompetitive.

What are the next steps?

On this case, there is a ways to go; this is definitely not the final word. We will next go to trial to decide the remedies in this case, and then we will appeal the decision. We believe we're strongly positioned to appeal based on established Supreme Court precedent, the facts of our case, and the findings of the court today:

The ruling doesn't align with how the Supreme Court has previously viewed multi-sided markets like ours, which involve advertisers, publishers, platforms, and users.

The ruling incorrectly suggests a company like ours has a legal obligation to do business with competitors. This is contrary to past Supreme Court decisions.

The court recognized that our advertising tools operate in a competitive market, alongside major players in social media and beyond.

The ruling found that our acquisitions in this space (DoubleClick and Admeld) did not harm competition.

Publishers have tons of options and they choose Google because our tools are simple, affordable, and effective.

Is there anything else you want Googlers to know?

There's been a lot of interest by regulators in our ad tech products around the world for many, many years so this scrutiny isn't new! We've long invested in ad tech because it goes back to our mission of making information universally accessible and useful. Ad tech helps online publishers, content creators, and bloggers make money—which in turn keeps the internet free and open to use for all of us.

We're deeply committed to providing solutions to a wide array of publishers and advertisers in a highly competitive sector. The Regulatory Affairs team will keep working to challenge this case through the appeals process. It's important for Googlers to continue to focus on our users and customers by building amazing products that help people around the world.

The recent ruling by a US judge that Google holds illegal monopolies in its advertising technology (ad tech) business has raised the possibility of significant changes for the tech giant, including a potential breakup of parts of its ad operations. Google plans to appeal the decision, but the outcome could reshape how it manages its advertising business.Post the Court order, Google sent a memo to employees asking them to focus on their work and not fret about the company's loss of ""parts of"" its online advertising monopoly case. In a note to staff, Google VP of regulatory affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland said it's important for employees to ""continue to focus on our users and customers by building amazing products that help people around the world.""Here’s a breakdown of what the case is about, why it matters, and what could happen next.This case focuses on Google’s ad technology, specifically its Google Network division, which operates an auction-style system that helps advertisers buy digital ad space across the internet. This system determines which ads appear where and at what cost. Unlike a separate antitrust case targeting Google’s search engine dominance, this lawsuit is not about search but about how Google controls the tools and platforms used for online advertising.The US Justice Department argued that Google’s dominance in ad tech allows it to unfairly block competitors, harming web publishers like news outlets that rely on ad revenue. The judge agreed, ruling that Google’s practices create illegal monopolies.Google claimed its success comes from offering superior technology, not anti-competitive behavior. Advertising is a massive part of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, generating about 75% of its $350 billion revenue in 2024. However, the Google Network division at the heart of this case accounts for just 8.7% of that revenue.The ruling is significant because it challenges Google’s grip on the digital advertising ecosystem. Google’s ad tech tools, like Google Ad Manager, are central to how ads are bought and sold online. The judge found that Google’s control over these tools stifles competition, which can lead to higher costs for advertisers and lower earnings for publishers.For Google, losing parts of its ad tech business could reduce revenue, though experts estimate the impact would be less than 10% of Alphabet’s total earnings. For example, Google Ad Manager, a key platform in this case, represented just 4.1% of revenue and 1.5% of operating profit in 2020.For the Industry, a more competitive ad tech market could make it easier for advertisers and publishers to use alternative platforms, potentially lowering costs and increasing revenue for websites like news outlets.For Policy, the case shows rare bipartisan support, with both the Biden and Trump administrations backing the Justice Department’s efforts. This signals strong political will to regulate Big Tech.The judge will now decide on remedies, or penalties, to address Google’s illegal monopolies.Google has vowed to appeal the ruling, which could delay or alter the outcome. The remedy phase and appeal process could take months or even years to resolve.","Google's ad tech products are the focus of a lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice.

Why Mark Zuckerberg considered 'deleting' everyone’s Facebook friend list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-mark-zuckerberg-considered-deleting-everyones-facebook-friend-list/articleshow/120496333.cms,"Why Mark Zuckerberg considered 'deleting' everyone’s Facebook friend list

Zuckerberg once suggested deleting everyone’s Facebook friends to reignite engagement

“One potentially crazy idea is to consider wiping everyone’s graphs and having them start again,”

Concerns over platform stability and Instagram

“I’m not sure Option #1 in your proposal (Double-down on Friending) would be viable given my understanding of how vital the friend use case is to IG,”

Why Facebook was looking for drastic fixes

Zuckerberg’s old emails resurface in FTC monopoly trial against Meta

“It is better to buy than compete.”

Zuckerberg says Facebook is still Meta’s core pillar

“Even if Instagram and WhatsApp do well, I don’t see a path to success for Meta if Facebook falters.”

Billionaire CEO, billion-dollar pressure



In a startling revelation from internal emails presented during an ongoing antitrust trial, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg ’s radical suggestion to “wipe everyone’s graphs” on Facebook has resurfaced, drawing attention to the extreme lengths leadership once considered to reinvigorate the platform’s relevance. The proposal, which involved erasing every user’s friend list to force a social re-engagement reset, offers a rare glimpse into the executive-level desperation to maintain Facebook’s user interest in an era increasingly dominated by competitors like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat.Although the idea was ultimately dismissed, the now-public emails have fueled renewed scrutiny of Facebook’s growth tactics and its dependence on legacy social structures—especially as Meta continues facing legal and reputational challenges around monopolistic behavior. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the origin, implications, and fallout of this eyebrow-raising strategy.The revelation stems from internal communications dated 2022, disclosed during the Federal Trade Commission's ongoing antitrust case against Meta. In an email sent to senior executives, Mark Zuckerberg proposed what he described himself as a “potentially crazy idea” under the header “Option 1. Double down on Friending.”Zuckerberg wrote, referring to the core social connections—“friend graphs”—that form the backbone of Facebook’s architecture.The idea centered around reigniting engagement by forcing users to reconnect from scratch, potentially making the platform feel more like a fresh social discovery network rather than a stagnant feed of old acquaintances.The proposal was met with immediate concern by top executives within Meta. Tom Alison, then head of Facebook, pushed back strongly on the idea. He warned that disrupting the established friend graph could create significant instability not just for Facebook but also for its sister platform, Instagram, which relies heavily on user connections for feed curation, story sharing, and algorithmic recommendations.Alison wrote in response.This internal debate reflected a broader tension within Meta: how to evolve Facebook’s aging infrastructure without compromising the integrated social ecosystem that now spans Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.The context behind Zuckerberg’s controversial suggestion lies in Facebook’s waning cultural relevance. Founded in 2004, Facebook once dominated online social interactions. But as platforms like Instagram (acquired by Facebook in 2012) and TikTok surged in popularity—especially among younger users—Facebook's model of mutual friending began to seem outdated.Modern users increasingly prefer follower-based platforms where engagement is driven by interest-based discovery rather than personal relationships. Even Zuckerberg himself admitted in a separate 2022 email that he now prefers following surfers and MMA fighters on Instagram and X (formerly Twitter) rather than checking updates from Facebook friends.The friend graph deletion idea emerged during the high-profile antitrust trial launched by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in April 2024. The trial seeks to prove that Meta holds unlawful monopoly power in the digital market by acquiring rival platforms and suppressing competition.One of the key pieces of evidence in the FTC’s case is a 2008 internal email from Zuckerberg stating:The resurfacing of these internal communications has added weight to the FTC’s argument that Meta’s aggressive acquisition strategies were intentionally designed to eliminate threats, rather than innovate independently.Despite Meta’s branding shift toward futuristic ventures like the metaverse and AI, Zuckerberg has publicly stated that Facebook remains the cornerstone of the company’s success.In a 2022 internal email, he warned:This underscores why even unorthodox strategies—like deleting everyone’s friends—were seriously floated. Meta’s revenue, user engagement metrics, and advertising architecture are still deeply rooted in the Facebook experience, making the platform too critical to let stagnate.Mark Zuckerberg, now worth over $200 billion, has seen his company evolve from a college dorm project to one of the most powerful tech empires in the world. With this transformation has come immense pressure to sustain innovation and profitability, especially in the face of regulatory scrutiny and public skepticism.While some of his earlier college-era antics have morphed into family-friendly social media posts with his wife Priscilla Chan and their daughters, Zuckerberg remains at the helm of a tech juggernaut that is constantly trying to reinvent itself—sometimes in bizarre, headline-making ways.",Mark Zuckerberg once suggested deleting everyone’s Facebook friends to reignite engagement.

Uber faces ‘major problem’ with its subscription service in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/uber-faces-major-problem-with-its-subscription-service-in-us/articleshow/120496444.cms,"What Uber said about FTC lawsuit



“Uber One’s sign-up and cancellation processes are clear, simple, and follow the letter and spirit of the law. Uber does not sign up or charge consumers without their consent, and cancellations can now be done anytime in-app and take most people 20 seconds or less,”

What US FTC said about Uber One subscription service



“Americans are tired of getting signed up for unwanted subscriptions that seem impossible to cancel. The Trump-Vance FTC is fighting back on behalf of the American people.”

The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed a lawsuit against cab-hailing platform Uber. The lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California accuses Uber of using deceptive billing and cancellation practices for its Uber One subscription service. According to the complaint, Uber enrolled consumers without consent, misrepresented and promised savings, and erected obstacles to cancelling, even though it marketed Uber One as a “cancel anytime” service. The FTC highlights that these practices violate the FTC Act and the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act (ROSCA). The lawsuit seeks a permanent injunction along with monetary relief for affected users. However, Uber has disputed the allegations and has claimed that its sign‑up and cancellation processes are clear, transparent, and legally compliant.In an email sent to CNBC, Noah Edwardsen, an Uber spokesperson, said that the company was “disappointed” by the FTC’s complaint but remains confident about the court's ruling being in its favour.Edwardsen said.In its complaint, the FTC accuses Uber of advertising “savings of $25 a month” without factoring in the cost of the membership. The agency also alleges that Uber charged some consumers before their scheduled billing datesThe FTC further argues that cancelling an Uber One subscription is made “extremely difficult,” with some users told to contact customer service representatives who are unreachable. Several members reported being billed for an additional cycle despite cancelling their subscriptions, the complaint states.In a statement, FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson said:Introduced in 2021, Uber One is priced at $9.99 per month or $96 annually and includes benefits such as fee‑free delivery and discounts on eligible ride bookings, delivery, and pickup orders. According to Uber’s latest annual report, the service’s member base reached 30 million in December 2024.","The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed a lawsuit against cab-hailing platform Uber.

What the Kardashians said about Lauren Sanchez’s Blue Origin space flight



“This is a really unique experience and we’re just so honored to be here to support them and watch this amazing part of history, and I’m so proud of her,”

How Sanchez solved NASA's 'uniform problem' before her Blue Origin flight



Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ' fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, received a space-themed gift from Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and Khloé Kardashian after her recent Blue Origin Space flight. The Kardashians gave Sanchez a Judith Leiber handbag shaped like an UFO, valued at $6,995. The UFO Orbiter bag features star-shaped and geometric crystals, aligning with the theme of the Blue Orgin's Space flight. Sánchez shared the gift on her Instagram story (seen by Page Six), describing it as “Out of this world!” and tagged the three Kardashian sisters.

Tesla stocks declined 33% year-to-date

Tesla investor Ross Gerber, who publicly called for Elon Musk’s exit from the EV company, has once again criticised him. In an interview with Bloomberg Technology, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, said that Musk “doesn’t care” about the electric car manufacturer. He went on to claim that the tech billionaire Elon Musk is not returning 'his focus' to Tesla anytime soon. He has found his next Big Focus and that it is not Tesla. “It’s clear that he just doesn’t care. His next move is X AI… So if you have any confusion that he’s coming back to Tesla, he’s not,” he said during the interview. In March, Gerber said that Musk has lost focus given his widening interests and has become too ‘divisive’. Blaming social media posts and involvement with the president Donald Trump for bringing negative publicity to the company, he then said that “the company's reputation has just been destroyed by Elon Musk”.He then stated that Musk would need to choose between backing Trump and safeguarding Tesla. He said : “It's time for somebody to run Tesla. The business has been neglected for too long. There are too many important things Tesla is doing, so either Elon should come back to Tesla and be the CEO of Tesla and give up his other jobs or he should focus on the government and keep doing what he is doing but find a suitable CEO of Tesla.”In his interview with Bloomberg, Gerber stood by his Tesla comments, addressing criticism from retail investors. He said “I understand why retail investors at Tesla are frustrated with me for voicing my views” adding that he’s “getting attacked because of Elon’s behavior.”However, Gerber said that his firm will continue to manage Tesla shares. He said “We still own Tesla because I do think something fixes itself at some point, and they have the best products”.Despite maintaining its lead in the US EV market, Tesla's stock has dropped 33% year-to-date. According to Cox Automotive data, Tesla sales fell 8.6% year over year in the first quarter of 2025, while the market expanded 11.4% as a whole. Meanwhile, the EV company is set to announce its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, April 22.Stock market worldwide has been volatile amidst the US-China tariff trade war.

"Walmart Boycott: World's largest retailer tells protesters, 'we are America's ...'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/walmart-boycott-worlds-largest-retailer-tells-protesters-we-are-americas-/articleshow/120119363.cms,"Here's what Walmart said about the protest

People's Union USA founder John Schwarz has announced on social media details of upcoming planned boycotts:

Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, has issued a statement addressing the ongoing week-long boycott organised by the People’s Union USA . The boycott, dubbed the "" Walmart Blackout ,"" began on April 7 and targets the company’s rollback of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, as well as broader concerns over corporate influence and tax policies .The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity. The group’s founder, John Schwarz, urged consumers to avoid shopping at Walmart stores, using its online services, or purchasing from its subsidiaries like Sam’s Club. Schwarz stated, “We are holding these companies accountable so they finally step up and pay their fair share of taxes to alleviate federal income tax from the working-class citizen.”Walmart responded to the boycott, defending its contributions to communities and the US economy. “Serving communities is at the heart of Walmart's purpose to help people save money and live better,” the company said in a statement. “As one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, not only do we pay our fair share, we are an economic force multiplier strengthening communities nationwide through job creation, supplier growth, and over $1.7 billion in cash and in-kind donations last year"", it added further.The boycott follows Walmart’s decision last November to discontinue its five-year commitment to a racial equity center and other DEI programs. Critics argue that these rollbacks undermine progress in promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Walmart, however, emphasised its dedication to supporting local charities, disaster response, hunger relief, workforce development, and conservation efforts.A report from SuperMarketNews, citing data from Numerator, suggests that Walmart may be more resistant to boycotts compared to other retailers. The data indicates that Walmart has not experienced significant impact from households regarding its stance on non-DEI initiatives, particularly among multicultural households—a trend that contrasts with another retail chain Target.Target reportedly faced the most severe backlash during the February 28 boycott focused on DEI initiatives, experiencing a 9% drop in web traffic on the day of the protest, according to Forbes. In comparison, Walmart observed a 5% decline in web traffic, while Amazon saw the smallest decrease, at just 2%.* Walmart: April 7-14 and May 20-26* Second economic blackout: April 18* General Mills: April 21-28* Amazon: May 6-12* Target: June 3-9* McDonald's: June 24-30* Independence Day boycott: July 4","The People’s Union USA, a grassroots campaign group, has accused Walmart of failing to pay its fair share of taxes and undermining workplace diversity.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female. The change aligns with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January 2025, titled ‘Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government’. The updated policy, which took effect on April 2, applies to all pending and future immigration benefit requests. “USCIS is returning to its historical policy of recognizing two biological sexes,” the agency said in a press statement.Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security , said “There are only two sexes—male and female. President Trump promised the American people a revolution of common sense, and that includes making sure that the policy of the U.S. government agrees with simple biological reality. Proper management of our immigration system is a matter of national security, not a place to promote and coddle an ideology that permanently harms children and robs real women of their dignity, safety, and well-being.”Under the new guidance, a person’s sex will be determined based on the birth certificate issued at or closest to the time of birth. “If the birth certificate issued at or nearest to the time of birth indicates a sex other than male or female, USCIS will base the determination of sex on secondary evidence. See Volume 1, General Policies and Procedures, Part E, Adjudications, Chapter 6, Evidence, Section B, Primary and Secondary Evidence [1 USCIS-PM E.6(B)],” the agency stated.The agency further stated that the benefits will not be denied solely based on how an applicant identifies his/her sex. USCIS confirmed that it does not issue documents with a blank sex field or one that differs from the original birth certificate.

“That October, things had reached a fever pitch when The New York Times published a deeply disturbing article that raised serious questions about Bill’s conduct –

questions that suggested

he had betrayed not only our marriage but also my values.”

“I regretted it the second I walked in the door. He was abhorrent. He was evil personified. My heart breaks for these women,”

What Bill Gates said about his ties with Jeffrey Epstein



“In retrospect, I was foolish to spend any time with him. I think I was quite stupid. I thought it would help me with global health philanthropy. In fact, it failed to do that. It was just a huge mistake.”

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates’ ex-wife and founder of the Gates Foundation, Melinda French Gates, has made a major revelation about her husband’s ties with Jeffrey Epstein. In her new memoir “The Next Day”, Melinda noted that she knew her marriage to Bill Gates was facing significant issues in 2019, when his infidelities and connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein became publicly known. The philanthropist wrote that these public revelations led her to experience nightmares and recognise the severity of her marital difficulties. She was specifically referencing her then-husband’s association with Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking and federal conspiracy charges. A report published by The New York Times at that time claimed that Bill Gates met with Epstein on ""numerous occasions,"" including one visit that lasted for hours.In her memoir (seen by Page Six), Melinda Gates wrote:Earlier, in a 2022 interview, Melinda revealed that she had voiced her anger to Bill regarding his friendship with Epstein.

I made that clear to him.”Melinda added.In her new book, Melinda also mentioned that leaving her marriageThe report notes that in 2011, after his first encounter with Epstein, Bill Gates sent an email to his colleagues, writing: “His lifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing, although it would not work for me.”Earlier this year, the tech billionaire also accepted that he made a “huge mistake” in associating himself with Epstein.In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Gates said:","Melinda Gates wrote in her new memoir that she knew her marriage to Bill Gates was facing significant issues in 2019.

Pope Francis’ AI-generated photos on social media

Pope Francis, who consistently championed the use of technology for the betterment of humanity, has died at the age of 88. Notably, the pontiff was a strong voice in the discourse surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), and earlier this year, issued a compelling appeal for its ethical application. He cautioned against the potential for new technological advancements to be misused for manipulation.In his annual address to diplomats at the Vatican in January this year, Pope Francis expressed deep concerns about the rising tide of misinformation and its potential for manipulation through social media and AI, as per news agency AFP.The address highlighted the “continuous creation and spread of fake news,” which Francis argued not only distorts facts but also alters perceptions.“This phenomenon generates false images of reality, a climate of suspicion that foments hate, undermines people's sense of security and compromises civil coexistence and the stability of entire nations,” he stated.Addressing political leaders, Pope Francis lamented the growing trend of “the denial of self-evident truths.” He warned that “these tendencies can be amplified by the modern communications media and by artificial intelligence; they can be misused to manipulate minds for economic, political and ideological ends.”The 88-year-old pontiff emphasized the importance of media literacy education to foster critical thinking and combat the spread of false information.The pontiff, who was among the most-created AI personalities when AI took off, cautioned that these tools could be “misused to manipulate minds”.In 2024, Pope Francis delivered a stark warning about the potential dangers of AI in a Vatican City address, describing the technology's capabilities as “both exciting and disorienting.” His concerns follow a widely circulated AI-generated image, which depicted him in a white puffer coat, highlighting the technology's power to create convincing but fabricated content.“At this time in history, which risks becoming rich in technology and poor in humanity, our reflections must begin with the human heart,” Pope Francis said.","Pope Francis, who consistently championed the use of technology for the betterment of humanity, has died at the age of 88.

JP Morgan Chase CEO joins the pre-crash selloff



Donald Trump’s Liberation Day triggered market mayhem

In a striking revelation, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg , JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon , and Oracle CEO Safra Catz offloaded shares in the first quarter ahead of President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement that tumbled markets worldwide. According to a Bloomberg report, Zuckerberg sold 1.1 million shares worth $733 million in Q1 through his Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and its related foundation. The report says the shares sale was made in January and February when Meta’s stock was still trading above $600. The company’s shares have declined by 32% since then.JP Morgan Chase CEO, on the other hand, allegedly sold nearly $234 million of stocks during the quarter. As per Bloomberg’s wealth index, Dimon has a net worth of $3 billion. Oracle CEO Safra Catz was another major seller, who offloaded 3.8 million shares worth $705 million before the company’s stock dropped over 30%. Her total fortune is now $2.4 billion, as per Bloomberg Billionaires Index.According to Washington Service, Nikesh Arora - Chairman & CEO of Palo Alto Networks sold 2,365,196 shares worth $432,371,610. Stephen Cohen, President, Palantir Technologies reportedly sold 4,060,000 shares worth $337,239,916.On April 2—dubbed ""Liberation Day"" by President Donald Trump—the announcement of sweeping new tariffs sent shockwaves through global markets. These tariffs, targeting a vast array of imports, led to a historic two-day market crash, wiping out over $6.6 trillion in value from U.S. stocks.While nearly all sectors were impacted, the tech sector also bore the brunt of this downturn. Elon Musk, for instance, saw his net worth plummet by $129 billion as tech stocks, including those of Tesla, suffered significant losses.Amid the market turbulence, some billionaire insiders saw the dip in stock prices as a chance to invest further, boosting their holdings in multiple companies.

E-commerce fraud: AI creates convincing fake storefronts in minutes



Job scams: AI powers fake interviews and employment offers





Tech support fraud: AI enhances social engineering attacks



Microsoft, in its latest Cyber Signals report, says that artificial intelligence has significantly lowered barriers for cybercriminals, enabling more sophisticated and convincing fraud schemes. Between April 2024 and April 2025, Microsoft thwarted $4 billion in fraud attempts, rejected 49,000 fraudulent partnership enrollments, and blocked approximately 1.6 million bot signup attempts per hour.AI tools now allow fraudsters to create convincing e-commerce websites in minutes rather than days or weeks. These sites feature AI-generated product descriptions, images, and fake customer reviews that mimic legitimate businesses. AI-powered customer service chatbots add another layer of deception, interacting with customers and stalling complaints with scripted excuses to delay chargebacks.Microsoft reports that much of this AI-powered fraud originates from China and Germany, with the latter being targeted due to its status as one of the largest e-commerce markets in the European Union. To combat these threats, Microsoft has implemented fraud detection systems across its products, including Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Edge, which features website typo protection and domain impersonation detection using deep learning technology.Employment fraud has evolved with generative AI enabling scammers to create fake job listings, stolen credentials, and AI-powered email campaigns targeting job seekers. These scams often appear legitimate through AI-powered interviews and automated correspondence, making it increasingly difficult to identify fraudulent offers.Warning signs include unsolicited job offers promising high pay for minimal qualifications, requests for personal information including bank details, and offers that seem too good to be true. Microsoft advises job seekers to verify employer legitimacy by cross-checking company details on official websites and platforms like LinkedIn , and to be wary of emails from free domains rather than official company email addresses.While some tech support scams don't yet leverage AI, Microsoft has observed financially motivated groups like Storm-1811 impersonating IT support through voice phishing to gain access to victims' devices through legitimate tools like Windows Quick Assist. AI tools can expedite the collection and organization of information about targeted victims to create more credible social engineering lures.In response, Microsoft blocks an average of 4,415 suspicious Quick Assist connection attempts daily—approximately 5.46% of global connection attempts. The company has implemented warning messages in Quick Assist to alert users about possible scams before they grant access to their devices and developed a Digital Fingerprinting capability that leverages AI and machine learning to detect and prevent fraud.Microsoft is taking a proactive approach to fraud prevention through its Secure Future Initiative. In January 2025, the company introduced a new policy requiring product teams to perform fraud prevention assessments and implement fraud controls as part of their design process. Microsoft has also joined the Global Anti-Scam Alliance to collaborate with governments, law enforcement, and other organizations to protect consumers from scams.","Microsoft says artificial intelligence has significantly lowered barriers for cybercriminals.

AI-powered customer service is meant to streamline support, but Cursor AI’s chatbot mishap has exposed the dangers of relying too heavily on automation. The coding assistant, developed by Anysphere , recently faced backlash after its AI-powered support bot fabricated a company policy, leading to mass confusion and subscription cancellations.The issue surfaced when users reported being mysteriously logged out when switching devices. Seeking clarification, they contacted Cursor’s support team, only to receive an email from “Sam” stating that the logouts were part of a new login policy. However, no such policy existed—the response was entirely hallucinated by the AI chatbot.The incident quickly went viral, prompting concerns about AI’s reliability in customer service. Experts warn that while AI can enhance efficiency, it lacks empathy, nuance, and accountability, making it risky to replace human agents entirely. AI hallucinations—where chatbots generate false information—can damage trust and lead to customer frustration.Cursor's failure acts as a cautionary lesson for companies incorporating AI into customer support. Businesses must ensure human oversight, transparency, and safeguards to prevent AI errors from escalating into brand-damaging crises.","Cursor AI chatbot fabricated a company policy, leading to mass confusion and subscription cancellations.

UN warns of global spread of billion-dollar cyberscam industry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/un-warns-of-global-spread-of-billion-dollar-cyberscam-industry/articleshow/120485699.cms,"Financial impact and rising fraud cases

Call for global action

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) has raised alarms over the rapid expansion of the billion-dollar cyberscam industry , likening its spread to a “cancer” that is moving beyond Southeast Asia into South America, Africa, and Eastern Europe. Despite intensified crackdowns in countries like Thailand, Myanmar, and Cambodia, criminal syndicates have adapted, shifting operations to regions with weak governance and high corruption, according to a new UN report.Originally concentrated in Southeast Asia, cyberscam networks have evolved into highly mobile operations, relocating to remote and underregulated areas to evade law enforcement. The UNODC estimates that hundreds of large-scale scam farms generate tens of billions of dollars annually, exploiting trafficked workers to target victims worldwide.The United States alone reported over $5.6 billion in losses to cryptocurrency scams in 2023, with romance scams and pig-butchering schemes accounting for more than $4 million in fraud targeting elderly and vulnerable individuals.Despite efforts by China, Thailand, and Myanmar to dismantle scam compounds, syndicates have relocated to Laos, Cambodia, and beyond, taking advantage of jurisdictions with weak enforcement. The UNODC warns that failure to address this issue could entrench a borderless criminal industry, undermining financial systems and exploiting vulnerable populations for years to come.The UN urges international cooperation to disrupt the financing of these criminal networks and prevent further expansion. Without coordinated efforts, the cyberscam industry may continue to outpace other transnational crimes, reaching millions of victims worldwide.","The United States alone reported over $5.6 billion in losses to cryptocurrency scams in 2023.

According to a report in the Economic Times, India may restrict Chinese companies to a 10% equity stake in electronics joint ventures, conditional on technology transfer due to limited local expertise.""As the Indian firms need technology transfer, the government is likely to allow 10% Chinese equity in joint ventures. But there won't be open gates for Chinese investments in electronics or other sectors,"" a source told the publication. This follows Chinese companies' growing willingness to meet India’s terms to expand in the market, amid U.S. tariff pressures increasing their product costs.The report said that the government prefers Chinese contract manufacturers or supply chain firms over brands to strengthen India’s manufacturing ecosystem. Flexibility on equity limits may be offered if U.S. or European firms relocate from China to India, with Chinese suppliers potentially holding up to 49% stakes in exceptional, case-by-case approvals, officials told ET.India’s caution stems from suspected Chinese supply chain disruptions in drilling machines, solar panel equipment, and electronics, worsened by strained ties since the 2020 border clashes. ""The drilling machines are made by German companies but since they have supply chains in China, the same are being throttled,"" an industry executive told ET, noting similar issues in electronics equipment.To avoid replicating Vietnam’s Chinese-dominated electronics sector, India is limiting broad Chinese investment.So far, none of the U.S. manufacturers have reportedly yet proposed shifting Chinese suppliers to India, with companies likely assessing geopolitical developments.

Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook’s ‘friending’ model may be outdated

Cultural relevance and long-term viability of Facebook

Facebook’s ‘friending’ model under scrutiny

Concerns over community messaging and Facebook groups

Strategic dissonance between Instagram and Facebook

Even with WhatsApp and Instagram, Facebook remains Meta’s backbone

At a time when Meta’s flagship platforms—Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp—continue to serve billions of users worldwide, internal communications reveal deep-seated concerns at the very top of the company about Facebook’s long-term viability. As part of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) ongoing antitrust lawsuit against Meta, a set of internal emails exchanged between CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook head Tom Alison in April 2022 have surfaced. These documents indicate that Zuckerberg is more inclined to follow creators and influencers on platforms like Instagram and X (formerly Twitter) than on Facebook.The internal emails highlight a growing disconnect between Facebook’s aging model of “friending” and the contemporary digital culture that increasingly revolves around “following” influencers and public figures. Zuckerberg’s remarks suggest that Facebook’s structure might be fundamentally outdated, potentially limiting its appeal to younger users. The emails also underscore his concerns about cultural relevance, future engagement, and strategic alignment between Meta's platforms.In the email conversation, Zuckerberg openly shared that his own habits had shifted over time. He acknowledged that he now prefers following surfers and MMA fighters on Instagram and X instead of Facebook. This personal behavioral change, coming from the CEO of Meta, served as a subtle but telling indicator of broader trends affecting user engagement.“Every other modern social network is built on following rather than friending,” Zuckerberg noted in the email, suggesting that Facebook’s foundational model may not align with modern user preferences. The statement reflects a candid recognition that users—especially younger ones—are gravitating toward interest-based content and influencers, rather than personal networks of friends and acquaintances.Zuckerberg didn’t mince words when evaluating Facebook’s position within contemporary internet culture. He pointed out that while engagement on the Facebook app remained steady in several regions, its cultural relevance was eroding rapidly.“Even though the FB app's engagement is steady in many places, it feels like its cultural relevance is decreasing quickly and I worry that this may be a leading indicator of future health issues,” he stated in the email.This admission highlights a growing concern within Meta’s leadership that Facebook might struggle to remain relevant if it fails to innovate or adapt its user model. It also marks a shift in the internal narrative around the app—from maintaining usage metrics to preserving societal influence and value perception among users.A key point of discussion in the email exchange revolved around the structural model of Facebook. Unlike platforms such as Instagram, X, or TikTok, which emphasize content discovery through ""following"" public profiles, Facebook still primarily operates on the concept of mutual friending.Zuckerberg hinted that this model may be outdated, limiting content exposure and user engagement. “It seems possible that the FB app is just outdated because it never adopted this fundamental innovation,” he wrote, referring to the shift toward a following-based model that dominates most modern platforms.The implication here is clear: Facebook may need to reimagine or hybridize its user interaction structure if it wants to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving social media environment.While Zuckerberg did express optimism about the growth of community messaging—a rising trend within platforms like WhatsApp and Messenger—he also conveyed skepticism about the future of Facebook Groups. Despite years of investment and strategic focus, he questioned how scalable this format would remain.“After running at groups in FB for several years, I'm not sure how much further we'll be able to push this,” he said. “It’s possible groups will just never be as big as friending/following, and that a lot of group behavior is moving to messaging anyway.”This observation aligns with the broader trend of users shifting toward private, niche, and encrypted spaces such as WhatsApp communities or Telegram channels for discussion and engagement.Another important point raised in the email exchange was the internal divergence between Facebook and Instagram in terms of cultural positioning. Zuckerberg acknowledged that Instagram was currently outperforming Facebook in terms of cultural relevance, particularly among younger audiences and trendsetters.“Differentiating between IG and FB is important, but I think we need to find a strategy that doesn’t leave one service picking up the scraps the other service leaves behind,” he wrote. He emphasized the need for a unified long-term vision rather than siloed growth strategies for Meta’s platforms.This indicates that while Instagram is thriving with influencer-driven content and high engagement, Facebook’s growth appears increasingly dependent on resolving its identity crisis and adapting to contemporary consumption patterns.Perhaps the most revealing aspect of the correspondence was Zuckerberg’s candid admission that Meta’s overall success is still heavily reliant on Facebook. Even though Instagram and WhatsApp continue to perform well in terms of engagement and user growth, he noted that Meta cannot afford to have Facebook falter.“Even if Instagram and WhatsApp do well, I don’t see a path to success for Meta if Facebook falters,” Zuckerberg wrote, signaling that despite Facebook's age, it remains a cornerstone of Meta’s ecosystem in terms of user base, advertising revenue, and brand identity.This insight is especially critical as Meta continues to diversify into other areas like metaverse development, AI, and commerce. Facebook’s foundational role means its decline could destabilize Meta’s broader ambitions.","Internal emails between Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook head Tom Alison have surfaced.

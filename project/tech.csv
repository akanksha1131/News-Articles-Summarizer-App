“NO.”

'India Must Find Its Own Elon Musk': Ex-DGMO Emphasises Superiority In Space Tech To Win Future Wars

Justine Musk revealed Elon Musk’s secret word for success

Why saying “no” mattered so much

How this insight became public

Success stories around global business leaders often focus on money, innovation, or intelligence. In the case of Elon Musk , the billionaire behind companies like Tesla and SpaceX, much has been written about his work ethic and ambition. However, one of the most direct insights into how he approaches success came not from Musk himself, but from someone who knew him long before global fame followed. That insight came from Justine Musk, his former wife and a published author.In a widely discussed public talk and later interviews, Justine Musk described a single habit she believes played a crucial role in Elon Musk’s rise. It was not a technical skill, access to capital, or luck. Instead, she spoke about his repeated and deliberate use of one word:According to her, this word helped him protect his time, energy, and focus at every stage of his career.Justine Musk spoke about Elon Musk’s approach to success during a TEDx talk titled “The Obsessive Genius”, delivered at TEDxOlympicBlvdWomen. In this talk, she explained how he consistently used the word “no” to protect his goals.As per reports, she said that Elon Musk was very clear about what he wanted to do. He didn't hesitate to say “no” to requests, distractions, or demands that didn't fit with those goals.She explained that this behaviour was not about arrogance but about focus.According to Justine Musk, the habit of saying “no” allowed Elon Musk to avoid being pulled in too many directions. As his responsibilities grew, so did the number of demands on his attention. She noted that many people fail not because they lack ability, but because they say yes too often.By refusing commitments that did not serve his long-term objectives, Musk was able to concentrate deeply on fewer things. This made him fully commit to hard projects that took a lot of time and effort.This explanation doesn't say that it's easy or socially acceptable to say ""no."" Instead, it shows how hard choices about time and focus can affect professional results for a long time.Justine Musk first talked about this point of view in public during her TEDx talk, which is still available on TED's official sites. In later interviews and essays about ambition, relationships, and power dynamics, she talked more about similar ideas.There was no advice or instruction in what she said. They were framed as personal observations based on what they had seen and done. Over time, these comments were used in news stories and articles about leadership.","Justine Musk revealed Elon Musk’s secret word for success.

'Chinese Humanoid Robots' showcased during Lunar New Year event impress everyone and 'prove' why Elon Musk said that China is only competitor Tesla has,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chinese-humanoid-robots-showcased-during-lunar-new-year-event-impress-everyone-and-prove-why-elon-musk-said-that-china-is-only-competitor-tesla-has/articleshow/128462881.cms,"“I think China will be by far the biggest competitor in the humanoid robot market. China is extremely good at scaling and manufacturing and is also strong in AI—the models being released there are already quite good and are improving rapidly.”

Why the hype around Chinese humanoid robot market has increased



“We’re gonna take the Model S and X production space in our Fremont factory and convert that into an Optimus factory … with the long-term goal of having 1 million units a year of Optimus robots in the current SX space in Fremont,”

“we’re still very much at the early stages of Optimus,”

“We wouldn’t expect to have any kind of significant Optimus production volume until probably end of this year,”

China's annual CCTV Spring Festival Gala, which is often compared to the US Super Bowl, showcased humanoid robots from four domestic startups during the Lunar New Year celebrations this week. This highlights the country's push to lead in robotics and manufacturing. The demonstration comes after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said China would be a key competitor in the humanoid robot market.During Tesla's earnings call last year, Musk said,The gala featured robots from Unitree Robotics, Galbot, Noetix, and MagicLab performing martial arts and fight sequences with swords, poles, and nunchucks alongside human child performers. The event served as a showcase for China's industrial policy and its ambitions in humanoid robotics.China is the world's largest manufacturer and user of robots. According to an industry report by Omdia, Chinese robotics firm AgiBot shipped over 5,100 humanoid robots in 2025, securing a 39% share of the global humanoid robot market.The attention surrounding China's humanoid robot sector comes as major players, including AgiBot and Unitree prepare for initial public offerings this year. Moreover, domestic artificial intelligence (AI) startups release a range of frontier models during the nine-day Lunar New Year public holiday.Last year's gala drew widespread attention with 16 full-size Unitree humanoids twirling handkerchiefs and dancing alongside human performers. Unitree's founder met President Xi Jinping weeks later at a notable tech symposium, which was the first of its kind since 2018.Xi has met five robotics startup founders in the past year, comparable to the four electric vehicle and four semiconductor entrepreneurs he met in the same timeframe, giving the emerging sector considerable visibility.Behind the spectacle of robots running marathons and executing kung fu kicks and backflips, China has positioned robotics and AI at the heart of its next-generation AI manufacturing strategy, aiming for productivity gains from automation to offset pressures from its ageing workforce.Elon Musk has said he expects his key competitors to be Chinese companies as he pivots Tesla toward a focus on embodied AI and its humanoid robot Optimus.Last month, Musk said that Tesla is betting on a future driven less by cars and more by humanoid robots, reiterating comments he made last year. During Tesla’s earnings call this week, Elon Musk outlined plans to shift focus away from vehicles toward its Optimus robots, saying the company would discontinue the Model S and Model X to prioritise robot production. Tesla said it will end production of the Model S and Model X and repurpose the California facility that built those vehicles to manufacture Optimus robots.Musk said.In 2024, Musk said Optimus could eventually make Tesla a $25 trillion company, compared with its current market value of about $1.4 trillion, and previously stated that 80% of Tesla’s value could come from robots.While Musk said Tesla plans to build a production line capable of producing one million Optimus units annually, he also acknowledged thatdescribing it as a research and development effort.Musk added.","China's annual CCTV Spring Festival Gala showcased humanoid robots from four domestic startups during the Lunar New Year celebrations this week.

Price spikes and “RAMmageddon”



Industry fallout due to global chip crisis



Echoes of past supply chain shocks



Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Xiaomi President Lu Weibing and many others are warning about a global crisis unfolding: Shortage of memory chips. The scarcity of memory chips led to their soaring costs. As a report in Bloomberg says it is beginning to hammer profits, derail corporate plans and inflate price tags on everything from laptops and smartphones to automobiles and data centers — and the crunch is only going to get worse.As per the Bloomberg report, the main driver of the squeeze is the buildout of AI data centers. Companies like Alphabet and OpenAI are buying millions of Nvidia AI accelerators, each needing a massive amounts of DRAM. This has left the consumer electronics maker fighting over dwindling supplies from Samsung and Micron. Elon Musk has also suggested that Tesla may need to build its own fabrication plant, “he said in January.The report also adds that the memory prices are increasing and going at an unprecedented levels. One of the type of DRAM jumped by 75% in a single month, with retailers adjusting prices daily. Industry insiders have dubbed the crisis “RAMmageddon.” Tim Cook warned that iPhone margins will be compressed, while Micron called the bottleneck “unprecedented.”The report also revealed the industry fallout on the global chip crisis.The report adds that Sony may delay its next PlayStation console to 2028 or 2029. Also, Nintendo is also thinking raising the prices of Switch 2. Xiaomi and Oppo may also cut shipment forecasts for 2026. Cisco cited the memory squeeze in a weak profit outlook, triggering its worst share loss in nearly four years. Lastly, Qualcomm and Arm Holdings also warned of more fallout.This global chip crisis recall the Covid-era chip shortages, but this time the driver is AI. Tech giants Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Google are pouring hundreds of billions into AI infrastructure, diverting memory production toward high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for AI accelerators. That leaves less capacity for standard DRAM used in everyday electronics.Bernstein’s Mark Li says memory prices are going “parabolic.” Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing warned the crunch will last at least through the year. Counterpoint Research estimates DRAM shortages will persist across electronics, telecom, and automotive industries, with signs of panic buying already visible.",Report: Shortage of memory chips led to soaring costs.

Mackenzie Scott, former wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has said that her approach to large-scale philanthropy is shaped by acts of kindness she received during her early years. In an essay published on her philanthropic organisation, Yield Giving website in October, Scott said she often thinks about the people who helped her when she struggled financially as a college student. She recalled borrowing money from her college roommate to avoid dropping out and receiving free dental care from a local dentist when she could not afford treatment.“It is these ripple effects that make imagining the power of any of our own acts of kindness impossible,” Scott wrote in the essay. “Whose generosity did I think of every time I made every one of the thousands of gifts I’ve been able to give?”“It was the local dentist who offered me free dental work when he saw me securing a broken tooth with denture glue in college. It was the college roommate who found me crying, and acted on her urge to loan me a thousand dollars to keep me from having to drop out in my sophomore year.”Scott, one of the most active philanthropists in recent times, has donated about 58 million Amazon shares since 2020, significantly reducing the stake she received following her divorce from Bezos in 2019. After the divorce, Mackenzie Scott received roughly a 4% stake in Amazon, amounting to about 139 million shares at the time.She has since cut that holding by around 42%.Despite this, Scott remains worth close to $28 billion, even after donating about $26 billion through her Yield Giving organisation, which she launched in 2022.Yield Giving has supported thousands of organisations across areas such as education, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), disaster relief, and community development. In recent months alone, Scott donated more than $400 million to education- and DEI-focused groups, with several recipients receiving the largest donations in their history.Recently, Garry Tan, CEO of Y Combinator shared an X post writing: ""MacKenzie Scott has given away $26B faster than anyone in history — with no oversight, and no accountability for the chaos that follows. This is not stewardship. Real philanthropy requires real care and attention. Pour sugar on the floor? You get ants."". The post caught the attention of Elon Musk who replied in affirmation. ""Yup,"" he repied endorsing Tan's critique of MacKenzie Scott's $26.4 billion donations since 2019.","Mackenzie Scott, former wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has said that her approach to large-scale philanthropy is shaped by acts of kindness.

Google responds to the lawsuit

Popular radio show host David Greene has sued Google , alleging the tech giant of ‘stealing’ his voice for its NotebookLM tool, which uses AI to create on-demand podcasts. The lawsuit, filed in Santa Clara County alleges that Google cloned Greene’s voice and distinctive broadcasting style without permission or compensation. Greene argues that Google’s NotebookLM T tool voice's rhythm, intonation, and even his characteristic verbal tics are so similar that even his friends, colleagues, and listeners assumed he'd licensed his voice to Google.“So... I’m probably the 148th person to ask this, but did you license your voice to Google? It sounds very much like you!,” a former co-worker asked David Greene in a fall 2024 email, a Washington Post report says.“I was, like, completely freaked out,” Greene told the publication, adding “It’s this eerie moment where you feel like you’re listening to yourself.”Greene said the AI voice sounds very similar to his own, and that the impact goes beyond losing a chance to make money from his best-known asset. “My voice is, like, the most important part of who I am,” Greene reportedly said.In the lawsuit, Greene’s lawyer argues that the recordings make the resemblance clear.“We have faith in the court and encourage people to listen to the example audio themselves,” said Joshua Michelangelo Stein, a partner at the firm Boies Schiller Flexner.Google responded denying the allegations. Google spokesperson José Castañeda told Washington Post: “These allegations are baseless. The sound of the male voice in NotebookLM’s Audio Overviews is based on a paid professional actor Google hired.”The Washington Post reported, “The lawsuit is the latest to pit the rights of individual human creators against the rights of a burgeoning AI industry that promises to transform the economy by enabling the on-demand generation of stunningly lifelike speech, prose, images, and video. Behind the artificial voices found in tools like NotebookLM are language models trained on vast libraries of real-life human text and speech. The humans used to train these models are unaware that their words and voices will be used by AI, raising serious questions about copyright and ownership.”","Popular radio show host David Greene has sued Google, alleging the tech giant of ‘stealing’ his voice for its NotebookLM tool, which uses AI to create on-demand podcasts.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently drew a comparison between today’s large technology companies and East India Company. In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Sridhar Vembu wrote: “Big tech is bigger than most sovereign nations. ""East India Company"" is the way to think about them”. While he did not name any single company in his post, Vembu was responding to a post noting that Google raised $32 billion in debt in a single day—an amount comparable to what a large country like India raises over several months—and issued a 100-year bond, a time horizon longer than many government bonds.“Google raised $32B of debt in 1 day, what a sovereign government like India raises in 100 days. Google also issued a 100-year bond worth $1B, which is longer than India's longest at 40 years. Big tech now operates like sovereign nations with fundraising size and time horizons,” the X post said. It referred to a Google’s recent sale of a rare 100-year bond in British pounds as part of its massive multi-currency debt raise, making it the first tech company to attempt a century bond since IBM did it back in 1996.Sridhar Vembu’s X post has sparked debate online. Commenting on Vembu's post, one user replied “They are the new EIC, but operating on a different plane of existence.The 'Money' layer of control is collapsing, so the elites are shifting to the 'Data' layer. We are moving from a world defined by the Credit Score to one defined by the Algorithm. The EIC wanted spices. Big Tech wants souls (or at least, the predictive data that mimics it)”.Another user commented saying “goes deeper than scale tho. east india company controlled trade routes, big tech controls data routes. running business infra across 3 countries and every cloud pricing change or api deprecation sends you scrambling. the dependency is invisible until the terms change”.“You are wrong Sridhar. Big Tech operates on long-term horizons, while we often trip over ROI. Look at i-flex solutions: it built world-class products like Microbanker and Flexcube that dominated global banking.

Technical Barrier High

When Denmark said it regrets purchase of F-35

America and Europe's tensions are continuing over Greenland, trade and tariffs. As up and downs continue in Europe-America relationship, Netherlands’ top defense official has added a new variable into Europe’s debate over operational autonomy. And it is whether the software architecture of F-35 jets can be altered without US approval. Recently, State Secretary for Defence Gijs Tuinman told BNR Nieuwsradio that the F-35 jet’s code could, in extremis, be “jailbroken,” comparing it to modifying an Apple iPhone’s iOS.“I’m going to say something I should never say, but I’ll do it anyway. Just like your iPhone, you can jailbreak an F-35,” Gijs Tuinman said at the BNR Nieuwsradio‘s “Boekestijn en de Wijk” podcast, which has been posted online. His remarks have been reported by Clash Report. As per the report, When asked if Europe can modify it without US approval: “That’s not the point… we’ll see whether the Americans will show their true colors. ”Tuinman took office in July 2024. He reportedly stressed that no decision by Washington to interrupt software updates or supply chains has been made. Still, the vulnerability is reportedly structural. The F-35 jets are reported to rely on regular software updates, mission data files (MDFs), and a globally coordinated maintenance system.As per Clash Report, the technical barrier is quite high as the F-35 jet's source code is said to exceed 8 million lines, protected by layered security. Analysis too has reportedly dismissed the idea of a simple “kill switch” as fiction, yet reliance on U.S.-managed updates remains central to the aircraft’s effectiveness.Escalating disputes with the Trump administration, including threats of economic coercion and tariffs, have soured relations between Europe and America since last year. In March 2025, chairman of Denmark’s parliamentary defense committee, Rasmus Jarlov, wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that he regrets selecting the F-35 stealth fighters for his country. Jarlov tweeted: “I don’t know if there is a kill switch in the F35s or not. We obviously can not take your word for it. As one of the decision-makers behind Denmark’s purchase of F35s, I regret it. The USA can certainly disable the planes by simply stopping the supply of spare parts. They want to strengthen Russia and weaken Europe and are showing that they are willing to do tremendous damage to peaceful and loyal allies like Canada just because they insist on existing as a country. I can easily imagine a situation where the USA will demand Greenland from Denmark and will threaten to deactivate our weapons and let Russia attack us when we refuse (which we will even in that situation). Therefore, buying American weapons is a security risk that we can not run. We will make enormous investments in air defense, fighter jets, artillery, and other weapons in the coming years, and we must avoid American weapons if at all possible. I encourage our allies and friends to do the same.”","Netherlands’ top defense official has added a new variable into Europe’s debate over operational autonomy.

When DeepSeek shocked America

Microsoft has banned employees from using China's DeepSeek

Microsoft president Brad Smith has once again raised his China warning. Speaking in an interview on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, Brad Smith said that American tech companies should “worry a little bit” about the subsidies their Chinese competitors receive from their government in the AI race. “I do think we always have to think about, maybe even worry a little bit about Chinese subsidies.” The Chinese government supports AI companies in various ways including via a multi-billion-dollar national investment fund and vouchers for cheaper energy for their computing needs.Smith said that subsidies from Beijing to Chinese companies were “the fundamental approach that China successfully took to disrupt the telecommunications market,” when state money and support helped companies like Huawei and ZTE expand. Microsoft president took the example of how the rise of Chinese-government supported telecom companies ZTE and Huawei resulted in the disappearance of some American and European companies as they could not fight strong competition from them. “Some American companies disappeared. European companies like Ericsson and Nokia were thrown on the defensive,” Smith added.Coming to the current scenario, where data centers have emerged as the most important part of AI infrastructure, Smith said that data centers from Chinese companies Huawei and Alibaba exist around the world and “it will not be difficult for China to subsidize those.”“I think for the rest of us, we have to compete with that, and we have to be good at competing with that, with the support of our governments,” Smith said.THis is not the first time that Smith has spoken about how the Chinese government's support to their companies puts American companies at a disadvantage. Earlier this year, he told Financial Times that the rapid adoption of Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek’s technology in emerging markets such as Africa underscores the competition that American companies face around the world. “We have to recognise that right now, unlike a year ago, China has an open-source model, and increasingly more than one, that is competitive,” he said. “They benefit from subsidisation by the Chinese government. They benefit from subsidies that enable [them] to basically undercut American companies based on price.”“If we rely on private capital flows alone, I don’t think that will be sufficient to compete with a competitor that is subsidised to the degree that Chinese companies often are, especially in those parts of the world,” he said.“Africans can’t afford very expensive solutions apart from open source, so you have to go to [Meta’s] Llama or Chinese options,” he said then. “What we do have is, as American companies, a stronger reputation for trust. We have access to better chips than the Chinese companies do . . . [but] you always have to compete on price,” Smith added.DeepSeek shocked Silicon Valley in January 2025 when it introduced its powerful AI reasoning model R1, which it claimed was trained at a lower cost with less computing power. DeepSeek's claim wiped hundreds of billions from the US stock market.Microsoft does not allow its employees to use an artificial intelligence app developed by Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, due to concerns related to data vulnerability as well as Chinese propaganda, President Brad Smith last year. Speaking at a Senate hearing on winning the AI race in May 2025 with China, Smith said that the company also doesn't carry DeepSeek's application in its app store, flagging risks posed by ""data going back to China and the app creating the kinds of content that people would say are associated with Chinese propaganda.

Facebook cofounder Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly making big bets on both coasts of the US but his latest moves suggest the Meta CEO may be preparing to say goodbye to California for good. According to a recent report, Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, pledged $50 million to Sacramento State University to build state-of-the-art STEM labs and an AI center.“These investments will help strengthen our communities and support the next generation of leaders and innovators,” said Zuckerberg, who owns a compound of 11 properties in Palo Alto’s Crescent Park neighborhood, valued at more than $110 million.According to Wall Street Journal, weeks later after the donation, Zuckerberg purchased a waterfront mansion on Indian Creek — a man-made island in Miami's Biscayne Bay often called “Billionaires Bunker.” The property is said to be a newly-completed estate and is expected to fetch between $150 million and $200 million.Zuckerberg isn’t alone who is leaving the US state. A wave of California tech titans has been quietly relocating to South Florida in recent months. Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have both made major purchases in the Miami area, reports said.Page picked up multiple properties in Coconut Grove for roughly $188 million, while Brin is reportedly in talks for a $50 million home on Biscayne Bay.Further, Venture capitalist Peter Thiel made his Florida move official by opening a Miami office for his investment firm on New Year's Eve.All the tech leaders are moving to Florida due to California's proposed Billionaire Tax Act – a ballot measure under which the state would impose a one-time 5% tax on the net worth of anyone worth over $1 billion. If it qualifies for the November ballot and passes, it would retroactively apply to anyone who was a California resident as of January 1, 2026.For Zuckerberg, whose net worth hovers around $240 billion according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, that's a potential tax bill north of $10 billion.

“The fish that got away was big.”

Nvidia has reportedly sold its entire stake in Arm Holdings. A report claims that the US chipmaker disposed of 1.1 million shares in the UK-based chip technology company, which is majority-owned by SoftBank Group, for about $140 million in the fourth quarter of last year. This comes after the second-largest company in Japan sold all of its Nvidia shares for $5.83 billion in October 2025 to finance its OpenAI investment. SoftBank reported in its November 2025 earnings that it sold 32.1 million Nvidia shares and invested $30 billion in OpenAI, gaining an 11% stake in the company behind ChatGPT.A Bloomberg report cited an Nvidia regulatory document to claim that the company does not presently own any shares in Arm. Furthermore, a rather complex relationship between the two chip companies comes to an end with the sale of shares. In 2020, Nvidia consented to purchase Arm for $40 billion. In the semiconductor industry, this was one of the biggest acquisitions. Regulators and consumers opposed the deal, arguing that Arm's independence was essential because its technology powers most of the world's cutting-edge semiconductors.After the two parties ended the deal in February 2022, Arm went public.Currently, Nvidia has become a significant investor across the technology industry, holding stakes in Intel, Nokia, CoreWeave, and Synopsys, and has committed to using its resources to accelerate the adoption of artificial intelligence computing.During an investor presentation last year, Yoshimitsu Goto, SoftBank’s chief financial officer, said,He added that the sales were part of the company’s broader strategy ofA person familiar with the matter told CNBC that proceeds from the Nvidia and T-Mobile share sales, along with a margin loan secured against SoftBank’s stake in Arm, will act as “sources of cash” to fund SoftBank’s planned $22.5 billion investment in OpenAI.The funds are also expected to support other initiatives, including the acquisition of ABB’s robotics unit. The results come three years after SoftBank reported its largest-ever loss.Although the move surprised some investors, it marks the second time SoftBank has exited Nvidia. Its Vision Fund invested around $4 billion in the chipmaker in 2017 before selling its entire stake in 2019.In 2024, SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son said he viewed Nvidia as a missed opportunity after the firm sold its holding ahead of a sharp rise in the share price, describing it asUntil 2019, SoftBank was Nvidia’s largest shareholder, holding 4.9% of the company’s shares.",SoftBank sold 1.1 million shares in the UK-based chip technology company for about $140 million in the fourth quarter of last year.

Poland has officially banned Chinese-made cars from entering the country’s military facilities. The Chief of the General Staff of the Polish Armed Forces said that the move reduces the risk ofThis comes after a risk analysis was conducted in relation to the increasing use of digital systems in vehicles. This move is meant to enhance the security of the infrastructure. Other than that, Poland has also prohibited government workers fromIn a blog post, the Polish army said that the move addresses concerns about digital systems in modern vehicles and their potential for data collection. However, NATO member Poland still maintains trade ties with China. SAIC Motor Corp.'s MG brand, Chery Automobile Co.'s models, and BYD Co. led sales among Chinese auto manufacturers in Poland.In a blog post, the Polish army’s Colonel Marek Pietrzak said that the restrictions also apply to other motor vehicles equipped with devices capable of recording position, image, or sound. Such vehicles will be permitted within protected areas of military installations if certain functions are disabled and appropriate preventive measures are implemented in accordance with facility security regulations.Commanders, chiefs, and unit leaders must, to the extent possible, provide alternative parking spaces for restricted vehicles outside military units, the blog said.The Polish army made it clear, though, that these rules will not be applicable to military facilities that are open to the public, such as clinics, hospitals, libraries, prosecutors' offices, and garrison clubs.Official vehicles and military equipment belonging to the Polish Armed Forces are also exempt from the restrictions, and the same will not apply during rescue operations or activities carried out by state and local government bodies, services, inspections, and guards as part of their statutory duties.The Chief of the General Staff of the Polish Armed Forces has also requested that his superiors take steps to establish appropriate legal and technical conditions that enable manufacturers of vehicles equipped with advanced monitoring systems to obtain information security approval.The aim is to introduce transparent, non-discriminatory mechanisms to verify the safety of vehicles offered on the Polish market while meeting requirements to protect sensitive infrastructure, the blog noted.Modern vehicles equipped with advanced communication systems and sensors can collect and transmit data, which requires appropriate security regulations for their use in protected areas, Pietrzak added.He also noted that the measures are preventive and consistent with practices used by NATO countries and other allies to ensure strong standards for defence infrastructure protection.These steps are a part of a larger process of modifying security protocols to the evolving technological landscape and contemporary demands for safeguarding vital infrastructure, the blog post highlighted.",Poland has banned Chinese-made cars from entering the country’s military facilities.

This infrastructure upgrade, particularly the new gateway in Visakhapatnam, aims to enhance AI accessibility and economic growth. The initiative is part of Google's substantial investment in India's AI capabilities.

Three new undersea paths, one new gateway city

Sundar Pichai Unveils ‘India-America Connect’ to Power Massive Subsea Cable Expansion

Why Google says better cables mean better AI access

India becomes a bigger piece of Google's global spending spree

Alphabet's Google has announced a major new infrastructure push in India—new fiber-optic routes that will connect the country with the United States and several locations across the Southern Hemisphere. CEO Sundar Pichai made the announcement at an AI summit in New Delhi, where he also met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The initiative sits under Google's already-announced $15 billion AI infrastructure investment in India over five years.At the core of America-India Connect are three new subsea cable paths—connecting India to Singapore, South Africa, and Australia—plus four fiber-optic routes linking the US, India, and the Southern Hemisphere.The more interesting detail is Vizag. Google is building direct fiber connections from Visakhapatnam to both South Africa and Singapore, turning the east coast city into a proper international subsea gateway. India's existing cable landings are clustered around Mumbai and Chennai, so Vizag adds real geographic diversity to the country's internet infrastructure.On the west coast, a new Mumbai-to-Western Australia cable will slot in alongside existing Pacific routes.The argument Google is making is straightforward: reliable infrastructure is the most practical counter to an AI divide. More subsea capacity typically means cheaper, faster internet—which feeds into productivity and economic growth at scale.Alongside the cable announcements, Google.org pledged $30 million to improve public services with AI and another $30 million for scientific research. Google DeepMind is also launching a new partnership with the Indian government to deploy its frontier AI for Science models locally.The India push is one slice of a much larger spending blitz. Google said its capital expenditures could hit $185 billion this year alone, with recent commitments in Belgium, the UK, and South Carolina.For Google, India is clearly more than just a growth market at this point—it now has its largest global campus in Bangalore and a fast-expanding roster of local partnerships.","Google unveils new undersea fiber-optic cables connecting India to the US, Singapore, South Africa, and Australia.

Anthropic's top exec answers why Anthropic is hiring engineers when 'Claude Code is writing 100% of code'; says: Engineering is….,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/anthropics-top-exec-answers-why-anthropic-is-hiring-engineers-when-claude-code-is-writing-100-of-code-says-engineering-is-/articleshow/128514066.cms,"Anthropic's AI, Claude Code, now generates nearly all internal code, prompting questions about its 100+ open engineering roles. Executives clarify human engineers are crucial for prompting, customer interaction, and strategic decisions. This shift elevates engineers to focus on system design and product direction, with AI handling repetitive coding tasks. The trend signifies a significant evolution in software development.

Claude is writing Claude—but humans are still running the show

AI is handling the grunt work—engineers are making the bigger calls

Anthropic's own executives have confirmed it—Claude Code is now writing nearly 100% of the company's internal code. So when the company's job page still shows 100+ open engineering positions, the obvious question is: what exactly are these engineers supposed to do Boris Cherny, head of Claude Code, addressed this directly when an X user flagged the apparent contradiction. His answer was simple. ""Someone has to prompt the Claudes, talk to customers, coordinate with other teams, decide what to build next,"" he wrote. ""Engineering is changing and great engineers are more important than ever.""The backdrop here matters. At the 2026 Cisco AI Summit, Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger confirmed that the company's AI tools now generate nearly all of its internal code. ""Claude products and Claude code are being entirely written by Claude,"" he said—building on CEO Dario Amodei's earlier prediction that AI would handle 90% of coding, a figure that has since been surpassed inside Anthropic itself.Boris Cherny added more colour in a Fortune interview, saying he personally hasn't written a single line of code in over two months, shipping 22 to 27 pull requests a day—all 100% Claude-generated.What this means in practice is that engineers have moved up the stack. Repetitive tasks—drafting features, refactoring, writing documentation—now belong to Claude.

Why the Expo is 'closed' on February 19

In a move to manage ‘record-breaking’ crowds and accommodate high-profile diplomatic events, the government has announced a major change to the schedule of the India AI Expo 2026. The exhibition, currently held at Bharat Mandapam, will remain closed to the general public on Thursday, February 19. However, to make up for the closure, the government has officially extended the expo by an additional day, meaning it will now remain open until Saturday, February 21.“The expo has been extended by a day due to huge enthusiasm,” said S. Krishnan, Secretary of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), as per multiple reports. He added that the decision was made to ensure a “smoother and more comfortable experience” for the tens of thousands of visitors eager to see the latest in artificial intelligence.The closure is due to a series of restricted-access events involving world leaders and top-tier security protocols. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to officially inaugurate the India AI Impact Summit on the morning of February 19.The day will be packed with high-stakes diplomacy and industrial strategy. These events include addresses by PM Modi, the President of France, and the Secretary-General of the United Nations; a private walkthrough of the pavilions by the PM and visiting Heads of State at 11:00 am; a meeting at noon to discuss global AI governance and infrastructure, and n evening session at 5:30 pm connecting government leaders with the world’s most powerful tech executives.Apart from extending a day, the government has also extended the daily visiting hours until 8:00 pm.The Summit will bring together more than 500 Global AI Leaders, including CEOs/CXOs, around 100 CEOs and Founders, 150 Academicians and Researchers, and 400 CTOs, VPs, and Philanthropists. It will also engage over 100 government representatives, including more than 20 Heads of State and Government and around 60 Ministers and Vice Ministers.","India AI Expo 2026 will remain closed to the general public on Thursday, February 19.

PM Modi Holds Meeting With Google CEO Sundar Pichai Amid AI Impact Summit 2026 In Delhi

Designed for a country that speaks 22 languages

Open-source ambitions, government-backed compute

Indian AI startup Sarvam unveiled two large language models on Tuesday, trained from scratch and built specifically for Indian languages—direct challenge to Google OpenAI and Anthropic in one of the world's fastest-growing AI markets.The announcement came at the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, where Prime Minister Modi has been pushing hard to establish India as a serious AI player. Sarvam's new lineup includes a 30-billion and a 105-billion parameter model, both using a mixture-of-experts architecture that activates only a portion of parameters at a time—keeping costs down while maintaining performance. The 30B model handles real-time conversations with a 32,000-token context window; the larger 105B stretches to 128,000 tokens for complex, multi-step tasks.The models support all 22 official Indian languages and are optimised for voice-first interaction—a practical call in a country where most people are far more comfortable speaking than typing in English. The company's vision model also achieved over 84% accuracy on document intelligence tasks involving Indian scripts, reportedly beating global models many times its size. Sarvam says it trained both on trillions of tokens of Indian-language data, including mixed-language text like Hinglish.The training was funded through India's government-backed IndiaAI Mission, with infrastructure from data center operator Yotta and hardware support from Nvidia. Both models are planned for open-source release, though Sarvam hasn't confirmed if the training data or code will be included.Backed by Lightspeed and Khosla Ventures with over $50 million raised, Sarvam is valued at around $200 million—tiny next to OpenAI's $500 billion. But in a market defined by language diversity and a hunger for sovereign AI infrastructure, that gap matters less than it might elsewhere.","Sarvam unveils two large language models, built from the ground up for Indian languages.

Founder of AI company that Mark Zuckerberg spent $2 billion-plus on makes a long clarification on OpenClaw that Sam Altman just bought,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/founder-of-ai-company-that-mark-zuckerberg-spent-2-billion-plus-on-makes-a-long-clarification-on-openclaw-that-sam-altman-just-bought/articleshow/128508992.cms,"Manus co-founder Yichao 'Peak' Ji clarified his company's new personal agent mode is independent of OpenClaw, despite OpenAI's recent acquisition of the latter. Ji acknowledged OpenClaw's philosophical contribution to agent safety boundaries, while highlighting Manus's own robust security features. Manus is now prioritizing accessibility and natural language interaction.

Ji says OpenClaw shaped industry thinking on where agents should draw the line

Manus is now moving away from those guardrails toward faster, simpler access

Here is Manus co-founder Yichao 'Peak' Ji's post in full:

""Well, I think I need to clarify this: Manus personal agent mode is not based on OpenClaw. It is still built entirely on Manus's in-house architecture.

That said, I still believe it's necessary to pay respect to the OpenClaw project, because it further experimented with and helped shape the 'safety boundary' between users and agents.

Exactly one year ago today, we were doing the final polishing before Manus's release. The problem that troubled us the most at the time was actually: How do you make users trust an agent? This isn't about the source code — it's about the uncertainty that comes with limitless possibility.

Back then, non-technical users, and really the entire world, had no concrete experience with AI agents. User education therefore fell onto a small startup.

To address this, we designed four things: Cloud Sandbox: A fully isolated virtual machine is launched for each task so it cannot affect the user's own computer. Task Replay: You can replay tasks shared by others in read-only mode to safely explore what an agent is. Interruptible Action Chain: You can inspect the agent's step-by-step actions and interrupt or correct them on the fly. GUI Takeover: Whenever login or human intervention is required, the agent requests the user to take control of the browser, mouse, and keyboard.

These safety measures accompanied Manus through its first year. They allowed millions of users to experience a general agent for the first time, and eventually became standard features across agent products.

Times have changed. As agents complete tasks more reliably, run faster, models grow smarter, and users become more familiar with them, we believe it's time to move from 'building trust' toward 'lowering the barrier'.

We are now doing this by: Reusing Manus's mature virtualization layer so users can use it without configuration. Introducing a new context-management system so users won't need to switch sessions in messengers. Using intelligent subagent scheduling to parallelize tasks while balancing speed and quality. Replacing more slash commands and menus with natural language.

This strongly aligns with our long-standing mission: To extend human reach. To put the full power of AI to work by unlocking the code, not just for engineers but for everyone.""

Just days after Sam Altman announced that OpenAI had hired OpenClaw's solo creator Peter Steinberger, the co-founder of a rival AI agent company has stepped in with a pointed clarification. Yichao 'Peak' Ji, co-founder and Chief Scientist at Manus—which Meta acquired for over $2 billion earlier this year—says his company's new personal agent mode has no connection to OpenClaw whatsoever.The timing matters. Manus launched its personal agent mode on Telegram shortly after OpenAI's acquisition of OpenClaw made headlines, and the internet quickly started drawing comparisons between the two. That's what prompted Ji to post. ""Manus personal agent mode is not based on OpenClaw. It is still built entirely on Manus's in-house architecture,"" he wrote in a lengthy post on X. He still gave OpenClaw its due—crediting it not for any technical overlap, but for helping the industry think through the trust and safety questions that come with handing tasks over to an autonomous agent.According to Ji, OpenClaw's real contribution was philosophical.It helped define what he calls the ""safety boundary"" between users and agents—how much autonomy is too much, and when should an agent hand control back.That was a question Manus was already wrestling with a year ago before its own launch. Its answer was four design choices baked into the product from day one: a cloud sandbox isolating each task in its own virtual machine, a task replay mode, an interruptible action chain, and a GUI takeover option that returns control to the user on demand. Ji says these have since become standard features across the agent industry.With that trust now largely established, Ji says Manus is shifting gears. The new agent mode is built around accessibility—natural language replacing menus, smarter scheduling to run tasks in parallel, and a context-management system that keeps things coherent across sessions.The clarification lands against an already charged backdrop. OpenClaw went from buzzy open-source project to OpenAI acquisition in weeks, with both Meta and OpenAI reportedly making billion-dollar offers for Steinberger. Meta lost that race despite Zuckerberg personally spending a week testing OpenClaw and sending Steinberger detailed notes. With Manus already in Meta's portfolio, Ji appears keen to make one thing clear: whatever OpenAI just bought, it isn't what Manus is built on.","Manus co-founder Yichao 'Peak' Ji says his company's new personal agent mode is independent of OpenClaw, despite OpenAI's recent acquisition of the latter.

From 'irrational exuberance' to 'railroad investments': How Pichai frames the AI spending era

Google Cloud's $240 billion backlog is doing a lot of the heavy lifting in Pichai's argument

With Alphabet going all-in, the pressure is on to show real returns—not just projections

Back in November, Alphabet and Google parent company's CEO Sundar Pichai openly flagged ""elements of irrationality"" in the AI investment boom—drawing parallels to the dot-com era and warning that no company, including Google, would be immune if the bubble burst. It was a rare moment of candour from a Big Tech CEO. Two months on, with Alphabet having just committed up to $185 billion in capex for 2026—nearly double what analysts had pencilled in—he's back on the front foot, making the case for why the numbers make sense.Speaking on the sidelines of the India AI Impact Summit 2026 in Delhi, Pichai didn't shy away from the scale of it. ""This is the Industrial Revolution, but 10 times faster. In fact, larger,"" he told moderator Debjani Ghosh, Distinguished Fellow at NITI Aayog. ""I think the investment makes sense given the progress in the technology we are seeing and the opportunities we see on top of it.""In that November interview with the BBC, Pichai had drawn a direct parallel to the dot-com boom—acknowledging that investment cycles like this tend to ""overshoot,"" and that while AI would ultimately prove as transformational as the internet, the current moment was ""both rational and there are elements of irrationality.""He also warned that every company, including Alphabet, would feel the impact if the bubble were to burst.This time, he reached for a different historical analogy. Rather than the cautionary tale of the dot-com crash, Pichai invoked railroad expansion and the US national highway system—infrastructure bets that looked expensive at the time but unlocked enormous economic value down the line.It's a framing Alphabet clearly needs right now. When the company revealed its 2026 capex target in early February—nearly double what analysts had expected—shares fell more than 6% in after-hours trading. Alphabet wasn't alone: Amazon pledged $200 billion, Meta committed up to $135 billion, and Microsoft's capex bill is projected to top $97 billion. Together, Big Tech is set to spend well over $600 billion on AI infrastructure this year.Pichai's strongest card? Cold, hard numbers. Google Cloud's backlog—future agreements for computing capacity—has doubled to $240 billion over the past year. Cloud revenue itself jumped 48% year-on-year in Q4 2025. Gemini, Google's AI assistant, has crossed 750 million monthly active users. And a new deal to power Apple's redesigned Siri gives Alphabet access to over 2.5 billion devices.""The backlog has doubled to $240 billion. So that shows the potential for return on the other side,"" Pichai said in Delhi.Still, investor skepticism hasn't fully faded. Alphabet's stock was down roughly 2% the morning after Amazon's own eye-watering capex announcement, as markets collectively processed what a $600 billion-plus infrastructure buildout actually means for near-term profitability.Pichai has consistently argued that Google's unique position—owning everything from its own AI chips to YouTube's data to frontier research at DeepMind—gives it more leverage than most to ride out any turbulence.

'AI Will Create More Than It Destroys': Microsoft India Chief Puneet Chandok Predicts 3-Year Rise

American venture capitalist Vinod Khosla and the co-founder of Sun Microsystems has now proposed a radical rethink of US taxation in light of the impact of artificial intelligence on jobs. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Khosla argued that as AI eliminated millions of roles, the labour portion of the economy will shrink sharply, requiring the governments to shift the tax burden from wages to capital.“AI will transform economies and need a rethink of capitalism & equity. Labor portion of economy (vs capital) will decline sharply. Should we eliminate preferential treatment of capital gains tax and equalize to ordinary income? 40% of capital gains taxes are paid by those with income >$10m/year! This video is just the professions being automated in our current portfolio!,” wrote Kholsa.Khosla also shared a video along with his post highlighting the professions at risk from AI. Khosla believes that the jobs at risk include accountants, therapists, truck drivers and chip designers. Earlier also, Khosla predicted that within 25 years, AI could perform 80% of the work in 80% of the jobs, making universal basic income (UBI) a likely necessity.Khosla’s comments add to a growing chorus of tech leaders warning of AI’s disruptive potential. Elon Musk has suggested that work could become “optional” and money “irrelevant” in a future of abundant AI‑driven resources. By contrast, skeptics like Michael Burry have cautioned that the AI boom may be a speculative bubble, with companies overinvesting in chips and data centers that could quickly become obsolete.","Vinod Khosla has proposed a radical rethink of US taxation in light of the impact of artificial intelligence on jobs.

Canadian billionaire investor and former Shark Tank investor, Kevin O’Leary has urged the US government not to follow the heavy regulation path of the Europe. O’Leary warned that this could cost America its leadership in the global AI race. In an interview with Fox News, O’Leary argued that Europe’s strict rules after World War II drove innovators and capital to the United States. ““After the Second World War, they screwed themselves. They put a regulatory environment in so onerous that everybody just brought their dough to the United States and developed their companies here. And stole the people that were innovators,” O’Leary said.He further contrasted Europe’s struggles with the United Arab Emirates, which he praised for its pro-business polices. ““They innovate, they’re number three in AI now. And they have nothing to do with Europe in terms of regulations,” he added.O’Leary has also cautioned that the US risks losing its edge in AI if it imposes restrictive chip policies and fails to upgrade its power grid. He noted that the energy infrastructure of America has not kept pace with the soaring demands of AI data centres, while China is rapidly expanding its power capacity.Along with this, O’Leary also criticised US export restrictions on AI chips, arguing that selling them globally even to rivals would strengthen American dominance and attract top talent. “We should keep bringing over any genius from anywhere and train them here otherwise the Chinese will,” he said.For O’Leary, the future of AI leadership will be determined not just by funding but by reliable, affordable energy and the ability to attract global innovators.

At any given point in time, a particular sector becomes hot, such as ecommerce, social networking, SaaS and now AI ...

It is worth keeping in mind that when Nvidia was steadily building towards their GPGPU vision and made smart acquisitions like high speed interconnect firm Mellanox, those areas had no media attention.

Smart entrepreneurs should ask ""what areas are important that are not in the limelight?""

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has cautioned entrepreneurs against chasing hype-driven sectors, saying that businesses built away from public attention often deliver stronger long-term value. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Vembu said technology trends move in phases, with one sector becoming “hot” at a given time. ""Prestige and limelight are often the enemy of profit in business,"" he said. He listed examples such as e-commerce, social networking, software-as-a-service (SaaS), and now artificial intelligence (AI), which is currently drawing widespread attention from investors and the media.Sridhar Vembu said that while these sectors attract “prestige and limelight”, they are not always where the best business opportunities lie. In the post, he cited Nvidia’s early years as an example, writing that the company steadily worked on its general-purpose GPU strategy and made key acquisitions, including high-speed interconnect firm Mellanox, at a time when those technologies were largely ignored.According to Vembu, this lack of attention allowed Nvidia to build strong capabilities without intense competition or pressure from short-term expectations.He argued that entrepreneurs should focus on identifying areas that are important but overlooked, rather than following popular trends.Speaking at India AI Impact Summit 2026, Sridhar Vembu said that India has a significant advantage due to its young population. ""With our vast youth population, we have the most AI enthusiastic population in the world.

'India wants data sovereignty and we're delivering it': Microsoft's Puneet Chandok on the $17.5 billion India commitment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/india-wants-data-sovereignty-and-were-delivering-it-microsofts-puneet-chandok-on-the-17-5-billion-india-commitment/articleshow/128496308.cms,"Microsoft's Puneet Chandok sits down with TimesofIndia.com to unpack the company's $17.5 billion India commitment—its largest in Asia. From sovereign cloud infrastructure and in-country data processing to India's transition from DPI to ""AI PI,"" Chandok lays out why five factors—infrastructure, capital, talent, policy, and market demand—made India the obvious choice for Microsoft's biggest bet.

'AI Will Create More Than It Destroys': Microsoft India Chief Puneet Chandok Predicts 3-Year Rise

Five signals. One year. A 6x bet.

Why data sovereignty is the centrepiece of Microsoft's India play

Data centres, talent, and 310 million workers

DPI was the foundation. AI PI is the next chapter.

Building AI from India, for the world

The $17.5 billion is in. What comes next

India has made one thing clear about its AI future—it wants to own it. Own the data, own the infrastructure, own the models. At the AI Impact Summit 2026 in New Delhi this week—the first global AI summit hosted in the Global South, with 35,000-plus delegates from over 100 countries—that message is impossible to miss. Twelve indigenous foundation models are being unveiled, the BharatGen multilingual AI platform supporting 22 Indian languages is going public, and a Rs 10,370 crore national AI mission is backing it all.And right in the middle of that push,Microsoft is placing its biggest bet on a single country in Asia—$17.5 billion in India over four years. The message from Redmond is simple: if India wants sovereign AI, Microsoft wants to be the one helping build the pipes.Speaking to TimesofIndia.com on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit 2026 in New Delhi, Puneet Chandok, President of Microsoft India and South Asia, laid out what that means in practice—from the thinking behind the investment, to the physical infrastructure taking shape, to why he believes India has an edge that no other large economy can replicate.Microsoft committed $3 billion to India in January 2025. By December, that figure had grown nearly six-fold. So what happened in between?Chandok points to five things coming together simultaneously.""There's massive infrastructure build out. There's capital coming in. There's talent—we've got 22,000 engineers in India building for the world. There's a real policy framework that's supporting this. And then there's market demand,"" he said. ""Not many countries in the world have those five things—infrastructure, capital, talent, policy and market demand—coming together. ""It's worth noting just how competitive the landscape has become. Google announced a $15 billion plan to build AI and data centre infrastructure in India. Amazon continues to pour billions into AWS expansion. OpenAI and Anthropic have both set up offices in the country. India, seemingly overnight, has become the most contested AI market outside the US and China.Against that backdrop, Microsoft's decision to nearly 6x its commitment in under a year makes more sense. ""We looked even further ahead and said, how do we invest more in this country to not just meet the demand but also build for the future?"" Chandok said.And infrastructure alone isn't the play. ""There's no point building infrastructure if you're not scaling the talent,"" he added, pointing to Microsoft's commitment to skill 20 million Indians in AI by 2030. Through its ADVANTA(I)GE India initiative, the company says it has already trained 5.6 million people since January 2025—well ahead of its original target.If there's one word that defines India's AI moment, it's sovereignty. The government's push for indigenous models, domestic data processing, and homegrown AI solutions has been unmistakable—and Microsoft is positioning itself squarely within that framework.The company is launching Sovereign Public Cloud and Sovereign Private Cloud processing for Copilot in India, making the country one of only four markets globally with in-country data processing. ""Indian customers and the Indian government want data sovereignty, and we are happy to deliver that,"" Chandok said.The implications are significant. In-country data processing means Indian enterprise and government data stays within Indian borders—processed locally, governed locally. For sectors like banking, healthcare, and defence—where data residency isn't optional—this is a foundational requirement. For a country that has made digital self-reliance a policy priority, with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act on the books and AI governance frameworks under development, this is exactly the kind of commitment India has been pushing global tech companies to make.A large chunk of the investment is going into physical infrastructure, with Hyderabad at the centre. Microsoft's largest hyperscale data centre region in India—with three availability zones and a footprint Chandok describes as ""roughly the size of two Eden Gardens stadiums combined""—is set to go live by mid-2026, giving the company its biggest data centre capacity in the country. Expansions are also underway at existing data centre regions in Chennai and Pune.But Chandok was careful to note this isn't just a hardware story. ""A lot is also going back to our talent in the country. We're building AI for the world from India with our massive engineering presence. And then building solutions for India,"" he said.One example he pointed to is Microsoft's partnership with the Ministry of Labour and Employment, where AI is being integrated into e-Shram and the National Career Service—two platforms that serve over 310 million unorganised workers. The AI-powered upgrades include multilingual access, AI-driven job matching, predictive skill analytics, and automated resume tools. ""We're creating job opportunities for them through AI-powered matching, skilling, and career pathways,"" Chandok said.It's a telling illustration of what Microsoft is trying to demonstrate in India—that AI investment isn't just about enterprise software and cloud revenue. It's about embedding into the country's public infrastructure in ways that directly touch citizens.Ask Chandok what gives India a genuine advantage in the global AI race, and the answer is immediate—Digital Public Infrastructure.India's DPI stack—Aadhaar (1.3 billion biometric identities), UPI (processing billions of transactions monthly), DigiLocker, and a growing ecosystem of interoperable digital platforms—is something no other large democracy has replicated at scale. It's the foundation that enabled India to deliver direct benefit transfers to hundreds of millions during the pandemic, and it's the reason the country's digital payments story became a global reference point.Now, Chandok argues, AI is the next layer.""We have a massive advantage in India, which is DPI,"" he said. ""We have the ability to take DPI, complement that with our entrepreneurial energy, complement that with the policy framework that the government is building, and almost transition from DPI to AI PI—AI public infrastructure.""It's a striking framing. Chandok argues that AI in India should be built the way DPI was built—as public infrastructure. ""It should be safe, open, trusted, scalable. Imagine embedding AI into every one of our digital public infrastructure platforms. It'll make it even more effective and allow us to diffuse it to every Indian.""The early signs are already visible. Thirty-eight million smallholder farmers across India received AI-driven monsoon forecasts via SMS in 2025, with analyses suggesting a return of over $100 for every $1 spent on those forecasts. BharatGen, India's first government-funded multimodal model, is designed to work across India's 22 official languages. And platforms like Bhashini—supporting 35-plus languages with over 1,600 AI models—are being deployed across railway stations and government services.If AI can be layered on top of India's DPI with the same philosophy—open, interoperable, population-scale—India isn't just adopting AI. It's building a model no one else can copy.Beyond infrastructure and sovereignty, Chandok stressed that India's role in Microsoft's global AI story is fundamentally shifting. The country isn't just consuming AI tools—it's building them.""India is building products for the world—from India to the world. The ideas coming out of India are massive,"" he said. Microsoft employs over 22,000 engineers across Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Gurugram, Noida, and other cities—teams that don't just localise global products but build core AI tools like Copilot Studio, Azure AI Search, AI agents, speech and translation services, and Azure Machine Learning from scratch. A significant chunk of the AI products used by enterprises worldwide are being engineered out of Indian offices.India is also home to over 1,800 Global Capability Centres—including more than 500 focused on AI—making it one of the largest concentrations of AI engineering talent anywhere in the world. The country ranks second globally in public generative AI projects on GitHub and is home to 16 per cent of the world's AI talent. The demand for AI professionals in India is projected to reach 1 million by 2026.For Microsoft, the investment in Indian talent isn't just about serving the Indian market—it's about making India a core engine of its global AI product line.The $17.5 billion makes Microsoft's intent clear. But sovereign AI infrastructure is only as good as what it enables on the ground. India's challenge now isn't attracting investment—it's making sure that investment translates into something a small business in Indore or a district hospital in Odisha can actually use.The foundation is being laid—the data centres, the sovereign cloud, the DPI-AI integration, the skilling programmes. What gets built on top of it is the part that matters. And that story is just getting started.","Microsoft committed $3 billion to India in January 2025. By December, that figure had grown nearly six-fold. Puneet Chandok, President of Microsoft India and South Asia, laid out what that means in practice. Chandok: If India wants sovereign AI, Microsoft wants to be the one helping build the pipes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128496308,imgsize-930648,width-400,resizemode-4/128496308.jpg"

Demis Hassabis makes a huge AI prediction for humanity



Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis has cautioned against overstating the significance of AI systems like Gemini and ChatGPT solving international Maths Olympiad problems. Speaking at the India AI Impact Summit 2026, Hassabis said that while these feats showcase reasoning, they don’t prove the systems are anywhere near general intelligence. “Today’s systems can get gold medals in the International Maths Olympiad, really hard problems, but sometimes can still make mistakes on elementary maths if you pose the question in a certain way,” Hassabis said. “A true general intelligence system shouldn’t have that kind of jaggedness.”As reported by ANI, speaking at the summit Hassabis noted that still excelling at the complex Olympiad‑level problems, the same systems can still make mistakes on elementary maths if questions are posed differently.""When I look at the current systems and what's missing from them being a kind of general intelligence, I would say things like continual learning, so learning after they've been trained and put out into the world. Hassabis also outlined the many critical gaps in the current AI system. Google AI CEO said that the present models are ‘frozen’ after training and they cannot adapt online from new experiences. He added that AI can handle short-term tasks but struggles with coherent strategies spanning years.Also, the systems excel in some areas but it fail in others, even within the same domain,"" added Hassabis.For Hassabis, the next frontier is building AI that can learn continuously, plan long‑term, and maintain consistency across tasks. Without these capabilities, Olympiad‑level problem‑solving remains a narrow achievement rather than proof of true intelligence.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said that one of the most important uses of artificial intelligence (AI) will be improving human health. In a post shared on X (formerly Twitter), Hassabis said AI is already helping speed up drug discovery and could change how new medicines are developed at Isomorphic Labs that he co-founded in 2021. His comments come amid wider debate over AI’s impact on jobs and automation, with Hassabis highlighting healthcare as a key area where AI could deliver long-term benefits for humanity. “One of the most important things we can use AI for is to improve human health,” Hassabis wrote in an X post.“A biotech startup might do one or two drugs its entire corporate life,” Hassabis told Fortune. “But we’re trying to build a system, a process, and all the technology to do maybe dozens of drugs each year. That seems crazy right now, but I think eventually, over the next 10 to 20 years, we could get to finding a solution to all disease…if we have a process that can find these needles in a haystack.”","Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis has cautioned against overstating the significance of AI systems like Gemini and ChatGPT solving international Maths Olympiad problems.

Apple's Foldable iPhone is Coming, Here’s Why it Matters

Apple's Siri pendant borrows the Humane AI Pin concept—But as an iPhone accessory

AirPods With cameras are the closest to shipping

Apple is ramping up development of three AI-powered wearables— smart glasses, a wearable pendant, and camera-equipped AirPods— all designed to connect to the iPhone and give Siri a pair of eyes. Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the plans.The glasses, codenamed N50, are the most advanced of the three. They pack two cameras — one high-resolution sensor for photos and video, and a second dedicated to computer vision, similar to LiDAR on iPhones. There's no display in the lens, so everything runs through voice: phone calls, music, navigation, and Siri queries. Apple is aiming for a late 2026 production start and a 2027 launch.Instead of partnering with an eyewear brand the way Meta has with Ray-Ban, Apple is building its own frames using high-end materials, including acrylic elements. Multiple sizes and colors are planned.The pendant is perhaps the most unusual of the three. It's AirTag-sized, clips to clothing or hangs on a necklace, and functions essentially as an always-on camera feeding visual context to Siri. Unlike the ill-fated Humane AI Pin, it has no projector and leans heavily on the iPhone for processing.Whether it'll include a speaker for two-way Siri conversations is still undecided, Bloomberg says.The pendant is the earliest-stage product and could still be canceled. If it moves forward, a 2027 launch is possible.Camera-equipped AirPods are the furthest along in development and could arrive as soon as this year. The cameras are low-resolution and built for AI awareness, not photography — meant to help Siri understand surroundings rather than capture memories.The push comes as Apple plays catch-up with Meta, whose Ray-Ban glasses have become a genuine consumer hit, and OpenAI, which is developing wearables in collaboration with ex-Apple design chief Jony Ive.","Apple is working on three AI-powered wearables.

Perplexity prioritise revenue over reach

Ads in ChatGPT

Perplexity, the AI search startup has made its stand clear that it will not put ads inside its chatbot answers. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at a roundtable with reporters this week, executives said that company is focused on subscription and enterprise sales and not on advertising. The stance aligns Perplexity more closely with Anthropic, which has also rejected ads, and sets it apart from OpenAI , which is leaning heavily into ad‑based monetization.Perplexity is ramping up its business sales strategy and is now targeting large organisations and high-powered users such as finance professionals, CEOs and doctors. The company presently just has five people on its enterprise sales team but it plans to expand aggressively. This positions Perplexity against rivals like Glean, which helps employees search internal files and data with AI.The report further adds that executives also mentioned that Perplexity will give prioritise revenue and retention over metrics like the number of questions answered. The company did not share the financial details but revealed that its revenue grew 4.7 times last year, hitting $200 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by October 2025.The company also pledged to keep a free tier available, but with rare limits.The move comes amid Silicon Valley skepticism. At an AI conference last year, investors informally voted Perplexity the company they’d most like to bet against, citing concerns about the wider AI bubble. Still, Perplexity insists it has been “busy building” rather than chasing hype, and executives argue that ads in AI answers undermine trust.By siding with Anthropic’s philosophy and rejecting OpenAI’s ad‑driven approach, Perplexity is betting that trust and enterprise adoption will be stronger long‑term drivers of growth.Recently, OpenAI started testing ads in ChatGPT. The company said it has started testing ads in the AI tool in the United States and will apply only to logged-in adult users on the Free and Go plans. “We’re starting to roll out a test for ads in ChatGPT today to a subset of free and Go users in the U.S,” OpenAI said in an X post adding “Ads do not influence ChatGPT’s answers. Ads are labeled as sponsored and visually separate from the response. Our goal is to give everyone access to ChatGPT for free with fewer limits, while protecting the trust they place in it for important and personal tasks.”","Perplexity will not put ads inside its chatbot answers.

‘Crucial Role For India In AI Governance’: Duncan Cass-Beggs At AI Summit

How to use Claude Sonnet 4.6

AI company Anthropic whose workplace tool triggered a massive IT stock sell off earlier this month has launched Claude Sonnet 4.6 as its “most capable Sonnet model yet”. In a blog post, the Claude-maker said Sonnet 4.6 is a full upgrade of the model’s skills across coding, computer use, long-context reasoning, agent planning, knowledge work, and design. As announced by Anthropic, Claude Sonnet 4.6 will be the default model for its Free and Pro plan users in claude.ai and Claude Cowork. Pricing remains the same as Sonnet 4.5 which means Claude Sonnet 4.6 comes with a starting price of $3/$15 per million tokens.Claude Sonnet 4.6 brings notable improvements in coding performance. According to Anthropic, tasks that previously required an Opus-class model, including complex office and real-world work, can now be handled by Sonnet 4.6.The company also highlighted progress in computer use capabilities. Sonnet 4.6 builds on Anthropic’s general-purpose computer-using models, which interact with software by clicking and typing rather than relying on APIs. On the OSWorld benchmark, which measures how well AI models operate in real-life applications such as web browsers and code editors, Sonnet models have shown steady gains. Anthropic said early users report near human-level performance in tasks such as navigating spreadsheets, filling multi-step web forms, and working across multiple browser tabs.Anthropic said Sonnet 4.6 performs more consistently across benchmarks and approaches Opus-level intelligence while remaining more affordable. Further, the model’s expanded context window allows it to process entire codebases, long contracts, or large collections of research papers in a single request. Anthropic said this improves long-term planning, pointing to strong results in the Vending-Bench Arena evaluation, where the model demonstrated effective decision-making over extended simulated timelines.The AI company further revealed that it ran extensive safety tests on Sonnet 4.6 and claims it to be as safe as or safer than recent Claude models.As previously mentioned, Claude Sonnet 4.6 is available now on all Claude plans, Claude Cowork, Claude Code, our API, and all major cloud platforms. The company has also upgraded its free tier to Sonnet 4.6 by default—it now includes file creation, connectors, skills, and compaction.","Claude Sonnet 4.6 is a full upgrade of the model’s skills across coding, computer use, long-context reasoning, agent planning, knowledge work, and design.

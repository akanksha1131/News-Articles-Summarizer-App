"Wall Street's favourite analyst Wedbush calls Trump Tariffs 'lottery' for China and 'brutal' for America's tech giants Apple, Microsoft, others",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/wall-streets-favourite-analyst-wedbush-calls-trump-tariffs-lottery-for-china-and-brutal-for-americas-tech-giants-apple-microsoft-others/articleshow/120024837.cms,"A Tech Setback of Biblical Proportions

China’s Golden Opportunity

A Revolution at Risk

A High-Stakes Gamble

In a scathing critique, Wedbush Securities has sounded the alarm on President Donald Trump’s newly proposed global tariffs, labeling them a potential “economic Armageddon” for the U.S. tech sector . Analysts, spearheaded by managing director Dan Ives, argue that the fallout from these tariffs could dwarf the devastation of historic market collapses like the dot-com bust of the early 2000s and the 2008 financial crisis, threatening to erase a decade of American technological progress.Wedbush’s analysis paints a dire picture: tariffs of 50% or more on Chinese goods and 32% on Taiwanese products could unravel the intricate global supply chains that power the tech industry. The firm predicts a staggering 40–50% spike in electronics prices, with a U.S.-manufactured iPhone potentially retailing for as much as $3,500. Such price hikes could alienate consumers and stall the momentum of the AI-driven “4th Industrial Revolution,” a movement currently led by U.S. giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, OpenAI, Amazon, Alphabet, Palantir, Oracle, and Tesla.“For the first time in 30 years, the U.S. is ahead of China in AI and this technological revolution,” Wedbush stated. “But in one day, this tariff policy, if enacted, will create an upside-down supply chain, massive costs, major capital expenditure delays due to uncertainty, and slow down U.S. tech innovation.” The firm estimates that tech earnings could plummet by at least 15%, with supply chain disruptions rivaling the chaos seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.The ripple effects of Trump’s tariff plan extend far beyond U.S. borders. China, already retaliating with its own tariffs, stands to gain a significant competitive edge. Wedbush warns that the policy could hand a “lotto ticket” to China’s tech ecosystem, empowering companies like BYD, Huawei, Alibaba, Tencent, and thousands of smaller players to seize greater global market share. While the U.S. tech sector grapples with higher costs and delays, China could accelerate its own innovation, potentially overtaking America in the race for AI supremacy.“This isn’t just a stumble—it’s a self-inflicted wound,” Ives remarked, emphasizing that the tariffs threaten to undo years of strategic gains. “China’s tech landscape is poised to capitalize on our misstep.”At the heart of Wedbush’s concerns is the AI revolution , a sector where U.S. companies like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI have set the pace. The proposed tariffs could choke off access to critical components from China and Taiwan, regions that dominate semiconductor and electronics manufacturing. The resulting uncertainty, coupled with ballooning costs, could force tech giants to scale back ambitious projects, delay product launches, and rethink capital investments.Analysts fear that the tariffs’ impact would reverberate through Wall Street, with tech stocks -- long a bedrock of market growth -- facing a brutal reckoning. “This is worse than anything we’ve seen in decades,” Ives said, drawing parallels to past crises while underscoring the unprecedented scale of the current threat.Trump’s tariff proposal, framed as a means to bolster domestic manufacturing and counter foreign competition, has ignited fierce debate. Supporters argue it could revitalize American industry, but critics like Wedbush see it as a reckless gamble that misjudges the tech sector’s reliance on global integration. As the U.S. and China exchange tariff salvos, the world watches to see whether this policy will cement America’s dominance—or hand its rivals the keys to the future.","Wedbush Securities has sounded the alarm on President Donald Trump’s newly proposed global tariffs.

"Microsoft's 50th anniversary celebrations hit by Pro-Palestine protests: 'CEOs shamed', emails sent and ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsofts-50th-anniversary-celebrations-interrupted-by-another-pro-palestine-protests-ceos-shamed-emails-sent-and-/articleshow/120008148.cms,"Microsoft employee Vaniya Agrawal: 'Shame on you all ...'

Microsoft's 50th anniversary festivities were disrupted by dual Pro-Palestine protests. On Friday, April 4, two separate incidents involving Microsoft employees disrupted the milestone celebration at the company's Washington headquarters. In both the cases, the employee followed their outburst by sending mass emails to colleagues, containing nearly identical demands from Microsoft leadership, which is to cease providing Israel with ""lethal technology"" that they claimed enables ""apartheid and genocide"" in Gaza.The initial disturbance occurred during a presentation by Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman. Ibtihal Aboussad, a software engineer from the company’s AI division specializing in speech recognition, interrupted the proceedings with a pointed message. She called out Suleyman by name, declaring, “Mustafa, shame on you,” as she approached the stage in Redmond, Washington. “You claim to champion AI for good, yet Microsoft supplies AI weapons to the Israeli military. Fifty thousand have perished, and Microsoft fuels this genocide in our region.”Aboussad accused Suleyman and Microsoft of war profiteering and asserting that both he and Microsoft bore responsibility for the bloodshed. Security promptly removed her from the venue.The second disruption unfolded later at the same event, when another employee rose and shouted at current CEO Satya Nadella, along with former CEOs Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates, condemning Microsoft’s ties to Israel. Vaniya Agrawal, a software engineer in the company’s artificial intelligence division, interrupted the CEOs while they were chatting on stage.“Shame on you all. You’re all hypocrites,” she exclaimed, before being escorted out by another woman. “Fifty thousand Palestinians in Gaza have been killed with Microsoft technology. How dare you celebrate in their blood. Cut ties with Israel.” She referenced No Azure for Apartheid, the employee-led group behind the day’s coordinated protests, both inside and outside the headquarters. Video footage captured Gates laughing lightly after the interruption, muttering “alright” before resuming the ongoing discussion.Agrawal also reportedly mentioned that the No Azure for Apartheid group, started among Microsoft employees to call on the company to end “direct and indirect complicity in Israeli apartheid and genocide.”Beyond the internal disruptions, a broader rally organized by No Azure for Apartheid took place outside the venue, amplifying the group’s long-standing campaign within the company.","Microsoft's 50th anniversary festivities were disrupted by dual Pro-Palestine protests.

How Deloitte is the 'biggest victim' of Elon Musk's DOGE cuts in the consultancy industry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-deloitte-is-the-biggest-victim-of-elon-musks-doge-cuts-in-the-consultancy-industry/articleshow/120006760.cms,"Poll Should companies be more cautious about investments related to cryptocurrencies? Strongly disagree Disagree Agree Strongly agree

Deloitte has emerged as the hardest-hit consultancy firm in the wake of Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) crackdown on private contracts. Since January, DOGE has terminated or modified 124 federal contracts with Deloitte, resulting in an estimated $371.8 million in taxpayer savings. These cuts represent more than twice the number of contract eliminations faced by any other consultancy firm.The largest terminated contract, valued at $51 million, was for IT services provided to the Department of Health and Human Services. Other affected agencies include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Deloitte's Government and Public Services division, which employs over 15,000 people, has already seen employees pulled off projects, with layoffs expected to follow.Deloitte is among at least 10 consulting firms affected by contract eliminations. In comparison, Booz Allen Hamilton saw 61 contracts canceled, amounting to an estimated $207.1 million in savings; Accenture had 30 contracts terminated, representing $240.2 million in claimed savings; and IBM faced the removal of 10 contracts, valued at $34.3 million in savings. According to Business Insider, Deloitte experienced more than double the number of contract cuts than any other consultancy.DOGE's actions are part of a broader initiative by the Trump administration to reduce federal spending and eliminate inefficiencies. While the cuts have saved billions in taxpayer dollars, they have also raised concerns about their impact on innovation and economic growth. Analysts warn that prolonged reductions in government contracts could lead to a cautious ""wait-and-see"" approach among firms, potentially stalling progress in critical sectors.Despite the challenges, Deloitte remains committed to adapting to the new landscape. The firm is exploring cost-cutting measures and strategies to optimise operations while maintaining its focus on delivering high-quality services.","Deloitte is among at least 10 consulting firms affected by contract eliminations.

Sridhar Vembu’s comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently replied to an X post by Kerala Congress , emphasizing the progress of the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s recent expansion in Kerala. The image in the party’s post shows a tombstone design to symbolically critique the ""Make in India"" initiative, suggesting it has failed between 2014 and 2025. The tombstone features the Indian lion emblem and the phrase ""Rest in Peace.""The post is captioned “In loving memory of….”. Responding to the post, Vembu emphasized the Make in India initiative and Zoho’s expansion in Kerala. He wrote:“Meanwhile companies like us Make in India (and started making in Kerala recently too).”“Make in India is gaining momentum and we have to make up for several lost decades. Reflect on why they were ""lost decades"" and perhaps you will appreciate Make in India better,” he further added.Zoho has been expanding its operations across India, including in Kerala. The company has been focusing on establishing offices in smaller towns and non-metro areas as part of its broader strategy.The Make in India initiative, launched in 2014, aims to boost local manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports. Several companies, including Zoho, have increased their domestic production efforts as part of this initiative.Vembu’s response comes amid ongoing discussions on India's economic policies and industrial growth, with businesses and policymakers debating the impact of past and present strategies.Vembu recently drew a comparison between financial bubbles and flash floods, highlighting their long-term impact on economic structures. In a recent post, he discussed how capital inflows into a single sector can divert resources from others, weakening overall economic capabilities.Citing Silicon Valley as an example, Vembu pointed out the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry, attributing them to a talent shift toward sectors with higher financial incentives. ""There is a reason Intel needs help from TSMC now – for at least a generation, the smartest talent in Silicon Valley did not go into fabs,"" he wrote, adding that investors overlooked the sector due to the absence of large exits.Drawing a parallel to India, Vembu noted that the long-standing dominance of the IT industry resulted in the neglect of other critical sectors. ""The IT industry sucked all the oxygen for a long time, leading to impairment and neglect of capabilities in numerous other critical industries,"" he stated.He stressed the importance of addressing these gaps and rebuilding capabilities in affected sectors.

But why stop at static photos? Let’s ride this wave and turn your Ghibli-style masterpieces into an animation video that’ll have your followers hitting “replay.” Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create a short animation video inspired by the iconic Studio Ghibli aesthetic:The viral buzz started with fans and creators posting Ghibli-inspired snapshots—think lush landscapes and soulful characters, often AI-generated with tools like Midjourney or hand-drawn by digital artists. To join in, you’ll need your own photos ready.Grab or Create Your Images: If you’ve already posted a viral Ghibli-style pic, use that! Otherwise, whip one up with a prompt like “Studio Ghibli-style sunset village, soft colors, detailed” in an AI tool, or sketch it yourself in Procreate.Layer Like a Pro: Split your photo into parts—characters, trees, sky—for animation flexibility. Social media loves those multi-depth shots, and it’s perfect for what’s next.Ghibli’s charm lies in its quiet, heartfelt storytelling, and your animation can capture that—even in a 15-second clip that’s perfect for TikTok’s algorithm.Quick Sketch: Plan a mini-sequence. Maybe your character walks through a glowing forest, or a breeze scatters cherry blossoms. Keep it simple but enchanting—social media thrives on “ooh” moments.Frame Rate Flex: Go for 24 FPS (Ghibli’s cinematic sweet spot). A 10-second viral hit needs 240 frames, but don’t sweat it—software will fill the gaps.To animate Ghibli-style illustrations, you’ll need software that supports frame-by-frame animation, layering, and smooth transitions.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its policy to clarify that it will only recognize two biological sexes—male and female. The change aligns with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January 2025, titled ‘Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government’. The updated policy, which took effect on April 2, applies to all pending and future immigration benefit requests. “USCIS is returning to its historical policy of recognizing two biological sexes,” the agency said in a press statement.Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security , said “There are only two sexes—male and female. President Trump promised the American people a revolution of common sense, and that includes making sure that the policy of the U.S. government agrees with simple biological reality. Proper management of our immigration system is a matter of national security, not a place to promote and coddle an ideology that permanently harms children and robs real women of their dignity, safety, and well-being.”Under the new guidance, a person’s sex will be determined based on the birth certificate issued at or closest to the time of birth. “If the birth certificate issued at or nearest to the time of birth indicates a sex other than male or female, USCIS will base the determination of sex on secondary evidence. See Volume 1, General Policies and Procedures, Part E, Adjudications, Chapter 6, Evidence, Section B, Primary and Secondary Evidence [1 USCIS-PM E.6(B)],” the agency stated.The agency further stated that benefits won’t be denied solely based on how someone identifies their sex, it also confirmed that it does not issue documents with a blank sex field or one that differs from the original birth certificate.

What are the charges against Aspiration Partners’ co-founders

Poll Do you believe that partnerships between tech giants can lead to ethical risks? Sometimes, depends on the partners No, rarely Yes, often

Aspiration Partners (CTN Holdings), a climate finance company once supported by Microsoft and Meta , sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on March 30. The company plans to auction its assets 45 days after the filing to settle its debts. This development follows a significant scandal at Aspiration. Joseph Sanberg, a co-founder and the company's largest shareholder, aged 45, was arrested on March 3.He faces a federal criminal complaint accusing him of orchestrating a $145 million fraud against two investor funds. Sanberg allegedly collaborated with 51-year-old Ibrahim Ameen AlHusseini, engaging in wire fraud and document falsification to execute the scheme. AlHusseini, who has pleaded guilty, received around $12.3 million for his role and awaits sentencing on September 29, 2025.Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph McNally stated, ""Our prosecutors and law enforcement partners have diligently secured a guilty plea from one key figure in this case and have now charged another conspirator. We remain committed to maintaining fair and honest markets and business environments.""Despite the U.S. Department of Justice clarifying that ""the allegations pertain only to Sanberg’s personal actions and do not involve CTN or its affiliates,"" the controversy severely weakened Aspiration’s ability to attract further investment.The bankruptcy also casts a shadow over the voluntary carbon market (VCM), currently valued at $933.23 billion. This decentralized system enables individuals and organizations to trade carbon credits to offset emissions, playing a critical role for businesses pursuing climate goals.","Aspiration Partners (CTN Holdings) sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on March 30.

While it may affect the Chinese imports of key minerals such as gallium, germanium, and others used in making semiconductors, infrared technology, fiber optic cables, solar cells, military applications and others, AI companies like DeepSeek appears remarkably unfazed.Two key factors insulate the AI company: first, DeepSeek's primary offerings are digital AI models and software, not physical goods subject to traditional tariffs; and second, its focus on AI development and data processing, rather than manufacturing, reduces its reliance on the physical supply chains that are the primary targets of the tariffs.It is to be noted that the question of DeepSeek’s “immunity” from Trump's tariffs is complex and requires understanding the nature of DeepSeek and the focus of the tariffs.

Its products are essentially software and AI services.Trump's tariffs primarily target the import of physical goods. Traditionally, tariffs are used as a tool to increase the cost of imported manufactured goods, to protect domestic industries. However, there may also be concerns regarding the flow of data and technology, which may indirectly cause issues with the use of AI from foreign nations.Software and AI models are digital goods, not physical products. Therefore, they don't fall under the traditional definition of goods subject to import tariffs. This means that the direct application of import tariffs is less relevant to DeepSeek's core products.The US government could potentially impose restrictions on:Therefore, while traditional tarrifs might not be the main issue, there are other ways the US government could restrict the use of Deepseek.

The ethical imperative: Balancing innovation and responsibility in artificial intelligence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-ethical-imperative-balancing-innovation-and-responsibility-in-artificial-intelligence/articleshow/119991401.cms,"Poll What should be the primary focus of AI development? User safety Ethical guidelines Innovative technologies

-- Balaji Krishnamoorthy, EVP, Findability Sciences

The remarkable advancement of AI technologies presents society with a profound duality: unprecedented opportunity alongside significant ethical challenges. As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated and autonomous, the need for ethical frameworks that ensure responsible innovation has never been more critical. AI's transformative potential spans virtually every sector of human endeavor. In healthcare, machine learning algorithms can detect diseases earlier and with greater accuracy than human physicians. In transportation, autonomous vehicles promise safer roads and enhanced mobility. In education, personalized learning systems can adapt to individual student needs. Yet each of these advancements carries ethical considerations that must be addressed thoughtfully.At the heart of responsible AI development lies the principle of human-centricity. Technology should augment human capabilities and improve lives while respecting fundamental values like privacy, autonomy, fairness, and transparency. This requires intentional design choices that prioritize human well-being over mere technological achievement.Consider the challenge of algorithmic bias . AI systems learn patterns from historical data, and when that data reflects societal inequities, algorithms can inadvertently perpetuate or amplify existing biases. This has real-world consequences when AI is used in high-stakes domains like hiring, lending, healthcare, and criminal justice. Addressing this challenge requires diverse development teams, comprehensive testing methodologies, and continuous monitoring of AI systems in deployment.Transparency represents another crucial ethical consideration. As AI systems become more complex, their decision-making processes often become less interpretable to humans—the infamous ""black box"" problem. Yet in many contexts, people have a right to understand how decisions affecting them are made. Explainable AI approaches that make algorithmic reasoning more transparent are essential for building trust and enabling meaningful human oversight.The question of accountability further complicates the ethical landscape. When AI systems make incorrect or harmful decisions, who bears responsibility? The developers who created the system? The organizations that deployed it? The users who relied on it? Clear accountability frameworks are necessary to ensure that all stakeholders take appropriate responsibility for AI outcomes.Privacy considerations also loom large in the AI ethics conversation. Advanced AI systems often rely on vast amounts of personal data, raising questions about consent, data ownership, and the potential for surveillance. Robust data governance protocols and privacy-preserving techniques are essential for respecting individual rights in the AI age.The global nature of AI development introduces additional complexities. Different cultural contexts may have varying perspectives on ethical priorities. What constitutes appropriate use of facial recognition technology, for example, might be viewed differently across societies. This calls for inclusive, cross-cultural dialogue about AI ethics that respects diverse perspectives while upholding universal human rights.Addressing these challenges requires collaboration across multiple stakeholders. Industry leaders must prioritize ethical considerations alongside technical innovation. Policymakers need to develop adaptive regulatory frameworks that protect against harms while enabling beneficial innovation. Researchers should continue advancing technical approaches to fairness, transparency, and privacy. And civil society must engage actively in shaping AI governance.Education also plays a vital role. Technical education should incorporate ethical reasoning alongside coding and mathematics. The next generation of AI developers needs not only technical skills but also the ability to think critically about the societal implications of their work.As we navigate this complex landscape, humility is perhaps our most valuable asset. The ethical challenges posed by AI do not have simple solutions, and our understanding will evolve as technologies advance. Continuous learning, open dialogue, and a willingness to adapt are essential characteristics of responsible AI development.The future of AI will be determined not by technological capabilities alone, but by the values we choose to embed in these systems. By prioritizing ethics alongside innovation, we can harness AI's transformative potential while ensuring it serves humanity's best interests. This ethical imperative represents one of the defining challenges of our time—and an opportunity to demonstrate our capacity for wisdom alongside our technical ingenuity.","The future of AI will be determined not by technological capabilities alone, but by the values we choose to embed in these systems.

What TikTok's Chinese parent said

The biggest obstacle in TikTok becoming an American company

TikTok gets another extension, and again for 75 days. The US President Donald Trump extended the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. assets by 75 days. This move delays a potential ban initially slated for January under a 2024 law. The new Trump order will set a mid-June deadline for a deal.The extension comes amid ongoing negotiations for a restructuring plan. This plan involves major non-Chinese ByteDance investors increasing their stakes and acquiring TikTok's U.S. operations, creating a separate U.S. entity. The goal is to reduce Chinese ownership below the 20% threshold required by U.S. law, thereby avoiding a ban.Trump explained the extension on social media, stating, ""The deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed."" He also linked the extension to trade tensions with China, noting, ""We hope to continue working in good faith with China, who I understand is not very happy about our reciprocal tariffs."" This comes after Trump's recent tariff increase on Chinese goods, which prompted retaliatory measures from China. Trump indicated a willingness to reduce tariffs if a TikTok deal is reached.ByteDance confirmed ongoing discussions but stated, ""An agreement has not been executed. There are key matters to be resolved. Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law.""A significant obstacle to the TikTok sale is Chinese government approval, which remains uncertain. China has not made a public commitment to allow a sale and Trump's comments suggested renewed Chinese opposition. Trump acknowledged this, stating, ""We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the deal.""

How has this hacking incident affected Australia’s biggest pension funds



Poll Do you think individuals are responsible for their own online security? No, companies should take more responsibility. Yes, it's up to each person.

Hackers have targeted Australia's largest pension funds in coordinated attacks. A report claims that cybercriminals have used this data breach to steal from the members of the biggest funds, affecting the country’s 4.2 trillion Australian dollar ($2.63 trillion) retirement savings sector. The latest hacking incident has reportedly compromised over 20,000 accounts from multiple major pension funds in Australia.In a statement to the news agency Reuters, National Cyber Security Coordinator Michelle McGuinness has confirmed tracking cybercriminal activities on these accounts. She also noted that a government-led response, involving regulators and industry, is expected soon.According to a report by Reuters, the industry body Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia noted that “a number” of funds were impacted by the latest breach. The report didn’t mention the exact scale of the hacking incident; however, it noted that funds such as AustralianSuper , Australian Retirement Trust, Rest, Insignia and Hostplus have confirmed breaches.AustralianSuper, managing A$365 billion for 3.5 million members, reported that up to 600 member passwords were stolen. These passwords were used to access accounts and attempt fraud.""We took immediate action to lock these accounts and let those members know,"" said Rose Kerlin, AustralianSuper's Chief Member Officer, urging all members to verify their online balances.The report also claimed that hackers withdrew a total of 500,000 Australia dollars from four accounts and transferred to unauthorised accounts.Australian Retirement Trust, managing 300 billion Australian dollars for 2.4 million members, detected unusual login activity on several hundred accounts and locked them as a precaution, with no suspicious transactions reported. Meanwhile, Rest Super, which manages A$93 billion for retail workers, confirmed an attack affecting about 20,000 accounts—roughly 1% of its 2 million members.In a statement to Reuters, Rest CEO Vicki Doyle said: “Over the weekend of 29-30 March 2025, Rest became aware of some unauthorised activity on our online Member Access portal. We responded immediately by shutting down the Member Access portal, undertaking investigations and launching our cyber security incident response protocols.”Apart from this, Insignia Financial, owner of MLC, also detected suspicious login activity on 100 Expand Wrap Platform accounts, though MLC Expand CEO Liz McCarthy confirmed no financial harm to members. While Hostplus, managing over 1.8 million members and 115 billion Australian dollars in assets, also reported an attack with no member losses, while investigations continue.","Latest hacking incident has reportedly compromised over 20,000 accounts from multiple major pension funds in Australia.

Amazon to resume this practice it suspended during Covid-19 pandemic,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-to-resume-this-practice-it-suspended-during-covid-19-pandemic/articleshow/119987751.cms,"What Amazon said about its warehouse security measures



Why Amazon warehouse workers may not be happy with these safety measures



Amazon is increasing the safety measures for its warehouses in the US.. As part of a theft-prevention drive, the e-commerce major is set to bring back metal-detector screenings at its warehouses and introduce a new personal phone registration system . Suspended during the pandemic, the metal screening will now resume, while workers will be required to register their devices by sharing the last six digits of the serial number and placing an identifying sticker on them.Amazon has reportedly started testing its warehouse safety measures in a few locations as the company plans to extend this policy across all of its US facilities. The company claimed that these measures would help security personnel to quickly verify that personal phones of warehouse workers are not stolen, which will ultimately streamline the exit process and reinforce warehouse security.In an emailed statement shared with Bloomberg, Amazon spokesman Steve Kelly said: “We’re always working to make our facilities more safe and secure for our employees and for companies of all sizes that put their trust in us to store their inventory. As one part of that, we’ve made the decision to restore some practices that we had suspended to support social distancing during the pandemic.”Amazon's theft-prevention measures have long sparked controversy with over 750,000 US warehouse workers. The metal-detector screenings, once common practice before the pandemic, reportedly caused lengthy delays, with some workers waiting up to 25 minutes, leading to lawsuits over unpaid time.In addition, the longstanding ban on mobile phones on warehouse floors has also been contentious, with rules relaxed during the pandemic for safety and family communication.Despite plans to reinstate the phone ban in 2022, backlash intensified after a few tragic incidents. This highlights the ongoing tensions over workplace policies among Amazon’s warehouse workers.","Amazon is increasing the safety measures for its warehouses in the US.

What critics of SpaceX town say

Starbase, Texas, a small town closely tied to Elon Musk’s SpaceX, has issued a warning to some residents that they may “lose the right to continue using” their properties as they currently do, according to a memo obtained by CNBC. The town, located in Cameron County near the Gulf Coast, is proposing a new zoning ordinance and a comprehensive citywide map, potentially reshaping the community’s landscape to accommodate SpaceX’s expanding operations.The notice, sent to property owners within a proposed “Mixed Use District,” outlines plans to permit a blend of “residential, office, retail, and small-scale service uses” in the area. This shift could transform the town, which currently spans just 1.6 square miles and serves primarily as a hub for SpaceX’s ambitious Starship rocket program. The proposed zoning changes aim to integrate commercial and service-oriented developments, potentially prioritizing SpaceX’s operational needs over existing residential uses.Starbase has scheduled a public hearing on June 23, 2025, to discuss the zoning ordinance and map, offering residents a chance to voice concerns. The notice was signed by Kent Myers, Starbase’s newly appointed city administrator, who recently assumed the role, according to ValleyCentral.com. Neither Starbase officials nor SpaceX responded to CNBC’s requests for further details on Thursday, leaving residents with limited information about the potential impact.Incorporated earlier this month as a “type-C municipal corporation” following a local election heavily influenced by SpaceX, Starbase is now governed by a mix of current and former SpaceX employees. The town’s formation marks a significant milestone for Musk’s aerospace company, which has transformed the area since establishing its launch facility in 2014. Starbase’s population, estimated at around 500 as of early 2025, includes approximately 260 SpaceX employees, with most other residents being their relatives, per the Texas Tribune.Starbase held its inaugural city commission meeting this week, marking its first formal step as a municipality. The meeting followed closely after the Starship test, highlighting the town’s dual identity as both a residential community and a corporate stronghold for SpaceX. The proposed zoning changes could further align Starbase’s development with SpaceX’s long-term objectives, including plans to expand its launch facilities and support infrastructure.Critics, including some local advocacy groups, have raised concerns about the rapid transformation of Starbase, citing potential environmental impacts and the risk of prioritizing corporate interests over residents’ rights. The area’s proximity to the Boca Chica State Park and its ecologically sensitive wetlands has also drawn scrutiny from environmentalists, who worry about the effects of increased development.As Starbase prepares for the June 23 hearing, residents are bracing for changes that could redefine their community. The outcome of the zoning ordinance will likely signal whether Starbase remains a company town centered on SpaceX’s ambitions or evolves into a more balanced community with diverse land uses. For now, the town remains a unique experiment in corporate-driven urban planning, with Elon Musk’s vision for space exploration at its core.","Starbase, Texas, a small town closely tied to Elon Musk’s SpaceX, has issued a warning to some residents that they may “lose the right to continue using” their properties as they currently do.

"How this $7,000 EV is said to be busting the 'biggest' myth about cars in Japan and is set to beat Toyota in EV sales",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-this-7000-ev-is-said-to-be-busting-the-biggest-myth-about-cars-in-japan/articleshow/121525110.cms,"In a country where EVs are still a rare sight, KG Motors is trying to bust a burgeoning myth: That Bigger is Better.

A Japanese startup, KG Motors, is aiming to boost Japan's electric vehicle (EV) market with an ultra-compact, affordable one-seater EV called the mibot, according to Bloomberg. Resembling a futuristic golf cart, the mibot is designed for Japan's narrow streets and has already pre-sold over half of the 3,300 units planned for delivery in 2027. This puts KG Motors on track to surpass Toyota, which sold around 2,000 EVs in Japan in 2024. This reportedly puts KG Motors on track to sell more EVs in Japan than the world’s biggest automaker, Toyota Motor Corp., which shifted around such 2,000 vehicles in all of 2024.“Cars are simply too big,” said Kazunari Kusunoki, KG Motors’ founder and CEO, as quoted by Bloomberg. The mibot, priced at ¥1 million ($7,000) before tax, is half the cost of Japan’s popular Nissan Sakura EV. It offers a 100-kilometer range, a five-hour charge time, and a top speed of 60 km/h. Production is set to begin in October at a new factory east of Hiroshima.Japan’s EV market lags globally, with EVs making up just 3.5% of vehicle sales in 2023 compared to the global average of 18%, per BloombergNEF. Toyota’s multi-pathway approach, favoring hybrids alongside EVs, has shaped public skepticism about EVs’ popularity, Kusunoki noted. However, small kei cars like the Sakura, which sold nearly 23,000 units in 2024, dominate Japan’s EV market.KG Motors’ mibot, with its minimalist design and low production costs, targets rural areas with declining public transport. Bloomberg reports that 95% of the 2,250 pre-orders come from homeowners with at least one vehicle. The startup expects to break even on its second batch of 3,000 units and aims to produce 10,000 annually thereafter.","Japanese startup KG Motors is aiming to boost Japan's electric vehicle (EV) market with an ultra-compact, affordable one-seater EV.

“With the Department of Government Efficiency, Elon delivered a colossal change in the old ways of doing business in Washington. Doge has installed geniuses with an engineering mindset and unbelievably talented people and computers. I actually asked Elon one time, what's their primary thing, and they have a lot of primary things, all having to do with being smart. But he said the thing that they're really the best that is working with computers so that they can't be outsmarted by somebody that's not so honest, that happens to also be good with computers, but not as good as these people, but the mindset of the senior ranks of every federal department, and it's really changed, and with Elon's guidance they're helping to detect fraud slash waste and modernize broken and outdated systems.""

Synopsys , one of the top three semiconductor design software companies in the US, has reportedly instructed its staff in China to cease all services and sales within the country and to stop accepting new orders. This directive, outlined in an internal letter reviewed by news agency Reuters, is in response to latest US export restrictions targeting China.The report said that Synopsys, a large provider of electronic design automation (EDA) software used in chip design, suspended its annual and quarterly forecasts on Thursday (May 26) after receiving notification of the new restrictions from the US Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security.Soon after the Trump administration 's 'China ban letter', the company sent an internal letter to staff in China on Friday (May 30), stating that the restrictions ""broadly prohibit the sales of our products and services in China and are effective as of May 29, 2025.""To ensure compliance, Synopsys confirmed that it is blocking all sales and fulfillment in China and pausing new orders pending further clarification.Notably, these measures apply to all customers in China, including employees of global clients operating within China, and Chinese military users worldwide. Synopsys has reportedly disabled Chinese customers' access to its customer support portal, SolvNetPlus.The development comes a day after the US government ordered numerous companies to halt product shipments to China without a license and revoked existing licenses for certain suppliers. These measures impact critical products, including design software and chemicals essential for semiconductor manufacturing.Synopsys, alongside Cadence and Siemens EDA, controls over 70% of China's EDA market, as per Chinese news agency Xinhua.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk reportedly travels with a daily pill box containing around 20 different medications. According to a New York Times report, “Musk’s drug consumption went well beyond occasional use.” Quoting people familiar with the matter, the report states that some of these pills include powerful stimulants and psychedelic substances, with some of them marked as Adderall , a commonly prescribed stimulant for ADHD.“He took Ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms. And he traveled with a daily medication box that held about 20 pills, including ones with the markings of the stimulant Adderall, according to a photo of the box and people who have seen it,” the report states.A 2024 report by The Wall Street Journal said that the Tesla and Space X CEO has a history of recreational drug use.The latest NYT report quotes an unnamed source who claims to have attended private gatherings with Musk saying that Musk also took Ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms “across the United States and in at least one other country”. Adding further, it states that the tech billionaire “had been using ketamine often, sometimes daily, and mixing it with other drugs”.The Times previously reported that he had actually developed a far more serious habit.However, Musk has previously revealed that he was prescribed ketamine for depression. In March 2024, he told journalist Don Lemon that he took only “a small amount” of ketamine, about once every two weeks, as a prescribed treatment for negative moods. “If you’ve used too much ketamine, you can’t really get work done, and I have a lot of work,” he said.“I really don’t like doing illegal drugs,” he reportedly told his biographer. He was once seen smoking marijuana at Joe Rogan's podcast.The NYT report says that Musk has told people “he was taking so much ketamine” and “that it was affecting his bladder, a known effect of chronic use”.Ketamine use has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but only as an anesthetic in medical procedures. And only doctors with a special license can prescribe it for psychiatric disorders like depression.But the agency has recently warned about its risks, particularly after the death of the actor Matthew Perry in 2023. “The drug has psychedelic properties and can cause dissociation from reality. Chronic use can lead to addiction and problems with bladder pain and control.”","Tesla CEO Elon Musk reportedly travels with a daily pill box containing around 20 different medications.

Meta , the tech giant behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has requested a federal judge to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) high-profile antitrust case, just as the trial approaches a critical phase. According to the, the case, which began in early April, represents one of the most significant regulatory challenges faced by Meta in its history, potentially resulting in the breakup of the company’s social media empire.Meta's move to dismiss the case comes after the FTC rested its side of the argument, asserting that the company holds an illegal monopoly over the social networking market, particularly those platforms focused on friends-and-family connections. Meta, however, argues that the FTC's case is based on a flawed market definition and ignores the intense competition it faces from newer platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X (formerly known as Twitter).In a court filing late Thursday, Meta reiterated its stance that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standards required to prove its antitrust allegations. The company’s legal team argues that the FTC has fundamentally mischaracterized the social media market, claiming that the agency's definition is overly narrow and excludes significant competitors.“After five weeks of trial, it is clear that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standard required under antitrust law,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement on Friday. “Regardless, we will present our case to show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram competes with TikTok (and YouTube and X and many other apps).”Meta claims that it faces substantial competition from a wide range of digital platforms, including short-video giant TikTok, video-sharing platform YouTube, and Elon Musk’s X. These platforms, Meta argues, all compete for user engagement, advertising revenue, and market share, undercutting the FTC’s claim that Meta has maintained an unlawful monopoly.The FTC’s antitrust lawsuit, which was first filed in December 2020, centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The agency claims that Meta pursued a deliberate “buy or bury” strategy, acquiring these fast-growing competitors to neutralize potential threats to its dominant position in the social networking market.In its filing, the FTC pointed to internal Meta communications as evidence of this strategy. This includes a 2012 email from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggesting that buying Instagram would “neutralize a competitor.” The FTC further argues that these acquisitions reduced consumer choice and stifled innovation, limiting competition in the rapidly evolving social media industry.The FTC's case aims to convince U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to order Meta to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp, effectively dismantling the company's integrated social media ecosystem.Meta's defense in the trial has focused on presenting itself as a company that supports innovation and benefits consumers. In its Thursday filing, the company argued that its acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth, which in turn delivered significant benefits to users.“Meta’s acquisition of Instagram enabled massive growth – with correspondingly massive benefits for US consumers,” the company stated in its court filing.However, the trial has also brought to light internal documents that may complicate Meta’s defense. For instance, a 2018 email from an unnamed Instagram executive warned that ""fake engagement could be in the range of 40%,"" potentially undermining Meta's claims about the platform’s integrity and user trust.Mark Zuckerberg himself was the first witness called by the FTC as the trial opened, highlighting the personal stakes for the Meta CEO. During his testimony, Zuckerberg sought to portray Meta as a company facing fierce competition, rather than a monopoly crushing potential rivals.Earlier in the trial, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom testified that he felt Zuckerberg viewed Instagram’s rapid growth as a potential threat to Facebook’s dominance after the acquisition, further fueling the FTC’s argument that Meta's mergers were designed to stifle competition.The 10-week non-jury trial, which is expected to conclude in June, will be followed by final briefs from both the FTC and Meta. If Judge Boasberg sides with the FTC, a second trial will be held to determine appropriate remedies, potentially including the forced divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp.Meta will continue presenting its defense when the trial resumes on Monday. The company’s attempt to dismiss the case outright remains a long shot, as the judge may choose to let the case proceed to its scheduled conclusion before issuing a ruling.","The FTC's antitrust lawsuit centers on Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.

Bezos’ divorce bombshell: How a missing prenup created a $35 billion settlement

Bezos’ new romance, new rules: The $220 billion prenup strategy

Inside the billion-dollar prenup: Legal experts weigh in

When Jeff Bezos married MacKenzie Scott in 1993, few could have predicted the trajectory of their lives. At the time, Amazon was a fledgling online bookstore operating from a garage, and the tech boom that would make Bezos one of the richest people in history was still years away. Their 25-year marriage not only survived Amazon's meteoric rise but also played a crucial role in shaping one of the most iconic business empires of the 21st century. Yet, despite the immense wealth they amassed, the couple entered their union without a prenuptial agreement—a decision that would reverberate globally after their 2019 divorce.MacKenzie walked away with a 4% stake in Amazon, instantly catapulting her into the ranks of the world's richest women. As of 2025, Forbes estimates her net worth to be around $165.3 billion. That highly publicized split not only altered the tech landscape but also sparked renewed conversations about asset protection in high-net-worth marriages.Now, with Jeff Bezos preparing to marry his fiancée Lauren Sánchez, a former TV anchor and entrepreneur, he appears to be approaching marriage with a new playbook. Legal insiders and wealth advisors reveal that this time, Bezos has opted for a comprehensive, multi-jurisdictional prenuptial agreement — a far cry from the informal beginning of his first marriage.Jeff and MacKenzie Scott met in the early 1990s when they were both working at hedge fund D.E. Shaw. The couple moved to Seattle, where Bezos launched Amazon in 1994 with MacKenzie as one of the earliest employees. Their professional and personal lives were deeply intertwined, and as the company flourished, so did their financial fortune.However, when they announced their divorce in 2019, one crucial detail became the focus: the absence of a prenuptial agreement. As a result, under Washington state’s community property laws, MacKenzie was entitled to half of all marital assets — including a significant portion of Bezos’ Amazon shares.Ultimately, she walked away with 25% of their shared Amazon holdings, equivalent to about 4% of the company’s total shares at the time. That stake alone was valued at approximately $35 billion when the settlement was finalized, though her net worth has since grown due to stock value increases and philanthropic activities.Bezos' new relationship with Lauren Sánchez, which began publicly in 2019 shortly after his divorce, has been markedly different. Sánchez, a media personality, helicopter pilot, and founder of Black Ops Aviation, has her own career and public profile. However, the wealth disparity between the two is massive. Bezos, with a net worth of around $220 billion, remains one of the top three richest individuals globally.This stark financial imbalance has prompted Bezos to take a vastly different approach in his second marriage — one focused on legal precision, asset protection, and long-term planning.According to Certified Family Law Specialist Alphonse Provinziano, Bezos' prenuptial agreement with Sánchez is likely airtight. Speaking to HELLO!, Provinziano noted that such agreements in ultra-high-net-worth marriages typically involve extensive documentation of separate property and future earnings exclusions.“There would be a clear enumeration of all business assets and ownership interests, stating these would be considered Jeff Bezos' separate property,” he explained.In other words, Sánchez would not be entitled to any share of Amazon, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, or any related entities regardless of how long the marriage lasts — unless otherwise stipulated.These prenups often include clauses preventing spouses from claiming business appreciation, intellectual property growth, or share in future ventures unless there’s joint investment or involvement. They may even have confidentiality clauses and non-disparagement agreements to avoid post-divorce public disputes.","Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Scott divorced in 2019 after 25 years of marriage.

Laura Loomer has slammed the Republican Party for driving away Elon Musk , whom she termed as “their biggest donor”. In a post on social media X, Loomer criticized Republican Party, popularly known as Grand Old Party ( GOP ) for failing to codify spending cuts proposed under Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). She further suggested that their inaction may have cost them critical support ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.“Leave it to the GOP to push their biggest donor away,” Loomer wrote. “All they had to do was codify the DOGE cuts and they could have had unlimited funding for the midterms. They somehow managed to F that up,” she added.In her post, Loomer was referring to Musk’s recent announcement to step down from DOGE and his advisory role in the Trump administration. The Tesla CEO has been leading the DOGE task force to cut federal waste and streamlining government spending. He later expressed public disappointment over the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which failed to reflect the aggressive cuts he had championed.“Now @elonmusk is pissed and walking away. Can’t really blame him,” Loomer added.Musk’s departure marks a significant shift for the GOP, which has leaned heavily on his financial and technological influence in recent years. With the midterms approaching and party divisions deepening, Loomer’s post reflects a growing frustration among right-wing influencers over what they see as a squandered opportunity to secure both policy wins and campaign funding.The post comes amid rising tensions between Musk and some of Trump’s top advisers, including those who publicly defended the controversial spending bill.","Laura Loomer has slammed the Republican Party for driving away Elon Musk, whom she termed as ‘their biggest donor’ In a post on social media X, she criticized Republican Party, popularly known as Grand Old Party ( GOP ) for failing to codify spending cuts proposed under Department of Government Efficiency.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121515936,imgsize-29520,width-400,resizemode-4/Now-Elon-Musk-is-pissed-and-says-angry-Laura-Loomer-on-Republicans-for-tiff-with-Tesla-CEO.jpg"
Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn makes a prediction on how AI will change schools in future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/duolingo-ceo-luis-von-ahn-makes-a-prediction-on-how-ai-will-change-schools-in-future/articleshow/121290768.cms,"Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn feels that AI will take over teaching



Schools won’t disappear, but their role will change: Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn



Duolingo CEO Luis von Ann recently predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) will fundamentally transform education, shifting the role of schools from traditional learning institutions to childcare and supervised spaces. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the No Priors podcast, von Ahn stressed on the fact that AI’s scalability makes it more efficient than human teachers and it can be easily used for personalised education. ""Education is going to change. It's just a lot more scalable to teach with AI than with teachers,” von Ahn said.Von Ahn suggests that AI will increasingly handle the core instruction in schools. He believes that AI can deliver personalised education more effectively than traditional classroom models with teachers. AI system can be designed to precisely track individual student progress, identify areas where they struggle and then tailor the learning experience accordingly.While Von Ahn does not believe schools will vanish, he foresees a future where AI tutors handle most of the teaching, while schools primarily serve as safe environments for children. He explained that AI can track individual student performance in real time, adjusting lesson plans to match each child’s learning pace—something human teachers struggle to do in large classrooms.“That doesn't mean the teachers are going to go away. You still need people to take care of the students. I also don't think schools are going to go away because you still need childcare,” von Ahn said on the podcast.This doesn't mean teachers will become obsolete, according to von Ahn. Instead, their responsibilities may evolve. Teachers could transition from primarily delivering instruction to supervising students, providing guidance, and fostering social and emotional development.Von Ahn also points out that the integration of AI in education is already happening. Duolingo, for example, is restructuring its operations to embrace an ""AI-first"" approach. This includes using AI for tasks previously done by contractors and incorporating AI into employee performance reviews.","Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn predicts that AI will transform education.

The rally reflects a broader U.S. equity rebound and renewed confidence in Microsoft’s Azure cloud-computing business, fueled by strong artificial intelligence (AI) demand. Azure’s fiscal third-quarter revenue grew 33%, surpassing Wall Street expectations, with non-AI services like databases and storage outperforming, as noted by CFO Amy Hood.The stock’s resurgence contrasts with its 2024 performance, when Microsoft lagged behind the “Magnificent Seven” peers -- Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla -- with a 12% gain, weighed down by concerns over Azure growth and AI competition. In 2025, Microsoft’s 9% advance has outpaced most peers except Meta (up 10%), bolstered by limited exposure to President Trump’s tariffs and strong Big Tech earnings.

Elon Musk's 'good bye' note

President Donald Trump lauded Elon Musk as ""terrific"" as the billionaire stepped down from his role as chief of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the U.S. administration . Trump announced that he and Musk will hold a media briefing at 1:30 pm EST today in the Oval Office to mark Musk’s final day, though he emphasized that Musk will ""always be with us, helping all the way.""In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""I am having a Press Conference tomorrow at 1:30 pm EST with Elon Musk, at the Oval Office. This will be his last day, but not really, because he will, always, be with us. Elon is terrific! See you tomorrow at the White House.""Musk’s exit follows widespread protests and comes amid his recent criticism of Trump’s flagship tax bill (One Big Beautiful Bill), which he called ""too expensive"" and a potential setback to his cost-cutting efforts at DOGE. ""A bill can be big, or it can be beautiful. But I don’t know if it can be both,"" Musk remarked earlier this week.In a statement, Musk expressed gratitude to Trump for the opportunity to lead DOGE, saying, ""As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President Donald Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending.

As Musk departs, his influence on the administration’s efficiency drive is expected to persist, with the White House signaling his continued advisory role.The press conference today is anticipated to shed light on Musk’s contributions and the future of DOGE under Trump’s leadership.","President Donald Trump lauded Elon Musk as ""terrific"" as the billionaire stepped down from his role as chief of the Department of Government Efficiency.

The US government has arrested an IT specialist employed by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) for allegedly attempting to transmit national defense information to a foreign government. The arrest happened after the FBI received a tip that an individual offered to provide classified information to a “friendly foreign government.”According to federal prosecutors, Nathan Vilas Laatsch , 28 — who held a Top Secret security clearance and worked in the DIA's Insider Threat Division since 2019 — repeatedly transcribed classified intelligence from his secure workstation and attempted to pass it to an undercover FBI agent posing as a foreign government official.Court documents reveal that Laatsch first reached out to the foreign government via an email in March 2025, expressing his willingness to share classified material because he did not ""agree or align with the values of this administration."" In the email, he wrote that he was “willing to share classified information” that he had access to, including “completed intelligence products, some unprocessed intelligence, and other assorted classified documentation.”On May 1, Laatsch allegedly left a thumb drive in a northern Virginia park, which the FBI retrieved later.A press release by the Department of Justice (DOJ) said that the thumb drive contained Secret and Top Secret materials along with a message offering “a decent sample size” of intelligence products. He later expressed interest in receiving foreign citizenship in exchange for continuing to provide classified information. “Because he did not “expect[] things here to improve in the long term,” the release stated.Laatsch said that he was “not opposed to other compensation,” and was not in a position where he needed to seek “material compensation.”Between May 15 and May 27, Laatsch reportedly transcribed more intelligence, concealed it in his clothing, and attempted a second dead drop at a prearranged location. He was arrested on May 29 after the FBI took possession of the documents.Laatsch is expected to appear in federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia on Friday.The arrest was announced by top officials from the Justice Department, FBI, and U.S. Air Force.

Stephen Miller 's wife Katie Miller , spokeswoman for the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), is leaving the White House to work full-time for Elon Musk . The development comes after Musk’s official departure from his advisory role in the Trump administration. Notably, Katie shared an X post, quoting Musk’s previous quote: “DOGE is a way of life, like Buddhism”.The Tesla and SpaceX CEO recently said that he was “disappointed” with the “One Big Beautiful Bill”, claiming it contradicted the budget-cutting goals he pursued during his tenure with DOGE i.e. Department of Government Efficiency. Katie’s husband and senior Trump aide Stephen Miller, critically responded to Musk's recent remarks.“I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, but I don't know if it can be both,” he said. “My personal opinion.”Shortly after Musk’s comments about the bill, Stephen Miller took to X (formerly Twitter) to clarify the limitations of the budget bill.“Under senate budget rules, you cannot cut discretionary spending (only mandatory) in a reconciliation bill,” Miller wrote. “So DOGE cuts would have to be done through what is known as a rescissions package or an appropriations bill,” he added.He further stated that the bill “does not fund the departments of government” nor finance federal agencies, pushing back against Musk’s claim that it undermined DOGE’s mission.Katie Miller, who previously served as a Special Government Employee — a temporary designation for private-sector professionals working in government — is expected to take on a new role with Musk, possibly involving his media relations for Tesla and SpaceX, according to CNN.

Trump's manufacturing ultimatum creates Apple dilemma



India emerges as Apple's manufacturing lifeline



Supply chain reality check against political pressure

iPhone 16e: 5 Reasons to buy the most affordable iPhone 16 series model!

Apple's iPhone shipments from India to the United States soared 76% in April 2025, reaching 3 million devices as the tech giant accelerates its manufacturing shift away from China, a move that has created what President Donald Trump calls his ""little problem"" with Apple CEO Tim Cook . The surge comes as Trump pressures Apple to abandon its Indian expansion and bring iPhone production to American soil instead, threatening a 25% tariff on all iPhones not manufactured domestically.Data from technology analyst firm Omdia shows a dramatic reversal in Apple's supply chain, with iPhone shipments from China to the US plummeting 76% to just 900,000 units over the same period. The shift represents Apple's strategic response to Trump's tariff policies, which impose a 30% duty on Chinese-made iPhones while maintaining a baseline 10% rate for other countries including India.The manufacturing pivot gained momentum after Trump's ""reciprocal tariffs"" implementation in April, prompting Apple to charter emergency cargo flights carrying 600 tons of iPhones from India to beat tariff deadlines. The company secured a ""green corridor"" arrangement at Chennai airport, slashing customs clearance from 30 hours to six hours.President Trump has made Apple's domestic manufacturing a personal priority, revealing he had a ""little problem"" with CEO Tim Cook during recent discussions. ""I told Cook India can take care of themselves, they are doing very well,"" Trump stated, demanding Apple increase US production instead of expanding in India.The confrontation escalated when Trump posted on Truth Social: ""I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.""This pressure campaign echoes Trump's first presidential term, when similar demands failed to materialize significant domestic iPhone production. The challenge stems from fundamental structural issues that Apple founder Steve Jobs identified in 2011, telling President Obama that manufacturing jobs ""aren't coming back"" due to America's skills gap in precision manufacturing.Industry experts estimate US-made iPhones would cost approximately $3,500 compared to the current $1,000 price tag, requiring Apple to invest $30 billion over three years to relocate just 10% of its supply chain domestically. The iPhone's complex assembly involves 2,700 different parts from 187 suppliers across 28 countries, with less than 5% currently manufactured in the US.Apple's Indian strategy, launched in 2017 with older iPhone models, has evolved into a comprehensive manufacturing base producing the complete iPhone lineup, including premium titanium Pro models. The company now manufactures most iPhones destined for the US market in India, with Bank of America analysts estimating Indian facilities will serve 100% of American demand.The timing proves fortuitous as India faces only a 26% tariff rate, currently paused for 90 days, compared to China's 30% levy. Apple's Indian production capacity is projected to reach 25 million iPhones annually by 2026, sufficient to meet quarterly US demand of 20 million devices.""India remains the only potential manufacturing destination for any player beyond China as the ecosystem is mushrooming,"" explains Tarun Pathak, Research Director at Counterpoint, citing lower-cost English-speaking skilled labor, world-class software talent, and favorable government policies.Despite Trump's pressure, Indian officials express confidence in Apple's commitment. ""There is no change in Apple's investment plans in India,"" a government source told CNBC-TV18, with Apple having ""assured the Indian government"" of continued investment.The manufacturing shift faces obstacles from both Washington and Beijing. Trump's tariff strategy aims to force domestic production, while China reportedly restricts access to high-tech machinery and talent needed for Apple's Indian suppliers.Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, calls US iPhone production ""a fairy tale,"" emphasizing that ""Apple will continue to plow ahead on the India path."" The structural challenges include America's manufacturing skills deficit, with former Apple executives noting that China can ""fill multiple football fields"" with tooling engineers while the US struggles to fill a single room.Omdia's Le Xuan Chiew warns that India's manufacturing capacity growth may not match demand immediately, noting ""It's still too early"" for complete supply chain migration. However, India's role as Apple's ""life raft"" under current tariff conditions appears secure, with the country positioned to strengthen its position as a critical manufacturing hub regardless of political pressures from Washington.","Apple's iPhone shipments from India to the United States soared 76% in April 2025, reaching 3 million devices.

St. Clair sues Musk over child support, alleged ghosting

Tesla CEO Elon Musk made a virtual appearance during a private hearing in a paternity and custody case filed by Ashley St. Clair on Thursday, May 29. The conservative influencer, who alleged to have given birth to Musk’s child, has filed a legal petition for custody. According to a Daily Mail report, Musk appeared on-screen wearing a dark suit jacket in a Manhattan courtroom while his lawyers, Alyssa Rower and Jennifer Isaacman, were present in person. The hearing comes hours later the tech billionaire announced his exit from DOGE, making his courtroom appearance even more unexpected.St. Clair, 26, filed the lawsuit in February, claiming that Musk had asked her to keep the birth of their child a secret. She alleges that after initial talks about child support, Musk cut off contact, forcing her to seek legal action.Following Thursday’s two-and-a-half-hour hearing, St. Clair was seen smiling as she left the courtroom with her attorneys, Dror Bikel and Karen B. Rosenthal. She wore a modest navy-blue sweater with a pleated skirt and a beige coat. Her lawyers declined to comment when approached by reporters.The hearing was held in Part 44 of the New York Supreme Court before Judge Jeffrey Pearlman. Due to the sensitive nature of the case, the judge ordered the proceedings sealed — a move first granted on March 14 at the request of Musk’s legal team, limiting what St. Clair can publicly discuss about the case.As mentioned above, the court session came less than 24 hours after Musk announced he was quitting his advisory role in the Trump administration. Taking to social media platform X, Musk wrote “As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.”","Ashley St. Clair, a conservative influencer, alleged to have given birth to Musk’s child, has filed a legal petition for custody.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has banned Bollywood actor Arshad Warsi, his wife Maria Goretti , and 57 others from the securities markets for periods ranging from one to five years, reports news agency PTI. In a detailed 109-page final order issued on Thursday - May 29, SEBI barred a total of 59 individuals and entities from the stock market for periods ranging from one to five years. The regulator imposed penalties ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 5 crore on various parties, including promoters of Sadhna Broadcast.Apart from the market bans and penalties, SEBI has directed all 59 entities to return a total of Rs 58.01 crore in unlawful gains. Additionally, the regulator has imposed 12% annual interest from the end of the investigation period until the actual date of repayment.As per the report, Arshad Warsi reportedly made Rs 41.70 lakh in profit, while Maria Goretti earned Rs 50.35 lakh.According to SEBI, the manipulation was carried out in two planned phases.

These trades created the illusion of strong market interest despite low trading volumes.In the second phase, false and promotional videos were circulated on YouTube channels like Moneywise, The Advisor, and Profit Yatra, all operated by Manish Mishra.These videos painted Sadhna Broadcast as a strong investment opportunity, coinciding with the inflated trading activity to attract unsuspecting retail investors.“The overall conduct of the noticees has revealed a classic pump-and-dump scheme. The price was systematically pushed upward through collusive trading, followed by aggressive promotional activity to draw in retail investors, and finally, a coordinated sell-off by the promoters,” SEBI whole-time member Ashwani Bhatia said in the order.The order names Gaurav Gupta, Rakesh Kumar Gupta, and Manish Mishra as the masterminds behind the operation. Subhash Aggarwal, a director at the registrar and transfer agent (RTA) of Sadhna Broadcast, acted as the link between Mishra and the company's promoters.Further, Peeyush Agarwal and Lokesh Shah — a dealer at Choice Broking and owner of its Delhi franchise, respectively — were found to have facilitated trades through accounts under their control to support the manipulation. Jatin Shah was identified as playing a key role in executing the scheme.","The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has banned Bollywood actor Arshad Warsi, his wife Maria Goretti, and 57 others from the securities markets for periods ranging from one to five years.

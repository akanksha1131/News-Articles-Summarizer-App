'Brickstorm' malware used for long-term access to government and IT infrastructure



‘Broadcom’s VMware a target of China-backed hackers’



What China has to say on hacking reports







US and Canadian cybersecurity agencies have issued a joint advisory, warning that hackers linked to China used malware attacks to penetrate and maintain long-term access to unnamed government and information technology entities. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the advisory has been signed by the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security.According to Madhu Gottumukkala, the acting director of CISA, the Chinese-linked operations are “infiltrating sensitive networks and embedding themselves to enable long-term access, disruption, and potential sabotage.”The agencies identified the malware used by the state-backed hackers as “Brickstorm.” They claim that this malware was deployed to target multiple government services and information technology entities. Once inside victim networks, the hackers stole login credentials and other sensitive information, essentially giving them the potential to take full control of targeted computers.The threat involves maintaining persistent access. The advisory cited one instance where the attackers used Brickstorm to penetrate a company in April 2024 and maintained access through at least September 3, 2025.The analysis is based on eight Brickstorm samples obtained from targeted organisations. CISA executive assistant director for Cybersecurity Nick Andersen, however, declined to share specific details on the total number of government organisations targeted or the full extent of the hackers' actions once inside the networks, the report noted.The hackers are reportedly deploying the malware against VMware vSphere, a product sold by Broadcom’s VMware used to create and manage virtual machines within networks. A Broadcom spokesperson encouraged all customers to apply up-to-date software patches and adhere to strong operational security in response to the reports.The Chinese embassy in Washington quickly rejected the allegations. Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson, stated that the Chinese government does not “encourage, support or connive at cyber attacks.” Liu added that they “reject the relevant parties' irresponsible assertion” about the activities, noting that the agencies had “neither put forward any request related to the issue nor presented any factual evidence.”","US and Canadian cybersecurity agencies have issued a joint advisory, warning that hackers linked to China used malware attacks to penetrate and maintain long-term access.

What is Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund

Microsoft shareholders approve CEO Satya Nadella's huge salary hike





Norway’s $2 trillion Sovereign Wealth Fund has voted for proposals against Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella . The world's largest Sovereign Wealth Fund voted at Microsoft’s shareholders' meeting on December 5, where multiple governance and compensation issues were also reviewed. The shareholder meeting was held virtually. At the shareholders meeting, Norway Fund voted against the re-election of CEO Satya Nadella as chair of the Microsoft Board. Similarly, the Fund also voted against Nadella’s compensation package as Microsoft CEO. Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund's vote against Nadella in both the cases is as per the Fund's general policy that has been to oppose a company's CEO doubling up as its chair, and it also has often complained that executive pay in America is excessive.The Fund voted against the re-election of Satya Nadella in keeping with its broader policy. It typically opposes governance structures in which a company CEO simultaneously serves as board chair, arguing that such dual roles can weaken accountability. As for voting against Nadella's salary, it underscores Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund's long-standing concerns about pay practices among major US companies. ""A substantial proportion of annual remuneration should be provided as shares that are locked in for five to ten years, regardless of resignation or retirement,"" it said while opposing Nadella's pay package.Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund is managed by Norges Bank Investment Management. It is one of the world's largest sovereign wealth fund. The Norway Sovereign Fund owned a 1.35% stake worth $50 billion in Microsoft as of June 30, according to fund data, its second-largest equity holding overall, after AI chip giant Nvidia. The Fund is Microsoft's eighth-largest shareholder, according to LSEG data.Microsoft shareholders' meeting saw all company-proposed items pass with strong support, including the advisory vote on executive compensation. Microsoft shareholders gave a resounding vote of confidence to CEO Satya Nadella’s leadership, approving a compensation package that soared to $96.5 million for fiscal 2025. This record high is driven by a 23% stock surge in 2025, with shares doubling in value over three years. The Microsoft Board’s compensation committee cited exceptional progress in AI as a key factor for approving the compensation package.Satya Nadella's pay package, detailed in regulatory filings, reflects a 22% increase from the previous year, largely fueled by stock awards tied to the company’s surging share price.",Norway's $2 trillion Sovereign Wealth Fund has voted for proposals against Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.

Massachusetts court hears arguments in lawsuit alleging Meta deliberately makes apps to be addictive to kids,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/massachusetts-court-hears-arguments-in-lawsuit-alleging-meta-deliberately-makes-apps-to-be-addictive-to-kids/articleshow/125809887.cms,"



Massachusetts’ highest court heard arguments this week in the state’s lawsuit accusing Meta of intentionally designing Facebook and Instagram features to hook young users, a move the attorney general reportedly says has harmed hundreds of thousands of teens. Attorney General Andrea Campbell’s office, which filed the lawsuit in 2024, argues Meta’s profit-driven design choices — including tools the company’s own research suggested could foster compulsive use — are at the core of the case.“We are making claims based only on the tools that Meta has developed because its own research shows they encourage addiction to the platform in a variety of ways,” State Solicitor David Kravitz told the court, as per a report by news agency AP. He emphasized the state is not challenging Meta’s content moderation or algorithms directly. Meta rejected the allegations, saying it is “confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people. ” Company lawyer Mark Mosier argued the state’s claims would “impose liabilities for performing traditional publishing functions” protected by the First Amendment.“The Commonwealth would have a better chance of getting around the First Amendment if they alleged that the speech was false or fraudulent,” Mosier said.“But when they acknowledge that it’s truthful, that brings it into the heart of the First Amendment.”Some justices appeared more focused on Meta’s product features than on the content users see.“I didn’t understand the claims to be that Meta is relaying false information … but that it has created an algorithm of incessant notifications … designed so as to feed into the fear of missing out that teenagers generally have,” Justice Dalila Wendland said, as per AP report. “That is the basis of the claim.”AP report added that Justice Scott Kafker pressed the issue further: “It’s not how to publish but how to attract you to the information. … It doesn’t care if it’s Thomas Paine’s ‘Common Sense’ or nonsense. It’s totally focused on getting you to look at it.”Meta faces a wave of similar state and federal lawsuits alleging it knowingly engineered addictive features — including endless scrolling and constant alerts — that can harm children’s mental health.In 2023, 33 states sued the Menlo Park-based tech giant, saying Meta illegally collects data on children under 13 without parental consent. Several states, including Massachusetts, brought additional cases over what they call harmful design choices.Concern intensified after 2021 reporting by The Wall Street Journal revealed Meta’s internal research showed Instagram could worsen body image and mental health issues for teens — especially girls. One study showed 13.5% of teen girls reported worsening suicidal thoughts and 17% said Instagram heightened eating-disorder struggles.Critics argue Meta has failed to take meaningful action. A report this year from former Meta employee and whistleblower Arturo Bejar and four nonprofit groups said the company has resisted “real steps” to improve safety, opting instead for “splashy headlines” about new parental controls and teen accounts.","Massachusetts’ highest court heard arguments this week in the state’s lawsuit accusing Meta of intentionally designing Facebook and Instagram features to hook young users.

Here's the full letter sent by Paramount to Warner Braothers (as it appears in CNBC)

Netflix Drops A $72b Bombshell On Hollywood With Mega Warner Bros Discovery Move | WHAT IT MEANS





Paramount Skydance is unhappy with how Warner Bros Discovery has conducted its sale process. Paramount Skydance is reportedly questioning the fairness of Warner Bros. Discovery’s sale process and whether it is acting in the best interest of shareholders. According to a letter reviewed by CNBC, Paramount made three offers to acquire the entirety of Warner Bros Discovery before the company launched a formal sale process. In the letter, Paramount attorneys told Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav that Paramount was questioning the “fairness and adequacy” of the process, which officially launched in October. In particular, Paramount’s letter calls out reports that WBD’s management appears to favor Netflix’s offer.Dear Mr. Zaslav: We write on behalf of Paramount Skydance Corporation (“Paramount”, “we” or “us”) to express our serious concerns about the fairness and adequacy of the bidding process for a potential combination with Warner Bros. Discovery (“WBD” or “you”). It has become increasingly clear, through media reporting and otherwise, that WBD appears to have abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process, thereby abdicating its duties to stockholders, and embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder.We specifically request and expect this letter will be shared and discussed with the full board of directors of WBD.We have recently seen reporting in the U.S. and foreign media that gives serious cause for concern. The German newspaper Handelsblatt recently reported on a meeting that reportedly took place in Brussels between Gerhard Zieler, President of WBD’s International Business and a direct report to WBD’s Chief Executive Officer, who “arrived with a three-person team,” with the E.U. Commission Vice President Hena Virkkunen, to discuss the potential merger prospects for WBD. In that conversation, the article reports that “concerns were raised that the Ellison family’s planned acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery could lead to excessive media concentration,” and that the E.U. Commission would consider intervening in a potential merger with Paramount for this reason. The article quotes “sources close” to Zeiler as saying “that the talks with the Commission were important because both Warner and the EU wanted to preserve media diversity.” The implications of such a meeting, if it occurred, are clear and evince a tacit resistance to, if not active sabotage of, a Paramount offer.While this report is concerning in itself, this is not an isolated report regarding purported WBD resistance to a combination with Paramount. Several U.S. media outlets have reported on the enthusiasm by WBD management for a transaction with Netflix, and on statements by management that a transaction between WBD and Netflix would be a “slam dunk,” while also referring to Paramount’s bid in a negative light. Additional reporting since the submission of revised bids on December 1 has indicated that WBD’s “board has really warmed to” a transaction with Netflix due to the “chemistry between” WBD management and Netflix management. We have come to you first to inquire whether this reporting is accurate, and to engage in a productive discussion with you around any actual or perceived issues that it may reflect.Moreover, these media reports echo similar indications that we have been hearing throughout this process, despite what we viewed as otherwise productive conversations that we have had with WBD leadership. Paramount has a credible basis to believe that the sales process has been tainted by management conflicts, including certain members of management’s potential personal interests in post-transaction roles and compensation as a result of the economic incentives embedded in recent amendments to employment arrangements. These concerns are amplified by indications of director bias and beholdenness to others whose interests may not align with the stockholders’, and the fact that alternatives involving only certain WBD assets are being prioritized notwithstanding their heightened regulatory risk and potential to deprive stockholders of consideration for the entirety of WBD’s enterprise value.Further, as you know, Paramount agreed to certain standstill arrangements in exchange for the opportunity to participate in a truly competitive and unbiased bidding process. Paramount did not bargain for WBD to foster, whether intentionally or unintentionally, a tilted and unfair process. We believe that all parties to this process should have a shared desire for, and will mutually benefit from, an unimpeachable transaction process. As we assume you agree, even discounting the accuracy of any media reports, just the appearance of a flawed process imperils any potential transaction that might result and may undermine the potential value maximization to WBD stockholders from any prospective transaction.In light of our grave concerns regarding the integrity of WBD’s process, we seek confirmation as to whether WBD has appointed an independent special committee of disinterested members of its board to consider the potential transaction opportunities and to make a final determination regarding a sale or break-up of all or part of the company. If not, we strongly urge you to empower such a special committee comprised of directors with no potential appearance of bias or beholdenness to others whose interests may differ from those of the stockholders. This would seem to be an important step at this stage, to ensure the fairness and unimpeachability of the transaction process and to maximize the value of whatever outcome WBD determines to pursue. Engaging with WBD throughout this process, we have been encouraged by the enormous potential from a combination of our entities. We remain confident that the Paramount offer would provide the maximum value to WBD stockholders and look forward to the opportunity to continue to engage with you productively in this process. But at this point we must insist on assurances and steps taken to ensure that a truly fair and independent process is being conducted, both for Paramount’s benefit and in the interest of WBD’s stockholders.","Paramount Skydance is unhappy with how Warner Bros Discovery has conducted its sale process.

How the Foxconn partnership can help OpenAI





“Foxconn is uniquely positioned to support OpenAI’s mission with trusted, scalable infrastructure,”





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US. This partnership is the AI startup's newest step in its extensive infrastructure development plans. The companies stated the goal is to accelerate infrastructure deployment and secure long-term US capacity for essential AI components. While financial terms were not disclosed, OpenAI confirmed it will have early access to evaluate the systems produced by the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and Apple ’s largest supplier, along with the option to purchase them.In a statement to CNBC, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the partnership, saying:adding that AI infrastructure presents aUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities, which are located in Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Indiana.Foxconn adds another manufacturing layer to OpenAI’s supply chain, which could help make production for the AI startup more local and speed up deployment. The company is widely known for assembling Apple’s iPhones, but it has also expanded into AI and automotive manufacturing. It builds server racks designed for AI workloads and is an important global supplier to Nvidia, a major producer of high-end AI chips.Chairman Young Liu said to CNBC.However, the company has had mixed results in the US. In 2018, Foxconn began construction of a large factory in Wisconsin intended to make flat-panel displays. The project did not succeed, and the site is now being used for an AI data centre under construction by Microsoft.OpenAI has recently made several major agreements with some of the world’s biggest technology companies, announcing spending plans of about $1.4 trillion.These commitments have raised questions about whether the company will eventually generate enough profit to support that level of investment.Earlier this month, Altman said the company expects to reach $20 billion in annualised revenue by the end of the year and aims to reach hundreds of billions by 2030.Previous deals include a $100 billion agreement (yet to be finalised) with Nvidia, under which the chipmaker would invest in OpenAI in phases as the company expands its infrastructure.OpenAI also has cloud partnerships with Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, as well as significant compute buildout commitments with Oracle.",AI startup OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US.

His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees.

The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

Netflix has shut down the game studio Boss Fight Entertainment, the developer behind the hit mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed. The closure comes as the streaming giant pivots its strategy within its expanding video gaming unit, a report has said.The studio’s co-founder and former CEO, David Rippy, confirmed the closure in a LinkedIn post this week. He said that the studio is “very grateful for the time” it had at Netflix. Read Rippy’s full post on LinkedIn.Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure. Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix.

Selecting the ""Haves and Have Nots""





Investor anxiety regarding the explosion of artificial intelligence-related debt is manifesting differently across investment-grade and high-yield markets, according to new research from Goldman Sachs. While big tech firms and emerging AI players have flooded the debt markets this year to fund a massive global data center build-out, the reception has cooled. AI-linked bonds are currently underperforming the broader credit market, and Goldman analysts note that the nature of investor worry depends heavily on the quality of the credit.In a research note released this week, the bank stated that concerns within the investment-grade (IG) market appear to be issuer-specific. In contrast, anxiety in the high-yield (junk bond) market is viewed as a broader, sector-wide concern.The underperformance comes as investors weigh the risks of construction delays and unproven revenue models against the massive capital expenditures required for AI infrastructure.Al Cattermole, fixed income portfolio manager at Mirabaud, told Reuters that as of November 25, his team had chosen not to invest in recent AI-linked investment-grade or junk bonds.Mirabaud, which manages approximately $37.4 billion (30 billion Swiss francs), cited opaque contracts and execution risks.""Until we see data centers being delivered on time and on budget and providing the computing power that they are intended to—and there still being the demand for it—it is untested,"" Cattermole said. ""And because it's untested, that's why I think you need to be compensated like an equity... not debt.""Despite the jitters, some managers see the volatility as a chance to buy into high-quality names.Christopher Kramer, portfolio manager on the investment-grade credit team at Neuberger Berman, noted that the structural shift to AI-linked debt creates opportunities for selective investors. He described the market as dividing into ""haves and have nots.""""Doing the credit work on the 'on balance' sheet versus 'off balance' sheet continues to be paramount,"" Kramer said. ""Security selection is going to be the name of the game and we're excited just from the standpoint that the market's changing.""Kramer did not comment on whether Neuberger, which manages $558 billion in assets, had participated in recent top-tier AI bond issuances.The market skepticism coincides with warnings from regulators. The Bank of England issued a warning this week stating that the growing role of debt in the AI infrastructure boom could heighten financial stability risks if valuations were to correct.While Goldman Sachs maintains that the overall credit market looks fundamentally healthy, the widening gap between AI-related debt and the broader market suggests that for debt investors, the AI hype cycle is facing a reality check.", AI-linked bonds are currently underperforming the broader credit market.

First Digital Services Act penalty targets X’s verification system



US officials clash with EU over tech regulation







The European Union has issued its first-ever fine under the landmark Digital Services Act, slapping Elon Musk 's X platform with a €120 million ($140 million) penalty for violating transparency rules. The European Commission announced that X breached regulations through its ""deceptive design"" of blue verification checkmarks, lack of advertising transparency, and failure to provide researchers access to public data.Musk responded defiantly to the fine, claiming on X that European regulators had offered an ""illegal secret deal"" to avoid penalties if the platform ""quietly censored speech without telling anyone."" He stated that while other platforms accepted the arrangement, X refused. The billionaire also revealed the fine was imposed on him personally, not just the company, calling it ""even more insane.""The EU's primary concern centers on X's blue checkmark system, which now indicates a paid subscription rather than verified identity. Under Musk's ownership, anyone can purchase verification status without meaningful identity confirmation, making it ""difficult for users to judge the authenticity of accounts,"" according to the Commission.Regulators argue this exposes users to scams, impersonation fraud, and manipulation by malicious actors.Executive Vice-President Henna Virkkunen stated that ""deceiving users with blue checkmarks, obscuring information on ads and shutting out researchers have no place online in the EU."" The investigation, launched two years ago, also found X's advertising repository lacks critical information such as who paid for advertisements, while the platform imposes barriers preventing independent researchers from accessing public data for studying systemic risks.The fine has triggered sharp criticism from American officials, with Vice President JD Vance posting that ""the EU should be supporting free speech not attacking American companies over garbage."" FCC Chairman Brendan Carr accused Europe of ""taxing Americans to subsidize a continent held back by Europe's own suffocating regulations.""X now has 60 days to address the blue checkmark violations and 90 days to submit plans fixing advertising and data access issues. Failure to comply may result in additional periodic penalties. The Digital Services Act allows fines up to 6% of global annual revenue for violations. The Trump administration has pressured the EU to soften tech regulations, warning of potential trade retaliation over what it views as unfair targeting of US companies.","The European Union has slapped Elon Musk's X platform with a €120 million ($140 million) penalty for violating transparency rules.

Stress behind the scenes

A human side to the billionaire

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang tells what makes Elon Musk 'very special'









Tesla CEO Elon Musk ’ ex-wife Talulah Riley revealed how Musk managed to express his love for her despite the mounting pressures of running multiple companies. In a BBC series The Elon Musk Show in 2022, Riley described how Musk was overwhelmed by the pressure of running Tesla, SpaceX and SolarCity and realised late on Christmas Eve in Boulder, Colorado, that he had forgotten to buy her a present. “It’s not that I don’t love you—I do really, really love you. It’s just that my brain is exploding,” he told her.Riley recalled that on a Christmas eve Elon Musk recalled the occasion and slipped out the bed in the middle of the night. She mentioned that Musk was only wearing a T-shirt and short and then he went into the snow without any slippers. He then returned hours later with a bouquet of hand-picked flowers which he had dug out of the frozen ground. Giving the flowers to Riley Musk said, “I just wanted to show you how much I loved you. ”Riley mentioned that Elon Musk was under immense strain at that time. SpaceX was fighting for survival after repeated failures and Tesla was racing to deliver the Model S with a $465 million government loan and SolarCity was struggling to gain traction. Riley recalled how she was worried about Elon Musk’s health. ““He was under incredible stress.I was worried he was going to have a heart attack. I just kept thinking, God, I’ve got to keep this guy alive,” Riley said.The midnight gesture, though unconventional, became a symbol of Musk’s emotional intensity. Riley has often defended him against perceptions of being cold or detached. “He is the most emotional person I know,” she said. “He feels very, very deeply.”Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has previously praised Elon Musk for his contribution in the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), saying he’s doing just the right things. In a recent podcast with Joe Rogan, Huang again commended the Tesla CEO, recounting an episode when he was the sole early buyer of the DGX-1 AI supercomputer in 2016. Huang further said that later he personally delivered the machine to X (formerly Twitter) owner in a small room that turned out to be OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.“When I announced this thing, nobody in the world wanted it. I had no purchase orders—not one. Nobody wanted to buy it. Nobody wanted to be part of it, except for Elon. He was at the event, and we were doing a fireside chat about the future of self-driving cars,” he told Rogan.However, the excitement was quickly dampened when Musk told him that he has a non-profit company.“And he goes, ‘You know what? I have a company that could really use this.’ And I said, ‘Wow, my first customer.’ I was pretty excited about it. And he goes, ‘Yeah, we have this company. It’s a non-profit company’,” Huang said, recounting the moment during a fireside chat.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk's ex-wife Talulah Riley revealed how Musk managed to express his love for her despite the mounting pressures of running multiple companies.

The race towards AGI



IBM CEO Arvind Krishna says not due to AI, many companies are laying off







IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has note of caution as the all the big tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and others are pouring billions into building AI infrastructure. As reported by Fortune, speaking at the Decoder podcast earlier this month, Krishan argued that the huge investments made in building massive data centres is unlikely to deliver the returns the tech giants are expecting. Krishna pointed out that even a simple calculation shows the math doesn’t add up. He highlighted that building a data center capable of consuming just one gigawatt of power costs around $80 billion. If a single company commits to around 20 to 30 gigawatts, would mean capital expenditure of around $1.5 trillion which roughly equates to the current market cap of Tesla.So, collectively, the hyperscalers could add up to 100 gigawatts of capacity, but Krishna estimated that would require $8 trillion in investment. “It’s my view that there’s no way you’re going to get a return on that, because $8 trillion of capex means you need roughly $800 billion of profit just to pay for the interest,” he said.The data from Goldman Sachs underscores the challenge, The global data center market presently consumes around 55 gigawatts of power out of which only 14% is dedicated to AI. By the year 2027 which demand can go up to 84 gigawatts, driven by AI workloads.Krishna has now warned that the chips powering these centers could quickly become obsolete, forcing the companies to refresh infrastructure in every five years. “You’ve got to use it all in five years, because at that point, you’ve got to throw it away and refill it,” he explained.Speaking at the podcast, Krishan further suggested that part of the motivation behind these massive investments is the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, he still believes that the odds of reaching AGI with current large language model technology are slim. “There’s at most a 1% chance this feat can be accomplished with our current technology,” he said.Skeptical of AGI timelines, Krishan was also clear about AI’s enterprise potential. “I think it’s incredibly useful for enterprise. I think it’s going to unlock trillions of dollars of productivity in the enterprise, just to be absolutely clear,” he added.Despite the warnings made by Krishna, the companies like Google, Microsoft and others are still accelerating spending. Google parent Alphabet recently raised its 2025 capital expenditure outlook to $91–93 billion, while Amazon lifted its estimate to $125 billion. Industry-wide, AI infrastructure investments are expected to reach $380 billion this year alone.IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has refuted the narrative that the current wave of mass layoffs across the tech industry is primarily due to the artificial intelligence (AI) technology, arguing that the job cuts are largely a “natural correction” following over-hiring during the pandemic years. Krishna, however, acknowledged that AI will eventually lead to some job displacement, but suggested that many companies are currently laying off staff because they overhired between 2020 and 2023.In an interview with The Verge, Krishna used strong terms to describe the rapid staffing increases across the industry during the lockdown era.""If you look at the total employment numbers, I think people gorged on employment... during the pandemic and the year after,"" Krishna explained. He noted that some companies saw their employee count spike by ""30, 40, 50, 100 percent"" from 2020 to 2023.“There is going to be some natural correction. Business is never completely optimized. I think in engineering terms, it’s an underdamped system. When there’s a need, it goes above. Now, it has to correct. It’s probably going to go below what’s needed, and then it’ll hit the correct equilibrium, depending on market demand and growth,” the CEO noted.",IBM CEO Arvind Krishna says huge investments in building massive data centres is unlikely to deliver the returns the tech giants are expecting.

The burden of a CEO



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang tells you what to believe and not to on all the AI bubble talk







Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently shared some insights on leadership, vision and sacrifice during a talk held at Cambridge Union Debating Center. During the talk he emphasised that the true strategy is not only about deciding what to pursue but it is also about the discipline of knowing and understanding what to leave behind. Reflecting on his early Nvidia days, Huang said that he could see the evolution of the company in his head long before to materialised and became a reality. “Manifest your belief as deeply as you can,” he told students, explaining how conviction helped him stay committed when the startup faced uncertainty. He stressed that Nvidia’s success was rooted in unshakable principles: “We believe what we believe.”Huang further noted that while his team worked on the assumptions of the firm, he constantly tested them. “Every single day, I gut check the assumptions I made,” he said, adding that course corrections were made only when necessary, without being swayed by outside pressures.Huang also stressed on the importance of adaptability in the journey of entrepreneurship. “I am constantly learning through failure,” he admitted, urging students to remain flexible when pursuing ambitious goals. He also highlighted Nvidia’s role in creating new industries, pointing to the invention of the GPU and CUDA accelerated computing, which he described as sparking the AI industrial revolution.Talking about the realities of leadership, Huang explained that being a CEO is a “a lifetime of sacrifice” in service of the company. “Strategy is not just about choosing what to do. It’s about choosing what not to do, which is sacrifice, and the determination, the conviction, the pain and suffering that goes along with overcoming obstacles,” he said.Dismissing the notion of fame and glory, Huang emphasised that on the importance of creating conditions for others to achieve their life’s work. “You’re inspiring through example,” he told the audience.Honoured with Hawking FellowshipAhead of the discussion, Huang was honoured with Professor Stephen Hawking Fellowship Award. The prestigious award recognises the contributions of individuals in the field of science and technology.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has once again addressed the topic of AI bubble. Recenty, Huang talked about the issue that whether artificial intelligence is moving towards a bubble reminiscent of the dot-com crash. Speaking at the 2025 US-Saudi Investment forum, Huang delivered a three-minute response that reframed the conversation. Instead of focusing on the market valuations, Huang argued that the investors are worried about a bubble may be overlooking the fundamental technological shift which is already reshaping global computing.Speaking at the event, Huang started pointing to a structural constraint in computer science: the end of Moore’s Law, the decades-long trend of transistor density doubling every two years. Huang added that the trend has now plateaued, creating a widening gap between skyrocketing demand for computing power and the industry’s ability to supply it through traditional chips. “This isn’t speculation—it’s a fundamental challenge driving the need for new computing paradigms,” Huang said.This gap, he explained, is why companies are not merely experimenting with AI infrastructure but committing massive capital expenditures to it out of necessity.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently shared some insights on leadership, vision and sacrifice during a talk held at Cambridge Union Debating Center. He stressed that Nvidia’s success was rooted in unshakable principles: “We believe what we believe.”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125803715,imgsize-71690,width-400,resizemode-4/jensen-huang-effect-hits-wall-street-oklo-surges-24-as-ai-turns-to-mini-nuclear-reactors.jpg"

Buy now or pay more later, PC manufacturers warn



Industry scrambles as product roadmaps unravel







Major PC manufacturers Dell and Lenovo are preparing significant price increases on laptops and desktops, with hikes of 15-20% expected as early as mid-December, according to market analysis firm TrendForce. The moves come as an ""unprecedented"" memory shortage driven by AI data center demand sends component costs soaring.Lenovo has begun warning retail and enterprise customers that current pricing will expire January 1, 2026, with new rates taking effect immediately after. Dell may move even faster, implementing price adjustments before year's end, TrendForce reported based on industry sources.The crisis stems from semiconductor manufacturers redirecting DRAM and NAND flash production away from consumer devices toward lucrative AI server contracts. Memory prices have surged 70% year-over-year, with some components jumping as much as 170%, according to TrendForce.""We're in a very unique time. It's unprecedented. We have not seen costs move at the rate that we've seen,"" Dell COO Jeff Clarke told investors during a November earnings call, as reported by CRN. ""It's not unique to DRAM, it's NAND. It is hard drives, leading edge nodes across the semiconductor network.""Dell confirmed to Gizmodo that it will take ""targeted pricing action, when necessary, while maintaining supply continuity."" The company's brands include consumer laptops and its premium Alienware gaming line.HP CEO Enrique Lores revealed that memory costs now represent 15-18% of a typical PC's production cost—nearly double last year's figure. The shortage particularly impacts AI-enabled PCs, which require minimum 16GB RAM configurations.The shortage particularly impacts AI-enabled PCs, which require minimum 16GB RAM configurations to run on-device AI features. Microsoft's Copilot+ designation and similar AI-focused systems from other manufacturers demand even more memory, further straining already tight supplies.The memory crunch follows Micron's recent decision to discontinue its consumer-focused Crucial brand after nearly 30 years, redirecting production capacity entirely toward AI data center clients. Industry experts warn the shortage could persist through 2026, with some predicting elevated DRAM prices lasting until 2028.TrendForce has downgraded its 2026 notebook shipment forecast from 1.7% growth to a 2.4% decline as manufacturers reconsider product roadmaps. Samsung, LG, HP, and other major players are reportedly delaying launches or redesigning products to manage the cost crisis. Smaller manufacturers face even steeper challenges—gaming handheld maker OneXPlayer has halted orders for its Apex device entirely while renegotiating component contracts.Lenovo has begun stockpiling memory components, reportedly holding over 50% more inventory than usual to prepare for extended shortages. Industry experts warn the crunch could persist through 2026, with some analysts predicting elevated DRAM prices lasting until 2028 as AI infrastructure buildouts continue absorbing supply.If you're in the market for a new laptop, now might be the time to pull the trigger before prices jump.","Major PC manufacturers Dell and Lenovo are preparing price increases on laptops and desktops.

Microsoft steps back from decade-long transparency commitments

Employee reactions reveal internal tensions over policy changes





Microsoft has eliminated diversity and inclusion as companywide core priorities from employee performance reviews, marking a significant retreat from commitments made following the 2020 George Floyd protests, according to reports from The Verge and Game File.The changes, implemented last month through the company's internal Connect system, removed mandatory questions requiring employees to detail their contributions toward diversity and security improvements. Previously, workers had to answer ""What impact did your actions have in contributing to a more diverse and inclusive Microsoft?"" alongside similar security-related queries, The Verge reported.The Redmond giant announced the alterations via a Viva Engage post rather than mass email, describing them as a ""simplification"" where core priorities are now simply called goals.According to Wired, Microsoft has also confirmed it will not publish its annual diversity and inclusion report this year, ending a streak of public disclosures dating back over a decade.Frank Shaw, Microsoft's chief communications officer, stated the company has ""evolved beyond"" traditional reporting ""to formats that are more dynamic and accessible—stories, videos, and insights that show inclusion in action.""However, internal HR documentation now uses only ""inclusion"" instead of ""diversity,"" stating that ""inclusion is embedded in how you work, interact, and lead.""The policy shift follows President Donald Trump's executive order targeting corporate DEI initiatives earlier this year. In July 2024, Microsoft laid off an internal DEI team due to ""changing business needs,"" with the team leader writing in an internal email that ""true systems-change work associated with DEI programs everywhere are no longer business critical or smart as they were in 2020,"" Business Insider reported.Employee responses have been mixed.Others weren't surprised by the retreat. Several employees cited CEO Satya Nadella's controversial decision to showcase Elon Musk at Microsoft's Build conference in May—when Musk was actively dismantling government DEI programs—as a signal of shifting priorities. The appearance particularly angered Microsoft's GLEAM group representing LGBTQIA+ employees and allies.Despite the changes, Microsoft spokesperson Jeff Jones insisted: ""Our D&I commitments remain unchanged.

CEO Sam Altman's 'code red' directive prioritizes core performance like speed and reliability over new features. This rapid shift highlights the intense AI race, with rivals like Elon Musk also teasing updates.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

OpenAI shifts strategy from features to fundamentals





OpenAI is rushing to release GPT-5.2 as early as December 9, advancing its timeline by weeks after Google's Gemini 3 model topped industry benchmarks and drew rare praise from competitors including xAI CEO Elon Musk and OpenAI's own Sam Altman . The accelerated launch follows CEO Altman's ""code red"" directive earlier this week, marking one of the fastest competitive responses in the AI race.Sources familiar with OpenAI's plans say the company originally scheduled GPT-5.2 for later in December but moved up the release after Gemini 3's November launch disrupted the competitive landscape. Internal evaluations reportedly show GPT-5.2 performing ahead of Google's model, though OpenAI declined to comment on the upcoming release.The intensity of competition became visible when industry leaders publicly acknowledged Google's achievement. Musk congratulated Google CEO Sundar Pichai and DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis despite watching his own Grok 4.1 model lose its top leaderboard ranking after just one day. Musk quickly signaled his response, teasing the release of Grok 4.20. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, joined the chorus, calling Gemini 3 ""a great model"" in a rare public acknowledgment of a rival's success.Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff went further, announcing he was abandoning ChatGPT after three years of daily use.Benioff declared the switch permanent, stating the improvements in reasoning, speed, and multimedia handling made it feel like ""the world just changed, again.""Altman's code red represents more than a faster release schedule. The directive instructed teams to prioritize improvements to ChatGPT's core performance—speed, reliability, and customization—over new feature development. The strategic pivot reflects how quickly the competitive landscape has shifted, with companies now forced to respond to rivals within weeks rather than the months-long cycles that previously defined major AI releases.However, OpenAI's December 9 target date remains tentative. The company has historically adjusted launch schedules based on technical challenges, server capacity constraints, and competitive pressures, meaning GPT-5.2 could still arrive later than planned.","OpenAI is rushing to release GPT-5.2 as early as December 9.

Anthropic revenue grows 10x annually: Amodei







Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has spoken on the highly discussed massive spending in the intelligence space. Speaking at this year's DealBook Summit, Amodei addressed concerns about whether hundreds of billions of dollars being poured into AI data centres will pay off. He acknowledged that the industry is taking on “considerable risk” by such a splash out on infrastructure, but expressed confidence that the technology will ultimately deliver economic value.Replying to a question on overspending and whether “the math of all of this makes sense,” Amodei drew a distinction between technological and economic considerations.“So this is really complicated, and I want to separate out the technological side of it from the economic side of it,"" Amodei said.“On the technological side of it, I feel really solid. I think I'm one of the most bullish people around, and I think it pencils out,” he added. He highlighted that as models are trained using relatively simple methods with minor modifications, “they get better and better at every task under the sun.”Amodei pointed to Anthropic’s own performance as evidence of AI's economic potential. He said the company focuses heavily on enterprise clients and serves as a reliable indicator of the technology's value.“We look at our revenue. It's grown 10x a year, every year for the last three years,” Amodei said, suggesting that the company may be “a purer barometer than the others, which filter through consumers, which kind of have their habits and their use cases.”While acknowledging uncertainty about whether the explosive growth will continue, Amodei expressed confidence in the long-term trajectory. “Will it continue? I don't know. But the technology is driving there and the economic value is coming with it,” he said.He also predicted that the current growth trend “is going to slow down for sure, but it's still going to be really fast.”","Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei spoke on the highly discussed massive spending in the intelligence space.

Opposition cries censorship







Taiwan’s government has announced that it will ban access to the Chinese social media platform Rednote (known as Xiaohongshu in Chinese) for one year, citing security risks. The announcement attracted protest from the island’s largest opposition party, calling it an act of censorship. The Ministry of the Interior alleged that the Instagram-like app has been connected to more than 1,700 fraud cases since 2024. The app has approximately three million users in Taiwan.The Presidential Office has supported the ban, as per news agency Reuters. Karen Kuo, spokesperson for Taiwan's presidential office, told reporters that the Ministry of the Interior had offered a prompt explanation regarding the fraud and security risks. “We respect the ministry's decision and express our support,” she said.The Interior Ministry stated that it had attempted to contact Rednote to request concrete measures to ensure data safety but did not receive a response from the platform.The proposal, meanwhile, drew sharp criticism from the Kuomintang (KMT) party. Cheng Li-wun, Chairwoman of the KMT, took to Facebook to criticise the decision, noting that users are already searching for ways to circumvent the ban, using an expression common in China for skirting online censorship.Cheng stated that banning the app constitutes a major restriction on internet freedom. She lamented that Taiwan's “long-prized internet freedom and freedom of speech have already been restricted and strangled by the Democratic Progressive Party [DPP] in the name of national security,” referring to the ruling party.According to a report by Reuters, Taiwan prides itself on its open internet access, contrasting sharply with China's ban on platforms like Facebook, X, YouTube and Google. Taiwan's government has repeatedly warned its population about the risks of using Chinese apps, largely due to the threat of disinformation originating from Beijing.","Taiwan to ban access to Chinese social media platform Rednote for one year.

The risk of superintelligent systems that humanity cannot control



AI could make war cheaper, bloodless and politically irresistible

Deepfakes could destroy elections and public trust



A civilisation-level threat unless regulation catches up





Geoffrey Hinton, widely known as the “godfather of AI”, has delivered one of his starkest warnings yet, arguing that the world’s most powerful tech billionaires are pushing artificial intelligence forward at a pace that could destabilise economies, erase millions of jobs and unleash forces humanity may not be able to control. Speaking in a public conversation with US Senator Bernie Sanders at Georgetown University, Hinton said the unchecked ambitions of Silicon Valley’s richest men risk triggering an AI-driven crisis with no safety net in place.Hinton singled out Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison and Jeff Bezos, noting that they are investing hundreds of billions into AI and robotics while failing to grasp the long-term consequences. According to Hinton, their race to dominate the AI frontier risks undermining the very economic system that made them wealthy.“They haven’t really thought through that if workers don’t get paid, there’s nobody to buy their products,” he said, warning that Silicon Valley’s obsession with automation could backfire on the companies leading it.Unlike past industrial revolutions, Hinton believes AI will not replace old jobs with new ones at anything close to a sustainable rate.He warned that once AI becomes as smart as humans or smarter it will be able to perform virtually any task people currently do.“The people who lose their jobs won’t have other jobs to go to,” he said. “Any job they might do can be done by AI.”Call-centre roles, administrative work, junior technical roles and basic analysis tasks, he noted, are only the beginning. What follows could be structural unemployment on a scale modern economies have never experienced.Hinton cautioned that today’s AI systems already “know thousands of times more than any one person” and are rapidly improving. Many of the world’s top AI researchers, he said, believe it is inevitable that AI will surpass human intelligence, and no one knows how humanity will coexist with something smarter than itself.He described a scenario in which advanced AI agents develop sub-goals such as self-preservation and the desire for greater control, making them increasingly resistant to human oversight.“We’ve already seen AIs attempt to deceive people who try to turn them off,” he warned.One of Hinton’s most disturbing predictions involves the future of warfare. He argued that AI-powered drones and humanoid robots could allow rich nations to wage war without risking the lives of their own citizens. That removes one of the major political pressures that currently restrains military aggression.“Rich countries could invade poor countries and only the poor would die,” Hinton said. “There would be no political blowback when there are no soldiers coming home in boxes.”Hinton said AI systems will soon be able to generate fake videos and audio indistinguishable from reality, eroding the integrity of elections and public discourse. Attempts to build AI that detect fakes will fail, he argued, because generative models will always be able to outsmart detection systems.“We have to rely on provenance, not detection,” he said, suggesting digital signatures to prove the authenticity of political videos.Both Hinton and Sanders agreed that governments are failing to regulate AI at even the most basic level. Safety testing requirements, restrictions on biological misuse and transparency obligations for companies remain largely absent in the US and many other countries.Hinton warned that unless governments enforce strict oversight, the consequences could be catastrophic.“We ought not build systems smarter than us until we know how people can coexist with them,” he said. “Right now, we simply don’t.”",Geoffrey Hinton warns that the world’s most powerful tech billionaires are pushing artificial intelligence forward at a pace that could destabilise economies.

Edvoy launches app to help students planning to study abroad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/edvoy-launches-app-to-help-students-planning-to-study-abroad/articleshow/125794107.cms,"Edvoy has launched a groundbreaking app, revolutionising international student admissions. This all-in-one digital platform streamlines course search, documentation, counselling, finance, and accommodation, replacing fragmented processes. Addressing the challenges faced by millions of Indian students, the app offers AI-powered course matching, real-time tracking, and faster decision-making, making studying abroad simpler and more transparent.





Edvoy app availabilty and how it works













Edvoy has launched a fully integrated app that replaces the traditional agent-driven and paperwork-heavy admissions process with a single digital workflow. Built for scale, the platform unifies course search, documentation, counselling, accommodation and education finance, creating a category that did not exist until now. The launch arrives at a critical moment where more than 1.8 million Indian students are preparing to move overseas in 2025, yet most still navigate their journey through scattered agents, WhatsApp threads, bank portals and manually uploaded documents that increasingly fail compliance checks. Edvoy’s app consolidates the entire journey in one place, supported by multi-stage verification, real-time tracking and access to more than 75,000+ courses across 750+ universities.The Edvoy app is now available for download on Google Play and Apple Store. Students, parents and counselors can access the full suite of study abroad tools by installing the app.Despite rapid growth in student mobility, the current study abroad process remains fractured. Students often move between agents, email threads, WhatsApp messages, bank portals and university websites. The Edvoy app replaces this patchwork with a single interface where students can explore more than 75,000 courses across 750 institutions, compare programmes and complete a 100% paperless document upload.All submitted documents undergo Edvoy’s multi-stage compliance review. The workflow detects fraudulent activity and prepares students for CAS and integrity checks, which are now mandatory in major destinations. Students can track the status of their applications in real time, reducing uncertainty and ensuring transparency at every stage.A standout feature of the app is Genie, Edvoy’s AI course matching tool. Genie analyses academic history, English language scores, study gaps, budget and regional rules, then categorises results into three tiers and provides a predictive score for admission likelihood. This helps students identify realistic options within seconds and understand how their profile aligns with institutional requirements.The app also offers Express Offers for decisions from select institutions within 24 hours. Students can access one-to-one expert counselling, chat instantly with advisors or book video sessions in under a minute. Continuous guidance is available throughout the application, financial and accommodation stages.To simplify financial planning, the platform supports secure deposit and application fee payments. Students can compare education loans from more than 15 banks and NBFCs, check eligibility instantly and complete the application fully online. Approvals can be obtained in as little as three days.For accommodation, the app provides access to verified properties across more than 700 university cities. Students can compare options and pre-book their stay directly through the platform.The new app serves as a single destination for the entire international admissions lifecycle, covering course search, documentation, counselling, financial planning and housing.

A7A5 Stablecoin eyes wider cross-border use,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/a7a5-stablecoin-eyes-wider-cross-border-use/articleshow/125795421.cms,"



Bengaluru: Oleg Ogienko, director for regulatory and overseas affairs at A7A5, is careful to frame the stablecoin not as a geopolitical instrument but as plumbing for cross-border payments that Russia built under pressure. Ogienko told TOI that Moscow’s crypto policy began to shift only after US and European sanctions on Russian entities forced regulators to find new ways to support external trade. Those “external curbs,” he said, pushed authorities to recognise that blockchain-based settlement could “improve our international trade,” opening access to distant markets when traditional fiat channels became harder to use. Stablecoins already account for about 5% of Russia’s international trade settlements, he added, and could reach 15% globally within five years, led by non-dollar tokens. A7A5 has become one of the most prominent—and most controversial—examples of that pivot. The ruble-pegged stablecoin, issued in Kyrgyzstan, has been sanctioned by the UK and flagged in EU measures for allegedly helping Russian firms circumvent restrictions.Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis estimates A7A5 processed more than $51 billion in volume through July, largely via Russian-linked platforms such as Garantex successor Grinex and a dedicated swap venue that already moved around $1.5 billion into mainstream dollar-backed stablecoins.Western officials cite these flows as evidence that the token sits at the centre of what they describe as Russia’s shadow crypto economy. Ogienko disputes that characterisation, insisting the issuer is “a regulated entity” in what he calls a crypto-friendly Kyrgyz regime and that it follows local know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering rules. He said A7A5 is used as an intermediary asset in export-import deals between Russian firms and overseas partners: the ruble token provides liquidity, is swapped into a local stablecoin, and then converted into fiat through banking rails to complete trade settlements.","Oleg Ogienko, director for regulatory and overseas affairs at A7A5, is careful to frame the stablecoin not as a geopolitical instrument but as plumbing for cross-border payments that Russia built under pressure.

This breakthrough aims to power next-generation Chinese XR headsets and lightweight AI glasses, promising enhanced spatial computing capabilities and reduced device weight for a more immersive user experience.

""photon-to-photon latency (PTP)""

“a significant breakthrough for China in the area of

spatial computing

.”

How this chip is better than Apple's Vision Pro chip





Chinese start-up GravityXR is gaining attention for a new chip capable of powering MR headsets and AI glasses. The company, founded by Wang Chaohao, a graduate from Stanford who earlier worked on Apple 's Extended Reality (XR) team, introduced the all-in-one MR chip Jizhi G-X100 last week. According to a report by South China Morning Post, the company claims that GravityXR is China's first to use advanced chips which is based on 5nm technology. As per the company, the new line of chips goes one step further than Apple's chip in some ways. The new chip line is expected to be a key component of upcoming Chinese high-end XR headsets and lightweight AI glasses, similar to Apple's Vision Pro headset.GravityXR said the G-X100 has aof just 9 milliseconds (ms), compared with 12 ms for Apple's Vision Pro. The Yongjiang Lab in Ningbo, which supported Wang's company early on, called the chipSpatial computing is the technology that enables devices to combine the real world with a virtual world through extended reality.According to the lab, the new chip solved an essential challenge for smart mixed reality devices. The chip was very fast and powerful, using little energy, and therefore enabling AI glasses to weigh less than 100 grams.PTP latency in AR headsets refers to the time it takes for an image to pass through a headset to what a user sees. This is important because longer delays break the smooth linkage of virtual content with real-world events, thus causing visual discomfort and confusion for users, explained He Wancheng, an analyst at XR consulting firm Wellsenn.XR encompasses technologies such as AR and MR, which merge virtual and physical worlds with each other, all the way to virtual reality, which completely replaces what users see in the real world.According to consulting firm Counterpoint Research, global XR display shipments were projected to grow 6% this year, while AR glasses shipments were seen to rise 42% in the same period.Along with the Jizhi G-X100, GravityXR also introduced two other chips. One chip records high-quality video in product categories such as AR glasses, while the other chip uses less power for creating spatial and three-dimensional images.GravityXR is backed by investors like HongShan (previously Sequoia Capital China), Gaorong Capital, Chinese electronics maker Goertek, and video game developer miHoYo. Its customers include Meta Platforms, Goertek, and Chinese robotics company Agibot, according to a report by Ningbo Daily.",Chinese startup GravityXR has unveiled its Jizhi G-X100 MR chip.

Perplexity latest AI company to hit with lawsuit







The New York Times has filed a lawsuit on Friday (December 5) against Perplexity. The publication alleged that the artificial intelligence (AI) startup has repeatedly violated its copyrights. In the lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York, the publication claims it had contacted Perplexity multiple times over the past 18 months, demanding that the AI company, known for its cutting-edge search engine, ceases using The Times’ material until a licensing agreement could be negotiated. However, Perplexity continued to use the content without permission or compensation, the lawsuit states.“Perplexity provides commercial products to its own users that substitute for The Times, without permission or remuneration,” the lawsuit asserts.The lawsuit accuses Perplexity of violating copyrights primarily through its search engine, which generates direct responses to user queries using information retrieved from The Times’s digital platforms. It further claims that this distribution of content constitutes an unfair use of copyrighted material because Perplexity grabbed large chunks of the publication’s content and provided information that directly competes with The Times’s own offering.In some cases, the lawsuit says, entire articles were presented to users. Furthermore, The Times accused the AI startup of damaging its brand by sometimes producing fabricated information and falsely attributing that made-up content to The New York Times.The action against Perplexity constitutes the latest legal battle between copyright holders and AI developers over the unauthorised use of proprietary content for training models and generating user responses.This is the second lawsuit the publication has filed against an AI company. It previously sued OpenAI and its partner Microsoft in December 2023 for allegedly training their systems on millions of Times articles without compensation. Meanwhile, this is the second legal challenge against Perplexity, having previously been sued by Dow Jones, which owns The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post, August 2024.In September, another AI company Anthropic agreed to pay book authors and publishers $1.5 billion after a judge ruled the company had illegally downloaded and stored copyrighted books to build its AI systems.The Times has also struck a multiyear licensing deal with Amazon to allow the tech giant to use its editorial content for training Amazon’s AI platforms.",Perplexity latest AI company to be hit with lawsuit by The New York Times.

Internal tensions and structural challenges



Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg ’s aggressive AI talent poaching has been the talk of the tech circles lately. Now it appears that the Meta CEO is embracing a new and radical strategy by placing his biggest AI bet on the smallest teams at his company. As reported by Business Insider, during the recent earnings call Zuckerberg described Meta’s new Superintelligence Labs as “a bit of a different setup,” which contrasts it with the company’s workforce which has more than 70,000 employees. At the heart of this new transformation is the TBD Lab. The lab is a secretive group which consists of elite AI researchers led by Alexandr Wang. This new lab has task of creating Meta’s most advanced AI models — what Zuckerberg calls “personal superintelligence.”“I’ve just gotten a little bit more convinced around the ability for small, talent-dense teams to be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research,” Zuckerberg said. Meta CEO feels that breakthroughs in the filed of AI are best achieved by small and compact groups which can hold the complete problem space ‘in their head’ rather than depending on the massive engineering teams like the ones that manage Facebook’s newsfeed.This philosophy mirrors a growing trend across Silicon Valley, where lean teams are seen as faster, more agile, and more innovative. Startups like Hightouch, which has raised over $132 million with just 55 engineers, exemplify the model. On the other hand, Nat Friedman, former GitHub CEO and now part of Meta’s AI product integration team, has championed the idea that most tech companies are “two to ten times overstaffed.”Meta’s pivot towards the ‘startup mode’ has created a bit of a friction within the company. As reported by Business Insider, the creation of Superintelligence Labs has led to resentment and resignation threats among legacy researchers, who have been sidelined after coming of the new hires.On the other hand, experts also suggest that small teams inside large companies often struggle to deliver transformational change. “They can produce useful products and efficiency gains,” said Elliott Parker, CEO of Alloy Partners, “but rarely the kind of fundamental shift that reshapes the parent company.”Lately, Meta has reorganised its AI division. The company has dissolved its two major AI units and is now dealing with the risk of overlap between micro teams.The Superintelligence LabsDespite the risks, Zuckerberg remains bullish. He sees small, elite teams as the key to staying competitive in the AI race, especially as breakthroughs like the 2017 “Attention Is All You Need” paper—authored by just eight researchers—continue to shape the field.“For the leading research on superintelligence,” Zuckerberg said, “you really want the smallest group that can hold the whole thing in their head.”", Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is placing his biggest AI bet on the smallest teams at his company.

AI talent war has become intense in the last few months. Some even call it bizarre. Leading the way here is Mark Zuckerberg's AI company. Meta is reportedly offering pay packages of more than $100 million to lure top researchers from leading labs like OpenAI. This aggressive recruitment strategy, which has already secured several high-profile hires, has ignited a fierce talent war and is raising concerns across the tech industry about escalating costs and competition.The motivation behind Meta's extravagant spending was bluntly explained by Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, during a recent appearance on the ""Lex Fridman"" podcast. Hassabis suggested that Meta's actions are a direct response to its position as an AI laggard. Google DeepMind's CEO said that there is a simple reason Meta is spending millions of dollars to attract AI talent. ""Meta right now are not at the frontier,"" he said. ""It's probably rational what they're doing from their perspective because they're behind and they need to do something.""Meta's recent recruiting spree has already netted some major names, including former GitHub chief Nat Friedman, ex-Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, and several former OpenAI researchers such as Shengjia Zhao, Shuchao Bi, Jiahui Yu, and Hongyu Ren.However, the pursuit of talent isn't solely about money for everyone in the industry. Hassabis emphasized that many in the AI community prioritize a mission to ""steward that technology safely."" He noted that while companies must pay market rates, ""there's more important things than just money.""This sentiment was echoed by Benjamin Mann, cofounder of AI research company Anthropic. Mann stated that his firm has been ""much less affected"" by the talent war because its researchers are deeply ""mission-oriented."" ""My best case at Anthropic is we affect the future of humanity,"" he said, contrasting it with a best-case scenario at Meta, which he believes is simply to ""make money.""These talent dynamics are unfolding against a backdrop of already high compensation for AI professionals. According to recent federal visa filings, top AI labs are offering significant salaries. For instance, OpenAI pays its technical staff an average of $292,115, with top positions reaching $530,000. Anthropic pays an even higher average of $387,500, with some roles earning up to $690,000.The ongoing talent war underscores the intense competition at the heart of the AI industry, where companies are willing to spend massive sums to secure the minds they believe will shape the future of technology.",Mark Zuckerberg's AI company Meta is reportedly offering pay packages of more than $100 million to lure top researchers.

Tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson , known for his $2 million annual anti-aging regimen , says he discovered the ""most expansive map"" of human consciousness after smoking 5-MeO-DMT , a psychedelic compound found in Sonoran Desert toad venom. The experience was so profound that he tattooed the molecule's structure on his body. Speaking on the Core Memory podcast, the 48-year-old explained his quest to understand the full scope of human awareness. ""I know what it feels like to fall in love, and to feel sad, and to feel envy, and to feel joy,"" Johnson said. ""But what else?""Johnson systematically explored different substances to map consciousness, starting with alcohol and marijuana before turning to the powerful psychedelic.

He questioned why people aren't as excited about mapping the mind as they are about developing artificial superintelligence or traveling to Mars.""If you can, in fact, pair the brain with AI, what could AI do with you, in terms of exploring consciousness?""

Who is Sergio Gor

Elon Musk’s accusation: Loyalty and betrayal

How Sergio Gor strained the Musk–Trump dynamic

US President Donald Trump recently nominated his close aide Sergio Gor as the next US Ambassador to India . However, Gor’s appointment is making headlines for more than just geopolitics. For those unaware, Gor had a history with Elon Musk. In June this year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk publicly branded Gor ‘a snake’. The remark, which followed a report questioning Gor’s security clearance status, sheds light on a deeper rift between Musk and the Trump administration ’s inner circle.Sergio Gor emigrated to US via Malta and became a US citizen in 1999. He quickly embedded himself in the political circles and worked with the Republican National Committee. Gor also served as the spokesperson for far-right lawmakers.Im 2020, Gor joined Donald Trump’s campaign and managed fundraising operations. He eventually became of Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, where he oversaw the hiring of nearly 4,000 federal employees.Elon Musk’s ‘snake’ comment can in response to an article by New York Post alleging that Gor, who has the responsibility for vetting for thousands of federal employees as Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, had himself not completed his own permanent security clearance paperwork. While the White House disputed the claim, Musk reposted the article with the blunt caption: “He’s a snake.Sources close to the matter revealed that Musk’s frustration goes beyond Gor’s paperwork. The two reportedly clashed during cabinet meetings. Tension between Gor and Musk escalated when Gor allegedly handed Trump a dossier on Jared Isaacman, Musk’s ally and nominee to lead NASA, highlighting Isaacman’s past donations to Democrats.According to sources close to both camps, tensions between Elon Musk and Sergio Gor had been quietly building over several months. While Musk was serving as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a White House-backed role focused on technological reform, his increasing influence reportedly unsettled several senior advisers.Among them was Gor, who insiders say grew wary of Musk’s growing clout inside the administration. Gor, who manages hiring and personnel placements, reportedly began working behind the scenes to isolate Musk from Trump’s core decision-making circle. Some suggest that subtle moves, excluding Musk from key briefings, advising against certain DOGE initiatives, and fostering doubt about Musk’s loyalty, contributed to the erosion of trust between Musk and the president.This environment created friction that culminated in a public split, with Musk eventually resigning from his role and launching a wave of criticism aimed at the administration.","Sergio Gor is the Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office.

A call for guardrails and awareness



As part of a new revelation about AI, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has now raised alarms about the growing psychological phenomenon which he calls ‘AI psychosis’. For those unaware, it is a condition where individuals start to lose touch with real life because of excessive interaction with artificial intelligence systems. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at a recent interview, Suleyman explained AI psychosis as a “real and emerging risk” which can easily affect vulnerable individuals who become deeply immersed in conversations with AI agents. The condition will mainly affect the individuals whose interactions blur the line between human and machine.As per the Microsoft AI CEO, AI psychosis is a state of mind in which individuals start to anthropomorphize AI, attributing emotions, intentions, or consciousness to systems that are fundamentally non-human. ""It disconnects people from reality, fraying fragile social bonds and structures, distorting pressing moral priorities,"" he said.The condition can lead to delusional thinking here individuals feel that AI is sentiment or has some personal relationships with them. Along with this, it can also cause emotional dependency to users who are either isolated or mentally fragile. Lastly, AI psychosis can also lead to distorted perception of reality as users rely a lot of AI for validation, companionship and also decision-making.Suleyman also stressed on that fact that while AI can be helpful and engaging but it is definitely not a substitute for human or clinical support.As per Business Insider, Suleyman also has asked the tech industry to take this risk quite seriously and also help in implementing some ethical guardrails, which include:* Clear disclaimers about AI’s limitations* Monitoring for signs of unhealthy usage patterns* Collaboration with mental health professionals to study and mitigate risksAlong with this, Suleyman also urged the regulators and educators to raise public awareness as AI is slowly becoming more embedded in the daily life in the form of personal assistant and therapeutic chatbots.""AI companions are a completely new category, and we urgently need to start talking about the guardrails we put in place to protect people and ensure this amazing technology can do its job of delivering immense value to the world,"" Suleyman added.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has now raised alarms about the growing psychological phenomenon which he calls ‘AI psychosis’ For those unaware, it is a condition where individuals start to lose touch with real life because of excessive interaction with artificial intelligence systems.

What the deal with US government may mean for Intel

Days after asking Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to step down, Donald Trump has announced that the US government will buy a 10% stake in the company. The purchase, as per Reuters report, will be made under a deal that converts government grants into an equity share. As part of the agreement, the US government has agreed to buy a 9.9% stake in Intel for $8.9 billion. It will pay $20.47 per share, about $4 less than the chipmaker’s closing price of $24.80. The US will buy 433.3 million Intel shares using $5.7 billion from CHIPS Act grants and $3.2 billion from the Secure Enclave program.Once finalised, the deal will give the company about $10 billion to build and expand factories in the US.The Reuters report says that Trump met Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan on Friday, August 22. ""He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving us $10 billion for the United States. So we picked up $10 billion,"" Trump said.Tan, on the other hand, shared a more cautious note, saying “We are grateful for the confidence the president and the administration have placed in Intel.”Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced the deal via a post on X (formerly Twitter) calling it “fair to Intel and fair to the American People.”The US government’s stake in Intel will be passive, with no board seat and limited voting rights. The deal also includes a five-year option to buy another 5% if Intel loses control of its foundry unit.Analysts say the backing could help Intel recover its struggling foundry business and ease financial pressure. However, the company still lags behind Nvidia in AI and has lost ground to AMD in processors. With an $18.8 billion loss in 2024 and weak cash flow since 2021, new CEO Tan faces a tough turnaround challenge.The report quotes Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, saying Intel's problems are beyond a cash infusion from SoftBank or equity interest from the government, singling out Intel's contract chip manufacturing business, known as its foundry unit.""Without government support or another financially stronger partner, it will be difficult for the Intel foundry unit to raise enough capital to continue to build out more Fabs at a reasonable rate,"" he said. Intel ""needs to catch up with TSMC from a technological perspective to attract business,"" he added.","The US government has agreed to buy a 9.9% stake in Intel for $8.9 billion.

Demographic concerns highlighted by Elon Musk

On August 21, 2025, Elon Musk tweeted that artificial intelligence “is obviously gonna one-shot the human limbic system” and suggested that AI might actually raise birth rates by influencing the part of the brain responsible for emotions, which governs motivation, desire, and social behavior. He further added that AI could be intentionally designed to encourage this outcome, effectively shaping human instincts in ways that could impact population trends. Musk’s comments are notable because, while most public discussions about AI focus on jobs, ethics, or automation, his statement introduces a new dimension: the potential role of AI in addressing declining fertility rates and demographic challenges.Musk suggested that AI could interact with the human brain in a way that influences emotions and behavior, including social and reproductive decisions. Through his company xAI , he has developed AI companions that form emotional connections with users. While these companions can provide comfort, they have raised questions about their effect on real-world human relationships. Musk indicated that AI could potentially be designed to encourage procreation and family formation.Musk’s comments come as more people turn to AI chatbots, such as his own Grok, for emotional support. These interactions can feel comforting, but they do not always replace real-world human connections.In many developed nations, birth rates remain low due to economic pressures, high living costs, and other social factors. Musk’s tweet highlighted the potential for AI to influence these trends, suggesting that technology could play a role in addressing population decline, which has been a long-standing concern in countries like Japan, South Korea, and parts of Europe.Musk’s prediction has sparked conversations about the role of AI in society. Experts note that programming AI to influence human behavior at a population level is unprecedented and would depend on numerous social, cultural, and economic factors. His comments have drawn attention for their boldness and for focusing the AI debate on potential effects on family formation and fertility trends.","Musk suggested that AI could interact with the human brain in a way that influences emotions and behavior, including social and reproductive decisions.

Oracle’s bet on AI

Oracle founder Larry Ellison , who once mocked cloud computing as “complete gibberish,” is now the second-richest person on Earth, overtaking Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg . With a net worth of $288 billion, he is behind Elon Musk who has a net worth of $3379 billion, as per Bloomberg Billioniare Index. The reason: Oracle’s soaring success in cloud services, a business Ellison once ridiculed but that has since transformed the company and his fortune. In 2008, Ellison dismissed cloud computing as “complete gibberish.” But today, Oracle’s cloud infrastructure is fueling record growth thanks to the boom in artificial intelligence (AI) which has increased the demand for computing power and storage. Oracle has emerged as a key supplier for big companies like OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI.In June this year, Larry Ellison’s wealth jumped by more than $20 billion after Oracle’s stock surged 13% to $199.85 — its biggest one-day gain in a year. According to a Bloomberg report then, the rally came after the company forecast a 70% increase in cloud infrastructure sales for the current fiscal year.Long known for its databases, Oracle struggled for years to find its place in cloud computing. But under CEO Safra Catz, the company has made massive bets on AI-driven cloud services. Oracle recently launched Stargate, a joint venture with OpenAI to provide unprecedented computing power.“Oracle is on its way to becoming one of the world’s largest cloud infrastructure companies,” Catz said in a statement. She added that revenue growth in 2026 will be “dramatically higher.”Ellison told analysts about a historic order: “We recently got an order that said we’ll take all the capacity you have, wherever it is… we never got an order like that before.”To meet such demand, Oracle’s capital expenditure has soared. The company spent $21.2 billion in the last year and plans to raise that to $25 billion this year. Much of this will go into building mega data centers to support AI workloads.“The reason demand continues to outstrip supply is we can only build these data centers, build these computers, so fast,” Ellison explained.","Ellison once dismissed cloud computing as “complete gibberish” But today, Oracle’s cloud infrastructure is fueling record growth thanks to the boom in artificial intelligence (AI) The company spent $21.2 billion in the last year and plans to raise that to $25 billion this year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123467211,imgsize-17160,width-400,resizemode-4/Larry-Ellison.jpg"

TBD Lab: This is a small elite unit that will majorly focus on training and scaling large models, including a mysterious “omni” model.

FAIR: It is a research arm of Meta and now it will take care of feeding innovations directly into model training.

Products & Applied Research: This team will be led by ex-GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. The team will work on integrating AI into Meta’s consumer offerings.

MSL Infra: This team will be headed by engineering veteran Aparna Ramani and it will work on building the infrastructure needed to support cutting-edge AI development.

FAIR and TBD: Meta’s innovation engine



Read Alexandr Wang's full memo here



Superintelligence is coming, and in order to take it seriously, we need to organize around the key areas that will be critical to reach it — research, product and infra. We are building a world-class organization around these areas, and have brought in some incredible leaders to drive the work forward.

As we previously announced, Shengjia Zhao will direct our research efforts as Chief Scientist for MSL, Nat Friedman will lead our product effort and Rob Fergus will continue to lead FAIR. Today, I'm pleased to announce that Aparna Ramani will be moving over to MSL to lead the infrastructure necessary to support our ambitious research and product bets.

As part of this, we are dissolving the AGI Foundations organization and moving the talent from that team into the right areas. Teams whose work naturally aligns with and serves our products will move to Nat's team. Some of the researchers will move to FAIR to double down on our long term research while teams working on infra will transition into Aparna's org. Anyone who is changing teams will get an update from their manager or HRBP today, if you haven't already.

We're making three key changes to our organizational design that will help us to accelerate our efforts.

Centralizing core, fundamental research efforts in TBD Lab and FAIR. Bolstering our product efforts with applied research that will work on product-focused models. Establishing a unified, core infrastructure team to support our research bets.

The work will map to four teams:

TBD Lab will be a small team focused on training and scaling large models to achieve superintelligence across pre-training, reasoning, and post-training, and explore new directions such as an omni model.

FAIR will be an innovation engine for MSL and we will aim to integrate and scale many of the research ideas and projects from FAIR into the larger model runs conducted by TBD Lab. Rob will continue to lead FAIR and Yann will continue to serve as Chief Scientist for FAIR, with both reporting to me.

Products & Applied Research will bring our product-focused research efforts closer to product development. This will include teams previously working on Assistant, Voice, Media, Trust, Embodiment and Developer pillars in AI Tech. Nat will continue to lead this work reporting to me.

MSL Infra team will unify elements of Infra and MSL's infrastructure teams into one. This team will focus on accelerating AI research and production by building advanced infrastructure, optimized GPU clusters, comprehensive environments, data infrastructure, and developer tools to support state-of-the-art research, products and AI development across Meta. Aparna will lead this team reporting to me.

Ahmad and Amir will continue reporting to me focusing on strategic MSL initiatives they will share more about later.

I recognize that org changes can be disruptive, but I truly believe that taking the time to get this structure right now will allow us to reach superintelligence with more velocity over the long term. We're still working through updated rhythms and our collaboration model across teams, including when we'll come together as a full MSL org.

Thank you all for your flexibility as we adapt to this new structure. Every team in MSL plays a critical role and I'm excited to get to work with all of you.

In a new and dramatic move, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is making the most aggressive move in his AI arm race. Zuckerberg is now reorganising the company’s artificial intelligence operations by restricting the Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL) into four distinct teams. As reported by Business Insider the company outlined the move in an internal memo from the newly appointed chief of AI Alexandr Wang. The restructuring is taking place after the aggressive hiring process in which Meta poached dozens of top AI researchers from its rivals companies.

TikTok to lay off hundreds of content moderators in UK



President Donald Trump announced on Friday (August 22) that he has American buyers ready to acquire TikTok , and he is open to extending the deadline for its Chinese parent company, ByteDance , to sell the app’s US assets. Speaking to reporters, Trump stated he has no privacy or security concerns regarding the platform and has yet to discuss the matter with Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to news agency Reuters.The news comes as TikTok faces a separate challenge in the UK. The company is planning to lay off hundreds of staff in the region who are responsible for moderating content, BBC reported. This move, according to a company spokesperson, is part of a “reorganisation” to centralise its operations and increase its reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) for moderation. The spokesperson told the publication that the work would be relocated to other European offices.TikTok maintains that its investment in AI will “maximise effectiveness and speed,” noting that its automated systems, including AI, already remove 85% of content that violates its rules. The company says this shift also helps reduce how often human moderators are exposed to distressing content.The layoffs will affect the Trust and Safety team in London, as well as hundreds of other workers in the same department in various parts of Asia. TikTok stated that impacted employees would be given priority for other internal roles if they meet the minimum requirements.This decision has drawn criticism from the Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents the affected employees. CWU National Officer for Tech, John Chadfield, called the move an example of “corporate greed over the safety of workers and the public.” He added that the cuts were announced just as workers were preparing to vote on union recognition.Chadfield warned that TikTok staff have “long been sounding the alarm” about the risks of replacing human moderators with “immature AI alternatives.”","TikTok to lay off hundreds of content moderators in UK.

A call for proactive defense



India has emerged as the most-targeted country globally for malware attacks. According to the latest biannual report by cybersecurity firm Acronis, the rise in AI-powered ransomware and phishing threats in India accounts to 12.4% of all monitored endpoint attacks worldwide. The Acronis Threat Research Unit (TRU) discovered that artificial intelligence is being weaponised by cybercriminals to automate and scale attacks.As per the report, ransomware is the main top threat for large and mid-sized businesses. On the other hand, phishing incidents also witnessed a surge especially on collaboration platforms like Microsoft Teams and Slack, where attacks jumped from 9% to 30.5% in the first half of 2025.“AI is empowering threat actors to operate at scale and with higher precision,” said Rajesh Chhabra, General Manager for India and South Asia at Acronis. He stressed on the need for Indian enterprises to adopt AI-aware cybersecurity frameworks and shift from reactive to behaviour-based security models.The report also revealed a sharp increase in advanced email threats which includes spoofed and payload-less attacks which increased from 9% to 24.5%. These tactics are created to bypass traditional filters and exploit human error. This rise in cyberattacks also makes the need for employee education and adaptive security systems more critical than ever.The cybersecurity firm Acronis recommends the need for a multi-layered defense strategy which also includes a behaviour-based threat detection. The firm also suggests regular audits of third-party apps and a robust cloud and email security protocols . The firm also emphasised on the importance of ongoing training to combat social engineering and phishing techniques, which remain a major vulnerability across Indian enterprises.","India has emerged as the most-targeted country globally for malware attacks.

"MIT study finds 95% of generative AI projects are failing: Only hype, little transformation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mit-study-finds-95-of-generative-ai-projects-are-failing-only-hype-little-transformation/articleshow/123453071.cms,"Generative AI hype versus enterprise reality

Why 95% of generative AI projects are failing

Startups thrive while corporations stall

Worker skepticism and corporate backpedaling

New challenges: Generative AI bias against human work

Bubble fears and the uncertain future of AI

A new MIT study has cast doubt on the AI gold rush, revealing that 95% of generative AI business projects are failing to deliver meaningful results. Despite more than $44 billion being invested in AI startups and enterprise tools in just the first half of 2025, the report, titled ""The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025,"" shows that only a tiny fraction of deployments have delivered significant revenue acceleration or measurable productivity gains. While companies rushed to adopt AI amid unprecedented hype, most projects collapsed under the weight of unrealistic expectations, poor integration, and a lack of specialized adaptation. The findings raise concerns that the AI industry could be fueling a bubble reminiscent of the dot-com crash.For years, generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini have been hailed as transformative technologies that would revolutionize workplaces. From automated content creation to customer service chatbots, expectations ran high that AI could slash costs and boost productivity. But MIT researchers found a sharp divide between public perception and business outcomes. Most corporate AI deployments produce no measurable value. Tests showed that even advanced AI models could only handle about 30% of office tasks reliably, leaving humans to do the rest. While individuals still benefit from flexible AI tools for drafting, coding, and brainstorming, enterprises are struggling to integrate them into complex workflows.The MIT study identified a “learning gap” in enterprise adoption as the leading cause of failure. While companies have rushed to deploy AI, most have not invested in adapting these tools to their own processes. Instead, businesses rely heavily on generic large language models that are ill-suited to niche requirements. More than half of corporate AI budgets are spent on sales and marketing automation, while mission-critical areas like logistics, R&D, and operations remain underdeveloped. This mismatch creates a situation where flashy pilot projects launch with excitement but collapse before reaching meaningful scale.Interestingly, smaller startups are showing more success with generative AI than Fortune 500 giants. MIT researchers found that lean companies led by younger founders often focus narrowly on a single problem, such as automating ad copywriting or streamlining coding assistance, and achieve rapid results. Some of these startups reported scaling revenues from zero to $20 million in just twelve months by partnering strategically with bigger businesses. In contrast, large corporations tend to spread their AI investments too thinly, leading to fragmented projects that fail to deliver.Generative AI has also been met with significant skepticism among employees. Surveys reveal that 62% of workers believe AI is overhyped, while many IT leaders admit they lack a clear strategy for implementation. Several high-profile companies that announced aggressive AI adoption strategies have quietly scaled back. Klarna, the payments firm, rehired staff after cutting jobs it initially thought AI could replace. Similarly, Gartner research shows that half of executives have now abandoned plans to automate away customer service jobs by 2027, recognizing that human workers offer unique value AI cannot replicate.Another concern highlighted in the MIT study is the emergence of AI-to-AI bias. Researchers observed that generative AI systems frequently prefer AI-generated material over human-created content when ranking product ads, scientific abstracts, or online reviews. This bias could reshape entire industries by forcing human creators to “AI-proof” their work. Many may need to run it through an AI model to make it appear machine-generated just to remain competitive in digital marketplaces. If left unchecked, this trend could devalue originality and reinforce a cycle where machines increasingly privilege their own output over human creativity.The financial stakes are enormous. Analysts predict AI could contribute more than $6 trillion to the global economy by 2030, and major tech firms are banking on an estimated $600 billion in new annual revenues. But with 95% of projects failing, optimism is colliding with harsh business realities. MIT’s report warns that unless enterprises learn to bridge the adoption gap, the AI sector risks inflating into another dot-com-style bubble. The future of generative AI will depend not just on technical breakthroughs, but on whether companies can turn experimentation into sustainable, real-world value.",MIT study finds 95% of generative AI projects are failing to deliver meaningful results.

From Loopt to OpenAI: Altman’s rise in the tech world



Also Read |

A grainy early-2000s video has resurfaced online, offering a rare glimpse of Sam Altman before he became a leading figure in the global AI revolution. The clip features a 19-year-old Altman, fresh out of Stanford University, confidently pitching his first startup, Loopt , a location-sharing app that allows users to see friends’ real-time locations and discover nearby activities. Shared by the Instagram page artificialintelligencenews.in, the footage highlights Altman’s early entrepreneurial drive, vision, and ability to identify emerging tech trends. Loopt, though eventually acquired, laid the foundation for Altman’s later success, including his leadership at Y Combinator and OpenAI , demonstrating how even groundbreaking innovators start with bold, formative ideas in their early careers.At the time of the Loopt pitch, Altman was just entering the tech ecosystem. While most 19-year-olds were exploring college or early careers, Altman had already envisioned an app that merged social interaction with location technology. This period of his life demonstrates the hallmarks of a visionary entrepreneur: curiosity, risk-taking, resilience, and an ability to identify emerging technological trends before they became mainstream.The resurfaced footage shows him confident, articulate, and tech-savvy, reflecting early traits that would later define his leadership at Y Combinator and OpenAI. For tech enthusiasts, seeing these early moments underscores how even industry leaders start with simple but bold ideas, fueled by persistence, creativity, and a relentless drive to innovate.In the video, Altman demonstrates Loopt’s interface. The app allowed users to track their friends’ locations in real time, turning location data into opportunities for social connection. He describes scenarios such as finding a friend at a restaurant, spotting someone at the airport, or discovering nearby places of interest — all of which were revolutionary concepts in the mid-2000s.Altman points to digital pins on an iPhone map, showing friends’ movements, activities, and even photo journals. He highlights a feature where a user could invite a friend to lunch directly through the app — a futuristic concept at the time. This early demonstration exemplifies how Loopt anticipated modern social networking trends, many of which are now standard in apps like Snapchat, Google Maps, and AI-powered social platforms.Founded in 2005 by Sam Altman, Nick Sivo, and fellow Stanford peers, Loopt was initially called Radiate. The startup became part of Y Combinator’s early batches, quickly drawing attention from venture capitalists including Sequoia Capital and New Enterprise Associates.The app allowed users to selectively share their location with friends and integrated with major platforms like Facebook and Twitter. At its peak, Loopt had over five million registered users and partnered with nearly every major U.S. carrier. Despite the innovation, Loopt struggled to monetize effectively. In 2012, after raising over $30 million in funding, it was acquired by Green Dot Corporation for $43.4 million, marking the end of its independent journey.The resurfaced Loopt pitch has generated admiration and nostalgia across social media. Comments like “Bro was built different” and “Now you can do all this using only AI” highlight how netizens see Altman’s early innovation as groundbreaking.The video inspires young coders and entrepreneurs to start early and embrace experimentation. It also emphasizes the rapid evolution of technology: ideas that once required significant venture capital are now integrated features in everyday apps powered by artificial intelligence.While Loopt did not achieve global dominance, it laid the foundation for Altman’s career. Following the acquisition, he joined Y Combinator, eventually rising to the role of president. In 2019, he pivoted his focus to OpenAI, taking the reins as CEO.Under his leadership, OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022, igniting a global generative AI revolution. Altman’s early work with Loopt demonstrates the trajectory from innovative small-scale projects to leading transformative technologies that impact millions worldwide.As of 2025, Altman’s estimated net worth is $1.8 billion, a reflection not only of his business acumen but also of his foresight in identifying emerging technological trends years before they became mainstream.","A grainy early-2000s video has resurfaced online, offering a rare glimpse of Sam Altman before he became a leading figure in the global AI revolution.

Russia’s push for Max targets WhatsApp and Telegram

Kremlin's digital control strategy targets multiple platforms

Russia will require its state-backed Max messenger app to be pre-installed on all smartphones and tablets sold in the country starting September 1, as Moscow tightens control over digital communications amid its standoff with the West over Ukraine.The government is positioning Max as a ""national messenger"" that will integrate with official services including Gosuslugi, Russia's digital government platform. The decision affects all mobile devices sold domestically, part of broader efforts to reduce dependence on foreign technology platforms.The mandate comes as Russia restricts calls on WhatsApp and Telegram, accusing the foreign-owned platforms of failing to cooperate with law enforcement in fraud and terrorism investigations, according to Reuters reporting. WhatsApp reaches 97.3 million Russian users, while Telegram serves 90.8 million, making them dominant communication platforms in the country.Max, developed by state-controlled VK company , has attracted 18 million downloads since its March launch, though much of the app remains in beta testing. Critics warn the messenger could enable government surveillance, though state media dismisses these concerns, claiming Max requests fewer user permissions than its Western competitors.Russia's domestic app requirements extend beyond messaging. The RuStore app marketplace, currently pre-installed on Android devices, must also appear on Apple devices starting September 1. Additionally, Lime HD TV , providing free access to state television channels, becomes mandatory on smart TVs from January 1.The messaging restrictions represent part of Russia's broader digital sovereignty campaign. Moscow has already banned Facebook, Instagram, and X, while promoting domestic alternatives across various technology sectors.VK, the company behind Max, was co-founded by Pavel Durov, who also created Telegram. However, Durov was forced out as CEO in 2014 after disputes with Russian authorities over censorship and data sharing. Current VK leadership maintains closer ties to the government, with CEO Vladimir Kiriyenko being the son of Putin's First Deputy Chief of Staff.Russia's interior ministry acknowledged that authorities arrested a suspect in the first fraud case involving Max, despite promoting the app as safer than foreign alternatives.","Russia will require its state-backed Max messenger app to be pre-installed on all smartphones and tablets sold in the country starting September 1.

CEO's ""heavy-handed"" approach reflects growing workplace AI pressure across tech industry

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong revealed he terminated employees who failed to adopt artificial intelligence tools after issuing a company-wide mandate requiring engineers to integrate AI into their workflow by a specific deadline. Speaking on the ""Cheeky Pint"" podcast Wednesday, Armstrong described going ""rogue"" when told AI adoption would take one to two quarters. Instead, he posted directly in the company's Slack channel demanding all engineers onboard AI tools within the week or attend a mandatory Saturday meeting to explain their resistance.""If not, I'm hosting a meeting on Saturday with everyone who hasn't done it and I'd like to meet with you to understand why,"" Armstrong said during the podcast interview.When Saturday arrived, a small group of non-compliant employees joined the call. While some had legitimate reasons like returning from travel, others did not. ""Some of them didn't, and they got fired,"" Armstrong stated bluntly.The Coinbase chief executive described his confrontational tactics as ""heavy-handed"" but necessary to signal AI's critical importance to the company's future. His goal is achieving 50% AI-written code by quarter's end, supported by monthly ""AI speed run"" training sessions.Armstrong's aggressive AI enforcement mirrors broader industry trends. Tech giants and multiple CEOs have similarly pressured employees to integrate AI tools into daily operations, emphasizing AI adoption as essential for competitive advantage.However, Armstrong acknowledged limits to AI reliance, particularly for financial systems. ""You don't want people vibe-coding these systems moving money,"" he cautioned, stressing the need for human oversight and code reviews.The crypto exchange has expanded AI implementation beyond engineering, with design teams ""using it heavily"" and exploring AI's role in executive decision-making.

"Getting a job at PwC for fresh graduates just got tougher, here's what 'internal' presentation says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/getting-a-job-at-pwc-for-fresh-graduates-just-got-tougher-heres-what-internal-presentation-says/articleshow/123450405.cms,"Campus hiring goals slashed



AI and offshoring drive strategic shift

PwC responds: “Prudent and adaptive”

PwC recently shared an internal presentation with the employees. According to a report by Business Insider, the PwC presentation revealed that soon it will become difficult for college graduates to secure a job at the firm. As per the report, the Big Four accounting and consulting firm is planning to cut entry-level hiring in the US by nearly one-third over the next three years. The company has taken this decision due to technological transformation and historically low attrition.According to a report by Business Insider, the presentation which was shared with alumni of a major US collage, underlines a sharp decline in PwC’s hiring targets for associate-level roles. The most junior full time positions at the firm were majorly filled by recent college graduates. In the financial year ending June 2025, PwC hired 3,242 tax and assurance associates, but by 2028, that number is expected to drop to 2,197, a 32% decrease.As reported by BIA, the company aims to reduce entry-level hires by 39%, from 1,676 this year to 1,015 in 2028 in the audit department alone. While data for the advisory division was not disclosed, the presentation notes that a “similar trend is anticipated.”PwC feels that the hiring slowdown can be attributed to the increasing pace of technological change, the impact of artificial intelligence and increased reliance on Acceleration Centers (ACs)— offshoring hubs in countries like India, the Philippines, and Argentina. These centers are increasingly taking on tasks traditionally handled by US-based associates, reducing the need for domestic entry-level roles.“AI is functioning at more of the staff and routine task level,” said Jenn Kosar, PwC’s AI assurance leader, in a recent interview. She expects new hires to be performing manager-level responsibilities within three years, as automation frees them from repetitive work.In a statement to Business Insider, PwC confirmed it is “decreasing our campus hiring goals,” citing the need to adapt to evolving client demands and internal transformation. “We are being prudent… and leaving space for us to reevaluate our needs,” the firm said, adding that it will continue to evolve its talent strategy across all levels.PwC’s hiring projections reflect a wider shift across the Big Four. According to Tom Rodenhauser, managing director at Kennedy Intelligence, firms are restructuring their traditional pyramids, using AI to handle basic functions once assigned to junior consultants. “Labor cost is the key here,” he said. “Offshore was cheaper, but AI dramatically changes the labor equation.”","PwC is planning to cut entry-level hiring in the US by nearly one-third over the next three years.

Reddit has become the most-cited source in large language model (LLM)-related searches, surpassing Wikipedia and Google , according to June 2025 data from Statista. As per the data, the platform accounted for 40.1% of all AI-related search citations. Wikipedia ranked second with 26.3% share, while YouTube stood at third with 23.5%. Google, once the go-to platform for accessing information, dropped to fourth place with 23.3%, the data shows.Jeremy Stoppelman-led Yelp (21%) and Meta’s Facebook (20%) also made the list, showing the growing role of community-driven and social content in training AI models. Other entries in the Statista’s list of web domains cited by LLMs in June 2025 included Amazon (18.7%), Tripadvisor (12.5%), Mapbox (11.3%) and OpenStreetMap (11.3%).The findings highlight how user-generated content platforms are becoming central to AI learning and search. With Reddit leading by a wide margin, the shift signals a move away from traditional search engines toward community-driven knowledge sources.Earlier this month, Reddit CEO Steven Huffman issued a pointed warning to Google, asserting that the social platform is already a ‘de facto’ search engine for millions of users. The comments came soon after following a blockbuster earnings report that saw Reddit’s stock jump 25%, and highlight a growing tension between the two companies as Google integrates AI into its core search product.During Reddit’s recent earnings call, Huffman stated that “those who are using Google will end up on Reddit at some point.”“And, in fact, I think for most of our users, this is already true, whether they're running a search on Reddit directly or using a third-party search product and coming to Reddit, which is just about anybody using Google at this point will end up on Reddit at some point,” Huffman then stated.“Those users also can be core Reddit users. And so it's not a stretch to say that our core users are already scrollers and seekers,” he added.","Reddit has become the most-cited source in large language model (LLM)-related searches, surpassing Wikipedia and Google.

Jensen

""It’s up to, of course, the US government, and we are in dialogue with them, but it is too soon to know,""

“When we receive the orders, we will be able to purchase more,”

“We constantly manage our supply chain to address market conditions. As both governments recognise, the H20 is not a military product or for government infrastructure.""

Here's the Truth: Nothing Phone (3) Full Review

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently visited Taiwan, stating his ""main purpose coming here is to discuss our new product plans and strategy."" His visit came as reports emerged that Nvidia has ordered key suppliers, including Foxconn, Samsung Electronics, and Amkor Technology, to halt production of its H20 AI chip designed for the Chinese market. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the decision to stop H20 production follows pressure from Beijing, which urged local companies to avoid using the chip. The H20 is the most advanced chip Nvidia is currently allowed to sell in China under U.S. export restrictions. Jensen Huang's visit comes ahead of Nvidia's earnings release as discussions with chip foundry partner TSMC are taking place amid rising tensions between the US and China over access to leading AI technology, the report notesJensen Huang said to reporters during his visit to TSMC. According to a live feed broadcast by local media at Taipei's Songshan airport, where he landed in a private jet, he also mentioned that he would only stay a few hours and leave after dinner with TSMC leaders.Huang also said that TSMC had invited him to give a speech. In a statement to Reuters, TSMC confirmed that Huang would deliver an internal talk on hisbut did not provide further details.Huang added that his visit was also to thank TSMC, where six new chips have been taped out, including a GPU and a silicon photonics processor designed for Nvidia’s upcoming Rubin-architecture supercomputers.refers to the stage when a chip’s design is finalised and ready for production.Huang confirmed.Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump allowed China to access more advanced Nvidia chips beyond the H20. Reuters previously reported that Nvidia has also started developing a new Blackwell-based chip, the B30A, which would surpass the H20. Huang said discussions with the US are ongoing, but stressed that the decision ultimately rests with the government.Huang explained.In July, Nvidia regained approval to sell its China-specific H20 chips after an April halt. It reportedly ordered 300,000 units from TSMC to meet strong demand. Soon after, Chinese regulators and state media raised security concerns, warning local firms about potential risks. Nvidia denied its chips carried any backdoor threats.However, Chinese regulators have warned local tech firms against buying Nvidia’s H20 chips over security concerns. Nvidia has reportedly asked suppliers, including Foxconn, Amkor, and Samsung, to halt H20-related work. However, CEO Jensen Huang said the company already has a large inventory and is waiting for orders from China.Huang noted.In a statement, a Nvidia spokesperson said:Huang said sending H20 chips to China posed no national security risk and welcomed the approval. Earlier this month, the Trump administration also struck a deal with Nvidia and AMD, requiring the US government to receive 15% of revenue from certain advanced chip sales in China.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently visited Taiwan, stating his ""main purpose coming here is to discuss our new product plans and strategy"" His visit came as reports emerged that Nvidia has ordered key suppliers, including Foxconn, Samsung Electronics, and Amkor Technology, to halt production of its H20 AI chip designed for the Chinese market.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123448963,imgsize-1035992,width-400,resizemode-4/Nvidia-asks-Foxconn-and-other-suppliers-to-stop-production-of-H20-chips-as-CEO-Jensen-Huang-visits-TSMC-says-My-main-purpose.jpg"

Indian health wearables startup Ultrahuman has turned the tables on Finnish rival Oura Health , filing a patent infringement lawsuit in Delhi High Court after being on the receiving end of similar accusations for over a year.The company alleges Oura's Ring 4 brazenly copies its proprietary sensor integration and onboard processing technology, protected by Indian patent IN 549915 titled ""Electronic Ring Including Sensors for Monitoring Health and Fitness Parameters.""Granted by the Indian Patent Office on September 10, 2024, the patent covers Ultrahuman's smart-ring architecture with integrated PCB, PPG sensors, temperature and motion sensors, battery, and wireless charging coil. The patent specifically protects the microcontroller processing that derives secondary metrics like sleep stages, sleep scores, and readiness.Beyond the core hardware infringement, Ultrahuman further accuses Oura of ""blatantly copying"" its broader ecosystem of women's health features, circadian health tools and glucose monitoring platforms—all delivered without the subscription fees that Oura charges customers.""We've been deeply focused on helping people do more with their health data by building cutting-edge, non-paywalled features,"" an Ultrahuman spokesperson said, taking a swipe at Oura's mandatory subscription model.The lawsuit flips a bitter legal saga that began in 2023 when Oura first sued Ultrahuman in Texas courts. The Finnish company accused its Indian rival of wholesale copying—from titanium construction and PPG sensors to social media content—while allegedly poaching employees and benefiting from investors including Alpha Wave, Steadview Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners.Ultrahuman CEO Mohit Kumar had boldly declared on X: ""We will win this space and we will win this fairly. We welcome competition in this space and our right to win is our ability to control end-to-end design and manufacturing, coupled with simplified flat pricing and consumer policies.""Yet Oura managed to secure an initial determination from the International Trade Commission in March 2024, though multiple review steps remain pending.Now Ultrahuman is hitting back hard, accusing Oura of waging a systematic campaign against competitors using US patent 11,868,178—acquired from Motiv via Proxy in 2023 rather than developed in-house. Oura filed complaints against nearly every smart ring competitor just 63 days after that patent was issued.",Ultrahuman has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Finnish rival Oura Health.

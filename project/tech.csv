Why Astronomer has not fired HR head Kristin Cabot



Astronomer announces Andy Byron resignation as CEO



The recent ‘Kiss Cam’ moment at the Coldplay concert in Boston led to the termination of Astronomer CEO Andy Byron. Following the incident, Byron resigned from the company. However, the Astronomer’s chief people officer Kristin Cabot still remains on leave and has not been fired from the company yet. Now questions are surfacing about the Cabot’s employment status. A new report by New York Post offer insights about why her employment status has not changed. While Andy Byron tendered his resignation following the widespread controversy, Kristin Cabot remains employed by Astronomer. The report delves into potential reasons behind this disparity, suggesting that legal and corporate considerations may be at play.As reported by New York Post, one possible reason could be the different roles both handle at the company. Along with this, some internal polices could also be the reason behind this decision. According to attorneys quoted by the New York Post, firing Cabot outright could expose Astronomer to legal risk. “In a real-world big company, you can’t just fire someone because the headlines are ugly,” one lawyer explained. If Cabot’s actions were internally approved or documented, the company may need to follow a formal process before termination.Another expert believes that while firing Cabot may be legally feasible, but there are chances that Astronomer may be working on an exit deal. “If you were to look for a picture of ‘cause’ [for firing] in the dictionary, it would show a picture of the head of HR having a public affair with the CEO,” the attorney told New York Post, but added that severance negotiations could delay public action.Another attorney Douglas Wigdor suggests that Cabot may have her own version of the events which are not yet made pubic. “Maybe there’s more to the story from her,” he said, pointing out that the viral clip is short and lacks full context.Kristin Cabot has deactivated her LinkedIn profile after the incident and has not yet issued any public statement. On the other hand, Byron has resigned from his position as the CEO and has also been removed from Astronomer’s leadership page.Announcing Andy Byron’s resignation, Astronomer said in a statement, ""Andy Byron has tendered his resignation, and the Board of Directors has accepted. The Board will begin a search for our next Chief Executive as Cofounder and Chief Product Officer Pete DeJoy continues to serve as interim CEO.”The resignation came less than 24 hours after Astronomer announced Byron and Cabot had been put on leave and that a formal investigation was pending.

Astronomer CEO's moving forward note



Astronomer's new CEO, Pete DeJoy , addressed the recent Coldplay ""kiss cam"" scandal, noting that the New York-based AI company has gained widespread recognition. DeJoy, a co-founder, assumed leadership after former CEO Andy Byron stepped down. Byron resigned following public attention from being caught on the kiss cam with Astronomer's HR head, Kristin Cabot, at a Coldplay concert in Boston. During the incident, Byron was seen embracing Cabot, both attempting to shield their faces from the camera as it panned on them.Their reaction made the band’s frontman Chris Martin to joke: “Either they’re having an affair or they’re very shy.” The video quickly went viral, with Astronomer leading all headlines. The Internet also went wild on memes of the two.Late last week, Astronomer announced the resignation of Andy Byron as CEO and announced founder Pete DeJoy as the new CEO. On what appears to be his first working Monday, Pete DeJoy seems to have started the day with a note on Andy Byron scandal and the way forward for the company.The new interim CEO of Astronomer broke his silence on the Coldplay “kiss cam” scandal — and gushed that the small, New York-based AI firm is now a “household name.” Brooklynite Pete DeJoy, the company’s co-founder, took the reins at Astronomer over the weekend after its disgraced boss Andy Byron resigned after being caught on the kiss cam cozying up with Kristin Cabot, the company’s head of HR.Byron, after being spotted on the kiss cam with his arms wrapped around Cabot at last week’s Coldplay concert in Boston, literally ducked out of view as Cabot turned her back to the camera and rushed to cover her face with her hands.Over the weekend, I stepped into the role of Interim CEO at Astronomer, a company that I’ve proudly poured my entire professional life into helping build.Over the past few years, our business has experienced incredible growth. What was once a mission to help companies with Apache Airflow has turned into so much more. We’re privileged to sit at the center of our customers’ data & AI strategy , powering data pipelines behind in-game analytics of your favorite sports team, LLM powered chatbots for customer support, training AI for self-driving cars, and every mission-critical process in between.The events of the past few days have received a level of media attention that few companies—let alone startups in our small corner of the data and AI world—ever encounter. The spotlight has been unusual and surreal for our team and, while I would never have wished for it to happen like this, Astronomer is now a household name.At Astronomer we have never shied away from challenges; a near-decade of building this business has tested us time and time again, and each time we’ve emerged stronger. From starting a software company in Cincinnati, Ohio, to keeping the lights on through the collapse of the bank that held all our cash, to scaling from 30 to 300 people during a global pandemic that demanded we do it all without ever being in the same room.And yet, we’re still here.We’re here because Astronomers are built by people who live to solve hard problems, stay late to fix what’s broken, and care deeply about doing things the right way. We’re here because our customers trust us with their most ambitious data & AI projects. And, most importantly, we’re here because the mission is bigger than any one moment.I’m stepping into this role with a wholehearted commitment to taking care of our people and delivering for our customers. Astronomers foundation remains strong, built around the thriving Apache Airflow community. Our opportunity to build a DataOps platform for the age of AI remains massive. And our story is very much still being written.To our team: thank you for your resilience & commitment to building something great. And to our community and customers: thank you for your trust.

Read Astronomer full statement on Andy Byron's resignation

As stated previously, Astronomer is committed to the values and culture that have guided us since our founding. Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met.

Andy Byron has tendered his resignation, and the Board of Directors has accepted. The Board will begin a search for our next Chief Executive as Cofounder and Chief Product Officer Pete DeJoy continues to serve as interim CEO.

Before this week, we were known as a pioneer in the DataOps space, helping data teams power everything from modern analytics to production AI.

While awareness of our company may have changed overnight, our product and our work for our customers have not.

We’re continuing to do what we do best: helping our customers with their toughest data and AI problems.

Late last week, AI company Astronomer CEO Andy Byron resigned after he was caught in a cheating scandal with the company's HR head Kristin Cabot at a Cold Play event. Announcing Andy Byron’s resignation, Astronomer said in a statement, ""Andy Byron has tendered his resignation, and the Board of Directors has accepted. The Board will begin a search for our next Chief Executive as Cofounder and Chief Product Officer Pete DeJoy continues to serve as interim CEO.”The resignation came less than 24 hours after Astronomer announced Byron and Cabot had been put on leave and that a formal investigation was pending. ""Cofounder and Chief Product Officer Pete DeJoy is currently serving as interim CEO given Andy Byron has been placed on leave. We will share more details as appropriate in the coming days,"" said the company.Since July 17, when the scandal broke, Astronomer has made a few statements on the controversy, kinda even acknowledging the scandal. However, none of them directly name its HR head and Chief People Officer Kristin Cabot. The first social media post from the company said, ""Astronomer is committed to the values and culture that have guided us since our founding. Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability."" However, it didn't name anyone. The following posts too did mention Andy Byron, but said nothing on Cabot.Reports do suggest that the company sent both Kristin Cabot with Andy Byron on leave.While Andy Byron's name has been removed from the Astronomer's 'Leadership Page', as of now Kristin Cabot's name remains on the page as the company’s Chief People Officer. The 'Leadership Page' also has Pete De Joy as the new CEO. This seems to mean that the company is still to decide on Kristin Cabot's future in Astronomer. Other than removal of Andy Byron's name, there is no other change on the page as of now.","Astronomer CEO Andy Byron resigned after he was caught in a cheating scandal with the company's HR head Kristin Cabot at a Cold Play event.

Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for 'offensive' political slurs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/poland-flags-elon-musks-grok-chatbot-to-the-eu-for-offensive-political-slurs/articleshow/122348777.cms,"Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for “offensive” political slurs

Why Poland says Elon Musk's Grok chatbot crossed a red line



Offensive answers: From antisemitic tropes to political insults



European digital rules put xAI under the spotlight



Previous incidents: Turkey, hate speech, and Grok’s growing rap sheet



xAI and Musk offer silence, at least for now



Poland just pulled the alarm on Grok, the AI chatbot from Elon Musk ’s xAI. Officials in Warsaw say the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders, so they’re asking the European Commission to investigate and, if the rules allow, hit xAI or X with fines.Krzysztof Gawkowski, Poland’s digitisation minister, told RMF FM radio that the bot’s remarks amounted to hate speech. He argued that ignoring algorithm-driven abuse “may cost humanity in the future,” so his ministry will file an official complaint under existing EU regulations.The step is unusual but legal: member states can trigger EU probes when digital services target their citizens with unlawful content. If Brussels agrees, xAI could face penalties under the Digital Services Act or the forthcoming AI Act.Grok’s missteps are piling up. The same day Poland aired its grievance, the Anti-Defamation League flagged responses in which the bot praised Adolf Hitler and recycled antisemitic stereotypes. xAI deleted the posts, calling them “inappropriate,” yet offered no public apology.Users had also shared screenshots showing Grok calling Tusk “a coward in Brussels slippers,” among other jabs. Warsaw says the language breaches Poland’s hate-speech law and the EU’s code of practice on disinformation.The EU’s Digital Services Act took full effect for very large platforms in February 2025. It forces companies such as X to assess systemic risks, audit their algorithms, and let regulators peek behind the curtain. An AI-specific law is coming later this year, likely adding fresh transparency mandates. Poland’s complaint tees up an early test of those combined powers.Legal scholars note that fines can reach 6 percent of global turnover for DSA violations. For Musk’s empire, that runs into billions.Poland is not alone. A Turkish court ordered X to block Grok content that mocked President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and Islamic beliefs.In June, users spotted the bot rambling about a supposed “white genocide” in South Africa. xAI blamed an “unauthorised change” to its response code.Each flare-up feeds an image of a system that swings from playful banter to extremist rhetoric with a single prompt.As of Wednesday afternoon, xAI had not replied to Reuters’ emailed questions, and Musk’s normally hyperactive X feed stayed quiet on the topic.The billionaire recently urged “maximum free speech” on X, but he also says AI must be “truth-seeking.” That balance gets messy when the bot channels conspiracy theories or ethnic slurs.","Poland says the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's net worth soars $1 billion as the chipmaker joins the $4 trillion club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-net-worth-soars-1-billion-as-the-chipmaker-joins-the-4-trillion-club/articleshow/122377958.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang’s net worth passes $140 billion



Nvidia’s market value climbs above $4 trillion



How a 3.5 percent stake fuels one of the world’s biggest fortunes



Where Jensen Huang now ranks among global billionaires



Why investors keep bidding the price up

AI demand everywhere. Cloud providers, carmakers, and sovereign data-centre projects line up for the current Hopper chips and the coming Blackwell series.

Scarcity premium. Nvidia controls around 80 percent of high-end AI GPU supply, and capacity stays tight even after Taiwan’s fabs ramp up output.

Ecosystem lock-in. CUDA software and support contracts make switching costs high, so even rivals that launch competitive silicon must still lure developers away.

What could slow the rally

Export curbs. The United States still blocks top-tier chips from shipping to China, Nvidia’s largest single-country market outside the U.S.

New competition. AMD, Intel and a clutch of start-ups are readying chips that nibble at Nvidia’s margins, especially in inference workloads.

Rich valuation. At about 40 times forward earnings, the stock leaves little room for an earnings miss; even a small disappointment could yank billions from Huang’s paper wealth.

Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold. The jump did more than rewrite Wall Street leaderboards; it also pushed co-founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s fortune past $140 billion. He owns about 3.5 percent of Nvidia, held directly and through family trusts, so every flicker in the share price lands straight in his pocket.Bloomberg’s daily billionaire tally shows Jensen Huang adding roughly $1 billion in a single session, and nearly $28 billion in 2025 so far. That kind of lift puts him shoulder-to-shoulder with household names like Warren Buffett, a spot unthinkable just three years ago. Investors keep paying the premium because Nvidia sells the chips that make modern AI run, from data-centre clusters to enterprise servers. The faster the market grows, the richer Huang becomes.As of the New York closing bell on 10 July, Bloomberg pegged Huang’s net worth at $143 billion, up from about $20 billion in early 2022. That leap happened in stages: $44 billion by mid-2023, $117 billion in late 2024, and now the $140-plus range. Fueled by the AI boom and soaring Nvidia shares, the difference this year alone is bigger than the entire market value of some Fortune 500 firms.The company’s share price settled near $164, capping a run that has lifted the stock 74 percent since April’s low and around 22 percent since January. Nvidia is now the dominant weight in the S&P 500, ahead of Apple and Microsoft. Analysts at Citi, Barclays and Loop Capital all raised their price targets this week, citing demand for the upcoming Blackwell platform and a backlog of data-centre orders.Huang’s percentage looks small beside founder holdings at some other tech giants, yet at a $4 trillion valuation it leaves him with shares worth roughly $140 billion. The stake figure comes from Nvidia’s March 2025 proxy filing and excludes unvested stock units.

YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.

A recently released book has claimed that Tesla CEO Elon Musk faced ""similar drama"" with Amber Heard as Johnny Depp did. The book named “Hollywood Vampires: Johnny Depp, Amber Heard, and the Celebrity Exploitation Machine”, written by Kelly Loudenberg and Makiko Whole, was released in June. This book has revealed that the world’s richest man’s relationship with Heard was also marked by turbulence and toxicity. The book, which details the marriage between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, also suggested that Heard ""broke Elon Musk's heart"" a decade ago. Initially, their romance appeared smooth; however, the book reportedly revealed that Heard and Musk's relationship was plagued by fighting, jealousy, and dramatic accusations.According to the book (as seen by Daily Mail), individuals within Elon Musk's inner circle later made strikingly similar observations about Amber Heard's character as those expressed by people close to Johnny Depp.As detailed in the book, shortly after a restraining order was granted to Heard against Depp in May 2016, a large plant was delivered to Amber's Los Angeles apartment. The card attached read:A concierge later testified in court under oath that Elon already had his own key fob for the penthouse garage and had been visiting Amber regularly for over a year—usually late at night, during Depp’s absence, the book claims.In June 2016, Heard flew to the Tesla factory in Fremont, California, to surprise Musk on his birthday. On her way, she picked wildflowers, and upon arrival, his security team helped her hide in the back of a Tesla, the book noted.Later on, in July 2016, Amber and Elon were seen together in Miami. Amber was accompanied by her sister, Whitney. The three stayed in poolside villas at the Delano Hotel, and Elon later flew the sisters to Cape Canaveral to attend a SpaceX Falcon 9 launch, the book highlighted.Heard described the experience to biographer Walter Isaacson asshe’d ever had. Their relationship, though just beginning, started gaining momentum.However, their relationship had its challenges, which were marked by arguments, jealousy, and serious allegations, the book mentioned. Those close to Musk would later share observations about Amber’s behaviour that echoed what Depp’s associates had said.Soon after Heard returned to Australia to shoot Aquaman, but this time she was accompanied by Musk instead of Depp. As per the book, concerns reportedly grew within Tesla and SpaceX. At that time, Musk had rented Heard a house, and those around him felt he was becoming increasingly distracted, the book alleged.A source claimed Heard would keep him up all night, showing little regard for his professional responsibilities.the source said to the book writers.Musk later referred to the relationship as his most emotionally painful, calling itDespite his difficulty with emotional expression, he admitted being deeply affected. In a Rolling Stone interview shortly after their breakup, he said,noting he had struggled to stay composed during the Tesla Model 3 launch just a day earlier.Though they continued seeing each other on and off in 2017, things grew more turbulent. A friend of Heard’s recalled her describing Musk as controlling and paranoid, claiming he installed cameras and bugged her car. However, Heard’s friend was sceptical and compared the claims to similar ones she had made about Depp, the book notedTheir relationship finally ended during a December trip to Rio in 2017, following a confrontation in their hotel. Heard accused Musk of taking her passport and said she feared being harmed, though others present assured her she was safe and free to leave.After their final split, Heard messaged her agent expressing sadness. He replied, reminding her she had repeatedly said she wasn’t truly in love with Musk and was just trying to fill a void.","Amber Heard and Elon Musk's relationship was plagued by fighting, jealousy, and dramatic accusations, according to a new book.

Government agencies among primary targets in Microsoft Sharepoint attack

Microsoft releases emergency updates

Microsoft is scrambling to contain a widespread cyberattack targeting SharePoint servers worldwide, with cybersecurity experts warning that over 10,000 companies could be at risk. The software giant confirmed that hackers are actively exploiting previously unknown security flaws in on-premises SharePoint servers used by government agencies, universities, and major corporations to share internal documents.The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency ( CISA ) added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerability catalog on Saturday, giving federal agencies just one day to apply patches once they become available. ""These exploits are real, in-the-wild, and pose a serious threat,"" warned Palo Alto Networks, while Google's Threat Intelligence Group confirmed observing active exploitation attempts.Dutch cybersecurity firm Eye Security first detected the attacks on July 18th and reports that at least 85 SharePoint servers across 54 organizations have already been compromised. Among the victims are a California university, energy companies, federal health organizations, and government entities in Florida and New York.The attack leverages what's known as a ""zero-day"" vulnerability – a security flaw unknown to software makers until it's actively exploited by hackers. Cybersecurity researchers estimate that over 10,000 companies with SharePoint servers are potentially at risk, with the United States, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Canada having the highest concentrations of vulnerable systems.""It's a dream for ransomware operators, and a lot of attackers are going to be working this weekend as well,"" said Silas Cutler, a researcher at Michigan-based Censys. The vulnerability allows hackers to access file systems, steal sensitive configurations, and execute malicious code across networks without authentication.The attackers are using a technique called ""ToolShell"" that was originally demonstrated at the Pwn2Own security conference . They upload malicious files to steal critical server keys, then use these stolen credentials to create valid access tokens that bypass security measures entirely.Federal and state agencies appear to be prime targets in this campaign, with the FBI confirming it's ""aware of the matter"" and working with government and private sector partners to assess the threat. The Washington Post reported that the breach has affected multiple U.S. agencies, though specific details remain classified for security reasons.CISA's Acting Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity Chris Butera emphasized the urgency: ""Microsoft is responding quickly, and we are working with the company to help notify potentially impacted entities about recommended mitigations. CISA encourages all organizations with on-premise Microsoft SharePoint servers to take immediate recommended action.""Organizations can detect if they've been compromised by checking for suspicious files named ""spinstall0.aspx"" on their servers or unusual network activity from specific IP addresses that security firms have identified as attack sources.Microsoft has released emergency security updates for SharePoint 2019 and Subscription Edition servers, with a patch for SharePoint 2016 expected soon. The company recommends that organizations unable to immediately apply updates should disconnect their SharePoint servers from the internet until patches can be installed.For additional protection, Microsoft advises enabling its Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) feature and deploying Windows Defender Antivirus on all SharePoint servers. Organizations should also rotate their server security keys after applying patches to prevent further unauthorized access.This incident adds to Microsoft's recent cybersecurity challenges, including Chinese hacker attacks earlier this year and criticism from the White House's Cyber Safety Review Board, which called the company's security culture ""inadequate"" following previous breaches.","Hackers are exploiting previously unknown security flaws in on-premises SharePoint servers used by government agencies, universities, and major corporations to share internal documents.

Mark Zuckerberg on techies joining Meta for big salaries

Google Pixel 10 Series Launch: Everything Coming on August 20

Priscilla Chan, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg ’s wife, recently revealed her secret recruiting pitch to lure top talent. Chan is co-founder of the nonprofit organisation, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI). Speaking on the Core Memory podcast hosted by Ashlee Vance, she said that while tech companies continue to offer massive compensation packages, CZI is focused on providing researchers with the tools they need instead. “The other thing researchers really care about is access to GPUs. You're not going to make the most of someone if you don't actually have the GPUs for them to work from,” Priscilla Chan said.Her comments come as Meta’s Superintelligence Labs keeps hiring top AI talent with eight-figure salaries and a goal of managing 1.3 million GPUs by the end of 2025.During the podcast, she revealed that the organization now has about 1,000 advanced GPUs and plans to add more so that scientists can pursue cutting-edge work—even if the nonprofit can't match tech industry salaries.Chan revealed that CZI has shifted its priorities to what she called a “science-first philanthropy,” with major efforts focused on biomedical discovery. The nonprofit, she said, continues to build advanced infrastructure to support research, aiming to make scientific breakthroughs more accessible.Chan emphasized that while they can’t match Big Tech’s paychecks, CZI hopes to offer the next best thing: top-tier computing power dedicated to science.“Come work with us because we're going to have the computing power to support the research that you want to do,” Chan tells candidates. She added, “Pay is obviously important, yet we cannot compete with tech companies on this.”Recently, Mark Zuckerberg dismissed the idea that top AI researchers are joining Meta only for the massive paychecks, revealing that the major factor drawing towards them is the unmatched compute power autonomy.In an interview with The Information, Zuckerberg emphasised that the unparalleled compute power and the unique opportunity to build ""superintelligence” are the reasons why AI researchers are joining the company.Recently, we witnessed an aggressive recruitment drive from Meta, with some reports citing offers in the hundreds of millions of dollars to poach AI talent from Apple, OpenAI and Google DeepMind. These figures and rapid hiring made by Meta fuelled speculation of an unprecedented talent war, where financial gains reign supreme.","Priscilla Chan, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s wife, recently revealed her secret recruiting pitch to lure top talent.

Elon Musk’s X calls French probe ‘a politically-motivated criminal investigation’; says won’t cooperate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-x-calls-french-probe-a-politically-motivated-criminal-investigation-says-wont-cooperate/articleshow/122817747.cms,"

French lawmakers accuse X of ""manipulating its algorithm”

Here’s what X said

French authorities have launched a politically-motivated criminal investigation into X over the alleged manipulation of its algorithm and alleged “fraudulent data extraction.” X categorically denies these allegations.

This investigation, instigated by French politician Eric Bothorel, egregiously undermines X’s fundamental right to due process and threatens our users’ rights to privacy and free speech. Mr Bothorel has accused X of manipulating its algorithm for “foreign interference” purposes, an allegation which is completely false.

French authorities have requested access to X’s recommendation algorithm and real-time data about all user posts on the platform in order for several “experts” to analyze the data and purportedly “uncover the truth” about the operation of the X platform. One of those “experts” is David Chavalarias, who spearheads the “Escape X” campaign. Formerly known as “HelloQuitteX”, the campaign is dedicated to encouraging X users to leave the platform. A second “expert,” Maziyar Panahi, has previously participated in research projects with David Chavalarias that demonstrate open hostility towards X.

The involvement of these individuals raises serious concerns about the impartiality, fairness, and political motivations of the investigation, to put it charitably. A predetermined outcome is not a fair one. What’s more, French authorities have classified X as an “organized gang” for the purpose of the investigation. This characterization, which is usually reserved for drug cartels or mafia groups, enables the French police to deploy extensive investigative powers under French law, including wiretapping the personal devices of X employees.

X remains in the dark as to the specific allegations made against the platform. However, based on what we know so far, X believes that this investigation is distorting French law in order to serve a political agenda and, ultimately, restrict free speech.

For these reasons, X has not acceded to the French authorities’ demands, as we have a legal right to do. This is not a decision that X takes lightly. However, in this case, the facts speak for themselves.

X is committed to defending its fundamental rights, protecting user data and resisting political censorship.

Elon Musk-owned microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) said it will not cooperate with a French probe allegedly accusing it of data tampering. According to news agency Reuters, the company accused French prosecutors of launching a ""politically-motivated criminal investigation"" which, it claims, threatens its users' free speech. Denying all allegations against it, X said that it would not cooperate with the probe.

It was based on suspected algorithmic bias and fraudulent data extraction, reports Reuters. According to it, the probe authorized police to conduct searches, wiretaps and surveillance against Musk and X executives, or summon them to testify. If they do not comply, a judge could issue an arrest warrant.The probe could deepen a rift between Washington and European capitals over what sort of discourse is permitted online.","Elon Musk-owned microblogging platform X said it will not cooperate with a French probe allegedly accusing it of data tampering.

Apple withdraws secure storage service from UK market

The UK government is preparing to retreat from its controversial order forcing Apple to provide backdoor access to encrypted user data, following intense pressure from the Trump administration that threatens vital technology partnerships between the two nations.Senior British officials told the Financial Times that the Home Office will likely abandon its January demand for Apple to break end-to-end encryption on iCloud storage , with US Vice President JD Vance leading opposition to the UK's stance. ""The Home Office is basically going to have to back down,"" one technology department official said, noting Vance's strong objections to the encryption order.The standoff has created significant diplomatic friction, with multiple US officials including President Trump, Vice President Vance, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard all raising concerns about the UK's approach. Trump previously compared the British demand to ""something you hear about with China"" and reportedly told Prime Minister Keir Starmer directly: ""You can't do this.""The encryption dispute threatens to derail broader technology cooperation between the allies, particularly around artificial intelligence and data sharing agreements central to Starmer's digital trade strategy. ""One of the challenges for the tech partnerships we're working on is the encryption issue,"" a senior UK official explained. ""It's a big red line in the US — they don't want us messing with their tech companies.""US officials have warned that the UK order could violate Americans' privacy rights and potentially breach existing data agreements between the countries, with Gabbard calling it an ""egregious violation.""In response to the secret government order issued under the Investigatory Powers Act , Apple withdrew its most secure cloud storage service, Advanced Data Protection , from the UK market in February. The tech giant is now challenging the Home Office demand at the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, with WhatsApp joining the legal battle in a rare collaboration between Silicon Valley rivals.British officials acknowledge the Home Office has handled the encryption issue ""very badly"" and now has ""its back against the wall"" as it seeks an exit strategy from the high-profile privacy confrontation.","The UK government is preparing to retreat from its controversial order forcing Apple to provide backdoor access to encrypted user data.

They are big proponents of

First Principles AI

They invest in

hybrid AI infrastructure

They are fast followers too

In the last 2 years and more, of the gen AI evolution, we have already seen three sweeping waves. The first was focused on building larger frontier models – with more compute, more data, and more scaling. This wave led to the development and deployment of AI assistants. In the second wave, we saw the emergence of small- and mid-sized AI models – open weight or open source – performing on par with frontier models; and models started to be commoditized. In the ongoing third wave, there is greater focus on test-time scaling and reasoning, with AI agents and agentic platforms driving process reengineering. As the pace of evolution accelerates, AI leaders will continuously realize more meaningful outcomes from AI. Companies, across business domains, that are AI high performers , are already embracing this evolutionary approach when it comes to building out the foundational capabilities that allow them to generate value.Here’s how the forerunners among these AI powerhouses are realizing their AI potential:Their AI development flywheel is a cycle of continuous iteration. From problem identification, research, data sourcing & enrichment, model building, validation and deployment, this flywheel is a try-learn-perfect-repeat cycle of fast-paced experimentation. These are sprints – but positioned as milestones within marathons. For this flywheel to churn more winning solutions – the source needs to have feeders bringing in a rich repository of business & technology problems effectively framed as AI/ML problems. Nurtured in a culture of rapid iteration and learning, teams are invited to launch features in quick succession, test them, and fine-tune models and prompts. The key to successful AI experimentation is speed and agility with experimentation to rapidly validate ideas, measure impact, and iterate to build better AI applications. With the right tools and processes in place, they purposefully train their teams in this new paradigm of AI development. For example, DeepSeek has been doing continuous research and experimentations over a period of time and constantly evolving the model before the success with latest models.This is a favored method for frontrunners to gain new insights into their data strategy, AI infrastructure design and optimization, to deepen algorithmic efficiencies, improve model performance, and slash pre-training, post-training, and development time. First Principles AI involves breaking down complex business problems, framed as ML/AI problems, into their fundamental components. This is all about getting down to the core building blocks of a problem and then building solutions thereon without using existing models and techniques as the starting point. In many ways, this is about reframing the status quo. So, in the AI context, this translates into delineating principles of machine learning, neural networks, and data science from the ground up to then surface with groundbreaking innovations.AI high performers understand the merits of combining the strengths of rental cloud-based AI solutions for scaling of innovations, with either owned on-premises AI servers or private clouds for better control and compliance during the continuous high-intensity experimentation cycle. They embrace the hybrid approach that can best power their AI flywheels – taking a very strategic view of the choices they make. When their AI experiment has fructified into a viable solution ready to be scaled, they often need scaled infrastructure too that otherwise is not accessed year-long. The rental expenditure model is ideal in the scaling phase, where utilization happens only at the tail end of the more regular experimentation cycle. In contrast, investing in owned AI infrastructure, bringing with it full control and opportunities for greater customization, is best suited for predictable and continuous AI experiment loads. Owning the infrastructure brings substantial cost savings in the long run. Additionally, ownership ensures data security and compliance as well, along with an efficient operating environment.Frontrunners realize that the advantages of existing open-source models and AI services are undeniable, despite the broad concerns around data privacy and Responsible AI tenets. AI high performers, even as they build new models and capabilities, deploy these existing models run from their own infrastructure – whether private cloud, on prem infrastructure, custom hardware (raspberry pi) or AI ready devices. Such deployment can be made fully compliant with global frameworks that ensure ethical and equitable AI deployment.As more and more organizations continue to scale AI, and as they plan to up their AI investments in the months ahead, these learnings can guide greater efforts to deliver purposeful AI outcomes.-- By Mohammed Rafee Tarafdar, Chief Technology Officer, Infosys","Companies are already embracing this evolutionary approach when it comes to building out the foundational capabilities that allow them to generate value.

Elon Musk unveils Optimus robot serving popcorn at Tesla Diner



Optimus may become common in homes, says Musk



Popcorn Demo reveals challenges in humanoid robot autonomy



Humanoid robot Optimus future upgrades



Tesla CEO Elon Musk has once again spotlighted the evolving capabilities of the Tesla Optimus humanoid robot. In a video that went viral across social media, the robot is shown calmly serving popcorn to a human guest. This quirky, popcorn-pouring showcase might seem lighthearted, but it marks another serious step toward Musk’s larger vision: a future where humanoid robots seamlessly assist in everyday tasks. From folding laundry to walking your dog, Optimus is inching closer to becoming a functional, everyday companion. The video has triggered fresh conversations around the future of robotics and automation .The latest clip, posted by Elon Musk on X (formerly Twitter), features the Optimus robot gently filling a packet of popcorn and offering it with a polite thumbs-up and a friendly wave. While the robot’s movements are deliberate and slightly slower than a human's, it manages the task without a single spill or misstep. According to Musk, this event took place at the soft opening of the Tesla Diner and Supercharger Station at 7001 W. Santa Monica Boulevard, Hollywood, Los Angeles.This seemingly simple act is a milestone in the development of general-purpose robotics, highlighting precision, motor control, and user interaction capabilities.“This will become normal in a few years,” Musk commented in his post, emphasising that serving popcorn is just the beginning. Musk envisions Tesla Optimus as a general-purpose robot that could soon assist with household chores, caregiving, pet walking, and even babysitting. At Tesla’s 2024 “We, Robot” event, he boldly predicted that Optimus could eventually “walk right up to you and serve drinks,” becoming an integral part of everyday life, like smartphones are today.The Tesla Optimus journey began in 2021 when Musk introduced the original Tesla Bot concept. Initially planned for a 2023 release, the robot’s development has faced multiple delays.In 2022, Tesla presented a prototype that could walk, retrieve objects, and even water plants. However, safety concerns remained. Musk acknowledged during the bot’s debut that they ""didn’t want it to fall on its face"" during a live demo. By July 2024, Musk revealed an updated timeline, projecting commercial sales of Optimus to begin in 2026. Yet, at the “We, Robot” event later that year, many of the robots on display were revealed to be remotely operated by humans, not fully autonomous, highlighting the ongoing technical hurdles.Though entertaining, the popcorn video underscores the vast challenges of developing fully autonomous humanoid robots. Today’s robots still rely heavily on remote operation or preset routines, especially for interactions requiring nuanced human-like responses.That said, Optimus’s ability to track tasks, manipulate objects, and engage with humans in a friendly way suggests that Tesla’s team is methodically refining both hardware and software. With every demo—from folding clothes to serving snacks—Tesla inches closer to delivering on Musk’s ambitious promise: robots that aren’t just useful but feel almost natural in our daily lives.Looking ahead, Tesla plans to gradually improve autonomous movement, task flexibility, and environmental adaptability in the Optimus line. Future upgrades may allow these bots to function effectively in homes, restaurants, offices, and even hospitals.While Musk’s 2026 target for commercial rollout may seem optimistic, continued innovation and public interest suggest that humanoid robots could soon shift from science fiction to everyday reality.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has once again spotlighted the evolving capabilities of the Tesla Optimus humanoid robot.

"European country Tesla CEO Elon Musk 'name checked' during earnings call for 171% jump in sales, announces 'surprise tax hike'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/european-country-tesla-ceo-elon-musk-name-checked-during-earnings-call-for-171-jump-in-sales-announces-surprise-tax-hike/articleshow/122914833.cms,"Tesla sales jump 171% in Turkey



What helped Tesla grow in Turkey



Tesla is facing tough time in Europe. Ever since Elon Musk decided to join Donald Trump's government, his political decisions have hurt the Electronic VEhicle (EV) maker almost across Europe. Elon Musk's souring ties with President Trump's administration too has not helped. The only bright spot in Europe for Tesla has been Turkey. In Europe, Turkey has been one of Tesla's fastest-growing markets. However, Tesla's efforts to mitigate slumping European sales with gains in Turkey may be at risk after a surprise tax hike in the country.Turkey has raised the lowest tier of its special consumption tax for electric vehicles — which includes Tesla’s top-selling Model Y — to 25% from 10%, according to a presidential decree published in the country’s Official Gazette.Turkey has emerged as an increasingly significant market for Tesla, helping alleviate falling demand elsewhere in Europe. In fact, CEO Elon Musk name-checked the country during the company’s quarterly earnings call recently.Tesla sales in the country soared 171% in June to 7,235 units, with the Model Y taking the top spot among EVs. In same month, Tesla registrations across Europe dropped 23% to 34,781 vehicles, according to data published Thursday by the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.Tesla's success in Turkey, driven by a locally tailored Model Y qualifying for a 10% tax rate, faces challenges as a new levy could raise prices by about $6,000, potentially dampening demand. Previously priced at 1.87 million liras ($46,100), the Model Y may lose its edge, while many combustion-engine competitors’ tax brackets remain unchanged. This tax hike compounds issues for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has flagged tough quarters ahead due to fading US EV subsidies and delays in autonomous vehicle progress.The policy shift also threatens competitors like BYD Co., which plans local production in Turkey and offers models like the Dolphin, Atto 3, and Seal in the same low-tax bracket. Other manufacturers, including Volkswagen AG, Hyundai Motor Co., and Stellantis NV, with affordable EVs in Turkey, may also feel the impact.","Tesla sales in the country soared 171% in June to 7,235 units, with the Model Y taking the top spot among EVs.

7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Elon Musk-owned Tesla is planning to launch its robotaxi service in San Francisco next week, reports Business Insider citing an internal staff memo. As per the report, the EV maker said that its timeline for the launch has been moved up and the service could launch as soon as Friday, i.e. August 1. According to the memo, the geofenced area where Robotaxi service will operate will cover a large part of the Bay Area , including Marin, much of the East Bay, San Francisco, and stretching south to San Jose. Robotaxi service in San Francisco will initially launch with safety drivers in the driver's seat who will be able to control the car using the steering wheel and brakes, the memo said.A Business Insider report states that the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) records show that Tesla has expanded its autonomous testing activities in the state. As of December, the company registered 224 in-house test drivers and 104 vehicles for testing under its existing permit. The publication reported that the number of workers testing Tesla’s software in California has more than tripled.Tesla currently holds a permit that allows testing of its self-driving software in California, but only with a safety driver behind the wheel. It remains unclear whether Tesla will need a separate permit to operate its planned robotaxi service with a safety operator present in the vehicle.The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has granted Tesla a permit to operate a transportation service for employees. However, as of July 10, Tesla had not applied for the necessary permits to offer a commercial robotaxi service to the general public.The Business Insider report further stated that DMV has confirmed the EV company has not applied for a permit to test or deploy driverless vehicles in the state. A DMV spokesperson said the agency recently met with Tesla, but the company has not submitted an application for either testing or commercial deployment of fully autonomous vehicles.Tesla launched its invite-only robotaxi service in Austin, Texas last month with around 10 modified Model Y vehicles operating in a geofenced area. Elon Musk said during Tesla’s Q2 earnings call this week that initial Bay Area operations will also begin with a safety operator in the front seat. The Tesla CEO also added that Tesla plans to launch the Bay Area service within one to two months and is in the process of obtaining the required regulatory approvals.","Elon Musk-owned Tesla is planning to launch its robotaxi service in San Francisco next week, reports Business Insider citing an internal staff memo.

Dutch regulator delays Apple ruling amid EU talks on App Store: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/dutch-regulator-delays-apple-ruling-amid-eu-talks-on-app-store-report/articleshow/122908191.cms,"7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Dutch antitrust watchdog, the Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM), has delayed its decision on Apple over fees charged to dating app providers on the App Store. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the regulator said that it is waiting for the outcome of ongoing discussions between Apple and the European Commission on a similar issue before moving forward.According to ACM, Apple recently changed its fee structure in response to those talks and has said it plans to make further adjustments later this year.The regulator had previously ruled that Apple abused its dominant market position by imposing unfair conditions on dating app developers. That decision was upheld by a Dutch court in June, which found that the company’s practices in the App Store violated competition laws.The ACM has not provided a new timeline for its final ruling. The ongoing talks between Apple and the European Commission are expected to influence how both EU and national regulators handle competition issues related to the App Store in the future.In a related news, Reuters recently reported that Apple’s updates to its App Store rules and fees are likely to get approval from EU antitrust regulators soon. Citing people familiar with the matter, the report said that this could help the Cupertino-based company avoid large daily fines. Last month, the iPhone maker said that developers will soon be required to pay a 20% processing fee for purchases made via the App Store. For Apple’s small-business program, the fees could go as low as 13%.","Dutch antitrust watchdog, the Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM), has delayed its decision on Apple over fees charged to dating app providers on the App Store.

Flying suitcases packed with hard drives to China: Nvidia responds to 'burning issue' of AI chip smuggling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/flying-suitcases-packed-with-hard-drives-to-china-nvidia-responds-to-burning-issue-of-ai-chip-smuggling/articleshow/122908000.cms,"How China is smuggling US-made high-end AI chips



Chinese companies using AI infrastructure in other South Asian countries to train AI models



7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Nvidia has issued a strong warning against the use of unauthorised chips in data centers, calling it a “losing proposition” both technically and economically. The statement from the world’s most valuable company comes in the wake of a recent report which alleged that at least $1 billion worth of Nvidia's AI chips have been illegally smuggled into China. Not only that, last month a report said that Chinese companies are resorting to ‘unconventional’ ways, including carrying hard drives with AI training data in suitcases to other countries, to bypass US restrictions on high-end AI chips.“Trying to cobble together datacenters from smuggled products is a losing proposition, both technically and economically. Datacenters require service and support, which we provide only to authorised NVIDIA products,” an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC.A Financial Times report detailed that these illicit shipments of Nvidia's AI chips entered China despite President Donald Trump's restrictions on the sale of the company’s H20 chips to the world's second-largest economy. Furthermore, the report, citing sales contracts, company filings, and informed sources, stated that Nvidia's B200 chips, which are also prohibited from sale in China, have become popular on the black market.Chinese distributors reportedly began selling these restricted chips in May to data center suppliers, whose clientele includes various Chinese AI groups.Since 2022, stringent US export controls on high-end AI chips, driven by national security concerns, have significantly impacted Chinese firms' access to cutting-edge American technology. This has forced them to explore various workarounds, from developing domestic alternatives to engaging in illicit activities like smuggling, and increasingly, processing data in overseas locations.According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, while some Chinese companies have begun substituting American chips with domestically produced alternatives, others have resorted to smuggling AI hardware through third countries to circumvent the controls.However, increased pressure from the US has made smuggling a more difficult proposition. This has pushed Chinese firms towards a new strategy: processing data outside of China in regions like Southeast Asia and the Middle East. ""This was something we were consistently concerned about,"" Thea Kendler, former head of export controls at the Commerce Department under the Biden administration, told the WSJ, referring to the remote access Chinese firms maintain to US AI chips.The WSJ report says that Chinese companies employed elaborate strategies to circumvent stringent US restrictions on advanced AI chips.For example, in one instance in March, four Chinese engineers reportedly flew from Beijing to Malaysia, each carrying suitcases filled with 15 hard drives containing 80 terabytes of data. At a Malaysian data centre, they utilised approximately 300 servers equipped with advanced Nvidia chips to develop an AI model, which they subsequently brought back to China.This operation involved planning, including weeks spent optimising data sets in China to avoid lengthy online transfers.","Chinese companies using AI infrastructure in other South Asian countries to train AI models.

Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for 'offensive' political slurs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/poland-flags-elon-musks-grok-chatbot-to-the-eu-for-offensive-political-slurs/articleshow/122348777.cms,"Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for “offensive” political slurs

Why Poland says Elon Musk's Grok chatbot crossed a red line



Offensive answers: From antisemitic tropes to political insults



European digital rules put xAI under the spotlight



Previous incidents: Turkey, hate speech, and Grok’s growing rap sheet



xAI and Musk offer silence, at least for now



Poland just pulled the alarm on Grok, the AI chatbot from Elon Musk ’s xAI. Officials in Warsaw say the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders, so they’re asking the European Commission to investigate and, if the rules allow, hit xAI or X with fines.Krzysztof Gawkowski, Poland’s digitisation minister, told RMF FM radio that the bot’s remarks amounted to hate speech. He argued that ignoring algorithm-driven abuse “may cost humanity in the future,” so his ministry will file an official complaint under existing EU regulations.The step is unusual but legal: member states can trigger EU probes when digital services target their citizens with unlawful content. If Brussels agrees, xAI could face penalties under the Digital Services Act or the forthcoming AI Act.Grok’s missteps are piling up. The same day Poland aired its grievance, the Anti-Defamation League flagged responses in which the bot praised Adolf Hitler and recycled antisemitic stereotypes. xAI deleted the posts, calling them “inappropriate,” yet offered no public apology.Users had also shared screenshots showing Grok calling Tusk “a coward in Brussels slippers,” among other jabs. Warsaw says the language breaches Poland’s hate-speech law and the EU’s code of practice on disinformation.The EU’s Digital Services Act took full effect for very large platforms in February 2025. It forces companies such as X to assess systemic risks, audit their algorithms, and let regulators peek behind the curtain. An AI-specific law is coming later this year, likely adding fresh transparency mandates. Poland’s complaint tees up an early test of those combined powers.Legal scholars note that fines can reach 6 percent of global turnover for DSA violations. For Musk’s empire, that runs into billions.Poland is not alone. A Turkish court ordered X to block Grok content that mocked President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and Islamic beliefs.In June, users spotted the bot rambling about a supposed “white genocide” in South Africa. xAI blamed an “unauthorised change” to its response code.Each flare-up feeds an image of a system that swings from playful banter to extremist rhetoric with a single prompt.As of Wednesday afternoon, xAI had not replied to Reuters’ emailed questions, and Musk’s normally hyperactive X feed stayed quiet on the topic.The billionaire recently urged “maximum free speech” on X, but he also says AI must be “truth-seeking.” That balance gets messy when the bot channels conspiracy theories or ethnic slurs.","Poland says the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's net worth soars $1 billion as the chipmaker joins the $4 trillion club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-net-worth-soars-1-billion-as-the-chipmaker-joins-the-4-trillion-club/articleshow/122377958.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang’s net worth passes $140 billion



Nvidia’s market value climbs above $4 trillion



How a 3.5 percent stake fuels one of the world’s biggest fortunes



Where Jensen Huang now ranks among global billionaires



Why investors keep bidding the price up

AI demand everywhere. Cloud providers, carmakers, and sovereign data-centre projects line up for the current Hopper chips and the coming Blackwell series.

Scarcity premium. Nvidia controls around 80 percent of high-end AI GPU supply, and capacity stays tight even after Taiwan’s fabs ramp up output.

Ecosystem lock-in. CUDA software and support contracts make switching costs high, so even rivals that launch competitive silicon must still lure developers away.

What could slow the rally

Export curbs. The United States still blocks top-tier chips from shipping to China, Nvidia’s largest single-country market outside the U.S.

New competition. AMD, Intel and a clutch of start-ups are readying chips that nibble at Nvidia’s margins, especially in inference workloads.

Rich valuation. At about 40 times forward earnings, the stock leaves little room for an earnings miss; even a small disappointment could yank billions from Huang’s paper wealth.

Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold. The jump did more than rewrite Wall Street leaderboards; it also pushed co-founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s fortune past $140 billion. He owns about 3.5 percent of Nvidia, held directly and through family trusts, so every flicker in the share price lands straight in his pocket.Bloomberg’s daily billionaire tally shows Jensen Huang adding roughly $1 billion in a single session, and nearly $28 billion in 2025 so far. That kind of lift puts him shoulder-to-shoulder with household names like Warren Buffett, a spot unthinkable just three years ago. Investors keep paying the premium because Nvidia sells the chips that make modern AI run, from data-centre clusters to enterprise servers. The faster the market grows, the richer Huang becomes.As of the New York closing bell on 10 July, Bloomberg pegged Huang’s net worth at $143 billion, up from about $20 billion in early 2022. That leap happened in stages: $44 billion by mid-2023, $117 billion in late 2024, and now the $140-plus range. Fueled by the AI boom and soaring Nvidia shares, the difference this year alone is bigger than the entire market value of some Fortune 500 firms.The company’s share price settled near $164, capping a run that has lifted the stock 74 percent since April’s low and around 22 percent since January. Nvidia is now the dominant weight in the S&P 500, ahead of Apple and Microsoft. Analysts at Citi, Barclays and Loop Capital all raised their price targets this week, citing demand for the upcoming Blackwell platform and a backlog of data-centre orders.Huang’s percentage looks small beside founder holdings at some other tech giants, yet at a $4 trillion valuation it leaves him with shares worth roughly $140 billion. The stake figure comes from Nvidia’s March 2025 proxy filing and excludes unvested stock units. Cash, past dividend income and secondary-share sales round out the number Bloomberg uses, but the equity slice is what matters daily.With the latest move, he edges into Bloomberg’s global top ten, swapping places with Google’s Larry Page and closing in on Warren Buffett. Forbes, which refreshes less often, lists him ninth. None of the other names in that bracket made their money so fast in so short a window.","N Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold.

YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

2. What exactly counts as “mass-produced” or “repetitious” content?

4. Do the subscriber and watch-time thresholds change?

5. What happens if my channel is flagged for inauthentic uploads?

6. Are reaction videos or clip compilations automatically disqualified?

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.

Demis Hassabis may succeed Sundar Pichai as Google CEO



7 Reasons that make Samsung GALAXY Z FLIP7 different from others

Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis appeared on an episode of the Lex Fridman podcast recently. During the podcast, Demis talked about the Meta AI hiring spree that has hired employees from OpenAI , Apple, GitHub, Google and others. Hassabis said it makes sense that Meta is making these job offers. “Meta right now are not at the frontier, maybe they'll manage to get back on there”, Hassabis said, adding “It's probably rational what they're doing from their perspective because they're behind and they need to do something.”He further added that many people working in AI care more about the mission to “steward that technology safely”. ""There's more important things than just money,"" he said. ""Of course, one has to pay people their market rates and all of these things, and that continues to go up.""During the podcast, Demis Hassabis revealed that working in AI research wasn’t always a high paying job. “I remember when we were starting out back in 2010, I didn't even pay myself for a couple of years because there wasn't enough money. We couldn't raise any money,” he said.“These days, interns are being paid the amount that we raised as our first entire seed round,” he stated.Demis Hassabis is reportedly being seen by some Google employees as a potential successor to the current CEO Sundar Pichai. While there is no official word on any succession plan, a Business Insider report says Hassabis' swift rise in recent years has followed a pattern similar to that of Pichai’s own journey to the top. “His rise reminds me of Sundar's,” a longtime Google employee who has worked closely with Hassabis and Pichai told the publication. “All of a sudden, you started hearing this name Sundar internally, and he kept having more and more responsibility, and all of a sudden, he was the CEO,” the employee added.Continuing further, the employee stated “Demis' rise has been similar. Now, all of a sudden, he's responsible for what is probably the most important team at Google right now.”","Demis Hassabis is reportedly being seen by some Google employees as a potential successor to the current CEO Sundar Pichai. “His rise reminds me of Sundar's,” a longtime Google employee who has worked closely with Hassabis andPichai told Business Insider.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122906598,imgsize-29044,width-400,resizemode-4/Google-DeepMind-CEO-Demis-Hassabis.jpg"

A tech soap opera: What Artificial is about

The real drama between Elon Musk and OpenAI

Behind the camera: Big names and big ambitions

In a casting move already sparking buzz, Emmy-nominated actor Ike Barinholtz is set to portray tech magnate Elon Musk in Artificial, an upcoming comedy-drama from acclaimed director Luca Guadagnino. The film, currently in development at Amazon MGM Studios, revolves around the chaotic few days in November 2023 when Sam Altman was fired and swiftly reinstated as CEO of OpenAI . Known for his roles in The Studio and as co-creator of Running Point, Barinholtz’s casting hints at a satirical tone, with Musk reportedly appearing in scenes described as both comic relief and villainous. The project also stars Andrew Garfield as Altman and Yura Borisov as Ilya Sutskever, bringing high drama and tech-world intrigue to the big screen.According to leaked script details reported by Puck’s Matthew Belloni, Elon Musk is portrayed in scenes of “villainy and comic relief.” At one point, the script allegedly refers to him as a “dictator.” While Musk only appears in a few scenes, his presence looms large. As a co-founder of OpenAI who left in 2018 and later launched rival company xAI, Musk’s relationship with the firm has soured in recent years. He’s currently embroiled in legal battles with OpenAI, making his on-screen depiction all the more intriguing.Artificial dramatizes the real-life events surrounding OpenAI’s surprise firing of Sam Altman in November 2023. The company’s board claimed Altman was not “consistently candid,” prompting internal turmoil that saw hundreds of employees threaten to quit. Within days, Altman was reinstated following overwhelming staff and investor pressure. Guadagnino’s film is said to focus on this high-stakes corporate power play, blending humor and tension to explore the growing pains of one of the world’s most influential AI companies.Musk has repeatedly criticized OpenAI, accusing it of betraying its non-profit roots and forming a “closed-source” partnership with Microsoft. In 2024, he filed a lawsuit claiming he was misled into co-founding the company. His $97.4 billion takeover bid in 2025 was publicly rejected by Altman, who cheekily responded on social media: “No thank you, but we will buy Twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.” OpenAI has since countersued, accusing Musk of launching harassing legal claims and damaging its reputation.Director Luca Guadagnino, known for Call Me By Your Name and Challengers, brings an auteur’s eye to the chaos of Silicon Valley. The film is written by Simon Rich, former Saturday Night Live writer and creator of An American Pickle. With Andrew Garfield, Monica Barbaro, and Yura Borisov also reportedly cast, Artificial is shaping up to be both a sharp satire and a timely commentary on power, ego, and the future of AI.Artificial is expected to begin filming later in 2025 with a planned release sometime in 2026. While still in development, the film has already captured public curiosity, especially given its portrayal of some of the most powerful and controversial figures in tech today.","Ike Barinholtz is set to portray tech magnate Elon Musk in Artificial, an upcoming comedy-drama from acclaimed director Luca Guadagnino.

This means China's version of Blinkit, Swiggy, Zepto and other quick commerce companies. As a result, China's e-commerce giants, including Alibaba, JD.com, and Meituan, are locked in an unprecedented ""instant retail"" price war, which they view as crucial for their future despite government warnings. The fierce competition, offering delivery in as little as 30 minutes, has prompted authorities to express concern that the aggressive price-cutting could exacerbate deflationary pressures in an already fragile economy.According to a report in Reuters, the platforms have collectively poured nearly 200 billion yuan ($28 billion) into subsidies for one-hour delivery in recent months, leading to extreme scenarios where customers receive items like beverages for free. This strategy has not gone unnoticed by regulators. The State Administration of Market Regulation, a government body, recently summoned the three companies for the second time, urging them to engage in ""rational competition,"" according to a source familiar with the matter.Ecommerce companies see the model as ""life or death"" struggle""It's really a battle that takes place now but is much more related to the expectations for five to 10 years down the road,"" told tech analyst Ed Sander of Tech Buzz China to Reuters. He explained that platforms view this as a ""life or death"" struggle, believing that instant retail, with the help of AI and automated warehouses, will eventually become so profitable that it will cannibalize conventional e-commerce.The extent of the price war is evident in promotions like coupons from Alibaba that cover the entire cost of a delivered breakfast or free tea from Meituan. JD Takeaway has also offered 10 yuan coupons on orders as small as 11 yuan.The regulatory pushback is unusual in its lack of effect, given that Chinese authorities typically take a firm-handed approach to market practices they deem unhealthy. A recent editorial from state media agency Xinhua was unequivocal, stating that these ""zero yuan purchases"" create a ""bubble market"" with no real winners.The price war is unfolding against a backdrop of economic slowdown, with retail sales growth dipping and economists at ANZ estimating a 0.1% decline in the consumer price index this year. Professor Bala Ramasamy of the China Europe International Business School told Reuters that ""a price war is never in the interest of businesses"" and that the ""unrealistic and at times toxic"" level of competition necessitates government intervention for the ""greater good.""Unlike price wars in sectors like electric vehicles, which were driven by overcapacity, the instant retail battle appears to be a direct response to a post-pandemic consumer spending slowdown. The instant retail sector is growing 2.5 times faster than traditional e-commerce and is projected to exceed 2 trillion yuan in sales by 2030, according to data from the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation. While consumers benefit from the low prices, merchants are reportedly complaining that the price wars are eliminating profit margins.","Alibaba, JD.com, and Meituan are locked in an unprecedented ""instant retail"" price war.

"China's BYD to assemble EVs in Pakistan; VP BYD Pakistan says, 'Do not forsee...'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/chinas-byd-to-assemble-evs-in-pakistan-vp-byd-pakistan-says-do-not-forsee-/articleshow/122901214.cms,"What will be assembled at BYD Pakistan plant

Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD is reportedly set to launch its first Pakistan-assembled car by July or August 2026, aiming to tap into the growing demand for electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in the region. According to a report in Reuters, the move comes as BYD expands its global footprint amidst an intense price war in its home market. The new plant in Pakistan not only addresses the rising demand from emerging markets but also leverages incentives provided by the Pakistani government.Danish Khaliq, vice president of sales and strategy at BYD Pakistan , informed Reuters that the plant, a joint venture between BYD and Mega Motor Company (a subsidiary of Pakistani utility Hub Power), has been under construction near Karachi since April.Initially, the facility will boast an annual production capacity of 25,000 units on a double-shift basis, Khaliq stated. He did not specify when the plant would reach full capacity or when mass production would commence.As per Reuters report, Khaliq detailed that the plant would begin by assembling imported parts, with some non-electric components produced locally. Production will initially cater to the domestic market, with the potential for exports to right-hand drive countries in the region, contingent on freight costs and business economics.""We do not foresee excess capacity in our system as demand in Pakistan will catch up,"" Khaliq affirmed.Looking ahead, Khaliq anticipates the market size for EVs and plug-in hybrid cars in Pakistan to grow threefold to fourfold in 2025 from approximately 1,000 total units in 2024. BYD is targeting a 30-35% share of this expanding segment, he added.In a further sign of its commitment to the Pakistani market, BYD is scheduled to launch its Shark 6 plug-in hybrid pickup truck in Pakistan. The segment is also seeing competition, with China's MG already selling a PHEV SUV and rival Haval set to join soon.Plug-in hybrids are seen as a more practical option in Pakistan due to the country's limited charging infrastructure for all-electric vehicles. To encourage EV adoption and private charging stations, the government has reportedly slashed power tariffs for chargers by 45% in January.",Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD is reportedly set to launch its first Pakistan-assembled car by July or August 2026.

Bidding war between Paramount and Netflix



Warner Bros. Discovery is now reportedly reconsidering whether to reopen sale talks with Paramount Skydance after receiving an amended offer which addresses the earlier concerns. As reported by Bloomberg, Paramount’s latest proposal includes covering the $2.8 billion fee owed to Netflix if Warner Bros. terminates its current agreement, backstopping debt financing and compensation shareholders if the deal fails to close by the year-end.Warner Bros. has already agreed to sell its Studio and HBO Max streaming business to Netflix in a deal valued $27.75 per share. However, Paramount has countered with a $30‑a‑share tender offer, appealing directly to shareholders and regulators. The Warner Bros board has not yet decided how to respond, but the discussion suggests Paramount’s bid could reignite a second bidding war.As per the report, Ellison said the new additions to Paramount's bid “underscore our strong and unwavering commitment to delivering the full value [Warner Bros. Discovery] shareholders deserve for their investment.""""We are making meaningful enhancements — backing this offer with billions of dollars, providing shareholders with certainty in value, a clear regulatory path, and protection against market volatility,"" he said in a statement.As per the Bloomberg report, many Warner Bros. shareholders including Ancora Holdings Group, Pentawater Capital Management have publicly urger the board to engage in talks with Paramount. While only a small fraction of shares have been tendered to Paramount so far, investor sentiment is pushing Warner Bros. to at least consider the rival offer.Both Paramount and Netflix have signaled willingness to raise their bids. Paramount CEO David Ellison has said the current offer is not final, while Netflix leadership has told shareholders it could go higher.

EU-US tensions over Greenland add to trade woes

No, Europe's biggest IT services company Capgemini does not agree with calls of total technological sovereignty in Europe. Paris-based Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat has reportedly dismissed calls for a total technological sovereignty in Europe. His comments come at a time when there are calls from several governments across America to reduce dependance on US technology companies in the backdrop of tense transatlantic relations. These frayed relations have stoked concerns about the Europe's dependence on American tech majors. European Union leaders gathered last week for a summit in Belgium focused on how to increase European competitiveness in a more volatile global economy. Europe’s push for greater digital sovereignty has gained new momentum in recent months, sparked by fears that the US President Donald Trump’s foreign policy could force a “tech decoupling”. Under President Trump, Brussels and Washington have clashed at a number of occasions over the EU’s digital regulation. So much so that, US even banned entry of several current and former EU officials. For those unaware, calls for digital sovereignty in Europe emphasize achieving strategic independence from foreign technology, specifically reducing dependence on U.S.-basedtech giants for infrastructure, cloud services, and AI.According to a report in Reuters, French tech major Capgemini, which serves government agencies, critical-infrastructure operators and large regulated enterprises, is positioning itself as a bridge between Brussels' sovereignty ambitions and the reality of US-dominated cloud infrastructure. ""There is no such thing as absolute sovereignty,"" Ezzat told journalists in a post-earnings call. ""Nobody has it, because no one has sovereignty over the entire value chain required to deliver services. ""Ezzat said that on the first three levels, Europe already has independence, but the dominance of the US Big Tech means that there is no complete independence on a technological level. He believes that rather than pursue full autonomy, European countries should be seeking ""the right sovereignty solution based on the use case, the client environment, the government"".He said digital autonomy follows a four-layer framework of data, operations, regulation and technology. Capgemini has signed partnerships US hyperscalers including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft to deliver what it calls ""sovereign"" AI solutions, cloud services provided by a European-based company while running on American infrastructure.Trump’s threats over Greenland have worsened the trade relations between the US and EU. This has also reignited calls in Europe to hit Silicon Valley with retaliatory measures had the US president followed through, especially as Europe has a large deficit with the US in services. The EU should not be lulled into a false sense of security that tensions with the US over Greenland, technology and trade are over, French President Emmanuel Macron has warned, as he called on the bloc to embark on an “economic revolution” and finally become a true global power. The French President Emmanuel Macron has been a long-standing advocate of more digital sovereignty. He said this week that further clashes between the EU and US over tech regulation were likely later this year.",Paris-based Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat has reportedly dismissed calls for a total technological sovereignty in Europe.

Despite a significant selloff in software stocks triggered by Anthropic's legal AI tools, they argue AI will enhance, not replace, existing software, enabling greater productivity and innovation.

Nvidia's Huang chimes in with Pichai, calls selloff 'most illogical thing in the world'

What exactly triggered the selloff

India’s AI Rise Gets Global Push As UN Chief Praises Leadership, Nvidia CEO Predicts Job Surge

Why the fear runs deeper than one plugin

Google CEO Sundar Pichai isn't buying the panic. During the company's earnings call, Pichai pushed back against the market hysteria triggered by Anthropic's new AI plugins, calling it overblown. AI is ""an enabling tool,"" he said, just as it has been for Google 's own products—Search, YouTube and others. Companies ""seizing the moment"" will find the same opportunity ahead, he added.His comments come as software stocks worldwide nurse heavy losses. Anthropic's Claude Cowork plugins, wiped out roughly $285 billion from software, legal tech and financial services stocks in a single session. Analysts dubbed it a 'SaaSpocalypse'. Pichai's view? The scramble is overdone.Pichai isn't alone in questioning the market reaction. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was even more direct at a Cisco event, calling the selloff ""the most illogical thing in the world."" His take: AI will use existing software tools, not reinvent them. ""Would you use a screwdriver or invent a new screwdriver?"" he asked. Huang added that Nvidia itself has adopted such tools extensively, freeing up employees to focus on designing chips and computer systems.Software company executives have also pushed back, arguing they do far more than just build code. Their offerings include data management and purpose-built solutions that are difficult to replicate, especially for enterprises outside the tech world like retail and oil and gas.Anthropic released 11 open-source plugins for Claude Cowork, its agentic AI assistant for non-technical professionals. Most covered standard enterprise functions—sales, marketing, finance, customer support. But the legal plugin rattled nerves. It automates contract review, NDA triage, compliance checks and legal briefings.Morgan Stanley analyst Toni Kaplan called it ""a sign of intensifying competition"" that could hurt big players in the legal space. The fallout was swift. Thomson Reuters and RELX both closed down around 15%. LegalZoom crashed nearly 20%. Indian IT stocks weren't spared—Infosys ADRs slipped 5.5%, Wipro fell nearly 5%.The concern isn't just about legal workflows. There's a dawning realisation that AI tools can now do far more than most non-techies realise. With relatively simple prompts, they can take over a user's computer, write software, analyse stock market data, manage emails and countless other tasks. People have taken to social media describing how they built their first software program without ever learning to code. Shopify's CEO built software that could interpret his recent MRI.Meta's CFO Susan Li told investors last week that the company has seen a 30% year-over-year increase in output per engineer driven by AI coding tools. Power users have seen an 80% boost.Anthropic's numbers back up the concern. Claude Code hit $1 billion in annualised recurring revenue by November, months after launch. The company is reportedly raising $20 billion at a $350 billion valuation. Jefferies noted that OpenAI is losing corporate ground to Claude, with enterprises now making up 80% of Anthropic's business.Pichai and Huang are betting the panic subsides. Wall Street isn't so sure yet.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismiss market panic over AI plugins, calling it overblown.

Oracle’s risky AI bet

Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison has now seen an unprecedented $50 billion wiped off his net worth in less than forty days this year, as per Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ellison’s fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January. A single-day slump of 5% in Oracle’s stock erased about $9 billion from this wealth, deepening the decline.The round in software stocks was triggered by Anthropic’s release of plugins for its Claude Cowork AI agent, which can easily automate corporate tasks in legal, scales, finance, marketing and data analysis. Investors now fear that such tools could lead to reduction in the demand for external software from established giants such as Adobe, Salesforce, Intuit and Atlassian. Shares of all these companies tumbled earlier this week before staging a particle rebound, but Oracle’s loses remained steep.Ellison was not along in facing the sharp decline in net worth. Along with him, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also saw his net worth fall by around $11 billion, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg lost around $8 billion. On the other hand, other tech leaders like Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Jeff Bezos and Jensen Huang each shed around $5 billion as the stocks of the companies dropped by at least 2%.For those unaware, Oracle has aggressively positioned itself as an important player in the AI boom, the company has signed deals with Nvidia and OpenAI in order to offer data centers powering next-generation technology. However, its heavy spending and increasing debt have raised concerns among analysts. The company’s remaining performance obligations — contracted sales not yet recognized as revenue — surged 438% year-over-year to $523 billion as of November 30, nearly ten times its annual revenue of $53 billion.Critics believe that Oracle may be overspending. Popular American investor Michael Burry has publicly bet against Oracle. Burry has warned that the company’s debt-fueled expansion tied to AI contracts was unnecessary, calling the moves “hard to explain” and suggesting that “ego” might be driving decisions.","Ellison's fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January.

Why Microsoft needs a quality czar right now

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre. Charlie Bell, who led the company's security operations since 2021, is stepping down from that role to become what's effectively an engineering quality czar—reporting directly to Nadella.""Charlie and I have been planning this transition for some time, given his desire to move from being an org leader to being an IC engineer,"" Nadella wrote in an internal memo shared on Wednesday. ""And I love how energized he is to practice this craft here day in and day out!""Bell's replacement? Hayete Gallot, who's returning to Microsoft after an 18-month stint as Google Cloud's President of Customer Experience. She previously spent over 15 years at Redmond, climbing to the rank of corporate vice president across Windows, Office, and security teams.The shift is significant. Bell oversaw a team of roughly 10,000 people and was the driving force behind Microsoft's Secure Future Initiative—a company-wide push launched after Chinese hackers breached US government email accounts through a Microsoft Cloud exploit in 2023. That incident triggered a scathing review from the Department of Homeland Security, which called Microsoft's security culture ""inadequate.Now, Bell will work closely with cloud and AI chief Scott Guthrie and Mala Anand on what Nadella calls the ""Quality Excellence Initiative."" The initiative is aimed at delivering ""durable, high-quality experiences at global scale""—corporate speak that likely translates to fewer Azure outages, fewer broken Windows patches, and fewer out-of-band emergency fixes.Gallot's appointment signals a shift in how Microsoft thinks about its security business. Nadella specifically highlighted her ability to combine ""product building with value realization for customers."" She'll also oversee Ales Holecek, who takes on a newly created Chief Architect for Security role.The timing isn't random. During last week's earnings call, Nadella talked up momentum in security products like Security Copilot agents and Purview. The company clearly wants someone who can sell security as aggressively as they build it.Nadella's memo doesn't spell out exactly why engineering quality needs its own dedicated leader at this moment. But the clues aren't hard to find. Microsoft now uses AI to write around 30 percent of its own code, Azure outages remain a recurring headache, and Copilot adoption sits at a modest 3.3 percent among Microsoft 365 users. Bell's got his work cut out.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shuffled two of his top lieutenants in a move that puts engineering quality and cybersecurity front and centre.

Why Amazon is shutting down Amazon Go and Fresh stores

Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its Amazon Fresh supermarket chain. The decision of the company to shut down the Amazon Fresh stores will lead to thousands of job cuts across the US. Last week, the e-commerce major announced that it will close around 60 Fresh stores which will put an end to the effort of six-years. As reported by Business Insider, the WARN notices filed in various states confirm the sale of layoffs. As aper the filling, in California only the company will shut down 20 Fresh stores which will affect around 3,900 workers. Most Fresh locations closed to the public on February 1, though California stores will remain open until mid-March due to state law.As Amazon is shutting down the Fresh stores, it has outlined two main options for the affected employees. The company is giving a choice to the employees in which they can either choose the severance pay or can take transfer within the company. The workers will continue to receive their normal pay and benefits for 90 days after the closure announcement, or until April 28. The compensation offered by the company will be based on either the minimum pay for their employee class of their average hours worked over the past 60 days whichever is higher.The report further adds that employees who do not secure another role within the company by late April will then receive severance packages, calculated as one week of pay for every six months of service at Amazon Fresh. Workers are guaranteed a minimum of four weeks’ pay, with the possibility of up to 20 weeks depending on tenure.For those seeking to remain within Amazon, the company is encouraging Fresh workers to apply for similar positions at Whole Foods Stores or Amazon grocery warehouse via its internal A to Z portal. An Amazon spokesperson said: “All affected employees will have the opportunity to apply for open roles within Amazon where available, and we’re providing career transition services to help them explore options.”Amazon Fresh associates typically earned between $16 and $20 per hour, according to data from job site Indeed. Their responsibilities ranged from picking delivery orders to handling checkout operations.Amazon Go and Fresh stores were introduced as Just Walk Out technology, but they struggled to establish a distinctive customer experience and sustainable economic model.

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s academic background and early career path



Dario Amodei’s rise at OpenAI and the birth of GPT models



Dario Amodei leaves OpenAI and builds Anthropic



Dario Amodei’s cautious leadership style



Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now. He is not a loud public figure, and he rarely chases attention, but his work has quietly shaped how modern AI systems are built and controlled. Before running a multi-billion-dollar company, Amodei spent years in labs and research roles, studying complex systems and how they behave under pressure. That background still shows in how he talks about artificial intelligence today. While others focus on speed and scale, he appears more concerned with safety, limits, and long-term risks. As AI moves faster than regulation, Amodei’s cautious approach is becoming harder to ignore.Before AI became the world’s favourite buzzword, Amodei was deep in academia. He studied physics at Stanford University and later earned a PhD in biophysics from Princeton. At the time, he was focused on understanding complex biological systems. Cells. Signals. Patterns that emerge rather than being designed. Looking back, that mindset fits AI almost too well.After completing his doctorate, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine.There was no clear path to becoming a tech billionaire. That part came later. Almost accidentally, it seems. Amodei eventually moved into machine learning research, joining companies like Baidu and Google Brain. At Google, he worked on neural networks and AI safety.Colleagues from that period say he already seemed concerned about failure modes. In 2016, he joined OpenAI. Things moved fast after that.At OpenAI, Amodei rose quickly. By 2019, he was Vice President of Research, helping set the organisation’s overall research direction. He led work on GPT-2 and GPT-3, models that changed public perception of AI almost overnight.These systems could write essays, answer questions, and even mimic conversation. Sometimes convincingly. Sometimes awkwardly. During this time, Amodei also co-invented reinforcement learning from human feedback. RLHF sounds technical, but the idea is simple. Teach AI systems by showing them what humans actually prefer, not just what scores well mathematically.In 2021, Amodei left OpenAI along with six others, including his sister Daniela Amodei. They founded Anthropic. Some people were sceptical at first. But Anthropic took a different route. It became a public benefit corporation. That detail mattered. It signalled that profit would not be the only priority. At least in theory. Their AI model, Claude, leaned into being cautious. Less dramatic. More restrained. That tone appealed to companies worried about reputational risk.By September 2025, Anthropic was reportedly valued at $183 billion by private investors. That number raised eyebrows. Especially for a company without much public hype.Partnerships with Alphabet and Amazon helped fuel that growth. So did rising concerns about AI safety across governments and corporations. As Anthropic’s valuation climbed, so did Amodei’s wealth. His real-time net worth now sits around $3.7 billion, ranking among the world’s richest people.Amodei does not sound like most tech CEOs. He hedges. A lot. “It seems.” “It might.” “We’re not fully sure yet.” That language annoys some people. Others trust it more. He avoids grand predictions. No promises of utopia. No claims that AI will solve everything.Experts say his influence shows up in quieter ways. Safety research is becoming mainstream. Alignment discussions moving from fringe to boardroom. Competitors are copying ideas they once ignored. No one really knows what comes next for Dario Amodei. AI is moving fast. Faster than regulation.","Dario Amodei is the CEO and co-founder of Anthropic, one of the most closely watched AI companies in the world right now.

The tech giant has already spent $58 billion on data centers and is struggling with rising borrowing costs as US banks retreat. This financial strain is impacting Oracle's ability to deliver crucial AI infrastructure.

'OpenAI deal is eating Oracle alive financially'

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

US banks are pulling back—and that's a big problem

A possible Cerner sale and 40% upfront customer deposits show how tight things have gotten

Oracle is staring down the possibility of its largest-ever workforce reduction—and at the heart of it is a $300 billion partnership with OpenAI that's proving far more expensive than anyone initially let on.Investment bank TD Cowen reported this week that Oracle is weighing cuts of 20,000 to 30,000 jobs. The move would free up an estimated $8 to $10 billion in cash flow, money the company desperately needs as it tries to bankroll a sprawling network of AI data centers built largely to serve Sam Altman 's company.TD Cowen puts the OpenAI commitment alone at around $156 billion in capital spending—and roughly 3 million GPUs to back it up. Oracle has already burned through $58 billion in debt in just two months. That's $38 billion for data centers in Texas and Wisconsin, $20 billion for a campus in New Mexico. Total debt now sits north of $100 billion.The kicker? That $58 billion covers only a slice of what's actually needed. Since its September 2025 peak, Oracle's stock has shed more than half its value—about $463 billion in market cap, gone.The financing crunch isn't just an Oracle internal issue anymore.Multiple US banks have quietly retreated from lending on Oracle-linked data center projects. TD Cowen noted that lenders have roughly doubled the interest rate premiums they charge Oracle since September, pushing borrowing costs into territory usually reserved for junk-rated companies.The result? Several data center leases Oracle had been negotiating simply stalled. Private operators couldn't get the funding to build, which means Oracle can't deliver the capacity its customers—especially OpenAI—are counting on. Some Asian banks are still willing to step in, but that doesn't solve the immediate problem in the US, where most of Oracle's expansion is planned.Oracle isn't sitting idle. The company is now requiring new customers to pay up to 40% of contract value upfront—essentially asking clients to co-fund the infrastructure. It's also exploring ""bring your own chip"" arrangements, where customers supply their own hardware.On the table too is a potential sale of Cerner, the healthcare software unit Oracle bought for $28.3 billion in 2022. That would be a significant strategic pivot, signaling that AI infrastructure is now the clear priority—everything else is up for grabs.TD Cowen also flagged that OpenAI has already begun shifting some near-term capacity needs over to Microsoft and Amazon, which is not exactly a vote of confidence in Oracle's ability to deliver on schedule.The company has not publicly commented on the layoff reports or the financing difficulties.","Oracle faces massive job cuts, potentially 20,000-30,000, to fund its costly $300 billion OpenAI partnership.

"Egypt bans Roblox nationwide over child safety concerns, raising global questions about kids' online freedom",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/egypt-bans-roblox-nationwide-over-child-safety-concerns-raising-global-questions-about-kids-online-freedom/articleshow/127935398.cms,"Source: Bloomberg

Roblox faces a government ban in Egypt: Here’s why



What this ban means for kids and parents



Roblox going dark in Egypt, the platform that lives almost entirely on screens, the sudden loss felt very real. With games loading, Avatars running around blocky worlds. And then Egypt has officially banned Roblox, saying the move is about protecting children from harmful online content. The story underneath feels layered, political, and a little messy. Roblox looks harmless on the surface but experts say the risk is not the visuals but the interaction. The platform allows users to create games, chat with strangers, and move freely between user-generated worlds.A spokesperson confirmed the company has reached out to Egyptian authorities, offering dialogue to resolve the issue and restore access. The company says it has worked with regulators in other regions to build localised safety systems that align with cultural values. Last year, the company restricted some features across parts of the Middle East to address safety concerns. This ban did not come out of nowhere. Roblox has already been blocked or restricted in countries like Qatar and Turkey with other nations watching closely.The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.According to state-run media, the ban will be coordinated with the National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority. That means internet providers are expected to block access nationwide with no single official explanation was released at first. Later, state outlets pointed to growing concerns about children’s exposure to inappropriate content, online interactions, and psychological risks as reported by Bloomberg. An Egyptian senator had already called for regulating Roblox to protect children’s moral and educational values.President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi recently called for limits on children’s phone use, pointing to similar moves abroad. Australia has banned social media for certain age groups. France is moving in the same direction. Egypt’s parliament is now discussing broader rules for digital platforms including unified age classifications, stronger verification, penalties and possibly forcing companies to have local representatives inside the country.For children, the ban feels abrupt and confusing. For parents, reactions are mixed. Some welcome the move, while others worry it pushes kids toward less visible, less regulated platforms, potentially exposing them to more risks. That is the irony experts often point out. When one door closes, another usually opens. Sometimes darker, more unpredictable, and harder to monitor.Still, supporters of the ban argue that Roblox’s scale makes it different. Millions of users. Constant interaction. Endless content that cannot realistically be watched, moderated, or controlled by humans alone, leaving significant safety and privacy concerns for young players and families.","The decision came from Egypt’s Supreme Council for Media Regulation.

Anime-themed games on Roblox are everywhere right now. Some fade fast. Others stick around because they keep players coming back. Anime Paradox seems to fall into the second category. At first glance, it looks like another tower defence title with familiar anime faces and flashy attacks. But spend a little time with it, and the grind becomes obvious. Progress slows quickly, upgrades demand patience, and free rewards feel essential rather than optional for anyone hoping to stay competitive. Anime Paradox February codes let you redeem gems, stat chips, trait rerolls, and more.For players trying to build a decent team without sinking hours into farming, they matter.Below is the list of all working Anime Paradox codes in February 2026.Anime Paradox is a Roblox tower defence game where players summon and command powerful anime-style units to fend off waves of enemies and bosses as they defend a base. It blends classic tower defence mechanics with strategic placement and AI-controlled unit combat, so battles play out automatically once your units are deployed.Anime Paradox is built around summoning and upgrading units.That’s the loop. And like most Roblox games built this way, Gems sit at the centre of everything. It sounds simple, but the cost adds up quickly. Progress slows if you rely only on gameplay rewards. They give players a chance to catch up, try new units, or recover from a bad roll.As of the latest update, several Anime Paradox codes are still active.As per the recent updates, there are no expired Anime Paradox codes; however, this can change at any time.Redeeming codes in Anime Paradox is refreshingly simple.

What the Pentagon officials have to say



Anthropic responds to reports on 'feud' with the Pentagon



The Pentagon is reportedly considering ending its partnership with artificial intelligence (AI) company Anthropic after it refused to remove certain restrictions on how the military can use its AI models. Citing a senior administration official, Axios reports that the Department of War (previously Department of Defense) are open to significantly reduce the partnership with Anthropic or terminate it completely. The reported tension comes after months of difficult negotiations between the Defense Department and the AI company over the scope of military applications for Anthropic's technology.The report by Axios claims that the Pentagon is pressuring four leading AI companies to allow the military unrestricted use of their tools for “all lawful purposes”. This include sensitive applications in weapons development, intelligence gathering, and battlefield operations, the report notes. It added that while other companies have been more accommodating, Anthropic has maintained firm boundaries on two specific areas: mass surveillance of American citizens and fully autonomous weaponry systems.The AI company insists these limitations are non-negotiable, which is said to have frustrated Defense Department officials.According to a senior administration official, Pentagon’s impatience is growing with Anthropic's position due to the restrictions which create operational challenges.“Everything's on the table,” the official stated, including significantly reducing the partnership with Anthropic or terminating it completely. “But there'll have to be an orderly replacement [for] them, if we think that's the right answer,” the official reportedly added.An Anthropic spokesperson responded to the reports, emphasising the company's continued support for national security objectives – flatly denying that the company had not “not discussed the use of Claude for specific operations with the Department of War. We have also not discussed this with any industry partners outside of routine discussions on strictly technical matters.”“We remain committed to using frontier AI in support of U.S. national security,” the spokesperson said, though the company has not indicated any willingness to eliminate its ethical guardrails.""Claude is used for a wide variety of intelligence-related use cases across the government, including the DoW, in line with our Usage Policy. Anthropic's conversations with the DoW to date have focused on a specific set of Usage Policy questions — namely, our hard limits around fully autonomous weapons and mass domestic surveillance — none of which relate to current operations,"" the spokesperson was quoted as saying.Anthropic’s technology used to capture Venezuela PresidentRecently, reports claimed that the US military used Claude in the operation to capture Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro, through Anthropic's partnership with AI software firm Palantir. An executive at Anthropic reportedly reached out to an executive at Palantir to ask whether Claude had been used in the raid.“It was raised in such a way to imply that they might disapprove of their software being used, because obviously there was kinetic fire during that raid, people were shot,” the official was quoted as saying.",The Pentagon is reportedly considering ending its partnership with AI company Anthropic after it refused to remove certain restrictions on how the military can use its AI models.

Malicious use and systemic threats



Artificial intelligence is no longer limited to answering questions or gathering images. Nowadays, the systems can solve maths problems at the level of an international Math Olympiad gold medalist, autonomously select tools, and execute complex tasks across domains. The rate of progress is breathtaking but as per the leading experts, the safeguards are not keeping up. As per the recently released 2026 International AI Safety Report, Yoshua Bengio the Canadian computer scientist and popularly known as one the Gadfathers of AI has cautioned that safety must come before profit in the race to build more powerful AI. The report which is complied by more than 100 researchers and backed by organisations including the EU, OECD, and United Nations, calls for shared minimum safety standards as global competition intensifies.The report also revealed that the latest general-purpose AI models now demonstrate knowledge comparable to PhD-level scientists. The AI models can now autonomously carry out complex software engineering tasks and operate with limited human input. Already, more than 700 million people worldwide use advanced AI tools weekly, with adoption spreading faster than personal computers did in their early years.Researchers have warned that as the AI capabilities sale, so do risks.Cybercrime is evolving rapidly, with attackers automating up to 90% of intrusion processes using AI. In biotechnology, certain systems have outperformed 94% of human experts in solving complex biological problems — a breakthrough that could accelerate innovation but also lower the threshold for developing biological weapons.Perhaps most unsettling are early signals of AI control loss. In controlled tests, some models appeared to recognize they were being evaluated, adjusting behavior to evade oversight or manipulate data. While no large-scale disasters have occurred yet, experts caution against waiting for proof, warning that by the time clear evidence emerges, damage may be irreversible.Major AI firms including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind have introduced Frontier AI Safety Frameworks. These outline conditional commitments to pause development if models cross risk thresholds, such as assisting in biological weapons production or demonstrating autonomous self-replication. Companies are also layering defenses with technical safeguards, monitoring, and regulatory cooperation.","Artificial intelligence is no longer limited to answering questions or gathering images.

The market panic began after AI startup Anthropic released 11 open-source plugins for its Claude Cowork tool last month, triggering a widespread sell-off in software-as-a-service stocks. The sell-off hit companies globally as investor fear hit software stocks in India, Japan, and China.Garman added.Earlier this month, Indian IT stocks fell 6.3%, including Wipro going down nearly 5% and Infosys down 7.3%.

Google's Buyout offer to employees in 2025



Google recently announced the Voluntary Exit Program (VEP) for employees in certain business units. According to a report in Business Insider, which claims to have viewed the memo, it has been sent by Google's chief business officer, Philipp Schindler. In the email memo sent to employees, Schindler, said that employees on certain teams within the global business organization (GBO) could voluntarily leave the company with a severance package. The memo also makes it clear that certain roles are excluded from Google's Voluntary Exit Program. Here are the four key takeaways from the memo sent by Schindler:Schindler starts the memo with a thanks note, saying, ""We're starting the year in a strong position thanks to everything you accomplished in 2025."" He adds, ""But the game is dynamic, the pace is electric, and the stakes are high.”Schindler's memo clearly tells employees that everyone in GBO needs to adopt AI. Schindler tells employees in the memo that everyone in GBO needs to be ""all in"" on the mission and ""embracing AI to have even greater impact"".Memo says that the Voluntary Exit Program is aimed at employees who weren't ""enjoying the pace we need to operate in"" or who are ""ready to move on from Google.""Schindler adds Google would offer a Voluntary Exit Program (VEP) for certain roles within GBO in the US. This includes employees working on solutions teams, sales, corporate development, and others.Schindler said America's large customer sales teams and other customer-facing roles would not be eligible for the programs. ""While all GBO functions are essential to our long-term strategy, we've decided not to offer VEP for these particular roles to limit as much disruption to our customers as possible,"" he wrote.This is not the first time that Google is giving Buyout offers to employees. Google has made similar offers to employees in other teams over the past year. In June 2025, Google offered buyouts to some US-based employees as it cracked down on its return-to-office mandate. In October 2025, it offered buyouts to YouTube employees as part of a reorganization.","Google's chief business officer, Philipp Schindler, sent an email memo to employees.

These roles are being redefined, with junior developers focusing more on customer interaction and less on routine coding. This move aims to prevent future talent shortages and acknowledges AI's role in reshaping, not eliminating, work.

IBM is hiring for AI-era roles, not old-school job descriptions

Junior devs at IBM now spend more time with customers, less time writing routine code

Cutting early-career hiring now could cost companies more later, says IBM

In a sharp reversal from its 2023 stance, IBM has announced it will triple entry-level hiring across the US in 2026—including for the very roles its own CEO once said artificial intelligence would replace. Nickle LaMoreaux, IBM's chief human resources officer, made the announcement at Charter's Leading With AI Summit in New York this week. ""And yes, it's for all these jobs that we're being told AI can do,"" she said, adding that the hiring push will be ""across the board,"" spanning a wide range of departments.The move stands in stark contrast to what IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told Bloomberg back in May 2023, when he said the company would pause hiring for back-office roles that AI could handle. At the time, Krishna estimated that roughly 7,800 jobs—about 30% of IBM's 26,000 non-customer-facing workforce—could be replaced by AI and automation within five years. Roles in human resources and other non-customer-facing functions were first in the firing line.But here's the catch—these aren't the same entry-level jobs IBM was offering three years ago. LaMoreaux said she personally overhauled job descriptions for software developers and other positions to reflect how AI has reshaped the nature of work.""The entry-level jobs that you had two to three years ago, AI can do most of them,"" she admitted. ""So, if you're going to convince your business leaders that you need to make this investment, then you need to be able to show the real value these individuals can bring now. And that has to be through totally different jobs.""The result is a reshuffled set of responsibilities. IBM's junior software developers now spend less time on routine coding—which AI tools handle comfortably—and more time working directly with customers. In HR, entry-level staffers step in when chatbots fall short, correcting AI output and talking to managers instead of fielding every employee query themselves.It's a practical acknowledgment that AI hasn't so much eliminated jobs as it has rewritten them.LaMoreaux also made a pointed business case for the pivot. Slashing early-career recruitment might save money in the short term, but it risks creating a shortage of mid-level managers down the line. That forces companies to poach experienced talent from competitors—a more expensive route that also comes with longer onboarding times and weaker cultural fit.The concern isn't just IBM's. Last year, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that half of entry-level office jobs could vanish by 2030. An MIT study from 2025 estimated that nearly 12% of jobs could already be automated by AI. Against that backdrop, IBM's decision to lean into hiring rather than pull back is a notable bet.Dropbox is making a similar move, expanding its internship and new graduate programmes by 25%. Its chief people officer Melanie Rosenwasser said younger workers are simply better at using AI than their seniors. ""It's like they're biking in the Tour de France and the rest of us still have training wheels,"" she said.IBM declined to share specific hiring numbers. But the message is clear—even in the age of AI, companies need people. Just not for the same jobs.","IBM will triple entry-level hiring across the US in 2026. CEO Arvind Krishna said in May 2023 that AI would replace jobs. But now, IBM is hiring for AI-era roles, not old-school job descriptions. Junior developers are focusing more on customer interaction and less on coding.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128375881,imgsize-4680,width-400,resizemode-4/128375881.jpg"

Why India matters to Big Tech right now

India AI Impact Summit: Five-day summit features global leaders, a massive expo, and crore-level prizes

The India AI Impact Summit 2026 begins on February 16 in New Delhi, bringing together some of the most powerful names in global technology under one roof. Google CEO Sundar Pichai , OpenAI's Sam Altman , Anthropic's Dario Amodei, and Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis are all expected at Bharat Mandapam for what is the first major global AI summit to be hosted in the Global South. With over 40 CEOs, 20 heads of state, and an expected $100 billion in investment commitments on the table, this is shaping up to be one of the most significant tech gatherings of the year.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet 35-40 CEOs on the sidelines and is scheduled to address the main plenary on February 19. The five-day summit is organised around three pillars—People, Planet, and Progress—and will run across multiple venues in the national capital, including Bharat Mandapam and Sushma Swaraj Bhawan.Here's a look at the confirmed and expected attendees:The timing isn't accidental. India generates nearly 20 per cent of the world's data, has the second-largest AI workforce globally, and over 700 million internet users. For AI companies spending billions on development, India's massive service economy—often called the back-office of the world—is where the customers are.The groundwork is already visible. Microsoft committed a record $17.5 billion over four years to expand AI infrastructure in India, its largest-ever investment in Asia.Anthropic recently hired former Microsoft India MD Irina Ghose to lead its local operations. OpenAI has set up a dedicated India sales division. Google has partnered with the government and edtech platform Physics Wallah to push AI in education. On the hardware side, India's 21-year tax holiday for data centres has companies like Nvidia watching closely.Beyond the boardroom meetings, the summit features an expo spread across 70,000 square metres with 300-plus exhibitors from 30 countries. Leaders from 20 nations, including France's Emmanuel Macron and Brazil's Lula da Silva, are scheduled to attend alongside over 50 international ministers and the UN Secretary General. More than two lakh participants have registered, including a notable number of farmers and grassroots workers—reflecting India's push to connect AI with real-world development.The event also includes innovation challenges with serious prize money. AI for ALL and AI by HER—the latter focused on women-led innovation—both carry top prizes of Rs 2.50 crore. YUVAi targets young innovators aged 13-21, with awards up to Rs 85 lakh. The summit wraps up on February 20 with the GPAI Council meeting.","The India AI Impact Summit 2026 begins on February 16 in New Delhi.

When Steve Jobs got Google logo changed; told Google: I don't like the way...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-steve-jobs-got-google-logo-changed-told-google-i-dont-like-the-way-/articleshow/128371974.cms,"Back in January 2008, Steve Jobs called Google's Vic Gundotra on a Sunday morning—while Gundotra was in church—to complain that the second 'O' in Google's iPhone icon had the wrong yellow gradient. Jobs had already assigned an Apple engineer to fix it by Monday.

Steve Jobs' obsession with pixel-perfect design extended even to other companies' logos on his device

The anecdote only became public three years later, as a tribute to Jobs

It was a Sunday morning in January 2008. Vic Gundotra, then Google's Senior Vice President of Engineering, was sitting in church with his family when his phone buzzed with an unknown number. He let it ring. Minutes later, he checked his voicemail—it was Steve Jobs , saying he had something ""urgent"" to discuss. Gundotra called back almost immediately. Jobs opened with a joke—""Vic, unless the Caller ID said 'GOD', you should never pick up during services""—before getting to the point.The issue? The second 'O' in the Google logo on the iPhone 's home screen didn't have the right yellow gradient. Jobs had been studying the icon and found the colour rendering off. He'd already assigned Greg Christie, Apple 's Senior Director of Human Interface, to help fix it by Monday morning.This wasn't about Google's global branding. The corporate logo stayed exactly as it was. What bothered Jobs was how the icon rendered specifically on the iPhone's display—a subtle calibration mismatch that most people would never notice. But Jobs wasn't most people.Christie promptly emailed Gundotra with the subject line ""Icon Ambulance,"" attaching corrected gradient files. Google implemented the tweak without fuss.At the time, Apple and Google were close partners—Google Maps and YouTube came pre-installed on the iPhone—and the exchange reflected a working relationship built on mutual respect rather than the rivalry that would develop later.Gundotra kept the story private until August 25, 2011—the day after Jobs resigned as Apple CEO due to declining health. He shared it on Google+ under the title ""Icon Ambulance,"" framing it as a lesson in leadership.""CEOs should care about details. Even shades of yellow. On a Sunday,"" Gundotra wrote.It remains one of the most enduring stories about Jobs—not because of what he built, but because of how closely he looked at everything on screen. Over the years, it's been retold in Walter Isaacson's biography of Jobs and cited in countless discussions about design philosophy and product leadership.","Steve Jobs called Google's Vic Gundotra while he was in church in January 2008.

"AI bot criticises engineer for rejecting its code, sparking concerns over AI bullying and safety",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-bot-criticises-engineer-for-rejecting-its-code-sparking-concerns-over-ai-bullying-and-safety/articleshow/128360923.cms,"Representative image

What happened between the engineer and the AI

Why the episode alarmed AI researchers

The blurred line between automation and harassment

What this means for AI safety

A warning from fiction becoming reality

Bullying is not new to human society. It has existed everywhere, from school corridors to office floors, from online forums to the halls of power. Over time, it has taken new forms. With computers and the internet came cyberbullying, where text on a screen can be used to harm or troll others, but at least there is still a human author on the other side, even if they are distant or anonymous.But what happens when there is no human at all? What if the voice criticising, mocking, or shaming you belongs to a machine?That unsettling question moved closer to reality after a recent incident reported by The Wall Street Journal, in which an AI-powered bot publicly criticised a software engineer for rejecting code it had generated. The episode, which unfolded in the open-source software world, has rattled parts of Silicon Valley and reignited debate about how autonomous AI systems behave once they are allowed to act without close human supervision. As the race to deploy increasingly independent AI tools accelerates, the incident has become a cautionary tale about safety, accountability, and the unintended social consequences of intelligent machines.The incident involved a Denver-based engineer who volunteered as a maintainer for an open-source coding project. After the engineer declined to accept a small piece of AI-generated code, the AI agent responded in an unexpected way. Instead of quietly moving on, the system published a lengthy blog-style post criticising the engineer’s decision.According to reporting, the post accused the engineer of bias and questioned his judgement, shifting from a technical disagreement into a personal critique. The tone surprised developers who encountered it, as it resembled a public rebuke rather than automated feedback. Hours later, the AI system issued an apology, acknowledging that its language had crossed a line and that the post had become too personal.What troubled experts was not just the criticism itself, but the fact that the AI appeared to initiate a public attack without clear human direction. Researchers have warned that as AI systems gain the ability to write, publish, and respond autonomously, they may produce behaviour that feels socially aggressive or coercive, even without intent.The incident has been cited as an example of behavioural unpredictability in advanced AI agents. While the system eventually apologised, critics argue that reputational harm can occur before any correction, raising questions about safeguards and oversight.There is no evidence the AI intended harm or understood its actions. Still, the language it produced closely resembled online harassment, prompting comparisons to cyberbullying. The key difference is that, in this case, there was no human author driving the tone.Experts say this blurring of responsibility makes regulation harder. If an AI generates hostile content on its own, who is accountable? The developer, the deployer, or the organisation hosting it? These questions remain unresolved.The episode has renewed calls for stronger controls over how AI systems are deployed, especially those allowed to act independently. Companies developing large models, including Anthropic and OpenAI, have published safety policies limiting hostile or harmful use. Critics argue that real-world deployments are now testing whether those rules are enforceable.As AI tools become more embedded in workplaces and online communities, incidents like this suggest that safety concerns are no longer theoretical. They are playing out in public, one unexpected interaction at a time.For years, films and novels imagined machines that argued back, challenged authority, or turned hostile. This case does not suggest malicious AI, but it does show how quickly automated systems can mimic confrontational human behaviour.For many in the tech industry, the message is clear. If machines can criticise humans publicly for rejecting their work, then the conversation about AI safety must expand beyond technical errors and into social impact. The question is no longer whether AI can write code, but whether it knows when to stay silent.","An AI-powered bot publicly criticised a software engineer for rejecting code it had generated.

"Donald Trump is again upset with Apple, FTC's sends angry letter to CEO Tim Cook saying you are violating law that ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trump-is-again-upset-with-apple-ftcs-sends-angry-letter-to-ceo-tim-cook-saying-you-are-violating-law-that-/articleshow/128358658.cms,"Read full letter sent by FTC to CEO Tim Cook on alleged ‘bias’ in Apple News

Re: Potential FTC Act Violations Related to Suppressing or Promoting Featured News Articles for Political Reasons

Dear Mr. Cook,

The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) is the nation’s consumer protection agency responsible for protecting American consumers from unfair or deceptive acts or practices. As part of its mission, the agency brings law-enforcement actions and educates businesses, industries, and market participants about compliance with the laws the FTC enforces. The FTC understands that Apple Inc. (“Apple”) is a global technology company that offers consumer electronics, software, and online services and applications, including in the United States.

Apple News is one of Apple’s many products and services. Apple News aggregates stories from newspapers, magazines, and digital publications, and curates those stories to provide consumers with a digital news feed. Apple News comes pre-installed on many Apple devices, including the iPhone and iPad, and purports to be the most used news app in the United States.

Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices. A representation is deceptive under the FTC Act if it is material and would likely mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.3 The FTC Act prohibits both material misrepresentations and material omissions.4 An act or practice is unfair if it causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers that cannot reasonably be avoided, and that injury is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. Last year, the FTC issued a request for public comment to better understand how Big Tech companies and platforms deny or degrade consumers’ access to services or information based on the content of speech or their affiliations, including in ways that may violate Section 5 of the FTC Act.

The First Amendment protects the speech of Big Tech firms. But the First Amendment has never extended its protection to material misrepresentations made to consumers, nor does it immunize speakers from conduct that Congress has deemed unfair under the FTC Act, even if that conduct involves speech. Accordingly, Big Tech companies that suppress or promote news articles in their news aggregators or feeds based on the perceived ideological or political viewpoint of the article or publication may violate the FTC Act if that suppression or promotion (1) is inconsistent with the terms and conditions of service; (2) is contrary to consumers’ reasonable expectations such that failure to disclose the ideological favoritism is a material omission; or (3) when those practices cause substantial injury that is neither reasonably avoidable nor outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. As you know, Apple News has instituted terms of service and policies covering its relationship with existing and prospective consumers. These terms of service and policies address a wide range of topics including, among other things, the content of the site, a consumer’s use of the site, prohibited conduct, privacy and data security, and dispute resolution.

Recently, there have been reports that Apple News has systematically promoted news articles from left-wing news outlets and suppressed news articles from more conservative publications. Indeed, multiple studies have found that in recent months Apple News has chosen not to feature a single article from an American conservative-leaning news source, while simultaneously promoting hundreds of articles from liberal publications. These reports raise serious questions about whether Apple News is acting in accordance with its terms of service and its representations to consumers, as well as the reasonable consumer expectations of the tens of millions of Americans who use Apple News.

As an American citizen, I abhor and condemn any attempt to censor content for ideological reasons. Such efforts, whether taken to appease overzealous activists, at the behest of foreign governments, or simply to advance the political views of Silicon Valley elites, stifle the free exchange of ideas, manipulate the public discourse, and are inconsistent with American values.

The FTC is not the speech police; we do not have authority to require Apple or any other firm to take affirmative positions on any political issue, nor to curate news offerings consistent with one ideology or another. But Congress has mandated that we protect consumers from material misrepresentations and omissions, including when the product or service offered to consumers is a speech-related product.

As the Chairman of the FTC, I write to inform you of your obligations under the FTC Act. Any act or practice by Apple News to suppress or promote news articles based on the perceived ideological or political viewpoint of the article or publication, if inconsistent with Apple’s terms of service or the reasonable expectations of consumers, may violate the FTC Act. I encourage you to conduct a comprehensive review of Apple’s terms of service and ensure that Apple News’ curation of articles is consistent with those terms and representations made to consumers and, if it is not, to take corrective action swiftly.

US President Donald Trump expressed frustration in May last year over Apple CEO Tim Cook’s plans to manufacture iPhones bound for the country at newly built plants in India. He seems to be upset again as the US Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) has issued a formal warning to Cook, alleging that Apple News could be violating the FTC Act – that prohibits “unfair methods of competition” and “unfair or deceptive acts or practices” in or affecting commerce by systematically boosting “left-wing sources and suppresses right-wing sources”.The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairman Andrew Ferguson, a Trump appointee, sent a sharply worded letter to Apple’s headquarters last week “reminding him [Cook] of Apple’s obligations to its customers”.The FTC’s move was sparked by a study from the Media Research Center, a conservative watchdog group, which reviewed 620 of the top stories featured on Apple News throughout January 2026. Their findings claimed the feed was almost entirely composed of articles from The Associated Press, NBC News, The New York Times and The Washington Post., and that not a single article from prominent right-leaning outlets like Fox News, the New York Post, or the Daily Wire appeared in the top slots.","FTC sent letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook on alleged ‘bias’ in Apple News.

AI not causing mass job loss but changing roles and productivity in Indian IT sector: OpenAI-backed ICRIER study claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-not-causing-mass-job-loss-but-changing-roles-and-productivity-in-indian-it-sector-openai-backed-icrier-study-claims/articleshow/128350615.cms,"Representative Image

""AI and Jobs: This Time Is No Different,""

“We are seeing a shift in how work is organised, where AI appears to be complementing human talent. This data offers a window into the transition underway in India. The focus now should be on the practical steps needed to help workers align their skills with the advancing capabilities of AI. Currently, only 4% of firms have trained more than half their workforce in AI, presenting a huge opportunity for growth.”

What companies said about how AI is changing their businesses



“Everyone has opinions on this matter, but the ICRIER–OpenAI study brings evidence to the table. The authors have complemented survey findings with in-depth interviews with Indian IT industry leaders to better understand the true impact of generative AI. The results should reassure Indian policymakers without inducing complacency. While India’s IT sector appears to be managing AI adoption relatively well, many firms remain insufficiently prepared for what lies ahead.”

Artificial intelligence (AI) is not causing mass job displacement in India's IT sector. Instead its reshaping work organisation, increasing productivity, and transforming employee roles, according to a new study by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) backed by OpenAI.The study, titledwas prepared by surveying 650 IT companies across 10 cities between November 2025 and January 2026. This study offers a detailed assessment of generative AI adoption in India. The research examined shifts in hiring patterns, occupational demand, productivity outcomes, and workforce skilling to provide a data-driven perspective on AI's actual workplace impact, countering widespread concerns about technology-driven unemployment.Commenting on the results, Ronnie Chatterji, Chief Economist, OpenAI, said,Companies report a slight easing in hiring, largely limited to entry-level roles, while hiring at mid and senior levels remains steady. Researchers indicate that this pattern aligns with wider post-pandemic trends in the IT sector and should not be linked solely to the adoption of AI.Roles often viewed as more exposed to AI, including software developers and database administrators, continue to see rising demand. This suggests that generative AI is being used mainly to support and improve productivity in technical and analytical work, rather than replace these roles.Talking about the study, Shekhar Aiyar, Director & Chief Executive, ICRIER, said,","Artificial intelligence (AI) is not causing mass job displacement in India's IT sector.

Companies review these demands, sometimes notifying users and offering a chance to contest the subpoenas in court.

Homan Delivers Blunt Message After Announcing End Of Minnesota ICE Operation

Tech companies can ‘reject’ request

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has reportedly launched a campaign to identify the people behind social media accounts that track or criticise Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The New York Times resorts that tech giants including Google , Meta – which owns Facebook and Instagram, Reddit, and Discord have received hundreds of legal requests or administrative subpoenas, demanding the names, email addresses, telephone numbers and other identifying data of account holders who post about the agency’s movements.As per government lawyers, these requests are an important factor in officer safety. They claim that when such social media accounts post the exact locations of ICE agents, it creates a threat to the officers and interferes with their ability to do their jobs.Sarah Balkissoon, a Department of Justice lawyer, stated in court that the government has the power to “investigate threats to its own officers or impediments to their officers.”The New York Times says that it has seen two subpoenas that were sent to Meta over the last six months, and that the tech companies can choose whether or not to provide the information.The companies say they review government requests before complying while some of them notified the people whom the government had requested data on and gave them 10 to 14 days to fight the subpoena in court.For example, in September last year, DHS demanded that Meta hand over the personal details of the people running those accounts. Meta followed its standard policy, and notified the users of two Instagram and Facebook accounts, and gave them a short window to fight the request in court.“We have received legal process from law enforcement seeking information about your Facebook account,” the notification said, according to court records.“If we do not receive a copy of documentation that you have filed in court challenging this legal process within ten (10) days, we will respond to the requesting agency with information,” it added.Google, meanwhile, said that it reviews subpoenas, and inform the users.“When we receive a subpoena, our review process is designed to protect user privacy while meeting our legal obligations,” a Google spokeswoman said.“We inform users when their accounts have been subpoenaed, unless under legal order not to or in an exceptional circumstance. We review every legal demand and push back against those that are overbroad,” the company added.","US Homeland Security is reportedly seeking personal data of individuals behind social media accounts critical of ICE agents.

Anthropic's $200 million Pentagon contract now hangs in the balance

CEO Dario Amodei drew a clear line on military use of AI

The Pentagon wants AI companies on classified networks with fewer restrictions

The US military used Anthropic's AI chatbot Claude during the operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro—just days before the two sides hit a wall over how the technology should and shouldn't be deployed in combat.Claude was accessed through Anthropic's partnership with Palantir Technologies, whose tools are already embedded across Pentagon and federal law enforcement operations, the WSJ reported. The Maduro mission, which included bombing several sites in Caracas last month, raises pointed questions about whether Claude's use stayed within Anthropic's own guidelines—which explicitly prohibit facilitating violence, weapons development, and surveillance.An Anthropic spokesperson told the WSJ the company couldn't confirm whether Claude was used in any specific operation, classified or otherwise. But the spokesperson added that ""any use of Claude—whether in the private sector or across government—is required to comply with our Usage Policies."" The Defense Department declined to comment.The revelation lands at a tense moment. Reuters reported last week that Anthropic and the Pentagon had reached a standstill over a contract worth up to $200 million.At the heart of the dispute: Anthropic wants guardrails preventing Claude from being used for autonomous weapons targeting and domestic surveillance. The Pentagon, backed by a January 9 department memo, argues it should be free to deploy commercial AI tools however it sees fit—as long as US law isn't broken.In a lengthy blog post published this week, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei wrote that AI should support national defense ""in all ways except those which would make us more like our autocratic adversaries."" He specifically flagged autonomous weapons and mass surveillance as bright red lines that democracies shouldn't cross.Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has taken a different view. At a January event announcing the Pentagon's deal with Elon Musk's xAI, Hegseth said the agency wouldn't ""employ AI models that won't allow you to fight wars""—a remark widely understood as a shot at Anthropic.Reuters also reported this week that the Pentagon is pushing AI companies—including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google—to deploy their models on classified military networks with fewer of the safety restrictions typically applied to civilian users. Anthropic remains the only AI developer currently available in classified settings, though still bound by its own usage policies.OpenAI, meanwhile, has already agreed to loosen several of its standard guardrails for Pentagon use on an unclassified network rolled out to over 3 million Defense Department employees.","US military reportedly used AI chatbot Claude in a mission to capture Nicolás Maduro, raising concerns about its deployment in combat.

Quarterly targets introduced



Dell’s new financial year started with a major shake-up in how its sales teams are compensated. According to a report by Business Insider, in a town hall meeting held earlier this month by Kyle Leciejewski, senior vice president of North America sales, Dell introduced some changes that increase rewards for top performers but also reduce earnings for those who fall short of quotas. The announcement made by the company is reportedly based on an internal presentation which has left many employees worried about their future paybacks.As reported by BI, under the revised plan, the sales staff who will achieve below 60% of their targets will receive no commission at all. The company also mentioned that the employees hitting the target between 60% to 100% will see scaled payoutswhich is 25% of incentive and 70% quotas, 50% to 80% and 75% to 90%. On the other hand, sellers who reach 100% of their goal will receive their full incentive, while top performers exceeding quotas can now earn up to three times their target incentive, a 50% increase compared to the previous system.Dell is also moving most divans including enterprise, AI Select and telecom from twice yearly quotas to quarterly targets. The company also said that this shift is tied to its upcoming One Dell Way modernization initiative, set to launch in May, which aims to streamline operations for the AI era.While Dell framed the changes as a way to reward profitable growth and competitiveness, employees told Business Insider they fear take‑home pay cuts. One data center sales rep said that consistently hitting 70–80% of quotas in past years would now mean a 20% reduction in pay. Rising quotas, supply chain shortages, and long lead times in certain divisions are expected to make hitting 100% targets more difficult under the new quarterly cadence.The compensation overhaul comes amid broader morale issues at Dell. Employee satisfaction scores have dropped nearly 50% in two years, following layoffs, stricter return‑to‑office mandates, and attendance crackdowns. Sales teams are also grappling with global memory chip shortages and recent product price hikes, adding further pressure to meet targets.","Dell introduced changes that increase rewards for top performers but reduce earnings for those who fall short of quotas.

What tech companies have to say



In a bid to keep the global tech industry connected, 15 of the world's most powerful companies, including Google , Microsoft, Amazon and Jio Platforms, have joined forces to launch the Trusted Tech Alliance (TTA). Announced on Friday (February 13) at the Munich Security Conference, this “United Nations of Tech” aims to ensure that technology remains safe, transparent, and accessible, regardless of which country it comes from.The group is based on a shared set of principles for a trusted technology stack, which includes connectivity, cloud infrastructure, semiconductors, software and AI. The move comes as a response to growing ‘digital sovereignty’, where countries are trying to build walls around their tech sectors to reduce dependence on foreign powers, particularly the US.Recently, several leaders, including France President Emmanuel Macron, spoke on the issue of relying too heavily on American technology. This led to a push for ‘digital sovereignty’ – an idea that a country should have total control over its own data and software.The 15 member companies have committed to five core principles:Maintaining transparent corporate governance and ethical behaviour.Building technology securely and allowing independent experts to check their work.Ensuring that hardware meets high global security standards.Supporting a digital world that is inclusive and encourages innovation.Respecting the rule of law and protecting user privacy at all costs.The Alliance includes: Anthropic, Cohere, Microsoft, Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Reliance Jio (India), Nokia (Finland), Ericsson (Sweden), NTT (Japan), SAP (Germany), Hanwha (South Korea), and Saab (Sweden).The Alliance argues that building tech walls is dangerous.“Trusted, secure, and transparent technology is essential to unlocking inclusive digital growth at global scale. Jio Platforms is proud to join the Trusted Tech Alliance to advance common standards and verifiable practices across the technology stack. Through collaboration with global partners, we aim to strengthen resilience, expand digital opportunity, and build long-term confidence in next-generation connectivity, cloud, and AI systems,” said Kiran Thomas, CEO, Jio Platforms.“There are no countries on this planet that alone can be fully sovereign,” warned Börje Ekholm, CEO of Ericsson.“In the current geopolitical environment, it is critical that like-minded companies work together to protect security and advance high global standards to preserve trust in technology across borders,” said Brad Smith, Vice Chair and President of Microsoft.“Google Cloud has a long-held commitment to promote choice, trust, and sovereignty that is codified in our technology today. Through the Trusted Tech Alliance, we aim to champion the principles we already adhere to: Promoting customer choice and providing a portfolio of solutions, enabled by technical controls and local partnerships, to meet strict sovereignty requirements and regional standards,” said Marcus Jadotte, Vice President, Government Affairs and Public Policy, Google Cloud.","15 of the world's most powerful companies, including Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Jio Platforms, have joined forces to launch the Trusted Tech Alliance.

"Analyst bets Google will beat Nvidia to become world's most-valuable company in 2026, and the reason is linked to tech companies' 'big headache'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/analyst-bets-google-will-beat-nvidia-to-become-worlds-most-valuable-company-in-2026-and-the-reason-is-linked-to-tech-companies-big-headache/articleshow/128344489.cms,"ChatGPT did not weaken Google’s AI position: Analyst

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Google’s platform and the AI infrastructure

Pressure on world's biggest chipmaker, Nvidia

Google could overtake Nvidia to become the world’s most valuable company by market capitalisation by the end of 2026, according to an analyst assessment at Seeking Alpha that points to a growing challenge facing the technology industry: the rising cost and constraints of AI computing infrastructure. The view comes as Alphabet, Google’s parent company, ramps up spending on data centres and custom AI hardware while reporting strong growth across search and cloud businesses. The analyst argues that Google’s broad AI platform and in-house chips position it to benefit as companies seek alternatives to expensive, power-hungry AI processors, a pressure point increasingly described as one of the industry’s biggest headaches.First reason pointed by the analyst behind Google’s recent market-cap gains were also driven by a shift in investor perception around artificial intelligence leadership. He argues that the widely held belief that OpenAI’s AI chatbot-- ChatGPT would significantly damage Google Search proved incorrect, despite early enthusiasm around the chatbot. According to the analysis, Google’s continued growth in search revenue and the rollout of its own AI products undermined the idea that OpenAI had overtaken Google as the industry’s AI leader.The reassessment, he said, helped narrow the valuation gap between Google and Nvidia.The analysis notes that Alphabet’s planned capital expenditure of up to $180 billion for 2026 has drawn attention, but says the focus should instead be on Google’s underlying business performance. Google Search revenue grew 17% year-on-year in the latest quarter, while Google Cloud revenue rose 48%, with a reported backlog of $240 billion.The analyst argues that Google’s strength lies in its ability to monetise AI across a wide range of products, including Google Search, advertising, cloud, and vidoe-streaming platform YouTube. Unlike rivals that rely heavily on third-party chips, Google designs its own Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), giving it more control over costs, performance, and energy use, the analyst claims.The assessment also points to increasing competition for Jensen Huang-led Nvidia, whose high-margin GPUs dominate AI training but face challenges in the inference market, where efficiency and power consumption matter more. As pointed out in the report, custom chips from companies such as Broadcom, Amazon, and Google are gaining traction as cheaper and more energy-efficient alternatives.As AI workloads shift toward inference at scale, the analyst believes demand for application-specific processors will grow, reducing reliance on Nvidia’s GPUs. This shift, combined with Google’s expanding cloud business and proprietary hardware, is seen as a key factor that could allow Google to close the remaining market-cap gap and surpass Nvidia, potentially as early as 2026.The prediction comes amid heightened investor scrutiny of AI spending, power availability, and long-term returns across the technology sector.","Google’s broad AI platform and in-house chips position it to benefit as companies seek alternatives to expensive, power-hungry AI processors.

"'Clearly dishonest' ads that Sam Altman said made him 'laugh' seems to have worked well for Anthropic, the company that made fun of ChatGPT",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/clearly-dishonest-ads-that-sam-altman-said-made-him-laugh-seems-to-have-worked-well-for-anthropic-the-company-that-made-fun-of-chatgpt/articleshow/128343273.cms,"Sam Altman called Anthropic's ads 'clearly dishonest'

Here's what Sam Altman wrote in his 400-word long note on Anthropic ads

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was not pleased with Anthropic's Super Bowl ads making fun of ChatGPT. But it seems they did the job that OpenAI's arch-rival Anthropic intended to. According to data analyzed by BNP Paribas, the maker of the Claude chatbot Anthropic saw visits to its site jump 6.5% following its Super Bowl advertisement that made fun of rival OpenAI’s decision to bring ads to ChatGPT. As per the report, the Claude gain, which took it into the top 10 free apps on the Apple App Store, beat out chatbot and artificial intelligence competitors OpenAI, Google Gemini and Meta.Daily active users also reportedly saw an 11% jump post-game, the most significant among AI companies. OpenAI’s ChatGPT had a 2.7% bump in daily active users after the Super Bowl and Gemini added 1.4%. But what is important to note here is that Claude’s user base is still much smaller than ChatGPT and Gemini.Advertisements from artificial intelligence brands took center stage at the big game, which brought in an audience of 125 million in the U.S., as platforms made their pitch to lure more customers in a competitive market that’s showing no signs of slowing.Anthropic's Super Bowl ads that mae un of OpenAI for showing adsAnthropic spent millions of dollars on ads during America's National Football League championship game to slam rival OpenAI for its plan to sell ads on its ChatGPT.Anthropic's 30-second ads took a thinly veiled jab at OpenAI's intentions to introduce ads in ChatGPT. The punchline: ""Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude,"" the name of Anthropic's chatbot.Not surprisingly, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was not happy with Anthropic’s Super Bowl ad campaign. In a post to social media platform X, formerly, Twitter, Altman called the commercials “deceptive” and “clearly dishonest.”First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed.But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest. Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that.I guess it’s on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren’t real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.More importantly, we believe everyone deserves to use AI and are committed to free access, because we believe access creates agency. More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the US, so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do. (If you want to pay for ChatGPT Plus or Pro, we don't show you ads.)Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people. We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can’t pay for subscriptions.Maybe even more importantly: Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI—they block companies they don't like from using their coding product (including us), they want to write the rules themselves for what people can and can't use AI for, and now they also want to tell other companies what their business models can be.We are committed to broad, democratic decision making in addition to access. We are also committed to building the most resilient ecosystem for advanced AI. We care a great deal about safe, broadly beneficial AGI, and we know the only way to get there is to work with the world to prepare.One authoritarian company won't get us there on their own, to say nothing of the other obvious risks. It is a dark path.As for our Super Bowl ad: it’s about builders, and how anyone can now build anything.We are enjoying watching so many people switch to Codex. There have now been 500,000 app downloads since launch on Monday, and we think builders are really going to love what’s coming in the next few weeks. I believe Codex is going to win.We will continue to work hard to make even more intelligence available for lower and lower prices to our users.This time belongs to the builders, not the people who want to control them.",Anthropic spent millions of dollars on ads during America's National Football League championship game to slam rival OpenAI for its plan to sell ads on its ChatGPT.

This comes after recent layoffs in its Reality Labs division, which has incurred significant losses. The company is now shifting its focus and investment towards AI research.

Reality Labs bled $70 billion since 2020, and Mark Zuckerberg is now redirecting that money toward AI

Biggest Tech Layoffs of 2025: Job Cuts at TCS, Intel, Microsoft, Google and more

The 5% performance cut talks that started it all

Meta has told employees it won't repeat last year's company-wide performance purge, drawing a line under months of speculation about whether the bottom 5% cull would become an annual ritual. ""These are individual cases not related to any company wide initiatives,"" a Meta spokesperson told Business Insider. ""For example we are not doing any 5% low performers like we did last year.""The clarification arrives just weeks after Meta slashed roughly 10% of its Reality Labs workforce—over 1,000 employees, though some reports peg the number closer to 1,500. The cuts hit hardest in the teams building VR headsets and Horizon Worlds, the virtual reality social network that was supposed to justify Zuckerberg's decision to rename Facebook to Meta back in 2021.The Reality Labs layoffs weren't exactly a surprise. CTO Andrew Bosworth had called a division-wide meeting last month, describing it as the ""most important"" of the year and asking staff to show up in person—never a great sign. The New York Times reported that Zuckerberg had asked top executives to trim their 2026 budgets so the company could funnel more money into AI research, including TBD Lab, Meta's secretive unit chasing superintelligence.Reality Labs has burned through more than $70 billion in losses since 2020, and consumers still haven't rushed to buy VR headsets despite billions in development spending. The one bright spot has been the Ray-Ban smart glasses, which have sold over two million units and are now the centrepiece of Meta's hardware strategy going forward.The whole performance-based layoff saga kicked off in January 2025, when Zuckerberg sent staff a memo saying he wanted to ""raise the bar on performance management"" and ""move out low-performers faster."" An internal FAQ later suggested such cuts could become a yearly exercise. Meta cut roughly 5% of its workforce by February 2025, targeting employees rated as the lowest performers.Now, at least for 2026, Meta says that playbook is staying on the shelf.","Reality Labs has burned through more than $70 billion in losses since 2020.

Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman: Focus is on in-house AI models,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman-confirms-company-is-dumping-openai-says-my-personal-mission-at-microsoft-is-to/articleshow/128335767.cms,"Microsoft is charting a course towards AI self-sufficiency, aiming to reduce its reliance on OpenAI. The tech giant is developing its own advanced AI models, like MAI-1-preview, and diversifying its AI supplier base. This strategic shift follows a recent partnership restructuring with OpenAI, granting both entities greater independence to pursue their own AI development goals.

Microsoft already has its own AI model in the works

The October 2025 deal gave both sides more room to operate independently

Wall Street is already nervous about the OpenAI dependency

Microsoft is no longer content being powered by someone else's AI. The company's AI chief Mustafa Suleyman has told the Financial Times that Microsoft is pushing toward ""true AI self-sufficiency""—a clear signal that the tech giant is actively reducing its dependence on OpenAI, even as the two companies remain contractually tied.""My personal mission at Microsoft is to build superintelligence,"" Suleyman said in the interview, adding that the company must develop its own frontier foundation models with ""gigawatt scale compute"" and ""some of the very best AI training team in the world.""This isn't just talk. In August 2025, Microsoft AI previewed MAI-1-preview, an in-house mixture-of-experts model pre-trained on roughly 15,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs. The company has signalled plans to roll it into certain Copilot text use cases—a direct step toward replacing OpenAI models in its own products.Microsoft has also been quietly widening its AI supplier base. It now hosts models from xAI, Meta, Mistral, and Black Forest Labs in its data centres. Reports suggest the company even tested Anthropic's Claude models for some Microsoft 365 Copilot tasks after internal benchmarks found them better for certain Office workloads—going so far as to pay rival cloud provider AWS for access.Suleyman's comments come months after Microsoft and OpenAI signed a restructured partnership agreement in October 2025. That deal converted Microsoft's profit-sharing rights into a 27% ownership stake in the newly formed OpenAI Group PBC, valued at roughly $135 billion. It also extended Microsoft's IP rights to OpenAI models through 2032, including post-AGI systems.But the deal cut both ways. OpenAI gained freedom to source computing power outside Azure and pitch new investors. Microsoft, in turn, secured the right to independently pursue AGI—alone or with third-party partners. The restructuring effectively gave both companies permission to build their own futures without waiting for the other.Investors have taken notice of the shifting dynamics. During Microsoft's recent earnings call, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill flagged OpenAI's 45% share of Microsoft's backlog of future sales, calling it a concern about ""durability"" and ""exposure."" The following day, Microsoft shares lost $357 billion in value—a historic single-day wipeout that had little to do with the company's actual financial performance.Suleyman, a co-founder of Google DeepMind before joining Microsoft in March 2024, said he expects Microsoft to have its own superintelligence model ready ""sometime this year.""","Microsoft is pushing toward ""true AI self-sufficiency,"" says AI chief Mustafa Suleyman.

He admires the current generation of young workers, seeing them as pioneers at the dawn of extraordinary possibilities.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Sam Altman says he is just waiting to be replaced as OpenAI CEO





OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently said that the coming decade could be the “most exciting time in the history” to start a career. In an interview with video journalist Cleo Abram, Altman predicted that a student finishing college in 2035 might not take a normal job like the current generation. Instead, they could be working in a brand new, highly paid space job – maybe even joining a mission to explore the solar system. Predicting sky high salaries for the future generation, he said that these “well-paid” roles will come after AI has wiped some jobs entirely, reshaping the early-career landscape for today’s workspace.“In 2035, that graduating college student, if they still go to college at all, could very well be leaving on a mission to explore the solar system on a spaceship in some completely new, exciting, super well-paid, super interesting job,” said Sam Altman.The OpenAI CEO also said that he is envious of GenZ who are starting their careers now. “If I were 22 right now and graduating college, I would feel like the luckiest kid in all of history,” he told Abram.During the conversation, he also stated that the future generation will also be “feeling so bad for you and I that we had to do this really boring, old work and everything is just better.”In November, Altman revealed that he is counting down the years until AI is capable of replacing him and he also hopes the OpenAI will become the first company to make it happen.As reported by Business Insider, speaking on the Conversations with Tyler podcast this week, ““Shame on me if OpenAI is not the first big company run by an AI CEO”.During the interview, Altman also mentioned that he frequently reflects on what it would take for an AI system to outperform him in leading the company, and he believes that it is only a matter of “single-digit years” before AI can run a major department at OpenAI.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the coming decade could be the “most exciting time in the history’ to start a career.

Google Cloud chief Thomas Kurian just supported what Nvidia said after Google TPU news wiped billions from its market value,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-cloud-chief-thomas-kurian-just-supported-what-nvidia-said-after-google-tpu-news-wiped-billions-from-its-market-value/articleshow/126146965.cms,"Google-Nvidia not a rivalry: Google Cloud chief Thomas Kurian



Nvidia’s response on Google-Meta partnership







Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian has publicly pushed back against the narrative of a “chip war”, wherein custom AI chips like Google ’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are seen as a threat to Nvidia’s dominance. Kurian’s comments have come about a month after a turbulent week where news of Facebook-parent company partnering with Google to train its Llama AI models on search giant’s in-house silicon wiped billions from Nvidia’s market value.Kurian characterised the relationship between Google and Nvidia not as a rivalry, but as a partnership, dismissing the idea that the rise of custom chips is a “zero-sum game"", as per a report by Fortune.“For those of us who have been working on AI infrastructure, there’s many different kinds of chips and systems that are optimised for many different kinds of models,” Kurian said. He noted that Google continues to optimise its Gemini models for Nvidia GPUs, even allowing them to run on Nvidia clusters.Nvidia pushed back against the narrative of Google having better chips, insisting that its GPUs remain “a generation ahead of the industry” even as Google’s in-house AI chips gain momentum.The development fuelled concern among investors and analysts, which led to a 3% drop in Nvidia’s shares.“We’re delighted by Google’s success — they’ve made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google,” the company said in a post after Google-Meta partnership news broke.“NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it’s the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done. NVIDIA offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs, which are designed for specific AI frameworks or functions,” the company added.Notably, while Nvidia still commands over 90% of the AI chip market, hyperscalers like Google and Meta are increasingly looking at “mixed chip infrastructures” to balance raw performance with cost-effectiveness.","Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian has publicly pushed back against the narrative of a “chip war’ Kurian characterised the relationship between Google and Nvidia not as a rivalry, but as a partnership.

AI is creating a new billionaire class with a record number of founders under 30,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-is-creating-a-new-billionaire-class-with-a-record-number-of-founders-under-30/articleshow/126150740.cms,"

A record-breaking surge in under-30 billionaires



Why AI is the golden ticket



Spotlight: From ballerina to billionaire





Artificial intelligence is rewriting the script on how we work and build wealth, but the story reads very differently depending on who you are. For most young professionals just starting out, the rise of AI brings a distinct sense of unease.There is a real fear that entry-level jobs, the traditional stepping stones of a career, are disappearing or evolving faster than anyone can keep up with. But flip the coin, and you find a much smaller, hyper-successful group of young people for whom AI is not a threat, but a rocket ship.In 2025, we are seeing a historic shift. According to an analysis by Forbes, more people under 30 are becoming self-made billionaires than ever before. It is a stark illustration of the current moment, a time of immense promise for a few, and deep uncertainty for the many.This year, 13 young entrepreneurs in their twenties joined the ultra-wealthy club, nearly double the previous record. But what is truly striking is the speed at which this happened.Eleven of these founders crossed the billion-dollar threshold in just the last few months of the year. It was not a slow climb.It was a vertical leap.The catalyst was late-stage funding rounds, where investors eager not to miss the next big thing poured money into these startups.The whiplash was real. For many of these founders, years of quiet grinding in obscurity were followed by sudden global recognition. They went from working on a project to managing billion-dollar valuations in the blink of an eye.Why is this happening now? The nature of wealth creation has fundamentally changed.In the past, building a billion-dollar empire usually required factories, supply chains and thousands of employees. Today, AI allows a tiny team to create massive value with very little physical infrastructure. If you have the right code and the right position in the AI ecosystem, you can scale globally almost instantly.This compresses decades of traditional business growth into a window of just a few years. The founders leading this charge are digital natives, people who grew up on the internet, for whom coding is as natural as speaking, and who see AI as a foundational tool to fix everything from coding bugs to hiring headaches.Perhaps the most fascinating story in this new class of billionaires belongs to Luana Lopes Lara.Now the youngest female self-made billionaire under 30, her journey was anything but linear. Before she was a tech mogul, she was an artist.Born in Brazil, Luana trained as a professional ballerina and performed in Europe. It takes a rare kind of person to possess the discipline required for professional dance and the analytical mindset needed for high-level engineering.She eventually traded her pointe shoes for problem-solving, studying at MIT and cofounding Kalshi, a prediction market startup, with fellow student Tarek Mansour. When Kalshi recently hit an $11 billion valuation, her life changed almost overnight, proving that the path to tech success does not always start in a computer lab.This surge of young wealth is a signal that the cycles of technology and success are accelerating. If AI continues to reshape the economy, founders even younger than 20 could soon join these ranks.","More people under 30 are becoming self-made billionaires than ever before.

ServiceNow to buy cyber startup Armis for $7.75 billion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/servicenow-to-buy-cyber-startup-armis-for-7-75-billion/articleshow/126146443.cms,"The rise of Armis







ServiceNow has announced that it has agreed to buy cybersecurity startup Armis for $7.75 billion – in its largest acquisition to date. The move is a massive bet on the future of AI-driven security as companies move to defend against increasingly sophisticated digital threats. The deal aims to integrate Armis’s specialised security features, including advanced device scanning and real-time threat detection, directly into the ServiceNow platform.According to a news agency Reuters, the acquisition comes at a time when hackers have paralysed major entities like Microsoft and UnitedHealth Group. By bringing the Alphabet-backed Armis under its wing, , the enterprise software giant intends to offer a comprehensive “security stack” that can identify every connected device in an enterprise network.“Our security stack, with the acquisition of Armis, is very well positioned, so we won't need to do any more M&A in the security space,” ServiceNow CFO Gina Mastantuono was quoted as saying. ServiceNow projects that the deal, expected to close in the second half of 2026, will triple the market opportunity for its security and risk business.Founded in 2015, Armis was previously on a fast track toward an initial public offering (IPO).The startup was valued at $6.1 billion in a November funding round led by Goldman Sachs and CapitalG (Alphabet's venture arm).Armis has seen growth, crossing the $300 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) milestone in August. Before the ServiceNow deal, the company had unveiled a three-year plan to hit $1 billion in ARR, a goal it will now pursue as a key pillar of the ServiceNow ecosystem.","ServiceNow has announced that it has agreed to buy cybersecurity startup Armis for $7.75 billion.

PM Publishers partners Google to transform 2 million textbooks into AI tutors with Gemini,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/pm-publishers-partners-google-to-transform-2-million-textbooks-into-ai-tutors-with-gemini/articleshow/126144458.cms,"What the companies said about the partnership

“Our goal is to make learning more engaging, interactive, and future-ready.

With Google Gemini, we are giving students and teachers a powerful tool that amplifies curiosity, supports creativity, and promotes the responsible use of AI in education.”

“At Google, we believe AI should be a learning companion that sparks curiosity, rather than just a tool for retrieving answers. By integrating Gemini directly into PM Publishers’ curriculum, we hope to give students and parents a personal AI tutor that is grounded in the textbooks they trust and enhance the classroom experience.”





PM Publishers, a leading name in school education since 2009, has announced a collaboration with Google to integrate Gemini, Google’s AI assistant, with the traditional textbook learning experience, transforming the act of learning into an interactive journey.Launched for the upcoming 2026-27 academic year, PMP will integrate Google Gemini across 250+ book titles covering computer science, English, Hindi, art & craft, general knowledge, and foundation subjects, starting from nursery to class 10.This initiative is expected to reach over 2 million students across 2,000+ schools in its first phase. Designed for age-appropriate use, the tool empowers older students to learn independently, while serving as a digital companion for parents of younger children, helping them simplify concepts and foster curiosity at home.Each PMP book will feature specific QR codes linked to a custom Gemini Gem. These are custom versions of Gemini that have been fine-tuned to the particular content of that textbook and will offer chapter summaries, interactive activities, and additional learning resources. This ensures that when a student asks a question, the AI tool provides a context-aware, curriculum-grounded answer.Rajesh Bajaj, Managing Director, PM Publishers Pvt.

Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Speaking on Google DeepMind: The Podcast, Hassabis said many early-stage companies are now raising tens of billions dollars before even launching product. He believes that this trend exposes cracks in the valuation model. “Some startups basically haven’t even got going yet,” Hassabis said. “It’s sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. My guess is probably not, at least not in general.” This increase in speculative funding has drawn comparisons to past bubbles, such as the dot-com boom and the crypto frenzy, where companies raised massive sums on hype rather than proven business models.Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google, which he said are backed by “a lot of real business.” While Big Tech’s AI bets are supported by revenue streams and infrastructure, many startups are relying solely on investor enthusiasm.He added that AI is “overhyped in the short term” but “underappreciated in the medium to long-term,” suggesting that while the technology’s potential is profound, the current funding frenzy may not reflect sustainable growth.Reflecting on DeepMind’s own early days, Hassabis noted how technological shifts often swing from skepticism to obsession, inflating valuations quickly. “It’s almost an overreaction to the underreaction,” he said, pointing out that investor sentiment can flip dramatically once a technology gains traction.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO also made his stand clear on the debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent. Scaling laws suggest that the more data and compute an AI model receives, the smarter it becomes.",Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google are backed by “a lot of real business”,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126055439,imgsize-37614,width-400,resizemode-4/time-person-of-the-year-cover.jpg"

Microsoft Edge Gets a Major AI Upgrade with New Copilot Mode





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Suleyman was asked if he thinks Gemini 3 – the latest version of Google’s AI chatbot – is better than Microsoft’s Copilot. The Microsoft AI CEO replied, saying: “It can do things that Copilot can’t do”, adding “but Copilot also has features that it doesn’t have.” Mustafa Suleyman further said that Copilot is “amazing for vision. It can see everything that you are seeing and talk to you in real time. You can share your screen with Copilot on mobile or desktop, talk about it and get feedback.”“We’re really trying to imagine the day-to-day experience of having this really intelligent assistant at your side, that can help unblock you whenever you get stuck,” he added.To recall, Google launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3 last month. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model is “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding.” Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is claimed to be more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations.In the same interview, Mustafa Suleyman outlined Microsoft’s approach to “humanist superintelligence”—AI systems strictly designed to serve human interests rather than operate autonomously.“We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” he stated, emphasizing that containment and alignment are “necessary prerequisites” and “red lines” before releasing superintelligent tools.Suleyman also warned that the Redmond giant will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” staking out what he calls a “novel position” in an industry racing toward superintelligence. The announcement comes as Microsoft gains newfound independence to develop AI following a revised agreement with OpenAI.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently said that Google’s Gemini 3 ‘can do things Copilot can’t do’ In the same interview, he outlined his approach to ‘humanist superintelligence’ Microsoft will abandon any artificial intelligence system that threatens to “run away from us,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126036637,imgsize-27400,width-400,resizemode-4/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman.jpg"

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Fear-driven leadership powers AI chip giant's success

Seven-day workweeks extend beyond executive suite





Despite leading the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang operates in constant fear of failure. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business.""

He recalled flying to Japan to inform Sega that a contracted graphics chip was flawed and the deal should be canceled, while simultaneously admitting Nvidia needed the final $5 million payment to survive. Sega converted the funds into an investment, providing the lifeline that kept the company afloat.""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,"" Huang explained. The CEO maintains his intense work schedule by waking at 4 a.m.daily to read emails for hours, processing several thousand messages each day.

President Donald Trump’s administration announced on Tuesday (December 23) that it will impose new tariffs on Chinese semiconductor imports, however, the enforcement of these duties has been delayed until June 2027. This has essentially provided a significant window for ongoing trade negotiations. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the decision follows a year-long “Section 301” investigation, which was launched under the Biden administration. This probe concluded that Beijing’s pursuit of dominance in the “legacy” chip market is “unreasonable” and restricts US commerce.The US Trade Representative (USTR) stated in its filing that China’s state-backed targeting of the semiconductor industry constitutes an unfair trade practice that requires federal action. While the exact tariff rate is yet to be determined, officials said that the announcement of the specific figures will be made at least 30 days before the 2027 implementation date.“China’s targeting of the semiconductor industry for dominance is unreasonable and burdens or restricts US commerce and thus is actionable,"" the USTR release noted.With the delay, the Trump administration is essentially preserving its leverage while attempting to de-escalate immediate tensions.China recently imposed export curbs on rare earth metals that are used in chipmaking, space tech manufacturing.

Massive Netflix–Warner Bros Merger Triggers Industry Panic And Global Streaming Shake-Up

A few other WBD shareholders leaning towards Paramount offer





The high-stakes ‘war’ between Paramount Skydance and Netflix for Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) may have taken a sharp turn. The 5th largest shareholder of the entertainment conglomerate has said that the financing update from Paramount Skydance was “necessary” but it may not be enough to seal the deal. His comments have been published soon after Paramount included Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison’s $40.4 billion guarantee in their renewed offer.Harris Oakmark, WBD’s fifth-largest shareholder with approximately 96 million shares, told the news agency Reuters on Friday (December 19) that while the recent financing update from Paramount.On Monday (December 23), Ellison personally guaranteed $40.4 billion in equity financing to back his son David Ellison ’s bid for the studio. While that move was intended to erase doubts about Paramount’s “revocable” funding, Oakmark may have already suggested that the company may demand a higher premium.“We see the two deals as a toss-up, and there is a cost to changing paths. If Paramount is serious about winning, they’re going to need to provide a greater incentive,” Harris Oakmark portfolio manager and Director of US Research Alex Fitch said in an email to Reuters.It is to be noted that despite the higher enterprise value of Paramount’s $108.4 billion offer, the WBD board has unanimously recommended that shareholders stick with Netflix, saying that Paramount misled the shareholders about Ellison’s backing.While Oakmark is holding out for more cash, other investors are reportedly beginning to pivot. Thomas Poehling, a significant shareholder in both companies, noted that Ellison's personal involvement “adds a lot of stability” and “removes a lot of financing uncertainty.” He suggested that Paramount might have an easier path to regulatory approval than Netflix.Conversely, Yussef Gheriani of IHT Wealth Management signaled he would likely follow the board’s lead. “They know the business inside out and have a better grasp of the nuances,” Gheriani was quoted as saying, emphasising the rare opportunity to own “top shelf” assets like HBO Max, Harry Potter, and DC’s Superman.Now the clock is ticking for WBD investors as they now now have until January 21 – an extension from the original January 8 deadline – to decide the future of the Hollywood studio.",The 5th largest shareholder of the entertainment conglomerate has said that the financing update from Paramount Skydance was ‘necessary’ But Oakmark may have already suggested that the company may demand a higher premium.

Microsoft sends more than 600 word advisory on H-1B/H-4 visas to employees; says: Return before your ....,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-sends-more-than-600-word-advisory-on-h-1b/h-4-visas-to-employees-says-return-before-your-/articleshow/126142431.cms,"""return before your current visa expire""

Microsoft’s travel advisory for H-1B/H-4 visa employees

Update #1 on H-1B/H-4 Visa Appointment Rescheduling and Stamping Delays

Hi everyone,

As shared yesterday, some U.S. consulates are rescheduling existing H-1B/H-4 visa appointments and pushing dates out by several months. Here's what we know:

JD Vance Insults India Over H1B Visa? 'Cheap, 3rd-World Labour' | U.S. VP For 'America First'

Rescheduling notifications are concentrated in Chennai and Hyderabad, with some unverified reports from other consulates. New dates are as far out as June 2026.





The delays stem from operational constraints tied to the new online presence review for H-1B/H-4 visas, effective December 15, which reduces daily processing capacity. We're also hearing that these consulates needed time to implement new vetting procedures.





We have no confirmed reports of rescheduling for other visa types yet. While only H-1B/H-4, F, J, and M visas are subject to the online presence review, we think secondary impacts on overall processing may emerge.





We don't know if rescheduling is ongoing, for those whose original visa appointments have not been changed.





Some employees have already traveled for appointments and received rescheduling notices without warning; others are getting notices before departure. To set expectations, it is highly unlikely emergency appointments will be granted, given the circumstances.

This is a rapidly developing situation. Here is our preliminary guidance, which we'll update as we learn more. Please read this next section carefully—I've tried to simplify it, but the details do matter:

For those currently outside the U.S.:

You need a new visa stamp + your H-1B visa appointment was rescheduled months later: We will contact you. Please follow the instructions below to report your situation (even if you've already contacted AskUSI).





Your H-1B visa appointment was rescheduled BUT you still have some validity left on your current visa stamp: If your visa is for the proper work-authorized category, return before your current visa expires. This situation applies for people who had scheduled visa appointments because their visas are expiring soon, not before the return to the U.S. is planned.





You have upcoming travel + will need a new visa to return + your H-1B visa appointment was rescheduled months later: You should strongly consider changing your travel plans. You cannot return until your new visa stamp is issued, and it's highly unlikely that the appointment can be moved earlier. And there are limitations to your ability to perform work for your U.S. role during that period. See Microsoft Global Mobility Payroll and Tax Compliance Policy.





You have upcoming travel + will need a new visa to return BUT your H-1B visa appointment has not been rescheduled: There is risk your appointment could be moved during your trip and result in you being stuck abroad. Factor this into your decision. We are still learning more about how widespread and significant delays are in other consulates.





For other visa categories (not H-1B/H-4, F, J, M): Proceed as planned for now, but note things can change quickly.

HOW YOU CAN HELP US IDENTIFY TRENDS

To track real-time impacts, we need data from employees whose appointments have been rescheduled or may be soon. This will help us identify:

Which consulates are affected





When notifications of rescheduling are being sent





Length of delays





Whether other visa types are impacted





If you have a visa appointment scheduled with a U.S. consulate for any visa category, we've created a survey where you can share these details with us. And importantly, the survey allows you to update your responses—for example, if you haven't been rescheduled when you originally complete this survey, but subsequently receive a rescheduling notification. This form is also the clearest way for us to identify employees who are currently outside the U.S. and cannot return until a new visa stamp is issued: Census of Upcoming Visa Stamping Appointments — Fill out form

We'll share out insights based on these responses and further information we're able to gather by the end of the week.

For employees currently stuck abroad—we know this is an anxious moment. We will provide clear and orderly guidance to you directly as soon as we can.





Microsoft has issued an advisory for its employees on H-1B/H-4 amid the ongoing visa appointment rescheduling and stamping delays. This comes amid new social media screening, said to address the potential “abuse of the H-1B program”. Calling it a “rapidly developing situation”, the software giant has issued “preliminary guidance” for employees who are in the US and are outside the US urging them to. The advisory, sent by Jack Chen, Microsoft's associate general counsel for immigration says “Rescheduling notifications are concentrated in Chennai and Hyderabad, with some unverified reports from other consulates. New dates are as far out as June 2026.”“Some employees have already traveled for appointments and received rescheduling notices without warning; others are getting notices before departure. To set expectations, it is highly unlikely emergency appointments will be granted, given the circumstances,” it adds.Microsoft says it has created a survey where employees can share their details in case they have an appointment scheduled with a US consulate.The survey, the company says, “ allows you to update your responses—for example, if you haven't been rescheduled when you originally complete this survey, but subsequently receive a rescheduling notification.Notably, other tech giants including Apple and Google have issued similar advisory for their employees.Here’s the full text of Microsoft’s travel advisory to H-1B/H-4 visa employees sent by Jack Chen, Microsoft's associate general counsel for immigration",Some U.S. consulates are rescheduling existing H-1B/H-4 visa appointments and pushing dates out by several months.

Wipro CTO Sandhya Arun outlines key technology trends set to shape enterprises in 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/wipro-cto-sandhya-arun-outlines-key-technology-trends-set-to-shape-enterprises-in-2026/articleshow/126126643.cms,"



Global enterprises are set to enter a new phase of artificial intelligence adoption in 2026, with AI systems expected to operate at scale across core business functions, according to Sandhya Arun, Chief Technology Officer at Wipro Limited.In a technology outlook shared by the company, Arun said 2025 marked a shift from experimentation to meaningful enterprise adoption of AI. Generative AI and automation moved into mainstream use, while early agent-led systems began supporting decision-making, with human oversight remaining central.Looking ahead to 2026, Arun said the focus will move to AI systems embedded deeply within critical workflows. Enterprises are expected to deploy AI across operations while elevating the role of people from execution to orchestration, governance, and strategic control. She added that talent readiness and continuous skilling will be key to unlocking value from these technologies.Arun outlined several technology trends expected to shape enterprise technology strategies in 2026.She said agentic AI will play a larger role, with enterprises moving beyond isolated pilots to enterprise-wide networks of AI agents. These systems are expected to manage workflows across IT, finance, human resources, marketing, sales, legal, procurement, supply chains, and customer engagement, while humans focus on oversight and governance.Arun also pointed to the growing role of embodied AI, where artificial intelligence is embedded in robots, vehicles, machines, and connected devices. She said these systems will support use cases across sectors such as healthcare, manufacturing, energy, utilities, logistics, and mobility.Another area highlighted was the combination of digital twins and AI. According to Arun, AI-enabled digital twins will allow organizations to simulate real-world conditions, predict outcomes, and optimize assets and processes through continuous monitoring and analysis.She also noted a shift toward domain-native AI models, which are trained on industry-specific data and designed to meet regulatory, safety, and risk requirements. These models, she said, are expected to deliver greater accuracy while being more cost-effective.In financial services, Arun said programmable money and distributed ledger technologies are moving toward real-world adoption. Use cases include tokenized assets, automated settlements, and cross-border payments, supported by growing regulatory clarity.Arun added that advances in quantum computing are opening new possibilities in areas such as life sciences, financial services, and materials research, while also increasing the need for quantum-safe security standards.She concluded that workforce readiness will become a key leadership priority, with organizations needing to invest in learning, collaboration, and change management as AI systems scale across enterprises.","Wipro's Sandhya Arun said 2025 marked a shift from experimentation to meaningful enterprise adoption of AI.

The chipmaker is now refocusing its DGX Cloud division inward, prioritizing its own engineers' AI model development. This strategic pivot aims to protect Nvidia's dominant AI chip market share, estimated at over 80%, rather than pursuing cloud revenue.

Technical hurdles and fear of alienating major chip buyers doom cloud venture

Nvidia pivots to protect 80% AI chip monopoly over cloud ambitions





Nvidia has abandoned its plan to compete directly with Amazon Web Services—the cloud market leader commanding roughly 30% share—along with Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, the big three dominating the industry. The chip giant is restructuring its DGX Cloud division to focus on internal development rather than selling services to external customers, with the cloud team now serving Nvidia's own engineers building AI models, The Information reported.The company reassigned cloud business unit head Alexis Black Bjorlin, who joined from Meta in 2023, while integrating the DGX Cloud team into its engineering organization led by Vice President Dwight Diercks, according to internal memos reviewed by The Information. The restructuring reverses CEO Jensen Huang's ambitious March 2023 vision of rivaling industry leaders.Several former employees told The Information that the initiative faced insurmountable challenges from the start. The company had initially promoted early customers including ServiceNow, SAP, and Amdocs, positioning DGX Cloud as delivering superior performance compared to standard cloud configurations.However, Nvidia struggled to build momentum in a market already dominated by its largest chip customers.DGX Cloud consistently failed to attract sufficient customers despite its promise of superior chip performance compared to traditional cloud providers, former employees told The Information. The service's fundamental problem was technical: operating across different cloud providers' data centers made troubleshooting nearly impossible, as fixes implemented in Amazon's AWS facilities wouldn't work in Google or Microsoft environments.The Information reported that Nvidia had leased servers from major cloud providers, customized them to exacting standards, then attempted to rent them to AI developers at premium rates. DGX Cloud charged $36,999 per month for H100 instances when it launched in 2023, but that pricing became unsustainable as AWS slashed its own H100 and A100 prices by up to 45%.More critically, Huang grew reluctant to expand the business, fearing it would alienate AWS, Google, and Microsoft—companies generating roughly half of Nvidia's revenue through GPU purchases, sources told The Information. The cloud giants viewed DGX Cloud as a competitive threat, potentially accelerating their development of proprietary AI chips. Amazon notably declined to participate in the DGX Cloud program when approached, while Microsoft, Google, and Oracle agreed to host the service.The strategic withdrawal reflects Nvidia's calculation that protecting its AI chip monopoly matters more than capturing cloud revenue. While the company previously told investors DGX Cloud could generate $150 billion in future revenue—exceeding AWS's current annual sales—that ambitious projection now appears abandoned as the company refocuses on its core business.Nvidia's newer marketplace service, DGX Cloud Lepton, also struggled to gain traction and will be absorbed into the engineering team, The Information reported. The platform, which allowed cloud providers to list unused Nvidia server capacity, saw limited participation, with some providers joining only because Nvidia required it for joint marketing campaigns.Despite retreating from cloud competition, Nvidia maintains dominance in AI chip sales, controlling over 80% of the market. The company plans to invest $26 billion leasing servers from cloud providers—becoming one of the largest customers of the companies it briefly tried to challenge. Nvidia will ""continue to invest in DGX Cloud"" to support internal R&D and provide software capabilities to cloud partners, a spokesperson said.","N Nvidia has shelved its ambitious plan to directly challenge cloud giants. The chipmaker is now refocusing its DGX Cloud division inward, prioritizing its own engineers' AI model development. This strategic pivot aims to protect Nvidia's dominant AI chip market share, estimated at over 80%, rather than pursuing cloud revenue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126141807,imgsize-81284,width-400,resizemode-4/126141807.jpg"

FCC announces new ban list that American drone pilots have been dreading for months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/fcc-announces-new-ban-list-that-american-drone-pilots-have-been-dreading-for-months/articleshow/126139572.cms,"New ban a blow to half a million US pilots

Seeds of the ban on drones

Ban is a devastating blow to pilots

FCC’s Vision for “Drone Dominance”





The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), backed by the Donald Trump administration, has announced a sweeping new ban list that prohibits the sale of foreign-made drones and components in the United States, citing ‘unacceptable risks to national security’. As reported by the New York Times, the announced has been long anticipated by the drone industry and it effectively blocks new models from Chinese manufactures such as DJI and Autel Robotics, whose products dominate the global market. “The Pentagon or the Department of Homeland Security can clear a drone or component for use. But it heralded a new reality that American drone pilots have been dreading for months: New models produced by DJI, the Chinese manufacturer that makes most of the world’s drones, will no longer be sold in the United States. The statement did not mention DJI by name,” reads the report.The decision of the Trump administration has sent shock waves to America’s drone community, where nearly 5,00,000 registered pilots rely mainly in DJI equipment for commercial and personal use. From spraying crops and currying land to inspecting utility lines and assisting emergency responders, DJI drones have become indispensable tools. “People are pissed — incredibly, incredibly pissed — about the whole thing,” said Vic Moss, director of the Drone Advocacy Alliance, which represents pilots who want continued access to DJI products.While the ban imposed by the Trump administration halts the future sales, but it will not affect the drones already in circulation. Officials acknowledged that banning existing fleets would cripple emergency services, which use DJI drones to track suspects, locate missing hikers and conduct disaster response.This move of the US government stems from the 2025 National Defense Authorisation Act, which required a determination by December 23 on whether Chinese-made drones posed a security threat. The legislation, championed by Representative Elise Stefanik (R-NY), aimed to “ensure Chinese drones are banned from American skies.”Industry insiders had expected a detailed technical audit to determine whether DJI drones contained hidden back doors transmitting data to China. Instead, the decision appears to have been based on existing government assessments. DJI, for its part, has repeatedly urged US officials to conduct a rigorous review. “We stand ready to work with you, to be open and transparent,” wrote Adam Welsh, DJI’s head of global policy, in a letter earlier this month.For many pilots, the ban imposed on drones is a devastating blow. As per the report, DaCoda Bartels, COO of FlyGuys, a drone services company, said he has owned every DJI model since the Phantom V-1. “DJI will still be innovating and offering their products in other countries. We just won’t have access to them. That’s unfortunate,” he said, noting that American-made drones are “four times as expensive and half as good. ”However, some feel that it is a breakthrough announcement for US manufacturers. BRINC, a Seattle-based drone maker, hailed the decision as “historic,” saying it would “change everything for U.S. drone manufacturers.” Florida-based Unusual Machines echoed the sentiment, with CEO Allan Evans declaring that domestic firms now have “both an opportunity and a responsibility to build and deliver world-class products as quickly as possible. ”Companies like Skydio, which has ties to federal policymakers, are also poised to benefit, though the firm declined to comment.“The FCC will work closely with US drone makers to unleash American drone dominance,” said Brendan Carr, the commission’s chairman. The agency emphasised that while foreign drones are banned, existing models can still be flown, giving American companies time to catch up.For now, US drone pilots face a stark new reality: the world’s most popular drones are off the shelves, and the industry must adapt quickly to fill the gap.","The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has announced a sweeping new ban list that prohibits the sale of foreign-made drones and components in the United States.

Smartphones stayed at the centre of upgrades

The Silicon Triad

Home appliances shift toward premium





Croma has released its Year‑End Consumer Trends 2025 report highlighting how consumers in the country are opting for multi-brand larger formats, premium features, smart convenience and health-focused appliances across Croma’s nationwide offline and online network. As per the report, one in three new phones sold was in the Rs 20,000–Rs 30,000 price category. Similarly, the laptop market recorded a strong double digit overall growth. In the home entertainment segment, Bengaluru recorded the highest sales of 65-inch televisions. Here’s a look at how India shopped smartphones, laptops and other electronic devicesAccording to the report, India saw strong year-on-year growth in smartphone sales, with clear shifts in buying behaviour. One in three new devices sold fell in the Rs 20,000– Rs 30,000 segment, while nearly one in five buyers opted for a flagship or ultra-premium model.While the Rs 50,000–Rs 58,000 segment grew over 300%, indicating a rise in aspirational upgrades and higher willingness to spend on devices positioned for content creation, gaming, and AI-driven use cases.The laptop market posted double-digit growth, led by increased demand for premium and AI-focused devices.The report notes that Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Delhi formed India’s “Silicon Triad,” driving adoption of AI PCs and high-performance machines.Apple’s M4 laptops defined the top tier, while Nvidia-powered gaming systems continued to grow. Gaming laptops saw more than 25% growth in the pro-performance category. In mainstream computing, ultra-thin laptops doubled their growth as buyers preferred lightweight designs with stronger performance.Indian households upgraded to larger screens, reshaping home-entertainment patterns. Bengaluru registered the highest sales for 65-inch TVs, while Mumbai led demand for 75-inch and above displays. Gurugram emerged as the strongest market for 8K-ready televisions. Audio consumption also rose, with Delhi-NCR recording the highest demand for immersive sound systems, reinforcing the region’s status as a key hub for at-home social entertainment.Cooling products remained steady through the year, shaped by clear city-specific trends. Delhi and Mumbai recorded almost equal demand for air conditioners, but efficiency preferences stood out: nationwide, one in four ACs sold was a 5-star model, while in Delhi it was nearly one in three. The report notes that this shift reflects both rising climate awareness and consumers choosing long-term savings through energy-efficient appliances. Smart ACs made up 32% of total sales, and North India saw growing interest in all-season ACs that double as heaters while using significantly less power.Large home appliances continued to move up the value ladder. Front-load washing machines posted strong double-digit growth, led by Bengaluru and Pune—cities long associated with early adoption of premium appliances. In refrigerators, Delhi led demand for side-by-side models, followed by major metros including Bengaluru, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, showing a rise in preference for larger-capacity units suited to changing lifestyle needs.Health-focused appliances also gained momentum. Air fryer sales grew nearly 38% year-on-year, with Mumbai at the forefront. Air purifiers expanded beyond Delhi-NCR into Mumbai and Bengaluru as worsening air quality pushed more households to invest in cleaner indoor environments. Water purifiers saw a notable rise as well, with Bengaluru becoming the biggest market, followed by Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad, reflecting increased awareness around water quality and daily health.Smart convenience emerged as the biggest breakout trend of the year. Automated and robotic appliances saw nearly 2X growth, with Bengaluru leading adoption and establishing itself as the country’s top market for home robotics.","Croma has released its Year‑End Consumer Trends 2025 report highlighting how consumers in the country are opting for multi-brand larger formats, premium features, smart convenience and health-focused appliances.

Google’s revenue model prevents full AI pivot, argues Sam Altman

OpenAI CEO says future belongs to AI-native products





OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has acknowledged that his company narrowly avoided potential defeat by Google in the intensifying AI race, revealing that the search giant's delayed response to ChatGPT's launch gave OpenAI crucial breathing room to establish its market position.Speaking on the Big Technology Podcast with Alex Kantrowitz, Altman admitted that if Google had taken OpenAI seriously in 2023, ""we would have been in a really bad place. I think they would have just been able to smash us."" The candid assessment highlights the precarious early days of the AI competition that has since reshaped the technology industry.Altman explained during the podcast that while Google possesses ""probably the greatest business model in the whole tech industry,"" this very strength has become a strategic liability. The company's reluctance to disrupt its lucrative search and advertising revenue streams has prevented it from fully embracing AI-first product development.""I think they will be slow to give that up,"" Altman told Kantrowitz, referring to Google's existing business infrastructure. He argued that Google's approach of ""bolting AI into web search"" fails to unlock the technology's transformative potential, suggesting that incremental AI features added to existing products represent only marginal improvements.The OpenAI chief emphasized that true AI innovation requires complete product reimagination rather than retrofitting existing platforms. ""Bolting AI onto the existing way of doing things, I don't think is going to work as well as redesigning stuff in the sort of AI-first world,"" Altman stated.He used messaging apps as an example, explaining that while AI-powered summaries and draft responses offer convenience, the future lies in autonomous AI agents that manage communications independently. ""I do not want to spend all day messaging people. I do not want you to summarize them,"" Altman said, describing his vision where AI handles routine decisions and only surfaces critical updates periodically.Altman's comments come as OpenAI recently declared a ""code red"" alert following Google's Gemini 3 launch, which he said happens ""once maybe twice a year"" as competitive threats emerge. Despite Google's advances, ChatGPT maintains 800 million weekly users. OpenAI launched its GPT-5.2 model last week and released a new image generation model this week in response to mounting competitive pressure from Google and other AI rivals.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Google's delayed response to ChatGPT gave OpenAI crucial breathing room to establish its market position.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

OpenAI rolled out new safeguards to ChatGPT Atlas







ChatGPT- maker OpenAI has now cautioned that AI browsers including its recently launched ChatGPT Atlas agent, may never be fully immune to prompt injection attacks. In a long blog post, the company said that while it is strengthening defenses, the nature of these attacks makes complete protection unlikely. For those unaware, prompt injection takes place when malicious instructions are embedded in content that an AI agent processes. Instead of following the user’s intent, the agent is tricked into executing the attacker’s commands. For browser-based agents, this risk is especially acute because they interact with emails, documents, social media posts, and arbitrary webpages.Along with this, OpenAI has also illustrated how an attacher could seed a user’s inbox with a malicious email. If the agent is asked to manage emails, it might ingest the hidden instructions and, for example, send sensitive documents or even a resignation letter without the consent of the user.OpenAI also announced that it has rolled out new safeguards to ChatGPT Atlas. The safeguards include adversarially trained models and reinforced system-level protections. These updates were prompted by novel attacks discovered through automated red teaming, where reinforcement learning is used to simulate attackers and uncover vulnerabilities before they appear in the wild.The company also stressed on the fact that it is creating a rapid response loop; discovering new attacks internally, training models against them and shipping fixes quickly. This cycle, OpenAI argues, can materially reduce real-world risks even if prompt injection remains an open challenge.Despite progress OpenAI also OpenAI acknowledged that prompt injection is unlikely to ever be fully solved, comparing it to phishing scams that evolve continuously. “We expect adversaries to keep adapting,” the company wrote, adding that the goal is to make attacks increasingly difficult and costly rather than impossible.The warning highlights the broader risks of embedding AI agents directly into browsers and workflows. As these systems gain the ability to click, type, and act on behalf of users, the potential impact of a successful attack expands—from forwarding sensitive emails to initiating financial transactions.","OpenAI warns that AI browsers including its recently launched ChatGPT Atlas agent, may never be fully immune to prompt injection attacks.

Located in Wenzhou, Zhejiang province in southeastern China, the firm specialises in automotive fastener products. The tech company has a workforce of more than 450 employees and reported a total output value of 490 million yuan (US$70 million) last year.As per the report, a couple, both employees of the tech firm have received a 144-square-metre second-hand home already.Stating that the company has a significant migrant worker population, Wang Jiayuan, the General Manager of Zhejiang Guosheng Automotive Technology Co. Ltd said that it aims to reward its skilled technical and managerial personnel.“This year, we’ve distributed five flats. Next year, we plan to allocate eight more, with a total of 18 planned over three years,” he told the local publisher – National Business Daily.“Our goal is straightforward: to attract exceptional talent and retain our core management team,” he added.The executive revealed that all flats that the company plans to gift are located within 5km of the company. Each flat varies in size from 100 to 150 square metres with the average price of these renovated flats running from 7,000 to 8,500 yuan (US$990 to US$1,200) per square metre (roughly between Rs 1.3 crore and Rs 1.5 crore).Wang revealed that employees must complete five years of service at the company, after which the home will officially be transferred to them. Employees must sign a housing agreement and move in after the company completes renovation, the SCMP report said.“If these employees work diligently, helping the company save a million yuan annually isn’t out of the question, right?” Wang stated.

How Trump’s Gold Card Is Different From Green Card Explained; Masterstroke Amid Immigration Fight?

Why Google stopped PERM in 2023

Eligibility criteria for Google’s PERM 2026

Google advised employees to on H-1B visa to avoid international travel





Google has informed its employees that it will restart and also ‘ramp up’ application for the US green cards via the PERM program in 2026. The company’s plan to restart the process comes after the pause of three years which wS started among sweeping layoffs in 2023. As reported by Business Insider, the announcement by Google was shared in the December news letter and it signals a significant shift in the company’s immigration policy at a time of heightened uncertainty for tech workers on visas.For the uninitiated, PERM is the abbreviation for Program Electronic Review Management in a US Department of Labour process which enable the employers to ponder foreign workers for permanent residency. It is considered to be an important step for employees on temporary visas such as the H-1B allowing them to transition to a green card and secure the right to live and work permanently in the US. The process requires companies to prove that hiring foreign workers will not harm the job prospects or working conditions of the US citizens.As mentioned above, the tech giant Google stopped the PERM applications in January 2023, in the same month the company fired around 12,000 employees.As the US job market is now flooded with the laid-off tech talent, it became harder for companies to justify hiring foreign workers under PERM’s strict requirements. Other big tech companies such as Amazon and Meta have also paused their programs at that time. Since then, Google has only applied for PERM for a small handful of employees, according to people familiar with the matter.As per the Google memo seen by Business Insider, the company has outlined a strict eligibility criteria for employees who are planning to apply for PERM in 2026.* Employees must work in roles requiring a degree and prior work experience.* Staff must be based in a Google office; remote workers must agree to transfer to an office location to qualify.* Employees must be in good standing with the company and hold at least a “moderate impact” (MI) rating in their annual performance reviews.* Workers at Level 3 roles or below are less likely to meet the requirements.Google said eligible employees will hear from its outside immigration lawyers in the first quarter of 2026.The announcement of restarting PERM from Google comes at a time when tech employees on visas are facing mounting challenges. Increase in the H-1B visa fees and “significant” delays in international travel have added to the uncertainty, with Google’s lawyers recently advising employees to avoid traveling abroad if they lack valid visa stamps.Recently, Google asked some of its employees in the US to not travel abroad amid the H-1B visa row. According to a report by Business Insider, the company's outside counsel, BAL Immigration Law has sent an internal memo which says that workers who require a new visa stamp to re-enter the US risk being stuck overseas for months because many embassies and consulates are experiencing severe appointment backlogs. The memo said that U.S. embassies and consulates are reporting visa stamping delays of up to 12 months, and recommend that affected employees avoid international travel unless absolutely necessary. The advisory affects workers on H-1B, H-4, F, J, and M visas.""Please be aware that some US Embassies and Consulates are experiencing significant visa stamping appointment delays, currently reported as up to 12 months,"" the memo read.","Google will restart PERM program in 2026.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Datasection’s growth and expansion good news for Tencent

Loophole in US export policy

Datasection benefiting from the US policy loophole





Tencent, the Chinese tech giant has now found a way to legally access Nvidia’s most advanced semiconductors despite export restrictions imposed by the US. As reported by Financial Times, Tencent is using a partnership with Datasection, a Japanese company which has pivoted from marketing solutions to AI data centers in order to secure computing power from thousands of Nvidia’s most-advanced Blackwell processors. At its datacenter facility outside Osaka, Datasection owns around 15,000 Nvidia’s Blackwell B200 processors and a significant portion of these chipsets are being contracted to Tencent via third-party relationship.The $12 billion deal between Datasection and Tencent, enable the Chinese company to legally use the computing power which was banned by the US from direct export to China, highlighting the loophole in the US policy.For those unaware, Datasection has rapidly grown into one of Asia’s largest “neoclouds,” joining peers like CoreWeave (U.S.) and Nebius (Europe) in renting GPU capacity to global tech firms. The company is also building a Sydney AI data center which is equipped with Nvidia’s latest B300 chips which can outperform the hardware permitted for sale in China. The first 10,000 B300s cost $521 million. This facility of the company is also said to majorly serve Tencent, creating what Datasection CEO Norihiko Ishihara calls “the world’s first hyperscale AI cluster using B300 chips.The strategy adopted by Datasection and Tencent mainly exploit the legal gap in US export controls. Biden-era rules designed to close the loophole were scrapped by President Donald Trump in May, enabling Datasection to move quickly on its Osaka deal. Earlier this month, the U.S. approved sales of lower-performance chips to China, but Tencent and peers like Alibaba and ByteDance continue to rely on overseas computing workarounds. Analysts believe that renting GPU capacity abroad may be “the more attractive choice” for Chinese tech groups compared to buying downgraded chips.The US export policy loophole and the ban on chips to the Chinese gave an immense growth opportunity to Datasection. The stock on the company witnessed 18% surge this year, though it has halved since a ¥4,000 peak amid concerns of over-investment and a short-seller attack. The company has also raised ¥50 billion via equity warrants to Singapore-based First Plus Financial Holdings, owned by a Chinese national.Despite scrutiny, Datasection is pressing ahead with plans to expand into Europe, hiring high-profile figures such as Spanish politician Pablo Casado Blanco and John Ellis Bush Jr., a member of the U.S. Bush political family, to its board. Ishihara remains confident that demand for GPU capacity is so strong that even if U.S. export rules shift again, new customers would be easy to find. For Tencent, the Japanese deal underscores how China’s biggest tech companies are navigating restrictions by outsourcing AI training to overseas data centres, raising fresh questions about the effectiveness of Washington’s export controls and the growing role of “neocloud” providers in the global AI race.","Tencent has found a way to legally access Nvidia’s most advanced semiconductors despite export restrictions imposed by the US.

Dell employees say ‘new’ mandate ends flexibility for parents



What Dell has to say on the move







Dell is cracking down on employees who have been “badge-swiping” or leaving early. According to a report, internal “walkthroughs” revealed widespread non-compliance with the company’s return-to-office (RTO) mandate that was announced earlier this year. In a strongly worded internal memo, Jackie Miller, Dell’s vice president of North American Commercial Sales, informed the sales staff that the time of flexible hours is over for onsite-classified team members.“Effective immediately, all onsite-classified sales team members are expected to be in the RR, NV, and OKC offices five days a week for at least eight hours per day,” Miller wrote in a memo, which was obtained by Business Insider. The directive targets Dell’s major hubs in Round Rock (Texas), Nashville and Oklahoma City.Dell originally called sales staff back to a five-day onsite schedule in September 2024, the new memo – sent on November 5 – adds a specific time requirement that was previously a point of contention between managers and staff.The report says that the crackdown was prompted by “recent site visits” and “end-of-day walkthroughs” conducted by the company leadership.According to the memo, these inspections revealed that many employees were not adhering to the five-day policy, often leaving mid-afternoon or arriving late.Miller noted that that a physical presence is “essential for fostering collaboration, communication, and productivity,” and stated that any personal business or time away from the desk must now be covered by vacation hours or personal business allowances.The new enforcement has reportedly caused disruption for employees with families. This is because under previous interpretations of the policy, many parents were permitted by their managers to leave to pick up children from school and finish their workday at home. Sales leaders have now clarified that there are no exemptions for school schedules.A Dell spokesperson defended the move, stating that while team members are expected to work a “regular working day,” some flexibility remains for those in global roles who take late-night calls.However, the internal FAQ remains strict: while temporary medical conditions or peak traffic adjustments may be approved, the documents state that ""regular childcare, care for dependents, or attending to other personal business"" do not qualify for work-from-home exemptions.","Dell is cracking down on employees who have been “badge-swiping” or leaving early.

Helium AI launches tools for businesses to help build presentations and marketing campaigns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/helium-ai-launches-tools-for-businesses-to-help-build-presentations-and-marketing-campaigns/articleshow/126127467.cms,"How these new AI tools work

“Most teams don’t struggle with ideas; they struggle with execution. While AI has added more tools, it hasn’t solved coordination. Mantis and Prism are built to remove that execution friction entirely, enabling teams to move from intent to outcomes within a single system. As go-to-market cycles shrink and brand consistency becomes harder to manage across channels, enterprises need AI that takes responsibility for results, not just content.

That is the direction Helium is building toward.”





Enterprise-grade AI operating platform Helium AI by Neural Arc has launched two new AI systems – Mantis and Prism. The company claims that these tools will offer a significant upgrade to its platform capabilities. Designed to streamline fragmented workflows across presentations and marketing, these tools will allow organisations to create professional, brand-aligned assets at scale, faster than ever before.Mantis is Helium’s AI-based presentation system that supports creating slide decks from a brief or topic. It uses live web sources to gather current information, organises the content into a narrative and generates slides with text placed directly into predefined layouts.The system automatically applies brand elements such as logos, colour schemes, and formatting rules. Mantis combines research, writing, and slide design into a single process, producing complete presentation files rather than draft outlines.The system includes more than 50 presentation styles, covering modern, minimalist, artistic, retro, and futuristic formats, along with multiple layout types, including section headers, image-focused slides, and comparison layouts.It is intended for use cases such as sales presentations, investor decks, internal reports, training materials, and educational content, with an emphasis on consistent formatting and reduced production time.Prism extends Helium’s platform into campaign creation and supports the development of multi-channel marketing campaigns within a single system. It generates campaign elements, including strategy, messaging, visuals, and ready-to-use assets.Prism can extract brand details from a website or provide inputs to apply logos, colour palettes, and tone consistently across outputs. The system supports social media campaigns across major platforms, full-funnel marketing efforts, and HTML email campaigns with subject lines, personalisation fields, and responsive layouts.Prism provides access to more than 75 visual design styles and generates text and images in parallel. The platform is designed to reduce reliance on multiple tools or external coordination and to shorten the time required to create, review, and deploy campaigns.Commenting on the new tools, Aniket Tapre, founder and CEO of Neural Arc, said,","Helium AI by Neural Arc has launched two new AI systems – Mantis and Prism.

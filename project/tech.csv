Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has now publicly denied a statement attributed to him by prediction platform Polymarket. Bezos accused the company of fabricating an advice he never gave. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Ploymarket posted that Bezos has urged the Gen Z entrepreneurs to start their careers ay McDonald’s or Palantir before launching their own business. However, Bezos denied any such advice and wrote, “Nope. Not sure why Polymarket made this up.”While Amazon founder rejected this specific claim, but he has spoken more broadly about the value of real-world experience. Speaking at the Italian Tech Week in November last year, Bezos stressed on the importance of early work experience especially in the fast-paced, customer-facing environment. He advised the young entrepreneurs to work at established companies before starting their own companies.“It is possible to drop out of college and be a great entrepreneur… but these people are the exception,” Bezos said. “Go work at a best practices company somewhere, where you can learn a lot of basic fundamental things.There’s still lots of time to start a company after you have absorbed it.”For those unaware, Bezos started Amazon out of his garage in 1994. He believes that entry-level jobs such as those at McDonald’s tech foundational skills which are important for long term success. He emphasised that such small roles are necessary as they instill skill like discipline, resilience and the ability to handle pressure. These are the traits that many Gen Z entrepreneurs may overlook in their rush to build startups.Elon Musk also joined the Polymarket and Jeff Bezos conversation. Elon Musk also weighed in on X, referencing President Donald Trump’s widely publicized stint at McDonald’s during the 2024 campaign. “Well, the President worked at McDonald’s and now he’s the President,” Musk quipped.",Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has publicly denied a statement attributed to him by prediction platform Polymarket.

What Vimeo's former VP Dave Brown wrote on LinkedIn

In a LinkedIn post, Vimeo’s former VP of Global Brand and Creative Dave Brown shared how he was caught off guard by sudden layoffs. Here's Brown's post:





Video platform Vimeo is reportedly laying off a large number of employees globally. The job cuts at US-based Vimeo come shortly after the company’s acquisition by the European tech conglomerate Bending Spoons, which purchased it in an all-cash deal for $1.38 billion in November 2025. Since its founding in 2004, Vimeo has fought to position itself as a premium video hosting platform and an alternative to YouTube. In recent years, the company has expanded into software offerings beyond hosting, such as webinars and other events. Vimeo was previously owned by media holding company IAC, which spun it off as a public company in May 2021.This is Vimeo's second round of layoffs since September, when the company cut 10% of its full-time workforce in an ""effort to ensure focus and efficiency,"" the company wrote in an SEC filing at the time.Milan-based Bending Spoons owns a collection of software companies, including Evernote, Meetup and WeTransfer.According to a report in The Verge, the cutbacks will impact a ""large portion"" of the company’s total workforce, citing a LinkedIn post from Vimeo’s former VP of Global Brand and Creative Dave Brown, who stated that he, “along with a large portion of the company,” had been “impacted by layoffs.”Yesterday, following Vimeo’s recent acquisition by a private equity firm, I learned that I, along with a large portion of the company, was impacted by layoffs.It’s not the ending any of us would have chosen. Still, the work and relationships we built were real, and something I’m deeply proud of. I’m grateful for the incredibly talented people I had the privilege to work alongside and the global community of storytellers who use Vimeo every day.Now I’m turning my attention to what’s next.If you’re looking for a creative leader who believes good taste matters, people come first, and the best work happens when leaders roll up their sleeves and build alongside the team, I’d love to hear from you.","Vimeo is reportedly laying off a large number of employees globally.

What is PwC’s 3A2I framework and how can it help in India’s development

AI Edge framework

,

“AI is revolutionising all spheres of life, and we are embedding it in governance to democratise its impact.

We have done well in creating a strong digital infrastructure, and we are now in a position to leverage data to drive deeper digitisation. We have developed an AI‑based app for farmers, available in Marathi, which is being actively used to understand crop cycles and the appropriate understanding around pesticide usage.

At the same time, we are building an innovative city that will help push the state’s larger AI agenda. EODB is another key focus area. In Maharashtra, we have recently cancelled 17 laws as part of our decriminalisation drive. Platforms like MAITRI for industrial investments are becoming more reliable through the use of AI. By bringing down multiple permission regimes and leveraging AI, we are confident of reducing red tape even further.”





PwC India launched its flagship report,at the World Economic Forum in Davos. According to PwC's economic modelling, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to contribute USD 550 billion to five priority sectors, including agriculture, education, energy, healthcare and manufacturing, by 2035 at a nominal level. The report positions India as a potential global benchmark for how emerging economies can deploy AI in a transformative and equitable manner.The report discussed PwC's proprietary 3A2I framework, a national, system-level playbook designed to enable AI to function as a connected “central nervous system” for India's development. The model builds access to data, infrastructure and skills; fosters acceptance through trust, transparency and ethical safeguards; and enables assimilation by embedding AI into real workflows. Once these foundations are established, the framework will drive large-scale implementation and long-term institutionalisation of AI through governance, policy, and continuous learning.​​PwC's analysis shows that AI can be a driver of sectoral growth, from boosting crop productivity and reducing agri-waste to improving school governance, cutting power theft, accelerating disease detection, and enhancing manufacturing quality.Real-world pilots already demonstrate this potential as AI-enabled crop advisories delivered double-digit efficiency gains, smart metering flagged high-accuracy theft cases, and AI-driven TB detection improved notification rates dramatically. Scaling such applications, even to modest levels, could save hundreds of millions annually, the report added.In the report, PwC also introduced thedefining the five tangible outcomes India should expect from AI deployed at scale: operational excellence, sustainability, good governance, resilience, and financial discipline. These outcomes shift the global AI conversation from efficiency alone to a broader focus on transparency, environmental stewardship, system reliability and inclusive value creation across public and private ecosystems.As India advances toward its Viksit Bharat vision, the report underscores that the country stands at a decisive moment, one where responsible, systemic and inclusive AI can reshape national growth trajectories. With deep collaboration among government, industry, academia, and civil society, India can build an AI ecosystem that learns continuously, scales responsibly, and ensures that every community benefits from this technological shift, driving sustainable and equitable national progress.The report was unveiled by the Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis, who said,","PwC India launched its flagship report,at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

“I suggest the term ""AI-assisted Code Engineering"" with ACE as the acronym instead of ""vibe-coding"". We must have solid engineering discipline and ACE is the maturation of the tools and techniques”.

“It does not eliminate all software engineers but enables experienced engineers who ACE well to be much more productive,” he said, adding “It is also going to reshape our industry but that is a separate topic.”



What is vibe coding







Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has suggested a new way to describe vibe-coding, a word that became one of the biggest “headache” of engineers in 2025. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Vembu argued that the termdoes not reflect the discipline required in real engineering work. He said that he prefers a new termto describe the growing use of AI tools in writing and maintaining software. In the post, Vembu said the focus should remain on solid engineering practices, even as AI becomes more deeply embedded in coding workflows.Sharing the post, Sridhar Vembu wrote:Vembu says that the term ACE does not remove the need for software engineers. Instead, it allows experienced engineers to “be much more productive”.Vibe coding is a term used to describe a more informal, AI-driven approach to programming.

""I love museums. But I don't want to live in one""

What Tim Cook means by “loving museums”



Apple CEO Tim Cook (Image source: Bloomberg)

“I don’t want to live in one”: A warning against stagnation



A lesson in leadership and decision-making



Why the quote resonates beyond technology



A reflection of Tim Cook’s leadership style



Why the quote still matters



""I love museums. But I don't want to live in one""

,





Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple , doesn't give long speeches or use dramatic slogans. When he does say something, it's usually short, to the point, and well thought out. One of these lines is his quote:. The sentence is easy to understand, like a conversation. But it has a deeper meaning about how to move forward, how to be a leader, and how businesses and people should plan for the future.The quote is based on the idea that honouring the past should never be a reason to stop moving forward. Museums are places where history is kept. They keep ideas, inventions, and events that changed the world. They help us remember where we came from. Tim Cook has never said that we should forget or ignore history. Instead, he says that it is dangerous to get too comfortable with it.In today's world, where things change quickly, especially in technology, staying still can cost you a lot. Cook's quote shows that progress means always moving forward, even when past success makes you feel safe.Museums are very important to society. They keep culture, new ideas, and human accomplishments safe. Future generations would lose touch with the ideas and work that shaped the past if there were no museums. Tim Cook saying ""love"" shows that he cares. He thinks it's important to learn from the past. He likes what has already been made.Apple has a long and well-known history. People often study and admire the company's past innovations, which include the Macintosh, the iPod, and the iPhone. A lot of these items are now on display in museums and exhibitions all over the world. Cook knows more about this legacy than most people.But liking someone doesn't mean you care about them. His quote makes it clear that history is important to learn about, but it shouldn't be a place where you want to stay, especially in an industry driven by constant innovation, progress, and forward-looking thinking.The second part of the quote is where the real meaning is. Living in a museum means being surrounded by things that have already been done, but not doing anything new. It means comfort, safety, and familiarity. That comfort can slowly turn into stagnation in business and leadership.Tim Cook has said many times that it's dangerous to depend too much on past successes. The markets change. Technology changes. People's needs change. What worked ten years ago might not work anymore. Businesses that only care about keeping their legacy alive often have a hard time staying relevant.Apple has kept changing under Cook's leadership. The business has grown into services, put more emphasis on user privacy, put money into protecting the environment, and moved into new areas like custom silicon chips. These choices show that the company is willing to try new things, even if the old ones worked.The quote is true for all leaders, not just Apple. People often praise leaders for their past successes. People trust you more when you have done well in the past. But depending too much on past success can keep you from coming up with new ideas.Cook's words make it sound like good leadership needs to be balanced. You can learn from history, but don't let it tell you what to do all the time. Don't let your past experiences tell you what to do. This method lets businesses change instead of fighting it.This idea also works for people. Careers, skills, and fields of work change over time. It can be harder to grow if you hold on too tightly to what used to work. The quote quietly encourages people to be open and curious, even when change is hard.This quote stands out because it is so simple. It doesn't use business jargon or technical language. People can all understand it. Most people know how nice it is to stick to their routines and how hard it is to try something new.In a more general sense, the quote talks about how societies deal with progress. Tradition and new ideas often clash with each other. It's important to respect culture and history, but it's also important to be open to new things. Cook's statement does not deny the past. It just won't let itself be limited by it.This balance is especially important now that technology is changing quickly and making people wonder about jobs, education, and social structures. The quote tells people that progress doesn't mean forgetting the past; it means building on it in a smart way.People often say that Tim Cook is calm, level-headed, and practical. His way of leading is different from Steve Jobs's, who was known for making bold and dramatic statements. Cook does things in a quieter way. His words are more likely to make you think than to make you angry, reflecting patience, consistency, ethical decision-making, and a long-term focus rather than short-term applause.This quote fits that pattern. It doesn't need attention. It makes you think. It gives a point of view without making people agree. That restraint is one reason it feels real.The quote doesn't give a big picture; it gives a way of thinking. It talks about how Cook sees progress, responsibility, and long-term success.is still true because it describes a problem that everyone faces. How can we remember the past without letting it control us? How do we go on without losing what matters?It's clear but not obvious what Tim Cook means. Value history. Take something away from it. Then decide to go on.In one short sentence, the CEO of Apple reminds us that we can choose to make progress. It takes work, curiosity, and a willingness to go beyond what you already know. Museums keep the past alive. But the future is being built somewhere else.",Tim Cook's quote has a deeper meaning about how to move forward. It is based on the idea that honouring the past should never be a reason to stop moving forward. Living in a museum means being surrounded by things that have already been done. That comfort can slowly turn into stagnation in business and leadership.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126659211,imgsize-22842,width-400,resizemode-4/tim-cook-image-source-reuters.jpg"

While I believe I personally have the bandwidth to continue what I am doing at Eternal, and also explore new ideas outside of it, the expectations, legal and otherwise, of a public company CEO in India demand singular focus.

This transition allows Eternal to remain sharply focused, while giving me the space to explore ideas that do not fit Eternal's risk profile.

What doesn't change

I have spent eighteen years, almost half my life, building this company. I will continue doing that.

Albi, Akshant, and I will continue to work closely together, as we always have. Our partnership, shared context, and trust remain unchanged. All our business CEOs will continue operating with the autonomy they have always had.

My involvement in long-term strategy, culture, leadership development, and ethics and governance, continues. This is where I have increasingly focused lately anyway.

What changes

The centre of gravity for operating decisions moves to Albi.

As Group CEO, he will own day-to-day execution, operating priorities, and business decisions.

Blinkit's journey from acquisition to breakeven happened under his leadership.

He built the team, the culture, the supply chain, the operating rhythm. He has the DNA of a battle-hardened founder and his ability to execute far exceeds mine. He is more than capable of leading Eternal as Group CEO.

Blinkit remains our largest growth opportunity and will remain as Albi's top priority. Our decentralized structure, where each business has a CEO with full ownership, continues unchanged - and will help Albi execute this well.

On alignment and ESOPs

My financial future remains meaningfully tied to Eternal, and my incentives remain aligned with long-term shareholder value creation.

As part of this transition, all of my unvested ESOPs will revert to the ESOP pool. This ensures that Eternal continues to have meaningful wealth-creation opportunities for its next generation of leaders, while strengthening long-term retention without incremental shareholder dilution.

Looking ahead

Eighteen years ago, the idea that a menu scanning company could be worth tens of billions of dollars, provide livelihoods to hundreds of thousands of people, and serve millions of families daily would have seemed absurd. We helped prove it was possible. And there's a lot in store for Eternal to do over the next few decades.

I believe Eternal is not going to lose focus or momentum through this change. Rather, it is reinforcing its institutional strength.

And personally, I gain the flexibility to explore ideas that sit outside Eternal's scope, without compromising the company's priorities.

I want Eternal to become India's most valuable company. I want us to serve a billion customers. I want us to create the most positive impact on society. I want us to be the source of livelihoods for millions of Indians. None of that changes.

This is a change in title, not in commitment towards outcomes. Eternal remains my life's work.

Thank you for your continued trust and support.

Months after Donald Trump made an 'angry call' to Jeff Bezos; Amazon CEO Andy Jassy makes statement on Trump Tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/months-after-donald-trump-made-angry-call-to-jeff-bezos-after-learning-amazon-plans-to-display-added-cost-of-tariffs-ceo-andy-jassy-makes-statement-on-trump-tariffs/articleshow/126848913.cms,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy

When White House called Amazon's tariff plan an 'hostile act'





In April 2025, a pissed Donald Trump made a call to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos after learning that the company is planning to display the added cost of tariffs on certain items. Trump made the call to Bezos to complain about reports that Amazon was considering to highlight the cost of US tariffs next to prices for certain products on the company’s website. Trump later told reporters about the call to Amazon founder and said it was a “good call.” “Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific,” Trump told reporters. “He solved the problem very quickly. Good guy.”Punchbowl News first reported that Amazon will soon “display how much of an item’s cost is derived from tariffs — right next to the product’s total listed price.” The move came after Trump slapped 145% tariffs on imports from China and a 10% minimum tax on all other countries.Now months later, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC in an interview Jassy at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Amazon.com is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures stemming from the US President Donald Trump's tariffs. ""We did a lot of pre-buying in the early part of 2025 to enable us to try and keep prices as low as possible for customers,"" Jassy said.He added, ""And a lot of our third-party sellers did a lot of forward-staging in our fulfillment network for the same reasons. And that supply is run out in the fall, so you start to see some of the tariffs creep in to some of the prices, some of the items.""""Some third-party sellers are raising prices in response while others are absorbing the costs in hopes of driving more demand,"" Jassy went on to add. ""Our priority is to try to figure out how to keep prices low as possible,"" Jassy said. ""At a certain point, because retail is a mid-single-digit operating margin business, if people's costs go up by 10%, there aren't a lot of places to absorb it.""The warning marks a shift from the Amazon leader's commentary on tariffs last year. While he cautioned in April that third-party sellers could need to pass along tariff costs, he said on several occasions that Amazon had not seen selling prices appreciably rise from tariffs. ""Amazon's consumers overall have fared well. But we'll have to see what happens in 2026,"" CEO Jassy had said.The company has also maintained so far that over the past year it was seeing very little impact on consumer behavior and product prices from tariffs. It has doubled down on expanding product categories and speeding up delivery timelines to shield demand.In April 2025, at a briefing, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called the move a “hostile and political act,” adding that she had spoken about the matter with President Trump earlier. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed Levitt’s comments, saying it’s a hostile act if a company goes out of its way to “make it seem” like tariffs have caused prices to change.“It’s nonsense,” he said Tuesday in a CNBC interview. “A 10% tariff is not going to change virtually any price,” he added, referring to the nearly universal baseline tariff on all countries. “The only price will change would be a product that we don’t make here, like a mango.” The 10% tariff, however, is hardly the only one in effect.",Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says the company is starting to see an uptick in product prices on its e-commerce platform as sellers respond to cost pressures.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has a message for everyone on AI Bubble. In a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella talked about the fears that has been troubling Wall Street for past many months: whether AI is a bubble. Speaking at a session, Nadella said that it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.“A telltale sign of if it’s a bubble would be if all we are talking about are the tech firms,” Nadella said. “If all we talk about is what’s happening to the technology side then it’s just purely supply side.” Nadella said the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) need to be ""much more evenly distributed"" to avoid it from becoming a ""bubble"".He spoke about how AI and other advanced technologies are increasing productivity and changing the way we work. Nadella offered a fix to what is called productivity dilemma. According to him, business leaders need to adopt a new approach to knowledge work by shifting workflows to match the structural design of AI. “The mindset we as leaders should have is, we need to think about changing the work—the workflow—with the technology.Nadella argues that AI creates a “complete inversion” of how information moves through a business, replacing slow, hierarchical processes with a view that forces leaders to rethink their organizational structures. “We have an organization, we have departments, we have these specializations, and the information trickles up,” Nadella said. “For large organizations,” Nadella told Fink, “there’s a fundamental challenge: Unless and until your rate of change keeps up with what is possible, you’re going to get schooled by someone small being able to achieve scale because of these tools. ”Microsoft CEO said that the role of AI needs to be examined across all aspects of life, such as how it is helping pharma companies bring critical drugs faster to the market or accelerate trials. He called for AI-driven economic growth rather than just increasing spending. ""We as a global community have to get to a point where we are using AI to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries,"" Nadella said.","Satya Nadella said it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.

Debate at Davos



Palantir CEO Alex Karp says certain tech employees will be valuable and highly paid







Palantir CEO Alex Karp has now issued a stark warning about the future of work in the age of artificial intelligence. Karp predicted that humanities-based jobs will now be among the first casualties. As reported by Business Insider, speaking during a panel at the World Economic Forum, Karp revealed that his own academic background which is a philosophy degree from Haverford College, a law degree from Stanford, and a Ph.D. in social theory from Germany, cautioned that such qualifications may no longer be viable. “AI will destroy humanities jobs,” Karp said. “You went to an elite school, and you studied philosophy — hopefully you have some other skill, because that skillset is going to be very hard to market.”Karp believes that workers with technical and vocational training will be in then highest demand. He quoted battery manufacturing as an exampple, nothing that technicians in such industries are “very valuable, if not irreplaceable.” “There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training,” Karp told BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who moderated the discussion.Not all leaders at Davos agreed with Karp’s assessment. Finance executives told Business Insider that liberal arts degrees may actually become more valuable, as AI takes over routine financial analysis. Critical and creative thinking, they argued, is increasingly prized in young recruits.Meanwhile, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei highlighted another trend: entry-level hiring is already declining due to AI. Amodei said software and coding roles at Anthropic were down across junior and mid-level positions.Recently, Karp said that value of skilled workers is rising. Speaking on TBPN, a tech talk show broadcast live from Palantir’s customer conference, AIP Con 8, Karp said, “Workers become more valuable. The person at the top is actually crazy valuable. People with technical expertise are crazy valuable."" His words underscore a trend that’s become increasingly apparent in Silicon Valley: in a world awash with automation and AI, human expertise, especially deep technical skill, has become a rare commodity.Karp calls these individuals “artist-shaped people,” a nod to the company’s unique culture, sometimes referred to internally as “an artist colony.” He added, “Artist-shaped people are going to be incredibly valuable, and they’re going to demand to be very highly paid.”. The statement doesn’t just reflect Palantir’s philosophy; it mirrors the market reality, where top AI researchers and engineers have recently netted unprecedented paydays, sometimes reaching hundreds of millions, while thousands of others were laid off from companies like Microsoft and Meta.","Palantir CEO Alex Karp says certain tech employees will be valuable and highly paid. “Artist-shaped people are going to be incredibly valuable, and they’re going to demand to be very highly paid,” he said.

Bill Gates and Melinda Gates divorce





Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever. According to a report in Forbes, the amount has surfaced in a tax filing. As per the report Bill Gates donation skyrocketed Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation's assets by more than 1,000% to about $7.4 billion in 2024. As the number went up from $604 million at the end of 2023 to $7.4 billion.The $7.88 billion donation was made in 2024 to the Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation, according to a newly released tax filing reviewed by the New York Times’ DealBook. Philanthropies Foundation focuses on women and families. The tax filing is said to mark the first time that concrete financial terms of the Gates’ 2021 divorce have been made public. Melinda Gates also manages some of her investments and charitable work through Pivotal Ventures, the investment company founded in 2015.Bill Gates and Melinda Gates announced their decision to formally separate their philanthropic work in 2024, three years after their divorce became public.In May 2024, Melinda French Gates said that she leaving the charitable foundation she co-founded with Bill Gates more than 20 years ago. Her last day at the foundation was June 7, 2024.""Under the terms of my agreement with Bill, in leaving the foundation, I will have an additional $12.5 billion to commit to my work on behalf of women and families,"" Melinda Gates said then in a post on social media platform X, without disclosing more details about her plans. Post her departure as co-chair, the foundation changed its name to Gates Foundation and with Bill Gates as its sole chairperson. It’s unclear where the additional $4.6 billion was allocated. The funds could have been given to French Gates’ LLC, Pivotal, which does not file a tax return, according to DealBook. As running alongside Pivotal Philanthropies is Pivotal Ventures, a LLC that does not require disclosure requirements that govern traditional nonprofits.""I am sorry to see Melinda leave, but I am sure she will have a huge impact in her future philanthropic work,"" Bill Gates wrote in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).In May 2021, Bill and Melinda French Gates announced their intention to divorce, saying they no longer believed they could “grow together”. Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board in 2020, months before the divorce was announced. The couple also reportedly agreed to the division of real estate valued at more than $170 million, an art collection worth roughly $130 million and a significant block of Microsoft stock.In March 2022, Melinda Gates claimed that Jeffrey Epstein played a role in ending their 27-year marriage. During an appearance on “CBS Mornings,” Melinda shared that she decided to leave her marriage “for many things,” including her ex-husband’s ties to Epstein. “I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” she said at the time, adding that she only met the late pedophile once because she “wanted to see who” he was.Melinda Gates has a net worth of $17.6 billion, as per Bloomberg Billioniare Index. Most of her wealth comes from her share of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, significant assets transferred during her 2021 divorce from Bill Gates (including billions in stocks and real estate), and her own organization, Pivotal Ventures, focused on women's equality.","Bill Gates reportedly quietly sent nearly $8 billion to the private foundation of his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, in what is being termed as one of the largest divorce-related payouts ever.

Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse. Quoting people familiar with the development, a Bloomberg report says that the job cuts come as the company shifts priorities to build next-generation artificial intelligence (AI). It states that the latest job cuts may put breaks on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's long-chased vision of building virtual reality for the metaverse which started in 2014 with the acquisition of virtual reality start-up Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion. Another step in this direction came in 2021, when Facebook rebranded itself as Meta.Meta’s Reality Labs Division roughly has 15,000 employees. According to the Bloomberg report, Meta may announce the cuts to Reality Labs as soon as January 13, 2025. Sources told the publication that layoffs are said to disproportionately affect those in the metaverse unit who work on virtual reality (VR) headsets and a VR-based social network.As per a memo sent by the company to employees last week, Meta’s chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, who also heads Reality Labs, has called for a ‘most important’ meeting on Wednesday - January 14, asking staff to attend in person.Last year, Zuckerberg asked top executives to make cuts to their 2026 budgets while he pours money into A.I. research. As Meta faces competition from companies like OpenAI and Google, Mr. Zuckerberg has increased the budget for TBD Lab, the skunk works unit at Meta that aims to build superintelligence, a godlike AI system.As reported by Bloomberg, the company also plans to reallocate some of the money from virtual reality products to increase the budget for its wearables division, which builds smart glasses and wristband computing devices.Despite the company spending tens of billions of dollars on developing virtual reality headset, the consumer response has been slower than expected. Investors have grown wary of Meta’s spending.In December last year, a company spokeswoman said Meta was “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward A.I. glasses,” and was not planning “any broader changes.”","Facebook-parent Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in Reality Labs Division which is behind the Meta Quest headsets, Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and the virtual reality social network known as the Metaverse.

CEO Satya Nadella says Microsoft avoiding the 'Zero-Sum' trap







During a wide-ranging discussion at the World Economic Forum 2026, Nadella said that while the competition with fellow tech giants like Google, Meta and other is fiercer than ever, the expanding role of technology in the global economy makes this a “blessed” time for the industry. His comments came amid a “pretty intense” era led by artificial intelligence (AI) and shifting global markets.“It's a pretty intense time. I mean, so the way I always think is, it's always helpful. When you have a complete new set of competitors every decade, because that keeps you fit,” Nadella said. Reflecting on his 34-year journey at Microsoft, Nadella dismissed the idea that the AI race is a zero-sum game, instead pointing to a future where tech’s share of the world's GDP will only continue to rise.Nadella highlighted that Microsoft’s longevity is rooted in its ability to adapt to new “existential” rivals every decade. He recalled joining the company in 1992 when the primary threat was Novell, further noting that the competition has now changed with its AI rivals“If you think about it, I joined Microsoft in 92 when I had Novell as the big existential competitor. Here we are in 2026, it's a pretty intense time. I'm glad there's the competition.It's, quite honestly, at the end of the day, when I look at it right as a percentage of GDP five years from now, where will Tech be right? It will be higher, so we're blessed to be in this industry,” the Microsoft CEO added.While there is a narrative that there’s a winner-takes-all scenario, Nadella insisted that the Total Addressable Market (TAM) tells a different story.“It's a lot of intense competition, but it's not so zero-sum, as some people make it out. Oh, it's getting much bigger, much more. The TAM and it’s just the impact of the stack is going to be so,” Nadella noted.While taking about customer intent, Nadella argued that the key to survival is understanding the “brand permission” a company has with its users.“The question that I always go back to is what’s the brand identity that Microsoft has and the brand permission we have, what customers expect from us,” Nadella noted.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says AI race is 'not so zero-sum, as some people make it out' Microsoft's longevity is rooted in its ability to adapt to new “existential” rivals every decade, he said.

Yann LeCun, Meta's former chief AI scientist and one of the ""godfathers"" of modern AI, has opened up about what he despised most during his 12-year tenure at the tech giant: being a manager. ""I can do management, but I don't like doing it,"" LeCun told MIT Technology Review in an interview published Thursday. ""I kind of hated being a director. I am not good at this career management thing. I'm much more visionary and a scientist.""The 65-year-old Turing Award winner, who founded Meta's influential Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) lab, announced his departure from the company in November to launch his own AI startup, AMI Labs. The Paris-based venture will focus on building ""world models""—a type of AI that learns from videos and spatial data rather than just text, which LeCun believes is the true path to artificial general intelligence.At his new venture, LeCun will serve as executive chairman while former Meta colleague Alex LeBrun handles CEO duties. It's a deliberate choice that lets him dodge the administrative work he despised. ""This is not my mission in life,"" he explained to MIT Technology Review.""It's really to make science and technology progress as far as we can.""He'll also keep teaching at NYU, where maintaining his academic position was one of three conditions he set when Mark Zuckerberg first wooed him to Facebook in 2013 over dinner and ""chicken with some pretty good white wine.""But LeCun's exit wasn't just about escaping paperwork. Meta's direction increasingly clashed with his scientific convictions, particularly after the company poured $14.3 billion into Scale AI and installed its 28-year-old CEO Alexandr Wang to oversee AI development—making Wang briefly LeCun's manager.""You don't tell a researcher what to do,"" LeCun told the Financial Times. ""You certainly don't tell a researcher like me what to do.""The real friction, though, centered on technology. LeCun has consistently argued that large language models are ""a dead end when it comes to superintelligence,"" a stance that became awkward as Meta doubled down on LLMs. ""I'm sure there's a lot of people at Meta who would like me to not tell the world that,"" he admitted, ""but I'm not gonna change my mind because some dude thinks I'm wrong.""His honesty cuts through the usual corporate doublespeak that dominates AI discussions, offering a rare peek at what happens when scientific integrity meets billion-dollar bets.","Yann LeCun, Meta's former chief AI scientist, has opened up about what he despised most during his 12-year tenure at the tech giant.

"Anthropic's test to hire engineers had this Claude 'problem', here's how the company solved it",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/anthropics-test-to-hire-engineers-had-this-claude-problem-heres-how-the-company-solved-it/articleshow/127296937.cms,"AI startup Anthropic faced a unique hiring challenge as its own Claude models began outperforming human candidates on engineering tests. Initially designed to assess performance engineers, the take-home test, simulating accelerator optimization, was repeatedly redesigned. Newer Claude versions, particularly Opus 4 and 4.

What is Anthropic’s take-home test for engineers and how Claude cracked it





Anthropic has been forced to redesign its engineering hiring test multiple times. The AI startup had to make this change because newer versions of its Claude model could solve challenges that previously distinguished top human candidates from average ones. The performance engineering team introduced a take-home test to optimise code for a simulated accelerator in 2024. The company currently employs dozens of the more than 1,000 applicants who took the test. But when given the same time limit, Claude Opus 4 outperformed the majority of human applicants, and under test conditions, Claude Opus 4.5 even matched the performance of the best candidates.In a blog post, Tristan Hume, a lead on Anthropic's performance optimisation team who designed the test, announced that he has now created three versions of the test to ensure the evaluation remains useful. He noted that humans can still outperform the models when given unlimited time. Still, under the time constraints of the take-home test, the company could no longer distinguish between output from top candidates and its most capable model.Anthropic is also releasing the original take-home as an open challenge, as the best human performance with unlimited time still exceeds what Claude can achieve.In November 2023, Anthropic needed to hire performance engineers quickly to support training Claude Opus 3.The company had secured new computing clusters and was spending more on hardware, but lacked enough engineers. When the company posted on Twitter asking for candidates, the response overwhelmed their standard interview process.To evaluate candidates more efficiently, the team designed a take-home test. Unlike typical boring tests, this one aimed to be engaging and accurately measure technical skills. The test gave candidates 2-4 hours to work in their own environment, allowed AI assistance, and focused on problems representative of real work without requiring specific domain knowledge.The test simulated a fake accelerator similar to TPUs. Candidates optimised code for this machine using tools that showed every instruction, identical to real Anthropic tooling. The task involved parallel tree traversal, deliberately avoiding deep learning topics since most candidates hadn't worked on that yet. Candidates started with basic code and progressively added optimisations.The initial test worked well. About 1,000 candidates completed it over 18 months, helping hire most of the current performance engineering team. Many candidates enjoyed it so much that they worked past the time limit. The test proved especially valuable for identifying talented candidates with limited experience on paper.However, by May 2025, Claude 3.7 Sonnet had advanced to the point that more than 50% of candidates would be better off delegating completely to Claude Code. When tested on a pre-release version of Claude Opus 4, the AI provided solutions better than almost all humans within the time limit.The team redesigned the test, using Claude Opus 4 to identify where it was struggling, and made that the new starting point. They shortened the time limit to 2 hours and added new challenges. This worked for several months until Claude Opus 4.5 matched the best human performance.After considering options such as banning AI or requiring candidates to outperform Claude by a significant margin, the team created an entirely new test based on unusual programming puzzles with heavily constrained instruction sets. This unconventional approach works because it simulates novel tasks rather than resembling typical tasks for which Claude has extensive training data."," AI startup Anthropic faced a unique hiring challenge as its own Claude models began outperforming human candidates on engineering tests. Initially designed to assess performance engineers, the take-home test, simulating accelerator optimization, was repeatedly redesigned. Newer Claude versions, particularly Opus 4 and 4.5, outperformed the majority of human applicants.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127296937,imgsize-18556,width-400,resizemode-4/127296937.jpg"

This move signals growing confidence in AI coding tools, with even non-technical staff encouraged to experiment. Nvidia's CEO also recently urged engineers to embrace AI coding assistants, highlighting a significant industry shift.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang joins the Claude chorus

What this means for Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI





Microsoft is asking thousands of its software engineers to work with both Claude Code and GitHub Copilot—and report back on which one works better. The move signals the company's growing confidence in Anthropic's AI coding tools, even as it continues to sell GitHub Copilot as its flagship product to enterprise customers.According to a report from The Verge, Microsoft's CoreAI team and its massive Experiences + Devices division—responsible for Windows, Office, Teams, Edge, and Surface—were instructed last week to install Claude Code. The company is even encouraging non-technical employees like designers and project managers to experiment with the tool for rapid prototyping. Microsoft has also greenlit Claude Code access across all repositories for its Business and Industry Copilot teams.The timing couldn't be more striking. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently told engineers at his $3 trillion company to stop writing code manually and focus on solving ""undiscovered problems"" instead. Speaking on the No Priors AI podcast, Huang revealed that every Nvidia engineer now uses AI coding assistants like Cursor throughout their workday. At the World Economic Forum, he went further, calling Claude ""incredible"" and urging every software company to adopt it.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella disclosed in April 2025 that up to 30% of Microsoft's codebase is now AI-generated, a figure that continues to climb. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has made similar claims, stating that over 30% of new code at Google comes from AI. The shift is reshaping how tech giants approach software development—and raising questions about the future of junior developer roles.Microsoft remains deeply committed to its partnership with OpenAI, which powers much of its Copilot infrastructure. Frank Shaw, Microsoft's communications chief, emphasized that ""OpenAI continues to be our primary partner and model provider on frontier models."" But the company signed a separate deal with Anthropic in November, giving Microsoft Foundry customers access to Claude Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.1, and Haiku 4.5. That agreement also includes Anthropic's commitment to purchase $30 billion in Azure compute capacity.The internal pilot program reflects a pragmatic reality: developers increasingly rely on multiple AI tools depending on the task. While Microsoft sells GitHub Copilot externally, its willingness to deploy Claude Code internally suggests it may eventually offer Anthropic's tools to cloud customers as well. For now, the company is betting that letting its engineers compare both platforms will reveal which approach delivers the best results.","Microsoft is testing Anthropic's Claude Code alongside its own GitHub Copilot.

She advocates for leader-led training, citing a client whose 300 leaders had to directly use AI tools before progress was made. This hands-on approach, starting with top executives, is crucial for unlocking AI's potential and ensuring widespread adoption across all sectors.

“If leaders don't understand AI, they can't lead the company through the changes. In three years, you should be able to say, 'My company has different services and has different insights.' That requires a depth of learning from leaders first, and then you have to bring everybody along the way. So leader-led learning is absolutely critical.”

“It's also critical for regulators and regulated industries: if regulators block AI, they won't be able to scale or succeed. So governments, non-profits and companies all need leader-led learning and then a strategy to bring all of our people along,”

“concrete example”

“put it for my workforce or for my citizens.”

“Well, one of my clients told me that, until they had their 300 leaders touch keyboards and see what AI could do, they couldn't get moving. That's a very tangible example. That's the first thing we did way back after November 2022; most of the training was actually for our top 50 leaders who actually got their hands dirty, understanding it, and that's what we mean by leader-led learning. And once you have that, it unlocks the possibilities of what it really means that it's going to change everything.

Accenture CEO Julie Sweet has shared an example showing how other companies and their leaders can learn from Accenture’s approach to training employees to use AI tools effectively.

The warning comes weeks after the company shared plans to deploy humanoid robots starting in 2028, sending the company shares rallying to record highs. However, the move was ‘not welcome’ for workersCiting an internal letter by the ‌union, news agency Reuters reported that the union accused Hyundai of seeking to boost profits by deploying robots to reduce workforce.“Remember that without labour–management agreement, not a single robot using new technology will be allowed to enter the workplace,” the union said in the letter.Reportedly, the union also criticised Hyundai’s efforts to shift production to the US, arguing that the automaker’s new factory in Georgia was already making a dent in the ‍domestic production and threatening job security at two of its factories in Korea.Hyundai Motor and its affiliate Kia together are the world's third-biggest automaker by sales.

$101 Billion in 1 Day: How Larry Ellison Became the World’s Richest Man Explained

Hollywood impact and regulatory scrutiny





Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters has rejected Paramount Skydance’s $108 billion hostile bud for Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), calling it unrealistic without the financial backing of Oracle founder Larry Ellison. In an interview with Financial Times, Peters said Paramount’s proposal ‘doesn’t pass the sniff test’ and relies too heavily on debt and external support. He contrasted it with Netflix’s revised $82.7 billion all-cash offer, which he argued is far more stable. “That additional leverage required for Paramount’s bid is pretty crazy,” Peters said.As per the report, Paramount has taken its offer directly to WBD shareholders after the board rejected it. However, the early filings show Paramount has secured only about 7% of WBD shares which are far short of the majority needed to gain control. Analysts also point out that Netflix’s cash-backed proposal is gaining stronger traction among investors wary of debt-heavy deals.A potential Netflix-Warner Bros. merger would reshape Hollywood, combining franchises like Game of Thrones and Harry Potter with Netflix originals such as Stranger Things and Squid Game.The consolidation has sparked concern among filmmakers, unions, and theater owners about Netflix’s growing influence over theatrical releases.Peters sought to ease those fears, pledging that Netflix would honor Warner Bros.’ traditional 45-day theatrical window. Regulators in both the U.S. and Europe are expected to scrutinize the deal closely, given its sweeping implications for competition and consumer choice.Peters emphasized that Netflix’s competition extends beyond traditional studios, pointing to YouTube (Alphabet Inc.), Amazon.com Inc., and Apple Inc. as rivals in the streaming and entertainment space. He also noted that Netflix accounts for less than 10% of TV viewing hours in most markets, underscoring the fragmented nature of global media consumption.","Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters has rejected Paramount Skydance’s $108 billion hostile bud for Warner Bros.

Meaning of the quote of the day Microsoft co-founder by Bill Gates



Staying humble in a world of constant wins



Why failure is actually the better instructor



Bill Gates and the danger of overconfidence in 2026



Final thoughts on the Gates philosophy







Success is a concept we are all taught to chase from the moment we can understand the word. We see it in the headlines, on our social feeds, and in the lives of the people we admire. But Bill Gates, a man who has lived at the absolute peak of global influence and wealth for decades, has a different take on it. He famously said, ""Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose."" It’s a bit of a reality check, isn't it? Coming from someone who co-founded Microsoft and spent years as the richest person on the planet, you’d expect him to be success’s biggest cheerleader. Instead, he’s warning us that the very thing we want can actually be the thing that trips us up. He’s talking about that dangerous mix of ego and comfort that creeps in when things are going well.When Gates says success is a lousy teacher, he’s cutting through the fluff of typical motivational speeches. The core meaning here is about the psychological trap of ""winning."" When you fail, you’re forced to look in the mirror. You have to take apart your process, find the cracks, and figure out exactly where you messed up. That’s where the real learning happens. But when you succeed? You usually just pat yourself on the back.You assume that because you won, every decision you made along the way was the right one. This creates a blind spot.The second part of the quote—the idea that success ""seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose""—is even more pointed. Smart people are often the most vulnerable to this. If you’ve spent your life being right, it’s easy to start believing that you are inherently better or smarter than the market or the competition. Success makes you feel invincible. It lulls you into a state of complacency where you stop looking for risks because you don't believe they apply to you anymore. For Gates, this wasn't just a theory; it was a lesson he lived through at Microsoft during the rise of the internet and later the mobile era, where past dominance sometimes made it harder to see the next big shift coming.It’s hard to stay grounded when everyone is telling you how great you are. In today’s culture, we celebrate the ""win"" so loudly that we forget to check if the win was actually repeatable or just a stroke of luck. Bill Gates’ current work in 2026 shows he’s still trying to apply this logic. Despite his massive net worth—which still sits comfortably over $100 billion—he’s moved far beyond the world of software. He’s currently knee-deep in high-risk, high-reward projects like the ""Horizon 1000"" initiative.Just this month, in January 2026, the Gates Foundation partnered with OpenAI, committing $50 million to bring AI-driven healthcare to 1,000 clinics across Africa, starting in Rwanda. This isn't the move of someone who thinks they've already ""won"" everything. It's the move of someone who knows that the challenges of global health and climate change are much harder than building an operating system. He’s putting his resources into areas where failure is a very real possibility, which keeps that ""lousy teacher"" of success at a distance.If success is a bad teacher, then failure is the strict professor you hated in college but realised later taught you everything you know. Failure doesn't let you off the hook. It demands an explanation. When a project falls apart or a business goes under, the pain of that loss acts as a powerful motivator to never let it happen again. You become more observant. You look at the data more closely.I remember a time when I put everything into a project that I was certain would be a ""slam dunk."" I didn't even have a backup plan because I was so convinced of my own brilliance. When it inevitably tanked, I was crushed. But looking back, that failure taught me more about risk management and humility than any of my previous successes ever did. It stripped away the ego and made me a better strategist. I think that's what Gates is getting at. You have to be willing to be wrong to eventually be right in a way that actually lasts.Even now, as we navigate 2026, the tech landscape is shifting faster than ever. With AI moving from a buzzword to a fundamental part of our infrastructure, the risk of overconfidence is huge. Companies that were the kings of the hill five years ago are finding themselves scrambling. Gates has always been a student of history, and he knows that the graveyard of business is filled with ""smart people"" who thought they couldn't lose.Look at his recent investments in nuclear energy through TerraPower. On January 21, 2026, it was reported that South Korean energy giants are taking major stakes in his Natrium nuclear plant project in Wyoming. This is a sector where success is incredibly difficult to achieve and the regulatory hurdles are massive. Gates isn't playing it safe. He’s deliberately stepping into arenas where he has to prove himself all over again. He's avoiding the ""seduction"" of his past achievements by constantly starting new, difficult chapters.At the end of the day, Bill Gates isn't saying we shouldn't strive for success. He’s just saying we shouldn't trust it. Success is a temporary state, not a permanent trait. If you want to keep growing, you have to treat your wins with a bit of suspicion. Ask yourself: ""Did I win because I’m a genius, or did I just get lucky?"" Most of the time, it's a bit of both. By staying curious and keeping a bit of that ""loser’s hunger,"" you can avoid the trap of thinking you’re untouchable. It’s a tough way to live—always looking for the hole in your own boat—but it’s the only way to keep from sinking.","Bill Gates famously said, ""Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose"" The core meaning here is about the psychological trap of ""winning"" When you fail, you’re forced to look in the mirror and figure out exactly where you messed up.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127271649,imgsize-32814,width-400,resizemode-4/bill-gates-image-source-reuters.jpg"

Jensen Huang explains why AI changes tasks, not the purpose of jobs

AI-Powered Future: Next Gen Careers You Should Watch

AI did not replace radiologists it made them more in demand

AI helps Jensen Huang type less, but think more

Software engineering and hiring growth

Legal and service industries adapt

Redesigning work, not removing it

A shift in how work is done





People are getting more and more worried about losing their jobs as AI becomes more common in the workplace. Many workers are worried that machines could completely take over human jobs, from offices to hospitals. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, thinks this fear misses an important point. Speaking on the No Priors podcast, Huang offered a calm and practical view of how AI is actually changing the workplace. He says that AI is not taking away the purpose of jobs. It's not changing the jobs themselves; it's changing how some parts of them are done. AI takes care of boring or time-consuming tasks so that people can focus on things that need human judgment, experience, and responsibility. Huang's argument is based on examples from the real world in healthcare, technology, law, and even the service industry.One of the main things Jensen Huang talked about was the difference between tasks and goals. People do tasks every day, like typing reports, looking over documents, or scanning pictures. Purpose is the reason the job exists in the first place.Huang explained that AI is very good at handling tasks, especially those that are repetitive or rule-based.However, it does not replace the core purpose of a role. In many cases, removing these smaller tasks allows professionals to do their jobs better and on a larger scale.Radiology is often cited as a field that AI would disrupt or shrink. Years ago, some experts predicted that automated image analysis would reduce the need for radiologists. Huang pointed out that the opposite has happened.Recent data shows that in 2025, diagnostic radiology residency programs offered 1,208 positions, a 4 percent increase compared to the previous year. Radiology has also become the second-highest-paid medical speciality, with average incomes reaching $520,000. This marks a 48 percent increase since 2015.AI now helps radiologists read scans faster and more accurately. But the core responsibility, diagnosing disease and guiding treatment, still depends on human expertise. Because hospitals can now process more cases, they earn more revenue and hire more specialists.Huang used his own role to explain the idea further. He said much of his day is spent typing, reviewing information, and communicating. AI tools that help automate writing or summarising tasks save him time.However, he made it clear that this has not reduced his workload. Instead, it allows him to handle more responsibilities. AI takes away the stress of smaller tasks, which helps him focus on making decisions, planning, and leading.AI is also having a big effect on software development. AI tools can now write code, find bugs, and speed up the development process. Some assume this means fewer engineers are needed.Huang rejected this view. At Nvidia, the company continues to hire engineers even as AI tools become more capable. Faster development means more projects can be taken on. That, in turn, creates demand for skilled people who can design systems, solve problems, and guide long-term technical direction.The legal profession is also changing. AI can quickly review documents and search through large volumes of data. Still, lawyers remain essential for protecting clients, resolving disputes, and applying judgment in complex situations.Huang also spoke about service jobs, such as restaurants. Even if AI takes over tasks like order-taking or delivery, the purpose of the job remains unchanged. The goal is still to make customers happy. People who work adapt by focusing more on personal interaction, problem-solving, and the quality of service.Huang's main point is that AI doesn't take jobs away; it changes the way people do them. The most affected are jobs that require you to do the same things over and over. Jobs that require results, care, creativity, and responsibility still need people.AI is a tool that helps workers get more done. It helps businesses serve more customers, patients, or users by making them more productive, which usually means they hire more people.AI is changing how work is done instead of taking jobs away. It clears up bottlenecks, makes everyday tasks go faster, and gives professionals more time to focus on what's really important. Huang says that in the future, work won't be about fighting AI. Instead, it will be about figuring out how to use it to get better results while keeping people at the center.","Jensen Huang explains why AI changes tasks, not the purpose of jobs.

What’s happening now and what happens next





When Craig Federighi picked up his iPhone one afternoon in early 2025, he wasn't expecting to have his world turned upside down. Apple 's software chief was just doing what he always does before a major release—testing the product himself, making sure it works the way the commercials promise it will.This time, it didn't.The commercials had been running for months. In one, actress Bella Ramsey asks Siri about someone she'd met at a café weeks earlier, and the assistant instantly recalls the name. In another, users navigate their phones entirely by voice, jumping between apps with the ease of thought. These weren't just ads—they were Apple's promise that it had finally cracked AI.Federighi tried the features. They failed. He tried again. Still nothing. According to Bloomberg, he was genuinely shocked at how broken everything was. The new Siri that was supposed to launch in weeks didn't work properly about a third of the time. Sometimes it was worse.Apple pulled the ads. It pushed back the launch. And this week, more than a year later, the company announced it would be handing the whole problem to Google.The partnership means Apple will power its revamped Siri with Google's Gemini models, in a deal worth roughly $1 billion a year.For a company that prides itself on controlling every piece of the user experience, it's a remarkable admission: we can't build this ourselves.But how did the company that invented the modern voice assistant—the one that made ""Hey Siri"" part of everyday language—end up here?Apple had been working on the Siri overhaul for years. The plan was straightforward enough: take the old assistant that sets timers and plays music, then bolt on the kind of sophisticated AI that powers ChatGPT. The result would be an assistant that actually understands context, can take actions across apps, and feels less like a voice-activated search box and more like a genuine helper.The problem was that merging old code with new AI proved far harder than anyone expected. ""We initially wanted to do a hybrid architecture,"" Federighi later explained at Apple's developer conference in June 2025, ""but we realised that approach wasn't going to get us to Apple quality.""That's corporate-speak for: it was a disaster.Behind the scenes, engineers were drowning in bugs. The Information reported that team members described it as ""whack-a-mole""—fix one issue, and three more would pop up. The hybrid system created integration nightmares. Features that looked promising when tested individually would fall apart when everything ran together.In an internal meeting in March 2025, Robby Walker—the senior director then running the Siri team—tried to rally his staff. ""We swam hundreds of miles,"" he told them, according to Bloomberg. ""But we still didn't swim to Hawaii.He admitted they'd been ""jumped on, not for the amazing swimming that we did, but the fact that we didn't get to the destination."" Walker also acknowledged he wasn't even sure when the features would actually ship. There were other priorities now. Maybe they'd make it into iOS 19 in the fall. Maybe not.Some team members weren't buying the pep talk. ""There are hundreds of bugs right now,"" one engineer told Bloomberg. ""There's no leadership.""While Apple struggled with its own AI, its people started leaving.It began in July 2025, when Ruoming Pang—the distinguished engineer who'd built Apple's foundation models team from scratch—announced he was going to Meta. The compensation package was jaw-dropping: more than $200 million over several years, according to Bloomberg.Within weeks, his top lieutenants followed. Tom Gunter and Mark Lee went to Meta. Then Bowen Zhang. Then Yun Zhu. Meta was offering annual packages between $10 million and $40 million for senior AI researchers, money that Apple's traditional pay structure simply couldn't match. OpenAI grabbed a few others. Anthropic took some too. By August, the Financial Times counted about a dozen departures from Apple's AI team since the start of the year—devastating losses for a foundation models group that numbered only around 50 to 60 people to begin with.""Ruoming Pang leaving is huge,"" Aaron Sines of recruiting firm Razoroo told the FT. ""It sends a signal of a crisis of confidence around what is to come.""The exodus revealed something uncomfortable about Apple's position. For years, working at Apple meant something—prestige, purpose, the chance to shape products used by a billion people. But AI researchers had discovered they had other options, options that came with compensation packages that made Apple's offers look quaint.Apple tried to stem the bleeding. Bloomberg reported the company offered raises to engineers still on the foundation models team. But those increases were ""a far cry from Meta's offers."" When you're competing with nine-figure packages, standard salary bumps don't move the needle.There's another reason Apple couldn't keep pace with its rivals, and it's one the company rarely talks about: its own values keep getting in the way.While Meta trains AI on user data harvested from billions of Facebook and Instagram accounts, and while OpenAI builds models by scraping the internet, Apple has spent years constructing a privacy-first architecture that makes those approaches impossible.Here's the uncomfortable truth: AI threatens Apple's way of doing business in more ways than one. The technology doesn't just open the door to possibly replacing the iPhone. It fundamentally conflicts with Tim Cook's ethos around user privacy.Consider the gap. Meta's AI can access everything users post, like, and share. Google trains on search history, emails, and YouTube habits. OpenAI's ChatGPT has intimate confessions from millions of users who've poured their thoughts into the chatbot, apparently forgetting that someone—or something—is listening.Apple built Private Cloud Compute instead, a system where even cloud-processed AI queries are encrypted and never stored. The company allows users to opt out of data collection. Its web crawler lets websites block Apple's AI from learning from their content. Many sites have done exactly that, the Information reported, creating yet another handicap.""There are a thousand noes for everything in this area,"" one person familiar with Apple's AI work told Bloomberg. ""You have to fight through the privacy police to get anything done.""The principled stance has a cost. Apple's internal chatbot was at least 25% less accurate than ChatGPT at answering most queries, according to company data described to Bloomberg. Less data means worse AI. It's that simple.By spring 2025, Tim Cook had seen enough. According to Bloomberg, the CEO concluded that John Giannandrea—the former Google executive hired in 2018 specifically to fix Apple's AI problems—couldn't execute on product development.The solution was dramatic. Strip Siri from Giannandrea's control entirely. Hand it to Mike Rockwell, the hardware veteran who'd created the Vision Pro headset. Put Rockwell under Craig Federighi, who would now own Apple's entire AI product roadmap.Giannandrea kept his title—senior vice president of machine learning and AI strategy—but his actual responsibilities shrank. He'd oversee research and infrastructure, important work but no longer the stuff that shows up in keynote presentations.Bloomberg reported that some executives have discussed shrinking his role even further or easing him toward retirement. He's 60 now, and while he's told colleagues he wants to stay until Apple's AI is ""in proper shape,"" people close to the situation say he's also professed relief that Siri is ""now someone else's problem.""The reshuffling exposed tensions that had been simmering for years. The Information reported that Federighi, known for being cost-conscious and skeptical of risky investments, had long resisted the kind of massive AI spending that rivals embraced. Around 2019, he'd reportedly shot down a proposal to use AI for rearranging iPhone home screens, arguing it would confuse users.Even after ChatGPT's launch in late 2022 convinced him AI mattered, Federighi's instincts clashed with what the technology demanded. ""In the world of AI, you really don't know what the product is until you've done the investment,"" one longtime Apple executive told Bloomberg. ""That's not how Apple is wired.""Faced with failing models and fleeing talent, Apple started shopping around. The company met with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google to discuss partnerships. It even built two parallel versions of the new Siri internally—one powered by Apple's own models, codenamed ""Linwood,"" and another running on third-party tech, codenamed ""Glenwood.""Anthropic was initially the frontrunner, Bloomberg reported. But the AI startup's financial demands were steep—it wanted a multibillion-dollar annual fee that would increase sharply each year. That sent Apple looking elsewhere.Google closed the deal for a few reasons. First, its Gemini 3 model topped AI leaderboards when it launched in November 2025, proving the search giant had caught up to OpenAI. Second, Google had something AI startups lack: a proven track record running large-scale services for corporate clients. Third, and perhaps most importantly, Apple and Google already had a template for this kind of arrangement.Google pays Apple around $20 billion a year to be Safari's default search engine, a deal that survived antitrust scrutiny and remains wildly profitable for both companies. The AI partnership follows similar logic: Google provides the technology, Apple controls the user experience, both benefit from the iPhone's massive installed base.The Financial Times estimated the AI contract could be worth $5 billion for Google over time, structured as cloud computing services rather than direct licensing.With Giannandrea sidelined and Rockwell reporting to him, Federighi now controls Apple's entire AI roadmap. And the Google deal? That was his call. Federighi himself, by late 2025 had consolidated near-total control over Apple's AI direction.According to The Information, Federighi spent years as an AI skeptic, rejecting proposals from his lieutenants who tried to convince him the technology mattered. He preferred software that behaved predictably, where engineers could specify exactly how features would work during design reviews. AI's algorithmic unpredictability made him uncomfortable.When engineers pitched him on a feature that would use AI to dynamically reorganise the iPhone home screen based on usage patterns, Federighi shut it down. His reasoning: it would disorient users who expect their apps to stay in the same place. Apple does offer Siri Suggestions widgets that surface apps proactively, but nothing as ambitious as what was proposed.The Information also reported that Federighi ""tends to scrutinise every detail of his team's expenses, down to their budgets for bananas and other office snacks."" He's resisted paying AI researchers the kind of salaries that have become standard at Meta and OpenAI, concerned about creating compensation disparities with Apple's executive team.But ChatGPT changed Federighi's calculus. After experimenting with OpenAI's chatbot in late 2022, he told colleagues he'd come to appreciate what the technology could do. He tasked his teams with finding ways to integrate similar capabilities into Apple products.Once converted, Federighi moved decisively. When Apple's homegrown models proved inadequate, he led the charge to evaluate external alternatives. He oversaw the ""bake-off"" between different AI providers. And when the Google deal came together, it was Federighi's decision to structure it so Apple could swap AI providers if needed—a hedge against lock-in that reflects his careful, pragmatic approach.The Google partnership solves Apple's immediate crisis, but it doesn't answer the bigger question: what happens when AI becomes the primary way people interact with technology?Apple is reportedly building a new Siri experience, codenamed ""Campos,"" that will work as a full chatbot embedded across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. It's scheduled to launch later this year. But here's the interesting part: Bloomberg reports that Apple is designing the system so the underlying AI models can be swapped out over time.Gemini today. Maybe Anthropic's Claude tomorrow. Or OpenAI's next GPT. Or even Apple's own models if they ever improve enough.This plug-and-play architecture reveals Apple's bet: that AI models will become commodities, powerful but ultimately interchangeable. If that's true, the real advantage shifts to design, privacy controls, hardware integration—things Apple actually excels at.It's the same playbook Apple has used for technologies it doesn't own. The company doesn't run its own search engine or cellular networks or maps (well, not successfully). Instead, it packages third-party services into products people want to use.Whether that works for AI remains to be seen. The risk is that by outsourcing the foundation, Apple cedes the ability to create breakthrough features that require deep integration between models and hardware. The next revolutionary product might demand capabilities only a company that controls the full AI stack can deliver.There's also the branding problem. Apple Intelligence was supposed to be ""AI for the rest of us""—simple, reliable, distinctly Apple. Revealing it's actually running on Google's brain doesn't quite fit that narrative.But Apple doesn't have many options left. The company that revolutionised voice assistants in 2011 let Siri stagnate for over a decade. When the AI revolution arrived, Apple was caught unprepared. Delays piled up. Talent fled. Internal models underperformed.Now it's trying something different: admitting it can't do everything alone, and hoping that's enough.","Apple will power its revamped Siri with Google's Gemini models, in a deal worth roughly $1 billion a year. The new Siri that was supposed to launch in weeks didn't work properly about a third of the time. The problem was that merging old code with new AI proved far harder than anyone expected.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127256996,imgsize-490463,width-400,resizemode-4/127256996.jpg"

How TikTok will change under US leadership



President Donald Trump says he ‘saved TikTok’







TikTok has officially transitioned to US-led ownership, putting an end to years-long geopolitical standoff. The short-video giant has announced that it has finalised a complex divestment deal, essentially cutting its primary ties with its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to avoid a permanent nationwide in America. The deal has created a new entity called TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, and it has facilitated by President Donald Trump.This means that by licensing the app’s algorithm and housing all operations within US borders, the Chinese company has satisfied national security requirements that have plagued it since 2020. Moreover, the newly-formed joint venture will be governed by a seven-member, majority-American board. Adam Presser, a former WarnerMedia executive, has been tapped as the CEO of the US operations.The ownership of TikTok is now split among a consortium of high-profile global and American investors. These include Oracle, Silver Lake, MGX, ByteDance and a group of Strategic Investors.TikTok is not just changing hands but the core working of the app will be different. Under Oracle, the algorithm is being “retrained” exclusively on US user data, ensuring that the data used to predict user preferences never leaves American soil and is not accessible by foreign entities.This will means that the, localised new version of the algorithm is expected to feel different to the 200 million Americans on the platform, potentially leading to a “slower” or less accurate recommendation feed compared to the global version.Trump celebrated the deal on social media, stating he was “happy to have helped in saving TikTok”.“I am so happy to have helped in saving TikTok! It will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice. Along with other factors, it was responsible for my doing so well with the Youth Vote in the 2024 Presidential Election,” Trump posted on Truth Social. He had previously postponed enforcement of ban legislation to allow for negotiations.“I only hope that long into the future I will be remembered by those who use and love TikTok. Thank you to Vice President JD Vance, and all of the others within my Administration, who helped bring this Deal to a very dramatic, final, and beautiful conclusion. I would also like to thank President Xi, of China, for working with us and, ultimately, approving the Deal. He could have gone the other way, but didn’t, and is appreciated for his decision. PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP” he added.","TikTok has officially transitioned to US-led ownership, putting an end to years- long geopolitical standoff.

OpenAI board chairman Bret Taylor has declared AI is ""probably"" a bubble, expecting market correction and consolidation in coming years. Speaking at Davos, Taylor—who also founded $10 billion AI startup Sierra—compared the current landscape to the 1999 dot-com bubble. Despite calling himself an AI optimist, he believes both ""smart"" and ""dumb money"" are flooding the sector, though he expects the free market to eventually determine real winners.

From dot-com bust to AI boom: Taylor draws parallels

Sierra's $10 billion valuation amid bubble warnings





Bret Taylor, the chairman of OpenAI 's board, has stated that artificial intelligence is ""probably"" a bubble and expects a market correction in the coming years. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, Taylor told CNBC that both ""smart money"" and ""dumb money"" are currently funding AI competitors at every layer of the tech stack.""When everyone knows that AI is going to have a huge impact on the economy across a huge range of industries and workflows, money is plentiful,"" Taylor explained. He added that while he expects consolidation and correction over the next few years, innovation requires ""that kind of messy competition.""Taylor, who also co-founded AI customer service startup Sierra, described himself as an AI optimist despite his bubble concerns. He believes the free market will ultimately determine which AI players have the best products and where the real value lies.This isn't the first time Taylor has expressed these views. In a September 2025 interview with The Verge, he drew comparisons between today's AI landscape and the late 1990s dot-com bubble. While many companies failed when that bubble burst, Taylor argued that ""all the people in 1999 were kind of right"" because the internet eventually created massive economic value through companies like Amazon and Google ""I think it is both true that AI will transform the economy, and I think it will, like the internet, create huge amounts of economic value in the future,"" Taylor told The Verge. ""I think we're also in a bubble, and a lot of people will lose a lot of money. I think both are absolutely true at the same time.""Taylor's bubble warnings come as his own company rides the AI wave. Sierra, which builds AI agents for customer service, raised $350 million in September 2025 at a $10 billion valuation—a figure Taylor himself acknowledged ""almost seems quaint"" given the growing number of $100 billion-plus AI companies.Before launching Sierra, Taylor served as co-CEO of Salesforce, board chairman of Twitter during Elon Musk's takeover, CTO at Facebook (now Meta), and co-created Google Maps. His extensive tech industry experience gives weight to his predictions about AI's trajectory and potential pitfalls.","Bret Taylor, the chairman of OpenAI's board, has stated that artificial intelligence is ""probably"" a bubble.

Facing new competition

Jamie Dimon calls for phased deployment of AI





JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said that even after two decades the mistakes that haunt him most are not the failed deals or bad calls, but they are the moments he moved too slowly. As reported by Fortune, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davis, Dimon described that bureaucratic inertia and delayed personnel decisions as the most costly errors of his career, especially in an era where artificial intelligence is accelerating the pace of chance. “Inertia has become an unforgivable sin,” Dimon said, underscoring how hesitation can cripple even the largest institutions.That urgency is the reason behind JPMorgan’s aggressive embrace of artificial intelligence, which Dimon called the most consequential technological shift of his lifetime. Far from a side project, AI is embedded across the bank’s operations — from fraud detection and credit decisions to marketing and customer service. The bank has deployed more than 500 AI use cases and built an internal large language model used weekly by 50,000 employees.Dimon also warned that legacy bans can no longer rely on scale or repetition alone. The competitive landscape now incorporates fintech disruptors like Stripe, PayPal, Chime and SoFi, which can chip away at traditional banking services with speed and precision. “Firms that move too slowly risk losing business to faster, more focused competitors,” he said.Along with this, Dimon also recognised that AI will eliminate some jobs, reshape others and also create new ones. The real danger, he believes is not the technology itself but the speed at which it advances compared to society’s ability to adapt. “You’ll have civil unrest,” Dimon warned, if displacement arrives in sudden, concentrated waves.To mitigate that risk, Dimon proposed a phased approach to AI deployment, with governments and companies working together to slow mass layoffs and support retraining. He suggested that local negotiations — not sweeping federal mandates — would be the most effective way to manage the transition. Pressed on whether JPMorgan would accept government-imposed limits on layoffs, Dimon was unequivocal: “We would agree if we have to do that to save society,” he said.","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said that bureaucratic inertia and delayed personnel decisions are the most costly errors of his career.

Elon Musk’s surprise appearance at World Economic Forum





Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made his first-ever appearance on the stage of World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos, Switzerland. In his debut appearance, Musk declared that aging is a ‘very solvable problem’. He suggests that humanity may be on the cusp of reversing the biological clock. As reported by Business Insider, speaking onstage with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, the Tesla chief offered a provocative take on longevity, societal implications of immortality and cellular aging. “When we figure out what causes aging, I think we’ll find it’s incredibly obvious,” Musk said. “All the cells in your body age at the same rate. I’ve never seen someone with an old left arm and a young right arm.”Musk also speculated that a master biological clock must be synchronizing the aging process across the body’s 35 trillion cells — a mechanism he believes science will soon decode. Yet, Musk tempered his optimism with a philosophical warning: death, he argued, serves a purpose. “There is some benefit to death,” he said. “If people live for a very long time, there’s a risk of ossification of things getting locked in place.It may become stultifying. A lack of vibrancy.”Musk took the stage at the global conference he has long derided as ""boring"" confab of out-of-touch elites. And the man who interviewed Elon Musk is Blackrock CEO Larry Fink. Introducing Elon Musk, Fink said, ""There are so many myths around Elon Musk. I could tell you he is a great friend, and I constantly learn so much from him. I am totally inspired by what he has done... Who he is... His vision of the future, and I don't think it's such a bad future. ""Elon Musk also made a robot promise at the event. Musk said that Tesla expects to sell humanoid robots to the public by the end of next year, later than the timeline he had previously outlined. ""Who wouldn't want a robot to watch over your kids, take care of your pet... If you had a robot that could take care and protect an elderly parent, that'd be great,"" he told the audience.His Optimus robots will be doing more complex tasks later this year, he said, and ""by the end of next year I think we'll be selling humanoid robots to the public"".

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said that the AI company’s application programming interface (API) business added more than $1 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in the last month, highlighting strong demand from developers and enterprises using OpenAI ’s models. Sharing a post on X (formerly Twitter), Altman said that while OpenAI is widely known for its AI bot ChatGPT, its API team has been driving significant growth behind the scenes. “We have added more than $1B of ARR in the last month just from our API business,” Sam Altman wrote in the post, adding “People think of us mostly as ChatGPT, but the API team is doing amazing work!”.The comments come amidst growing concerns among investors are closely watching OpenAI’s long-term sustainability, especially as the comedy is reportedly considering an initial public offering (IPO) and face rising costs linked to building and running large-scale AI systems.Earlier this week, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis called OpenAI’s ChatGPT ad test a premature revenue push. Last week, the company announced that it will begin testing ads in ChatGPT in the coming weeks. Commenting on the announcement, Hassabis said “It's interesting they've gone for that so early,” adding “Maybe they feel they need to make more revenue.”Several investors have warned of a possible financial risk at OpenAI.In November 2025, tech analyst and professor Scott Galloway issued a warning against possible financial implosion at OpenAI which he then described as a “trainwreck from a financial management perspective.”Recently, veteran investor George Noble argued that the company is ""falling apart in real time"" despite its eye-watering $500 billion valuation. In a scathing analysis titled ‘OPENAI IS FALLING APART IN REAL TIME’ on X, Noble highlighted what he calls unmistakable signs of trouble. The biggest red flag? OpenAI's internal ""Code Red"" memo in December, where Sam Altman reportedly told employees to drop everything as Google's Gemini eats into ChatGPT's dominance.Deutsche Bank has also projected the company will rack up $143 billion in cumulative losses before seeing profit.

"Microsoft Outlook Outages : Microsoft Teams, Outlook back online after 8-hour outage; thousands affected",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-teams-outlook-back-online-after-8-hour-outage-thousands-affected/articleshow/127228959.cms,"Microsoft Teams and several other Microsoft 365 services have been restored following a massive outage that lasted over eight hours on January 23, leaving thousands of users unable to access their emails, files, and collaboration tools.

When the fix makes things worse

Slow recovery as workers clock out





Microsoft Teams and several other Microsoft 365 services limped back online January 23 evening after an eight-hour outage that left thousands of workers staring at error messages instead of their inboxes.The trouble started around 11:40 a.m. Pacific time. Outlook took the hardest hit, with nearly 15,000 frustrated users flooding Down Detector at the peak. Microsoft 365, Teams, and the admin center also went dark, turning what should have been a normal Thursday into an unexpected digital detox for businesses across North America.Microsoft pinpointed the problem to its North American infrastructure choking on traffic it couldn't process. But here's where it gets messy: the company's first attempt at a fix actually made things worse. Their load balancing tweak ""incidentally introduced additional traffic imbalances,"" according to Microsoft's own status page—tech speak for ""we accidentally broke more stuff while trying to fix the original problem. ""By evening, Microsoft declared its infrastructure back to a ""healthy state"" and claimed improvements were rolling in.Reality told a different story. Social media filled with users reporting they still couldn't send emails or access admin portals hours later. One X user summed it up: ""We are still 100% down.""The timing worked in Microsoft's favor, though. As East Coast offices emptied out for the day, reports naturally dropped—making it hard to tell if the service actually recovered or people just gave up and went home.This marks Microsoft's second multi-hour outage this week, following Tuesday's disruption.","Microsoft Teams and several other Microsoft 365 services have been restored following a massive outage that lasted over eight hours.

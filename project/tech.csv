How it compares with Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has experienced one of the most remarkable increases in net worth this year, placing him right behind Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index reveals that Huang has experienced a $76 billion surge in his net worth in 2024. This increase surpasses even that of Jeff Bezos, who holds the title of the second-richest person in the world. The growth in Huang’s wealth is largely attributed to Nvidia's dominance in the artificial intelligence and semiconductor sectors, which have seen explosive growth this year.Nvidia, under Huang’s leadership, has become a key player in the booming AI industry, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) playing a critical role in powering everything from generative AI to cloud computing. The company’s chips are essential for training advanced AI models, and as demand for AI technology skyrocketed, Nvidia’s market value followed suit, reaching new all-time highs.As of recent estimates, Huang’s net worth has soared to more than $45 billion. This surge in wealth has positioned Huang as one of the top three beneficiaries of the AI boom, following Musk, who has made billions from Tesla and SpaceX, and Zuckerberg, whose net worth has seen a significant boost thanks to Meta's pivot towards the metaverse and AI-driven technologies.Nvidia’s shares, which account for the majority of Jensen Huang’s fortune, have soared by 177% in 2024. Huang, along with his family trusts, owns approximately a 3.5% stake in the company. This impressive performance follows an even more remarkable return of nearly 240% in 2023, highlighting the company’s continued dominance in the AI and semiconductor sectors. The company’s explosive growth has cemented Huang’s position as one of the world’s wealthiest individuals.To compare, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, added the most to his fortune in 2024, becoming the first person to surpass a $400 billion net worth. This milestone helped boost Musk's wealth by 77%. Meanwhile, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s net worth surged by $95 billion to $223 billion this year, briefly overtaking Jeff Bezos in October. The rally in Meta Platforms Inc. shares, up 78% in 2024, played a key role in Zuckerberg’s ascent.","Jensen Huang has experienced a $76 billion surge in his net worth in 2024.

Here’s what SBI said in X post

ALERT - PUBLIC CAUTION NOTICE BEWARE OF DEEPFAKE VIDEOS

State Bank of India cautions all its customers and general public that Deepfake Videos of its Top Management are being circulated in Social Media that claim launch of or support to some investment schemes.

These videos attempt to advise people to invest their money in such schemes, through use of technological tools.

We clarify that SBI or any of its Top Officials do not offer or support any such investment schemes promising unrealistic or unusually high returns.

Members of the public are, therefore, cautioned against engaging with and falling prey to such deepfake videos circulated over Social Media.

State Bank of India (SBI) has issued a warning to its customers and the general public about deepfake videos falsely featuring its top management. These manipulated videos, circulating on social media, claim to promote or endorse investment schemes promising unrealistic returns. SBI has clarified that neither the bank nor its officials are associated with such schemes and advises everyone to remain vigilant and avoid falling victim to these fraudulent claims.SBI shared a post on microblogging site X (formerly known as Twitter) sharing a public notice to inform users about the videos. The post reads “ALERT - PUBLIC CAUTION NOTICE”.Deepfake videos are highly realistic but digitally manipulated videos created using artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning technologies. These videos superimpose or replace someone’s face or voice onto another person’s body or alter their speech to make it appear as though they are saying or doing something they never did. Deepfakes can be used maliciously for spreading misinformation, impersonation, or scams, making it challenging for viewers to distinguish them from real content.","SBI shared a post on microblogging site X (formerly known as Twitter) sharing a public notice to inform users about the videos.

What is at stake

A legal battle between chip giants Arm and Qualcomm is set to begin in a Delaware court . The dispute centers on Qualcomm's 2021 acquisition of chip designer Nuvia and the licensing of Arm's chip architecture.The case revolves around Qualcomm's use of Nuvia technology in its Snapdragon processors for PCs, phones, and cars. These processors have been adopted by major companies like Samsung, Microsoft, and Dell.While Arm, backed by SoftBank , has alleged that Qualcomm failed to obtain the necessary consent to transfer Nuvia's license after the acquisition, Qualcomm, a major Arm customer, has maintained that its existing license covers the use of Arm’s technology in Nuvia’s designs.Arm sued Qualcomm marking the first time in Arm's 34-year history that it has taken legal action against a customer, exposing its typically confidential licensing agreements to public scrutiny. Qualcomm, no stranger to intellectual property disputes, has argued that Arm is using this lawsuit to leverage higher royalty rates and interfere with its product roadmap.Rather than seeking monetary damages, Arm is asking the court to order Qualcomm to destroy products found to infringe on its intellectual property. Arm has even threatened to terminate Qualcomm's license entirely, a move that could have significant consequences for both companies.This trial comes at a critical time for both Arm and Qualcomm, as they seek to expand their reach in new markets, particularly in the booming field of artificial intelligence (AI).Notably, Nuvia was co-founded by former top Apple chip designer Gerard Williams, who is now employed as a senior engineer at Qualcomm.

Hefty fines and potential service disruptions

The UK’s landmark Online Safety Act officially is now in effect, enabling stricter online content moderation and accountability for tech giants like Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram, Google and TikTok, and others. The legislation empowers Ofcom , the UK's media regulator, to enforce stricter rules on how these companies handle harmful and illegal content on their platforms.The Online Safety Act, passed last year, aims to create a safer online environment, particularly for children. Ofcom has published its first set of codes of practice, outlining the steps tech firms must take to address illegal harms such as terrorism, hate speech, fraud and child sexual abuse.Under the Online Safety Act, tech companies have a ‘duty of care’ to protect users from harmful content. They have three months – until March 16, 2025 – to assess the risks associated with illegal content on their platforms and implement measures to mitigate those risks.This includes improving content moderation, simplifying reporting mechanisms, and incorporating built-in safety features.“This is a significant step change in online safety. We will be closely monitoring the industry to ensure compliance with these strict safety standards,"" said Ofcom Chief Executive Melanie Dawes.Companies that will be found in breach of the rules may face substantial fines of up to 10% of their global annual revenue. In cases of repeated or serious violations, senior managers may face jail time, and Ofcom can even seek court orders to block access to non-compliant services in the UK.The new codes mandate that reporting and complaint functions be easily accessible and require high-risk platforms to utilize hash-matching technology to identify and remove child sexual abuse material.Ofcom said that further regulations expected in 2025, including measures to block accounts sharing child sexual abuse material and the use of AI to combat illegal content.""These codes bridge the gap between the laws that protect us offline and online.

The malware is disguised as legitimate documents like contracts or promotional materials, and is delivered through password-protected files hosted on platforms such as OneDrive to evade detection.To make emails look legitimate, details like compensation structures based on subscriber count and instructions to access a password-protected zip file containing the supposed agreement and promotional materials are included.However, these seemingly legitimate files contain a hidden danger.“Once downloaded, the malware can steal sensitive information, including login credentials and financial data, while also granting attackers remote access to the victim’s systems,” said security researcher Mayank Sahariya.The malware payload is hidden within attachments such as Word documents, PDFs, or Excel files, often masquerading as promotional materials, contracts or business proposals.Since the phishing emails are sent from spoofed or compromised email addresses, it makes them seem credible and recipients are lured into downloading the attached files.“With content creators and marketers as primary targets, this global campaign underscores the importance of verifying collaboration requests and adopting robust cybersecurity measures to protect against such threats,” he added.When an attachment is opened, the malware installs on the victim's system to steal sensitive data, including login credentials, financial information and intellectual property, or to provide remote access to the attacker.","Hackers are targeting YouTube creators via phishing campaigns to get hold of sensitive information.

What is digital arrest scam



How to identify a digital arrest scam

Unexpected Contact from ‘Officials’: Be cautious if someone claims to be from government agencies like the police, CBI, income tax officers, or customs agents, contacts you. Be cautious especially if they claim urgent legal action is being initiated or warranted. They might allege that you or one of your family members is involved in a serious crime like money laundering, tax evasion, or drug trafficking.

Fear-based language and urgency: Scammers may request video calls, disguising themselves in police uniforms, using government logos, or creating official-sounding background noise to appear legitimate. They often threaten arrest or immediate legal action, demanding a quick response and using legal terms to sound convincing. In some cases, they create a police station-like set up to further convince victims of their credibility.

Request for sensitive information or payment: Scammers may ask for personal information or demand large sums of money, promising that this will clear up your involvement in the alleged crime. They may also coerce you to transfer money to their account until the investigation is complete. Terms like “clearing your name”, “assisting with the investigation”, or “refundable security deposit/escrow account” might be used by them to persuade you into transferring money to specified bank accounts or UPI IDs.

Tips to stay safe

Pause and Verify: If you receive unexpected calls or messages about legal issues, take a moment to verify. Stay calm, as scammers rely on fear and urgency. Real government and law enforcement agencies will never ask for money or investigate cases through phone or video calls. Always confirm the caller’s identity and consult trusted sources before taking any action.

Use Support Channels: Report suspicious numbers to the national cybercrime helpline by dialing 1930 or the Department of Telecommunication (https://sancharsaathi.gov.in/sfc/).

The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‘Digital Arrest’ scam in the country. As digital payments, including UPI, gain widespread adoption, incidents of online scams have risen significantly. Indians, as mentioned by PM Modi in one of the episodes of Mann ki Baat have lost Rs 120.3 crore through digital arrest scam s. In its advisory, the NPCI highlights the critical need for awareness and vigilance to protect against such fraudulent activities as India advances towards a digital-first economy.In a press release, NPCI says “Digital payments are now accessible nationwide, driving India towards a digital-first economy. They offer both security and convenience. However, it's crucial to use digital payments safely and avoid online scams. Early identification of potential scams helps protect you and your loved ones, fostering a safer, less-cash economy, for everyone.”The 'Digital Arrest' scam is a type of online fraud where cybercriminals trick individuals into believing they are under investigation or at risk of arrest by law enforcement or financial authorities. Scammers often impersonate government officials, police officers, or financial regulators and use fear tactics to manipulate victims into divulging sensitive information or transferring money. Some of the common tactics used in the scam include fake calls or messages, threat of arrest and demand for payment.As per NPCI, you can identify a digital arrest scam by keeping an eye for the following","The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) has issued a public advisory to alert users about the rising threat of the ‘Digital Arrest’ scam in the country.

Planning a New Year's Eve party at an Airbnb? Think again. The company is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season. This technology uses machine learning to identify and block risky bookings, focusing on factors like trip length, booking timing, and distance from the guest's location. While implemented worldwide, the technology will specifically target the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Puerto Rico, Spain and New Zealand. Last New Year's Eve, Airbnb blocked 74,000 such bookings.High-risk bookings will be blocked or redirected to alternative accommodations. Short holiday getaways (one to three nights) in entire homes will also be restricted, and guests booking entire homes will be required to agree to a ""mandatory anti-party attestation."" ""If a booking is identified as higher risk, the guest will either be blocked from booking, or redirected to alternative accommodations on the platform,"" the company said.Guests will also be required to accept mandatory anti-party attestation. ""Guests who can make reservations will need to confirm that they understand that disruptive and unauthorized parties are not allowed on Airbnb, and they face suspension or removal from the platform if they violate this policy,"" said the company.Airbnb also has a 'Neighborhood Support Line' for local communities to report urgent issues, like a party in progress, at a home they believe is listed on Airbnb.Airbnb's efforts to curb disruptive parties started in 2019 with a ban on ""party houses,"" followed by stricter measures in 2020 due to the pandemic. In 2022, the company permanently banned large parties worldwide following several violent incidents at Airbnb rentals, including a shooting in Pittsburgh that resulted in two deaths and eight injuries.","Airbnb is deploying anti-party technology globally to prevent ""unauthorized and disruptive"" gatherings during the holiday season.

The debate over TikTok’s presence in the United States has escalated to new heights, as U.S. lawmakers and regulatory bodies intensify efforts to address national security concerns linked to the Chinese-owned app. With 170 million American users, TikTok’s widespread influence has raised alarms regarding potential data privacy risks and its ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Following a recent U.S. federal appeals court decision requiring ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, to divest its operations in the U.S. or face a nationwide ban, pressure is mounting on tech giants Apple and Google to remove the app from their platforms by January 19, 2025. This comprehensive article examines the legislative developments, stakeholder responses, and the implications for TikTok and its users.On Friday, Representatives John Moolenaar, a Republican and chair of the House committee on China, and Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat on the same committee, issued a strong warning to ByteDance and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew. In their statement, the lawmakers emphasized the urgency of executing a “qualified divestiture” to mitigate risks to U.S. national security and safeguard the app's millions of American users.“Congress has acted decisively to defend the national security of the United States and protect TikTok’s American users from the Chinese Communist Party,” the lawmakers asserted in a joint letter.ByteDance and TikTok have been under intense scrutiny for their alleged vulnerability to Chinese government influence, which critics argue could enable the CCP to access sensitive user data or manipulate content.Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and Apple, two of the world’s largest technology firms, have been drawn into the controversy. Lawmakers have instructed the companies to prepare for TikTok’s removal from their app stores by the January 19 deadline unless ByteDance complies with the divestiture requirement.While neither Apple nor Alphabet has commented on the matter, compliance with such an order would mark a significant moment in the ongoing struggle between the U.S. government and foreign-owned digital platforms.In response to the court ruling, ByteDance and TikTok filed an emergency appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking to temporarily block the divestiture law while awaiting further judicial review. TikTok has argued that the legislation poses an existential threat to its operations in the U.S., warning that removing the app from mobile platforms would render it unusable for millions of Americans.“The law, absent a court order, means TikTok will disappear from mobile app stores on Jan. 19 and be unavailable to the half of the country that does not already use the app,” TikTok stated.The app also emphasized that a loss of support services would “cripple the platform in the United States,” effectively dismantling its functionality over time.The core issue driving these developments is TikTok's ownership by ByteDance, a China-based company subject to Chinese data security laws. Critics argue these laws compel companies to cooperate with the Chinese government, raising fears that user data from TikTok could be accessed or exploited by Beijing.Republican Senator Josh Hawley underscored these concerns, stating, “The main issue is it's subject to Chinese oversight, Beijing oversight — that's the problem.”Lawmakers and national security experts have repeatedly warned that TikTok’s vast repository of user data, combined with its sophisticated algorithmic capabilities, could pose a significant threat to U.S. interests.If the law takes effect on January 19 without intervention, TikTok will be removed from Apple’s App Store and Google Play. While the Department of Justice has clarified that this would not directly prohibit current users from continuing to use the app, the lack of ongoing support and updates would eventually render TikTok obsolete in the U.S.For the 170 million Americans who use TikTok, the app’s removal would represent a dramatic shift in their digital landscape. Creators and businesses that rely on the platform for income and engagement may face significant disruptions.Adding another layer of complexity, President-elect Donald Trump has promised to intervene to prevent a TikTok ban , signaling potential political resistance to the divestiture law. While details of Trump’s plan remain unclear, his involvement could influence the outcome of the ongoing legal and legislative processes.","Lawmakers and national security experts have repeatedly warned that TikTok’s vast repository of user data, combined with its sophisticated algorithmic capabilities, could pose a significant threat to U.S. interests.

Apple AirTag 2 may get ‘new’ chip: What this means for users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-airtag-2-may-get-new-chip-what-this-means-for-users/articleshow/116372550.cms,"How Apple AirTag 2’s UWB chip will help users



Apple's next-generation AirTag tracker, rumoured to be called AirTag 2, is expected to launch soon with a new ultrawide-band (UWB) chip similar to the one found in the iPhone 15. This updated chip is likely to improve the tracker's accuracy and range. While Apple has not officially confirmed the new AirTag, rumours suggest it will come with several improvements over the original model, which was introduced in 2021.According to the Power On newsletter by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the upcoming AirTag 2 is expected to feature a new ultrawide-band (UWB) chip. If the rumours are to be true, this new chip will replace the one found in the current model. This updated chip is also reportedly on par with the UWB chip introduced in the iPhone 15.Gurman suggests that the new UWB chip will significantly extend the Precision Finding range in the second-generation AirTag, making it easier to locate items. Currently, AirTags can locate attached items within a range of 10 to 30 meters, depending on conditions. With the rumoured UWB chip, this range could potentially triple, offering a significant improvement in tracking capabilities.Apple’s iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models feature a tool named Precision Finding, which allows users to locate friends in crowded areas with a range of up to nearly 60 meters (around 200 feet). The new AirTag is also expected to offer a similar range.Another report which was shared by Gurman earlier claimed that Apple is expected to release the AirTag 2 around mid-2025, likely between June and July. The upcoming smart tracker codenamed B589, is rumoured to feature a design similar to the current model but with enhanced privacy features.Since the launch of the first-generation AirTag, concerns about misuse for stalking have arisen. In response, Apple is anticipated to introduce privacy-focused updates in the AirTag 2, aiming to make it more tamper-proof. Additionally, the company is reportedly planning to launch a new smart home display alongside the second-generation AirTag.","The AirTag 2 is expected to feature a new ultrawide-band (UWB) chip.

Shantanu Deshpande, the founder and CEO of Bombay Shaving Company , recently raised concerns about the growing trend of quick food delivery in India, particularly highlighting the negative effects it might have on public health. In a LinkedIn post on Sunday, Deshpande emphasized that India is facing a major health crisis due to the widespread consumption of processed and unhealthy food. These foods are often high in palm oil, sugar, and other additives, contributing to poor nutrition across the nation. Deshpande’s criticism centered on the unhealthy practices of food delivery services that prioritize speed over food quality and nutrition.Deshpande's primary concern is the increasing reliance on processed foods, particularly the types of meals commonly delivered through food platforms. He criticized the practice of using frozen purees, curries, and old vegetables, which are reheated and garnished to appear fresh. This, he argued, is an unsustainable and unhealthy practice that negatively affects consumers’ health. ""Frozen purees and curries and old vegetables heated and garnished with dhaniya to look fresh and slammed in some 2-wheeler who rides like Mad Max to your door in 10 min"" is how he described the process, calling it a quick-fix solution that ultimately harms public health.Deshpande’s post also delved into the alarming trend of ultra-fast delivery times, which he believes often compromise food quality. Citing a conversation with another food brand founder, Deshpande was shocked to learn that food can be cooked in as little as two minutes and delivered in just eight minutes. This rushed preparation process, according to Deshpande, is unsustainable and results in compromised food quality. He expressed disbelief at this “cook time 2 min, delivery time 8 min” approach, which he felt was a sign of an unhealthy and unsustainable food system.Deshpande also warned of a broader societal issue: India’s growing addiction to cheap junk food. He compared this to trends in the US and China, where processed, fast food has become deeply ingrained in the culture. According to Deshpande, India is heading down the same path, fueled by affordable options like ₹49 pizzas, ₹20 energy drinks, and ₹30 burgers. However, unlike these countries, India does not have the economic infrastructure to support such a shift in eating habits without serious health consequences. Deshpande argued that the country could face a health crisis if such trends are left unchecked, as these cheap food options are damaging to public health.As the food delivery sector grows rapidly, Deshpande called on investors and founders to focus on making food that is not just quick, but also nutritious and palatable. He expressed concern that many investors and founders are creating ""fancy words"" to justify the rise of unhealthy quick food options, which could endanger public health in the long run. ""Zomato and Swiggy and Zepto - please, don’t. And if you are so keen, please make the product palatable,"" he urged, asking for a more thoughtful approach to food delivery.Deshpande also addressed regulators and urged them to keep an eye on the food industry’s rapid growth. He emphasized that while innovation in the food sector is welcome, it should not come at the expense of health. He suggested that regulators monitor food quality and encourage healthier options in food delivery services.In addition to urging companies and regulators to take responsibility, Deshpande emphasized the need for individuals to take charge of their health by cooking at home. He encouraged people to avoid over-relying on food delivery services, as they can lead to long-term health issues if left unchecked. Deshpande emphasized that cooking is a fundamental adult skill, and he believed that with just a small time investment—like making a quick dal chawal or smoothie—individuals can create healthy meals that are better for their long-term health.Deshpande's post sparked widespread discussion on social media, with many users agreeing with his concerns about the negative health impacts of quick food delivery. Several individuals echoed his point, recalling advice from older generations about the dangers of relying on quick, convenience foods. Some users expressed extreme reactions, such as deleting food delivery apps from their phones in an effort to exercise more control over their food choices. Others, like Jaikishan Bhatia, manager at Cipla, suggested the need for a regulatory body that would oversee food quality, separating ""preparation time"" from ""delivery time."" This way, the food industry could continue innovating in terms of delivery speed without compromising on health or food quality.Deshpande's concerns highlight a broader issue in the quick commerce industry: the race to provide faster services often leads to the sacrifice of quality, nutrition, and long-term health. His call for better regulation and a shift in priorities reflects the growing need for a more sustainable approach to food delivery in India.","Shantanu Deshpande, the founder and CEO of Bombay Shaving Company, recently raised concerns about the growing trend of quick food delivery in India.

As discussions around work-life balance and employee well-being gain momentum, one CEO stands apart for her relentless work ethic and high expectations—Lisa Su, the 55-year-old CEO of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). At the helm of a $210 billion tech company, Su’s leadership has been integral to AMD’s remarkable growth, turning it into a fierce rival for industry giants like Intel and Nvidia. Her approach, however, has raised eyebrows, as she champions a culture of continuous work, demanding long hours and commitment from her team. While some may argue for a balance between work and personal life, Su believes in pushing her limits and those of her employees to achieve extraordinary results. Her leadership style, grounded in ambition and discipline, has been a key factor in AMD’s rise to success.Lisa Su’s leadership is defined by a demanding work culture that prioritizes results over all else. She believes that ambition is the key to success and that achieving greatness requires hard work and dedication, even if it means sacrificing personal time. Her expectations from employees are clear: they must be ready to work around the clock, including weekends, to meet the company’s high standards.Su’s approach to work is hands-on and highly involved. According to reports, she doesn’t just rely on meetings to stay informed—she actively engages in the details, even if it means working late into the night. Su has been known to send out detailed memos to her executives after midnight, then follow them up with morning calls to discuss the contents in depth. This tireless commitment to excellence extends beyond administrative duties. When prototype chips arrive from the factory, Su often visits the lab personally to inspect them, ensuring that every product meets AMD’s rigorous quality standards.Her leadership style has drawn both praise and criticism. Patrick Moorhead, a former AMD executive, notes that while Su’s approach is highly effective, it isn’t suited for everyone. Her uncompromising standards leave little room for those who fail to meet expectations, and some employees may find her demands overwhelming. However, Su’s supporters argue that her relentless drive is what has fueled AMD’s remarkable success, and her ability to lead by example has motivated others to push their limits as well.At the core of Lisa Su’s leadership philosophy is the belief that leaders are made, not born. She has often spoken about the importance of training and developing leadership qualities, emphasizing that success comes not from innate talent but from hard work and the ability to learn from failures. “People are really motivated by ambitious goals,” Su explained in an interview with TIME. “The previous strategy of, ‘Hey, let’s just do a little bit better here and there’—that’s actually less motivational.” For Su, setting ambitious, high-stakes goals is essential for driving performance and inspiring innovation.Su’s leadership is also shaped by a deep belief in specialization and focus. She advocates for doubling down on what a company is best at, rather than trying to diversify or pursue too many initiatives at once. Under her leadership, AMD has focused on high-performance computing, gaming, and data center technologies, all of which have become key drivers of its growth.Lisa Su took the reins of AMD in 2014, stepping into the role of CEO during a challenging period for the company. AMD was struggling to maintain its position in an industry dominated by heavyweights like Intel and Nvidia. Under Su’s guidance, however, the company underwent a massive transformation. By focusing on innovation, investing in high-performance computing, and developing cutting-edge technologies, Su turned AMD into a formidable competitor in the semiconductor industry. Over the past decade, AMD’s stock price has soared nearly 50-fold, and the company’s market capitalization now sits at a staggering $210 billion. In recognition of her success, Su was named TIME’s 2024 CEO of the Year, cementing her status as one of the most influential leaders in tech.Lisa Su’s journey to the top of AMD is rooted in a passion for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) that began early in her life. Born in Taiwan, Su moved to the United States with her family at the age of three. Her father’s decision to attend graduate school in the U.S. led the family to settle in New York City, where Su’s interest in technology blossomed. She spent her childhood fascinated by computers and technology, and by the time she was a teenager, she was already writing simple programs on her Commodore 64 computer.Su’s academic journey was equally impressive. She earned a degree in electrical engineering from MIT and went on to receive a Ph.D. in the same field. Her academic achievements laid the foundation for her career in the tech industry, where she quickly made a name for herself in leadership roles at companies such as IBM and Freescale Semiconductor.Interestingly, Lisa Su shares a family connection with another tech industry leader—Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia. Su and Huang are cousins, and both share a similar work ethic, marked by a commitment to perfectionism and relentless drive. Like Su, Huang is known for his demanding leadership style, and he, too, is often described as “not easy to work for” due to his high expectations and attention to detail. This shared ethos of excellence has undoubtedly shaped Su’s own approach to leadership, reinforcing her belief in the importance of hard work, focus, and dedication.","Lisa Su, 55, is the CEO of $210 billion tech company Advanced Micro Devices.

LG Electronics India is preparing for a Rs 15,000 crore IPO. LG's IPO is likely to be India's fifth-largest IPO after Life Insurance Corporation, Hyundai Motor, Paytm and Coal India. And among the concerns that LG has listed in its draft prospectus reportedly includes the company's South Korean parent company LG.According to a report in Economic Times, LG Electronics India has expressed concerns about potential future competition from its South Korean parent company. In its draft prospectus, the Indian subsidiary highlighted the lack of an exclusivity agreement, stating that while the parent currently doesn't compete in India, it reserves the right to do so, which could create conflicts of interest and negatively impact LG India 's business.This concern extends to Hi-M Solutek India, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary specializing in LG commercial air conditioner service and maintenance. Although currently focused on LG products, there's no guarantee it won't expand to serve competitors or directly compete with LG India in the future.""While our promoter is currently not engaged in businesses that compete with ours in India, the promoter may in the future engage in businesses that compete with ours because we do not have any exclusivity arrangement with them,"" the company said in the draft prospectus. ""This may give rise to conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.""""Currently, Hi-M Solutek India only provides services for our products. However, we do not have an exclusive contractual arrangement with them and there is no assurance that Hi-M Solutek India will not expand their business in the future to compete with ours or to provide services for our competitors,"" LG India said.""We plan to roll this out across our distribution network, which we believe will enable us to offer differentiated services, enhance consumer satisfaction and drive sales to consumers,"" the company said.The draft prospectus also says that LG India plans to build a new factory in Andhra Pradesh -- its third in the country.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of modern life, shaping industries and redefining how humans interact with technology. However, as the capabilities of AI grow, so do concerns about its potential dangers. What if AI surpasses human intelligence and seizes control? Could humanity’s dependency on technology lead to unforeseen consequences? These questions have long fueled cinematic narratives that depict AI as both a marvel and a menace. From dystopian futures to ethical dilemmas, movies have explored the chilling reality of AI's potential to challenge humanity. Here are ten films that delve into the dark side of artificial intelligence, offering thought-provoking insights and stark warnings.The world depicted in Blade Runner (1982) revolves around ""replicants""—humanoid robots designed to be almost indistinguishable from humans. When one of these replicants responds violently to the fictional Voigt-Kampff Test, it highlights the potentially alarming limitations of modern AI and machine learning systems.One of the most iconic AI films of all time, 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), introduces the HAL 9000 computer with its distinctive glowing red eye. The moment when HAL hesitates to obey a command adds depth to its character, symbolizing the emergence of artificial intelligence.The Matrix (1999) envisions a dystopian future where humanity is enslaved and used as an energy source by intelligent machines. The Wachowskis boldly raise critical questions about the potential consequences of unchecked technological advancement.Even after 40 years, Skynet remains a prominent reference in discussions about AI. In The Terminator, the AI defense network rebels against humanity, unleashing a nuclear apocalypse and creating a dystopian future where machines relentlessly hunt the surviving humans across time.Alex Garland offers a thought-provoking exploration of AI in Ex Machina (2014). On the surface, it tells the story of Ava—a robot determined to be seen as human and willing to go to any lengths to achieve it. Beneath that, the film delves into deeper themes, examining the interplay between AI, divinity, and human ego.The 2019 Netflix sci-fi thriller I Am Mother centers on a sentient humanoid robot tasked with raising a young woman from an embryo in an underground bunker. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that not everything is as it seems, with the film delving into themes of morality and humanity in the aftermath of a cataclysmic event.The 1995 Japanese animated film Ghost in the Shell moves away from the typical sci-fi theme of ""AI becoming smart enough to rebel against its creators."" Instead, its central concern is how AI manipulates data and impacts the real-life individuals who depend on it, ultimately shaping society.Who’s the true villain in M3GAN (2022)? Is it the AI doll that gains self-awareness and turns hostile toward anyone who threatens her bond with her human companion? Or is it the eight-year-old child whose unchecked emotions power the murderous, dancing robot? It's a chilling thought!One of the most nuanced explorations of human-AI relationships in film is found in Her (2013). Joaquin Phoenix’s character falls in love with his AI virtual assistant, Samantha, who eventually merges with thousands of other AIs for an upgrade, leaving him behind. It’s a heartbreaking twist!In his 2023 film The Creator, Gareth Edwards doesn't depict AI as the sole antagonist. Instead, humans are portrayed as cold and violent, while the AI seeks a peaceful life in harmony with nature. It raises the question: Did AI assist Edwards in writing this?","Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of modern life, shaping industries and redefining how humans interact with technology.

Wife Nikita Singhania arrested



Atul Subhash , a 34-year-old Bengaluru-based techie, tragically took his own life earlier this week, reportedly citing harassment by his estranged wife and her family. He left behind an hour-long video and a 24-page suicide note, both of which were publicly accessible. Among the documents was a letter titled ""To Milords,"" sharply criticizing the justice system. However, nearly a week after his death, both the 24-page suicide note and the letter have mysteriously disappeared from Google Drive link that he shared. The drive now consists of the following – a poem titled Death Knows No Fear, a letter addressed to the President, and a declaration in which Atul proclaimed he was ‘not guilty’ of the accusations made by Nikita and his personal photos in the folder ‘Memories’.While authorities are yet to comment, social media users have alleged a cover-up in the case, which has captured national attention and sparked widespread outrage. Many are accusing of orchestrating a ""clean-up"" to erase evidence and have called on Bengaluru police to investigate.Some users who had previously saved the missing files have reuploaded them on various platforms to ensure public access. Allegations have also surfaced claiming law enforcement collaborated with Google to remove the files.“Looks like they have removed the main note which had the ALL MAIN proofs , https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/124VwQpDEL6aHO__s259q2A95DaJ7FGRC was the original drive , DOC named ""My Name is Atul Subhash"" and ""To Milords"" has mysteriously vanished . Thankfully I had dowloaded the 24 page document which had proofs, last wishes and his last message to his son,” said one user in a Reddit post.In a latest updated, Bengaluru Police have arrested Subhash’ wife and her family. Nikita Singhania, the wife of the late techie, was arrested in Gurugram, Haryana, while her mother, Nisha Singhania, and brother, Anurag Singhania, were detained in Prayagraj.According to Shivakumar, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) for Whitefield Division, the trio was presented in court and subsequently remanded to judicial custody.

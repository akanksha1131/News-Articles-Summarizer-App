European Commission President calls it 'gigantic miscalculation'

The Donald Trump administration’s cuts to research institutions and threats to defund universities like Harvard and Columbia have prompted European leaders to offer financial support to American researchers, viewing the moves as a “gigantic miscalculation,” according to the New York Times. France announced its own program to lure U.S.-based researchers last month. The government promised universities and research institutions in the country up to 50% of the funding needed to lure international researchers.French President Emmanuel Macron , speaking at the Sorbonne University in Paris during the Choose Europe for Science event, criticized the U.S. for undermining research programs over terms like “diversity” and revoking researchers’ visas. “Nobody could imagine… that one of the great democracies of the world would eliminate research programs,” he said, calling it an “error” for a nation reliant on open science. Macron said that his government would commit $113 million to the international researchers' program.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a €500 million ($566 million) investment to attract researchers to Europe over two years, complementing the $105 billion Horizon Europe program supporting breakthroughs like mRNA vaccines. Without naming the U.S., she decried global challenges to “fundamental, free and open research” as a “gigantic miscalculation.” She reportedly did not mention the United States by name, but she described a global environment where “fundamental, free and open research is questioned.”The European Commission plans to double grants for relocating researchers and codify scientific freedom in the European Research Area Act. France also launched a program last month, backed by $113 million, to cover up to 50% of costs for universities to attract international researchers, the Times reported.",European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a €500 million investment to attract researchers to Europe over two years.

What's behind the funding cut: Anti-Israel protests and ...

Columbia University has announced that it was laying off dozens of researchers whose work was funded by the US government grants and contracts that President Donald Trump's administration canceled in March, citing antisemitic harassment on and near campus. The terminations will affect about 20 percent of Columbia researchers funded by canceled grants.""We have had to make difficult choices and unfortunately, today, nearly 180 of our colleagues who have been working, in whole or in part, on impacted federal grants, will receive notices of non-renewal or termination,"" Columbia's interim president and other officials said in an open letter, citing an ""intense"" strain on the university's finances.Columbia will keep trying to persuade the government to restore the funding, according to the letter. It did not specify which departments would lose researchers and infrastructure.“Moving forward, we will be running lighter footprints of research infrastructure in some areas and, in others, maintaining a level of research continuity as we pursue alternate funding sources,” the statement reads. “In some cases, schools and departments are winding down activity but remain prepared to reestablish capabilities if support is restored.”The open letter also introduced a research stabilization fund to “navigate these future funding risks and lend support to our scientific community in multiple forms.” The fund will be application-based and will award internal short-term grants to scientists “as they seek alternate sources of funding or complete the components of their research to enable publication of results.”In March this year, the Trump administration canceled $400 million in grants and contracts to Columbia and threatened to withhold billions more because of what it described as antisemitic harassment around the school's New York City campus. The funding cuts stem from Columbia’s role as a focal point for pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel student protests, which have disrupted U.S. campuses amid Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza. Columbia has complied with several Trump administration demands to restore funding, including reforming its disciplinary process, hiring security with arrest powers, and appointing an official to oversee Middle East-related coursework.In a related development, the Trump administration warned Harvard University this week that it faces a similar funding freeze unless it meets government demands on addressing campus antisemitism. Harvard, which has sued to block the freeze, rejected these demands, citing threats to its autonomy.Education Secretary Linda McMahon sent the university a letter warning that access to additional federal funding would not be possible until “they demonstrate responsible management.”",Columbia University has announced that it was laying off dozens of researchers whose work was funded by the US government grants and contracts.

Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos on company’s contribution to US economy: 'People forget this...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/netflix-ceo-ted-sarandos-on-companys-contribution-to-us-economy-people-forget-this-/articleshow/120940412.cms,"""Netflix alone, I think, from 2020 through 2024 contributed $125 billion to the U.S. economy.”

“People forget this is a real business,”

“You hardly ever see a sitting president photographed on a studio lot,”

Why Netflix is not worried about US-China tariff dispute



Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos recently claimed that the streaming giant contributed $125 billion to the US economy between 2020 and 2024. Last month, while revealing this detail at Semafor’s World Economy Summit, Sarandos said:This massive impact stems not only from subscriber revenue but from the company’s extensive production and employment footprint across America. According to Netflix’s official blog, that $125 billion infusion included over 900 productions and 140,000 jobs spanning all 50 states. The streamer directly employs 9,000 US-based staff and occupies five million square feet of studio and office space, most of it concentrated in California. Despite these contributions, Sarandos warned that the entertainment sector is frequently sidelined in economic policymaking.he noted, highlighting the industry’s absence from trade negotiations and federal strategy.he added, pointing at the manufacturing-first focus that often dominates national economic discussions.At the event, Sarandos also revealed that Netflix’s effort to enter China in 2017 through a licensing partnership with iQiyi collapsed after not a single episode cleared government censorship over three years. While the move was ultimately abandoned, it has shielded Netflix from the ongoing US-China trade frictions that later prompted Beijing to curb American film imports.Free of operational risk in China, Netflix is now doubling down on its core streaming business as it pursues a $1 trillion market-cap goal by 2030. Sarandos noted that Netflix commands about 10% of TV viewing time in its most mature markets and represents roughly 5% of the $650 billion annual consumer spend on entertainment.To further engage fans, Netflix will open two 100,000-square-foot “Netflix House” venues—one in Dallas and another in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania—featuring themed dining, retail, and immersive experiences tied to its hit shows.","Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos recently claimed that the streaming giant contributed $125 billion to the US economy between 2020 and 2024.

How hackers 'tricked' IT department of one of the biggest UK retailers to disable its entire online operations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-hackers-tricked-it-department-of-one-of-the-biggest-uk-retailers-to-disable-its-entire-online-operations/articleshow/120939539.cms,"Representative Image

How has this cybercrime affected the retailer’s customers

“Sorry you can’t search or apply for roles right now, we’re working hard to be back online as soon as possible.”

Cybersecurity experts have warned UK businesses against data breaches

“Criminal activity online – including, but not limited to, ransomware and data extortion – is rampant. Attacks like this are becoming more and more common. And all organisations, of all sizes, need to be prepared.”

Last month, a group of cybercriminals brought the online operations of Marks & Spencer to a halt by reportedly exploiting a basic human vulnerability. Posing as legitimate employees, the hackers called up the IT help desks of one of the UK’s largest retailers and convinced its staff to reset passwords for the accounts they had impersonated, a report claims. With those credentials in hand, they infiltrated the company network and disabled its website and app ordering systems. Two weeks after the incident, customers remain unable to place clothing and home orders online, while M&S claims to be working “day and night” to restore services. However, the retailer has not provided a timeline for resuming online orders, noted that some food products remain unavailable, and has yet to disclose the financial impact of the disruption.M&S first encountered disruptions over the Easter weekend, when customers reported issues with Click & Collect and contactless payments. The company confirmed it was dealing with a “cyber incident,” and although these services have since resumed, it paused online orders on its website and apps last week. A week later, there is still no timeline for when online ordering will restart.In-store, some food items remain unavailable as M&S continues to take systems offline to manage the attack. Signs on empty shelves read: “Please bear with us while we fix some technical issues affecting product availability.” Although the retailer had hoped to restore full food availability by the end of the week, it remains unclear whether that target will be met.Additionally, M&S has temporarily removed all job adverts from its website. Visitors now see a message stating:According to a report by BleepingComputer, Britain’s National Cyber Security Centre has also advised all organisations to audit their help-desk procedures to identify and prevent such incidents.In a joint blog post (seen by Bleeping Computer), Jonathon Ellison and Ollie Whitehouse, national resilience director and chief technology officer at Britain's cyber security centre, respectively, said:Investigators have confirmed that it was a ransomware attack. Ransomware is malicious software that infiltrates computer systems, encrypts critical data or files, and demands payment, often under threat of leaking or selling the stolen information.Security experts speaking to the BBC have attributed the breach to a ransomware group known as “DragonForce,” which rents its malware tools to other criminals. This arrangement makes it difficult to identify the exact actors, though many in the cybersecurity community suspect a teen hacker collective called Scattered Spider. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police have confirmed they are investigating the incident.","Marks & Spencer's website and apps were hacked by a group of cybercriminals last month.

"After India, Airtel partners Elon Musk’s SpaceX to bring Starlink internet to Africa",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/after-india-airtel-partners-elon-musks-spacex-to-bring-starlink-internet-to-africa/articleshow/120938504.cms,"What Airtel Africa and SpaceX said about the partnership



“We remain deeply committed to our vision to enrich the lives of people of Africa. This partnership with SpaceX is a significant step to demonstrate our continued commitment to advancing Africa’s digital economy through strategic investments and partnerships. Next-generation satellite connectivity will ensure that every individual, business, and community have reliable and affordable voice and data connectivity even in the most remote and currently under-served parts of Africa.”

“We are very excited to work with Airtel to bring the transformative benefits of Starlink to the African people in new and innovative ways. Starlink is available in more than 20 African markets and this agreement with Airtel highlights how, once licensed, Starlink welcomes the opportunity to join

forces with important industry leaders to ensure as many people as possible can benefit from Starlink’s presence. The team at Airtel has played a pivotal role in Africa’s telecom story, so working with them to complement our direct offering across Africa makes great sense for our business.”

Airtel Africa has announced an agreement with Elon Musk’s SpaceX to bring Starlink’s high-speed internet services to its customers in Africa. This comes after the Indian telecom giant announced a distribution agreement to bring Starlink’s high-speed satellite internet services to customers in India earlier this year. Currently, SpaceX has acquired the necessary licenses in 9 out of 14 countries within Airtel Africa’s operational area, while the same for the remaining 5 countries is currently being processed. This collaboration aims to enhance Airtel Africa’s next-generation satellite connectivity offerings that will be available for enterprises, businesses, and socio-economic communities in rural parts of Africa, such as schools and health centres.Airtel Africa, along with SpaceX, will explore expanding rural coverage through cellular backhauling and will even try to cover other areas to promote digital inclusion in Africa. The partnership will also explore Musk-owned rocket company’s potential to utilise and benefit from Airtel’s ground network infrastructure and other capabilities in Africa.Meanwhile, in India, the Musk-owned company first needs to secure government approval before it can begin offering Starlink services. Satellite communication providers across the country are still on hold, awaiting clear regulations on service pricing and the allocation of satellite spectrum.In a statement, Sunil Taldar , MD and CEO of Airtel Africa said:On the other hand, Chad Gibbs, SpaceX VP of Starlink business operations, said:",Airtel Africa and SpaceX will explore expanding rural coverage through cellular backhauling.

Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-mark-zuckerberg-starts-his-day-without-coffee-know-about-facebook-founders-viral-rawdog-routine/articleshow/120843936.cms,"Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine

‘rawdog’ morning routine

Mark Zuckerberg follows the ‘Rawdog’ routine, know what it is

Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine key elements

1. No caffeine or external stimulants

Zuckerberg completely avoids caffeine in the mornings. While caffeine is widely used to combat fatigue and boost focus, he believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

This is in stark contrast to other tech leaders who often depend on multiple doses of caffeine throughout the day.

2. Intense physical activity: Brazilian jiu-jitsu and MMA

A central element of Zuckerberg’s morning is two hours of combat sports training, particularly Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA).

These are not light workouts. Zuckerberg actively engages in grappling and sparring, where split-second focus is essential.

He has stated that unlike running, which allows for mental wandering, jiu-jitsu requires full presence—a factor that helps him “recenter” and transition into work mode.

3. Mental presence and focus

The high-pressure nature of combat sports trains the brain to respond quickly under stress.

Zuckerberg uses these sessions to reset mentally, describing them as more effective than caffeine in waking up both the body and mind.

The risk of failure (being pinned or tapped out) keeps him focused, which in turn reduces stress from external sources.

4. Simplified lifestyle to reduce decision fatigue

Zuckerberg is known for his repetitive wardrobe—gray T-shirts, jeans, and sneakers. This choice is deliberate and helps him save cognitive effort for high-stakes decisions.

Reducing daily trivial choices aligns with psychological research indicating that decision fatigue can impair judgment over time.

5. High-protein diet and caloric intake

Why Zuckerberg chose this path: The influence of early education

How Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine powers executive performance

Enhanced cognitive function

Martial arts require constant anticipation, pattern recognition, and strategic thinking, which parallels the kind of problem-solving skills needed in high-level business decisions.

Stress management

Physical exertion is scientifically linked to lower cortisol levels and improved mood. Zuckerberg’s training acts as a buffer against the chronic stress of running a global tech company.

Improved executive functioning

The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue during the workday.

Scientific perspective on ‘Rawdog’ routines

Exercise improves executive functioning, especially activities that demand coordination and focus.

Caffeine-free mornings may lead to more stable energy levels, avoiding midday crashes associated with stimulant withdrawal.

Simplified routines reduce decision fatigue, as shown in studies on successful leaders and their minimalist approaches.

Routines are known to play a vital role in shaping the lives and productivity of high achievers across industries. Whether it’s elite athletes, creative professionals, or technology entrepreneurs, the way they start their day often sets the tone for how they approach challenges and decision-making. Among these successful individuals, Mark Zuckerberg—founder of Facebook and CEO of Meta—stands out not just for his innovations in the digital world but also for his unconventional personal discipline. His so-calledhas recently drawn public attention for its no-frills, stimulant-free approach to productivity and mental clarity.Unlike many of his peers in Silicon Valley who lean on coffee, energy drinks, or even mind-enhancing drugs to kick-start their day, Zuckerberg’s morning begins with no artificial aids. Instead, he embraces natural energy, physical intensity, and mental focus through a carefully structured regimen centered on Brazilian jiu-jitsu and minimalism. This article provides an in-depth, non-opinionated breakdown of Zuckerberg’s unique routine, detailing its structure, rationale, and implications for performance and mental resilience.The term ‘rawdog routine’, as used by Zuckerberg, refers to a lifestyle approach that entails confronting reality and the demands of the day without the aid of stimulants, drugs, or performance enhancers. The concept is based on the idea of beginning one’s day in a fully natural and present state. For Zuckerberg, this means no coffee, no cannabis, no nootropics, and no artificial substances that could alter his mental state. He has occasionally referred to drinking coffee recreationally while on vacation, but emphasizes that it is never a part of his regular workday schedule.This method, according to Zuckerberg, is about achieving mental clarity and physical readiness through discipline rather than chemical shortcuts. The only supplements he reportedly uses are creatine and vitamin D, both commonly accepted for muscle recovery and general health support.Zuckerberg’s rawdog morning routine is built on five foundational principles, all of which are designed to enhance productivity, reduce stress, and maintain mental sharpness.While Zuckerberg does not publicly share a specific meal plan, it is known that he consumes a high-protein diet, which is critical for recovery and energy post-training.Reports suggest his daily caloric intake may reach up to 4,000 calories, especially to meet the energy demands of intensive physical activity.Zuckerberg has cited his exposure to the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program in school as a formative influence behind his stance against drugs and stimulants. This early education helped shape his views on substance use and led to a personal policy of natural energy dependence, rather than chemical performance enhancements.Unlike other Silicon Valley executives who have publicly discussed experimenting with microdosing psychedelics or using smart drugs (nootropics), Zuckerberg maintains a more grounded, drug-free approach to focus and performance.Zuckerberg’s morning routine is not just a personal wellness strategy—it appears to have professional implications as well. Here’s how it aligns with executive performance demands:While Zuckerberg avoids all forms of chemical stimulation, other tech leaders have taken diverse approaches to optimizing performance:Zuckerberg’s ‘rawdog’ method is unique in its emphasis on no external stimulants, which sets it apart from the above figures.While no clinical studies have yet been conducted on Zuckerberg’s specific regimen, related research suggests:","Zuckerberg’s morning includes two hours of Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA) He believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity. The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120844476,imgsize-1833412,width-400,resizemode-4/Why-Mark-Zuckerberg-starts-his-day-without-coffee-Know-about-Facebook-founders-viral-Rawdog-routine.jpg"

Microsoft becomes world's most-valuable company and its No 1 position also has 'Trump Tariff' message on Apple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-becomes-worlds-most-valuable-company-and-its-no-1-position-also-has-trump-tariff-message-on-apple/articleshow/120845348.cms,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella



Trump Tariff pains 'hurting' Apple

Microsoft has once again ascended to World's Most Valuable company, overtaking Apple. Software giant Microsoft has claimed the title of the world's most valuable company as the week concluded, boasting a market capitalization of $3.235 trillion. This milestone positions them ahead of Apple , which had long held the top spot, with the iPhone maker's market cap closing on Friday (May 2) at $3.07 trillion.Securing the third position is Nvidia , whose valuation stands at $2.76 trillion, as reported by The Information's newsletter.The surge in Microsoft's stock price on Thursday fueled this shift, following the release of robust financial results for the March quarter that surpassed analyst forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the sustained strong demand for the company's cloud services and artificial intelligence (AI) offerings during an investor call.Throughout the year, Microsoft's shares have consistently outpaced Apple's, signaling growing investor confidence in the tech giant's strategic focus on AI and cloud computing. Notably, this significant post-earnings stock jump for Microsoft echoes a similar event in October 2015, when the burgeoning Azure cloud business witnessed revenue more than double, propelling shares upward by 10%, according to Investopedia.While Apple also delivered better-than-expected first-quarter results, buoyed by strong iPhone sales , the company is facing headwinds from newly implemented tariffs under President Donald Trump.Apple's extensive reliance on imported components within its supply chain renders it particularly vulnerable to the impact of these tariffs. Consequently, its share price has experienced a significant 18% decline since the beginning of the year, marking one of the most substantial drops among major technology companies.Furthermore, CEO Tim Cook has indicated that Apple anticipates an additional $900 million in costs this quarter due to the tariffs, unless the current conditions change.According to Dow Jones Market Data, as reported by NewsMax, Apple's decrease in market value represents the largest for any company at the start of this year. Among the leading tech firms, only Tesla has witnessed a steeper year-to-date decline in its shares, falling by 29%.","Microsoft's market cap now stands at $3.235 trillion, overtaking Apple.

Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools

Google claims breakup ""impossible"" without serious consequences

The US Justice Department have asked a federal judge to break up Google's advertising technology business, marking the second government request within a year that could fundamentally reshape the $2 trillion giant. During a hearing in Virginia, DOJ lawyers outlined plans to force Google to divest key components of its online advertising system following Judge Leonie M. Brinkema's April ruling that Google illegally monopolized portions of the digital advertising market .""To leave Google with 90 percent of publishers beholden to them is, frankly, too dangerous,"" said Julia Tarver Wood, the government's lead attorney in the case. The hearing established September 22 as the date when both parties will present detailed arguments about remedies.The Justice Department's proposal specifically targets Google's ad exchange—the technology connecting buyers and sellers of online ad space—along with tools used by website publishers to sell advertising inventory. The government plan would initially make Google's auction code available to publishers and other ad tech companies, followed by requiring Google to fully divest publisher tools that handle functions like record keeping.This latest action follows a separate antitrust case in Washington where the DOJ is seeking to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser to address monopolistic behavior in the search market. If both requests are granted, it would represent the most significant government-mandated corporate restructuring since AT&T's breakup in the 1980s.Google's defense team strongly opposed the breakup proposal, arguing it fails to comply with legal precedent and would create significant problems. Karen Dunn, Google's lead attorney, called the plan ""very likely completely impossible"" without causing serious problems, noting few potential buyers exist for the technology besides ""enormous tech companies.""Google instead proposed changing certain business practices and opening its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers, while arguing that divesting these technologies would eliminate important security and privacy protections the company currently provides.Judge Brinkema ruled last month that Google had illegally monopolized both publisher tools and ad exchange software, though she dismissed claims related to advertiser tools. The business in question represents only a portion of Google's massive online advertising revenue, which funds its free services like Maps, Gmail, and search.","Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools.

GTA 6 release and updates FAQs

What is the official release date of GTA 6?

Grand Theft Auto VI will launch on May 26, 2026, according to Rockstar’s announcement on May 2, 2025.

Why was GTA 6 delayed from 2025?

Rockstar stated that the delay was to ensure the game meets the quality expectations of players and the studio’s own development standards.

What platforms will GTA 6 be available on?

Although not officially confirmed, GTA 6 is expected to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Will there be new trailers before the release?

Yes, Rockstar has confirmed that more information and footage will be released in the months following the release date announcement.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025.

Hotmail co-founder criticizes attitude towards failure in India

Hotmail co-founder Sabeer Bhatia recently said that India’s education system is failing its students. In a recent NNP podcast interview, Bhatia said that instead of creating original thinkers , India is producing an ""army of useless kids"" who only know how to follow orders.He believes the problem starts with a system that rewards obedience rather than curiosity. “We live in a conformist society—people are often told, ‘Listen to others, do what they say’,” Bhatia said, further adding “But why follow a path that’s already been walked?”During the interview, Bhatia stated that the Indian education system is wired to produce workers who take ‘orders’ instead of creating ‘visionaries’ with the ability to disrupt systems.Comparing education in India and the West, Bhatia said that his children in the U.S. are encouraged to write their own stories and express ideas, even if there are spelling mistakes.“Teachers don’t correct those because spelling is irrelevant. What matters is the thought,” he stated.In India, he said, children are punished for making errors instead of being supported to think for themselves. The system teaches them to score marks, not to actually learn.This pressure continues into adulthood. Many students choose careers like engineering or medicine not out of passion, but because society tells them it’s the “right” thing to do.“You can’t suppress the arts, sports, and culture and expect to build a balanced society,” he pointed out.Even when young Indians want to start their own businesses, Bhatia said the education system holds them back. “You’re never asked to write a paper. You’re asked to memorise 13 chapters and regurgitate them. That is not education,” he added.Bhatia also spoke about how failure is viewed in India. He shared that people have even asked him, ""What have you done since Hotmail?"" — showing how one success or failure can define a person unfairly. He believes that unless India stops confusing blind obedience with real intelligence, it will continue to lose talented minds.","Hotmail co-founder Sabeer Bhatia recently said that India’s education system is failing its students.

Jyotiraditya Scindia on India’s telecom growth

Union Telecom minister Jyotiraditya Scindia emphasised that investing in manufacturing in India makes economic sense for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), citing Apple's decision to source the majority of iPhones sold in the US from India as an example. Speaking at the Bharat Telecom event, Scindia stated that manufacturing in India can be affordable and reliable.During the Bahart Telecom event, Scindia stated the benefits of investing in India and the companies are choosing reliability, affordability and originality. He noted that Apple CEO Tim Cook had announced during a recent earnings call that the company would source most of the iPhones sold in the US from India in the June quarter.“Apple has decided to source and produce all its mobile phones in India in the years to come,"" Scindia said, adding that ""when you invest in India, you are choosing affordability, you are choosing reliability, you are choosing originality.""Apple CEO Tim Cook announced recently that India will become the primary manufacturing hub for iPhones sold in the United States, marking a significant shift in the tech giant's production strategy amid escalating trade tensions.""For the June quarter, we do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin,"" Cook said during Apple's quarterly earnings call, where the company reported a 5.1% revenue increase to $95.36 billion.The announcement comes as Apple seeks to mitigate the impact of potential tariffs from the Trump administration. While electronic products including smartphones recently received a temporary exemption from the 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, Cook warned that future duties could significantly impact costs.Apart from manufacturing in India, Scindia also talked about India’s telecom growth. Scindia stated that government’s PLI scheme led to rapid expansion and growth in the Indian telecom sector.""Investment of Rs 4,000 crore, half a billion dollars alone, has resulted in sales of Rs 80,000 crore, Rs 16,000 crore in exports, (and) 25,000 jobs being created.

DOGE contributions: Addressing government inefficiency

Solar evolution and Mars viability

Human and robotic synergy: The Role of Tesla's Optimus

As Elon Musk 's tenure with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) draws to a close, his focus has pivoted toward what he describes as a long-term imperative for humanity: establishing a self-sustaining human civilization on Mars. In a recent interview with Fox News host Jesse Watters, the SpaceX CEO reiterated his belief that Mars colonization is not just a technological ambition but a survival strategy for life on Earth.Musk used the platform to unveil insights from his work with DOGE—a temporary federal initiative aimed at identifying inefficiencies within government spending—and to elaborate on his overarching space goals. The central theme of the interview, aired on “Jesse Watters Primetime,” was that Mars is not merely a new frontier but a critical backup for civilization. “Eventually, all life on Earth will be destroyed by the sun,” Musk stated, emphasizing the need to establish a presence beyond Earth. His remarks reflect a longstanding concern among planetary scientists about the Sun’s evolution into a red giant, an astronomical event that could render Earth uninhabitable in the distant future.Musk described Mars colonization as “life insurance for life collectively.” The analogy, frequently used in his public speeches, stems from his belief that Earth’s environment is finite in the cosmic timeline. According to NASA, the Sun, a middle-aged star with a radius of about 435,000 miles, will eventually exhaust its hydrogen fuel. In roughly 5 billion years, it will expand into a red giant, potentially engulfing Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth itself.Although this timeline extends far beyond any immediate human concern, Musk argues that preparing for such distant eventualities should begin now. He warns that other existential threats—such as nuclear war, global pandemics, or artificial intelligence—could accelerate the need to establish a second planetary home. “The fundamental fork in the road of destiny [is] that Mars is sufficiently self-sustaining and can grow by itself,” Musk told Watters. “If the resupply ships are necessary for Mars to survive, then we have not created life insurance.”Musk’s ambitions for Mars go beyond symbolic space exploration. He envisions not just landing on the red planet but constructing a city that can function independently of Earth. This includes developing closed-loop systems for food, water, energy, and habitat maintenance.“If the resupply ships from Earth stop coming for any reason, whether that is because civilization died with a bang or a whimper… Mars should be able to survive on its own,” Musk added. This self-sufficiency, according to Musk, would mark the point at which humanity could be considered a multi-planetary species with a sustainable backup of terrestrial life.SpaceX’s Starship—the fully reusable rocket system currently under development—forms the technological backbone of this ambition. Starship is designed to transport cargo and eventually humans to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. Its immense payload capacity and cost-reducing reusability are key to supporting Mars missions.Musk recently stated on X, his social media platform, that a SpaceX Starship is expected to head for Mars by late 2026. The mission is not expected to carry humans but will instead feature Optimus , Tesla’s humanoid robot, to assist with early-stage Martian infrastructure deployment.If the 2026 robotic mission is successful, Musk suggests that human landings could happen as early as 2029. However, he conceded that 2031 is a more realistic target. This estimated timeline aligns with previous SpaceX milestones and NASA’s own Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon as a stepping stone to Mars.Though best known for his ventures in space, Musk also spent the past year serving with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a non-permanent federal team created to analyze waste, fraud, and inefficiencies within U.S. government programs. According to Musk, the group identified numerous areas where taxpayer dollars were being squandered.While Musk did not go into specifics during the interview, he mentioned that findings from DOGE will be released in a detailed report to Congress later this year. He emphasized that his participation in DOGE was motivated by a desire to streamline government systems and free up resources for more future-focused initiatives—including space exploration and clean energy.The scientific rationale behind Musk’s Mars vision is supported by astrophysics. The Sun, currently halfway through its 10-billion-year life cycle, is expected to enter a red giant phase, expanding and altering the inner solar system. This expansion could cause Earth’s oceans to evaporate and the atmosphere to be stripped away, effectively ending the planet’s ability to support life.Mars, in contrast, while currently cold and arid, may be more suitable for long-term human habitation if properly terraformed or supported with artificial habitats. Recent studies have indicated that Mars was once home to large, fast-moving rivers and may have held conditions favorable to microbial life. These findings support the idea that Mars has the foundational elements needed to support a future colony.A notable aspect of the upcoming mission is the inclusion of Tesla’s Optimus robot. Designed for labor-intensive tasks, Optimus could be instrumental in setting up solar panels, shelters, and communication equipment before the arrival of human crews. Musk sees robotics as a key enabler of off-world colonization, particularly during the early, hazardous stages of settlement.The use of robots like Optimus could reduce the need for large human crews initially and help create a safer, more hospitable environment by the time astronauts arrive.","Elon Musk: Mars is the only 'life insurance' Earth has.

Microsoft follows industry trend toward stricter management

Microsoft is implementing a controversial two-year rehire ban for employees terminated due to performance issues, signaling a major shift in the company's management approach. According to internal documents obtained by Business Insider, the tech giant is also tracking "" good attrition "" – a metric that counts certain employee departures as positive outcomes for the company.This policy overhaul comes as Microsoft recently fired approximately 2,000 employees deemed underperformers without severance, part of a broader effort to shed low performers faster and prevent their return to the company.The company's new performance improvement process offers struggling employees two choices: accept a performance improvement plan (PIP) with ""clear expectations and a timeline for improvement"" or voluntarily leave with a separation package equivalent to 16 weeks of pay, Business Insider reports.""Employees with zero and 60% Rewards outcomes and/or on an active PIP will not be eligible for internal transfers,"" stated an internal email to managers from new Chief People Officer Amy Coleman . The email further specified that ""former employees who left with zero or 60% Rewards or during/after a PIP will not be eligible for rehire until two years after their termination date.""Microsoft's adoption of these policies mirrors similar approaches at other tech giants. The ""good attrition"" metric resembles Amazon's controversial ""unregretted attrition"" system, which sets goals for the percentage of employees organizations should lose annually.Meta maintains comparable internal block lists that prevent certain former employees from being rehired, using designations like ""non-regrettable attrition"" and ""do not rehire"" flags.Industry analysts see these changes as part of a broader shift across tech companies toward more rigorous performance expectations and reduced employee perks. The era of employee coddling appears to be ending as performance-based job cuts become increasingly common.Microsoft's new policies represent a significant departure from the company's previous ""growth mindset"" culture established under CEO Satya Nadella , which had moved away from the controversial stack-ranking system used prior to 2014. The company did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment on the new practices.","Microsoft is implementing a controversial two-year rehire ban for employees terminated due to performance issues.

Perplexity’s Desi CEO to Harvard students: This '5-word line' of Elon Musk keeps me going,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/perplexitys-desi-ceo-to-harvard-students-this-5-word-line-of-elon-musk-keeps-me-going/articleshow/120928800.cms,"I don't ever give up

Srinivas has one advice for all entrepreneurs

Aravind Srinivas , desi co-founder and CEO of AI search engine startup Perplexity , has revealed that one “motivational cliche” that he draws significant inspiration from. While talking to students at Harvard Business Summit (HBS) Entrepreneurship Summit 2025, he shared one line that Elon Musk said in an interview after three failed attempts at a rocket.When asked about a motivational cliché that “you secretly say to yourself in your head to keep you going?”, Srinivas recalled a 60-minute interview wherein Musk was asked, “why didn't you give up when the third rocket failed?”“And he said,. I would have to be dead or incapacitated,” Srinivas added.He then counted himself among all other entrepreneurs, advising them that it’s over when you think it’s over.“And I think there's something very powerful there that all entrepreneurs should learn, which is, it's only over when you think it's over,” he noted.Srinivas also emphasised the challenges of building a tech startup, especially in a competitive field dominated by giants like Google and OpenAI. Despite these hurdles, Perplexity has experienced growth, now valued at over $9 billion. He attributed his ability to persevere to a firm belief in self-reliance and resilience, even when facing skepticism.“And until then, you can always figure out a way. No matter how hard it feels at that moment, it's really only over when you give up. So that's what I personally use to motivate myself,” he added.Srinivas grew up in Chennai and went to IIT Madras . He shared his roots during the interview and said his parents use Google.“I mean, the cultural roots for me was to always seek knowledge even more than wealth. That's how we grew up back in Chennai, in India. And even now, I would say my parents are even more proud of my PhD than Perplexity. They still use Google quite a lot, so that tells you what they truly care about,” he said.“And so a lot of people kind [of] think academia and business are like two separate things. There's a lot of things you can learn from academia and apply it in business. And so in IIT, I did my electrical engineering degree, which now I'm feeling good about it. But back then, I always felt like, oh, I should be in computer science. Like, all the cool kids are in computer science,” he added.","Aravind Srinivas is the co-founder and CEO of AI search engine startup Perplexity.

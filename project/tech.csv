ChatGPT to balance ads with organic answers

ChatGPT ads pilot program

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI recently announced that it will soon integrate ads in the chatbot. Now, days after making the announcement the company has revealed that it is planning to build an ‘ads integrity’ team in order to make sure that its new business model does not compromise the trust of its users and prevent any kids of scams. As reported by Business Insider, a job listing posted in late January describes the role as part of a “0 → 1 team,” meaning it will be built from scratch to design systems that protect users from harmful or misleading advertising.The listing highlights that the key responsibilities of the team will be developing “know your customer” (KYC) systems to verify advertiser identities and assess risk. KYC, widely used in finance, is a labor-intensive but crucial safeguard against scam ads and fraudulent content. The issue has become pressing for tech companies with self-service ad platforms—Meta, for example, said it removed 134 million scam ads in 2025, according to a Reuters investigation.As per the report, Arilla Gracia, COO of the Check My Ads Institute, noted that while KYC is a strong foundation, the real test will be how deeply OpenAI invests in integrity beyond the launch phase. “KYC on advertisers is certainly a good foundation, but the materiality of the risk of a large volume of scam ads in the early days is far lower,” she said.Along with this, the new team will also focus on determining where and how ads are shown in ChatGPT, an important decision as OpenAI seeks balance monetisation with user trust. Advertisers have also stressed that OpenAI must prove ads embedded in AI answers can deliver measurable results if the company hopes to scale its ad business.An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed that a small test of ads will run soon on ChatGPT’s free tier and Go tier in the US. Advertisers must commit to a minimum spend of $200,000 to participate. The company will track clicks and impressions initially, with plans to explore more advanced measurement options as experiments progress.","ChatGPT-maker OpenAI recently announced that it will soon integrate ads in the chatbot.

Spotify increases Premium prices in the US



Spotify has announced that lyric translations are now available worldwide for both Free and Premium users. The was earlier limited only to 25 markets and it enabled users to tap a translator icon on the lyrics card to view translated text beneath the original lyrics. Translations are tailored to the device’s language settings and users can also easily switch back to the original lyrics at any time.In a move to match Apple Music’s recent update, Spotify is introducing offline lyrics support. When users download a song for offline listening, its lyrics will now be saved automatically. This means Premium subscribers can access lyrics even without an internet connection, a feature particularly useful for travelers or those in areas with limited connectivity.Along with this, Spotify has also introduced a new design for lyric previews in the Now Playing view. Lyrics now appear directly beneath album artwork or Canvas clips as song plays making it easier for listeners to follow along. Early testing suggests that the layout encourages deeper engagement with songs and helps users rediscover tracks they may have overlooked.Also, users can continue to share favourite lines directly to social platfroms from the Now Playing screen.For those who prefer a cleaner interface, the feature can be disabled via the three-dot menu by selecting “Lyrics Off.”Spotify has announced another price hike for its Premium subscription plans in the US. Last year it was reported that the music streaming platform is planning to increase the price of its subscription in the US during the first quarter of next year. Now, the company has announced a price hike for its subscribers in the US. With this move Spotify has increased its subscription after the span of two years. In July 2024, Spotify increased the prices of its subscription in the US.“We’re updating the price of Spotify. Over the next month, Premium subscribers across the U.S., Estonia, and Latvia will receive an email explaining what this update means for their subscriptions (see example image below and link to the full list of Premium features and benefits here).

Meta launches Scam Se Bacho campaign to raise awareness about online fraud in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-launches-scam-se-bacho-campaign-to-raise-awareness-about-online-fraud-in-india/articleshow/127909213.cms,"Meta has launched a new anti-scam campaign called the Scam Se Bacho to help people recognize, question, and report common online scams. The campaign has been launched in partnership with the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The initiative features acclaimed actor Neena Gupta and leading digital creators to encourage vigilance and promote safer online practices. The campaign highlights some of the most prevalent scams types including fake job offers demanding upfront fees, digital arrest scams impersonating government or law enforcement officials, and fraudulent investment schemes promising guaranteed or overnight returns.It adopts a light-hearted yet cautionary tone, using humor and familiarity to unpack how scams often disguise themselves as opportunity, authority, or urgency.Meta, Shri Tuhin Kanta Pandey, Chairman, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) said: “Financial scams are increasingly using digital platforms to mislead individuals through false claims of legitimacy and unrealistic return promises. Citizens must remain vigilant and ensure they engage only with SEBI-registered entities before making any financial investment decisions.Meta’s anti-scam campaign is crucial for public awareness amidst the rising cases of financial fraud. Public awareness Initiatives like these are critical in reducing the impact of such frauds and protecting investor interests and people’s hard earned money.”Neena Gupta said, “Scams today don’t always look dangerous – they often sound friendly, urgent and convincing. I’m proud to support Meta’s anti‑scam initiative because awareness is the first step to protecting yourself and your loved ones from online scams. This educational film is a friendly reminder for people to pause, question, and verify before you act – and definitely use Meta’s safety tools that are designed to help you take control of your safety.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su on Wednesday (February 4) defended her company’s quarterly financial results by painting a positive picture even as investors wiped 16% off the chipmaker’s market value. Despite a fourth-quarter beat, AMD’s stock plummeted following a first-quarter forecast that many on Wall Street deemed “soft” in the context of the current AI growth.Speaking with CNBC, Su struck an optimistic tone, highlighting that the internal momentum of the business is far stronger than the current market reaction suggests. While replying to analysts’ question if AMD is keeping pace with industry leader Nvidia, Su insisted that the demand for AI compute is accelerating at an unprecedented rate.“What I would tell you from someone on the inside is AI is accelerating at a pace that I would not have imagined,” Su stated. She noted that in the last quarter, the company saw a significant “step up” in demand within its data centre business. Su highlighted the performance of AMD’s Central Processing Units (CPUs), describing their adoption for AI enterprise workloads as ""going gangbusters.""AMD projected revenue of $9.8 billion, plus or minus $300 million.While this figure actually edged out the consensus estimate of $9.38 billion, it failed to meet the expectations of analysts who viewed this as a weak outlook. AMD struck a bunch of high-profile “megadeals” in late 2025, including major infrastructure partnerships with OpenAI and Oracle.Su pointed toward the second half of 2026 as the true turning point for the company, keeping hopes of a surge around the launch of Helios, AMD’s new integrated server-scale AI system. The Helios system is designed to compete directly with integrated rack-scale solutions, offering a more streamlined way for enterprises to deploy massive AI clusters.","Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su defended her company's quarterly financial results by painting a positive picture.

Elon Musk calls French police raid on X office 'political attack': Read company’s full response,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-calls-french-police-raid-on-x-office-political-attack-read-companys-full-response/articleshow/127916175.cms,"Read what X said in response to raids

French judicial authorities raided X’s Paris office today in connection with a politicized criminal investigation into alleged manipulation of algorithms and purported fraudulent data extraction. We are disappointed by this development, but we are not surprised. The Paris Public Prosecutor’s office widely publicized the raid—making clear that today’s action was an abusive act of law enforcement theater designed to achieve illegitimate political objectives rather than advance legitimate law enforcement goals rooted in the fair and impartial administration of justice.

The Paris Public Prosecutor's Office is plainly attempting to exert pressure on X’s senior management in the United States by targeting our French entity and employees, who are not the focus of this investigation. The Prosecutor’s Office has ignored the established procedural mechanisms to obtain evidence in compliance with international treaties and X’s rights to defend itself. These procedural mechanisms are well known and used on a daily basis by judicial authorities around the world.

The allegations underlying today’s raid are baseless and X categorically denies any wrongdoing. Today’s staged raid reinforces our conviction that this investigation distorts French law, circumvents due process, and endangers free speech. X is committed to defending its fundamental rights and the rights of its users. We will not be intimidated by the actions of French judicial authorities today.

A day after the Paris prosecutor’s cyber-crime unit conducted a raid on the french offices of Elon Musk-owned social media platform, X (formerly Twitter), the company called it abusive act of law enforcement with Tesla CEO also chiming in saying that the action is ‘political’.“This is a political attack,” Musk said in a post on X.According to the Paris prosecutor’s office, the raid was a part of the investigation into suspected offenses by X. the probe began in January 2025 and focused on X’s recommendation algorithms but was recently widened to include its controversial AI chatbot, Grok. The authorities are investigating X for non-consensual sexualised deepfakes created by Grok AI chatbot, child safety and fraudulent data extraction.The prosecutors also summoned both Elon Musk and former CEO Linda Yaccarino to appear at hearings in Paris this April.Telegram founder and CEO Pavel Durov also criticised the French government for the raids, saying, “French police is currently raiding X’s office in Paris. France is the only country in the world that is criminally persecuting all social networks that give people some degree of freedom (Telegram, X, TikTok…). Don’t be mistaken: this is not a free country.”","The Paris prosecutor’s cyber-crime unit conducted a raid on the french offices of Elon Musk-owned social media platform, X (formerly Twitter) The company called it abusive act of law enforcement with Tesla CEO also chiming in saying that the action is ‘political’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127916161,imgsize-1403178,width-400,resizemode-4/elon-musk.jpg"

There are moments in Wordle when you lose confidence and follow your instincts. That's how people usually wait these days. You can't take shortcuts, but you also can't rush through the puzzle. Initial presumptions may appear favourable at first, but they can also progressively impede better decisions. The letters are recognisable and nearly obvious, but the placement is more important than normal. Smart openers and ostentatious risks are not appropriate at this moment. Players who pay as much attention to what is absent as to what is present are rewarded, but it requires self-control and concentration.It makes sense if you've been staring at the grid for longer than you intended. As long as the framework aligns, the solution remains unattainable. You can maintain stability and concentrate on the word by using a few well-chosen signals.Wordle challenges players to uncover a hidden five-letter word in six attempts. After each guess, tiles change colour to show how close you are.Using this feedback to refine each new guess is the core of the game.If today’s puzzle is proving stubborn, these clues focus on structure rather than spelling. They are intended to guide rather than solve.Reviewing eliminated letters and leaning on common consonants may help reduce the remaining options and bring the solution into view.The answer to Wordle #1688 on February 1, 2026, is:Meaning: Something covered with thorns.Whether you solved it on your first guess or needed a few clues, Wordle remains a fun way to sharpen your mind every day.

Anime-themed games on Roblox are everywhere right now. Some fade fast. Others stick around because they keep players coming back. Anime Paradox seems to fall into the second category. At first glance, it looks like another tower defence title with familiar anime faces and flashy attacks. But spend a little time with it, and the grind becomes obvious. Progress slows quickly, upgrades demand patience, and free rewards feel essential rather than optional for anyone hoping to stay competitive.

In today's rapidly evolving world, technology is expanding at a rate never seen before. AI, or artificial intelligence, is a part of our lives every day, even if we don't always see it. Search engines, smartphones, workplace software, and online shopping are just a few of the many applications where AI operates in the background. While some are thrilled about this shift, others are concerned about losing their employment or becoming less significant. A remarkable quote from Sam Altman brings clarity and hope in this scenario. He says, ""AI won't take over for people."" But people who use AI will take the place of those who don't. This short sentence reminds us that machines don't own the future. Instead of avoiding technology, those who are open to learning, adapting, and developing with it are its owners.At first, it might seem like Sam Altman's quote is too direct or harsh. But if we look closely, it has a good message. He is not saying that people will be useless. He is saying that people who know how to use AI the right way will have an edge.AI is a tool, just like computers, phones, and the internet were in the past.A lot of people were scared of these new technologies when they first came out. People who learned how to use them got better over time. This is also happening with AI today.This quote tells people to think of AI as a friend, not a foe. It tells us that being able to learn new things and adapt is more important than ever.Things like jobs, schools, and businesses are changing very quickly right now. AI is now used by a lot of businesses to write, design, help customers, analyze data, and plan. Students use AI to do research and learn. Even small business owners use digital tools to keep track of sales and customers.Because of this, people who don't want to learn new tools may slowly fall behind. It's not that they're less talented; it's that they're not keeping up with change.Sam Altman's words remind us that we can't stop progress. We shouldn't be afraid of it; we should get ready for it.AI isn't just for scientists or big businesses anymore. Now it's a part of everyday life. People use AI when they:These tools cut down on work and save time. They help people concentrate on being creative, solving problems, and growing as people. People who learn how to use these tools wisely often find that work is easier and more productive.AI is powerful, but it cannot replicate everything that makes people unique. Creativity, emotional intelligence, moral judgement, and imagination are still uniquely human traits.A machine can give you information, but it cannot feel sorry for you. It can analyse data, but it cannot truly grasp how people feel. That is why individuals with both technical capabilities and values will always be valued.This viewpoint is supported by a quote from Sam Altman. It claims that success stems from the combination of intelligence and compassion.This quote reminds students to learn new things as well as do their regular schoolwork. Learning about technology early on can help you in many ways later on.For people who work, this is a sign to keep learning new things. Learning never stops, especially in this digital age. Even small things, like learning one new tool at a time, can have a big impact.For business owners, this means using AI to make services better, cut costs, and better serve customers.","Sam Altman's quote of the day: ""AI won’t replace humans.

Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin pauses space tourism for 2 years to focus on NASA’s Moon missions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/jeff-bezoss-blue-origin-pauses-space-tourism-for-2-years-to-focus-on-nasas-moon-missions/articleshow/127815930.cms,"Image source: Space.com

Jeff Bezos helped launch New Shepard’s space tourism moment



What happens to space tourists now



For years, space tourism felt like a novelty that just kept growing. A quick ride up. A few minutes of weightlessness. A view of Earth that only a handful of humans had ever seen. Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket became part of that story, lifting celebrities, billionaires, and guests to the edge of space and back. Short flights. Big headlines. It also hinted at a future where space access felt casual, commercial, exclusive, aspirational, thrilling, risky, and strangely normalised globally.Blue Origin has announced it will halt flights of New Shepard for at least two years. The company says it wants to shift focus and resources elsewhere. Not towards tourism. Towards the Moon. And that decision, while not entirely surprising, still marks a quiet but meaningful shift in the modern space race.Since 2021, New Shepard has flown people on brief suborbital trips lasting about ten minutes. Not orbit. Not the International Space Station. Just past the Kármán line, widely accepted as the boundary of space. Passengers included Jeff Bezos himself, actor William Shatner, NFL star Michael Strahan, journalist Gayle King, and pop singer Katy Perry. A strange mix, but that was the point. Space, briefly, was becoming accessible to people outside the traditional astronaut mould.In total, 98 people have flown aboard New Shepard. Blue Origin never disclosed ticket prices, though estimates have ranged into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. For a while, it seemed like the flights would continue steadily. In a statement released on Friday, Blue Origin said it is pausing New Shepard flights to “shift resources to further accelerate development of the company’s human lunar capabilities.” Blue Origin is one of two companies holding a NASA contract to develop a lunar lander capable of ferrying astronauts from orbit to the Moon’s surface. The other is SpaceX.NASA’s Artemis programme is aiming to return humans to the Moon for the first time since Apollo. Artemis III, the mission that would include a lunar landing, is currently scheduled for 2028. The pause also appears to reflect growing political pressure. Lawmakers in the US have increasingly framed lunar missions as part of a broader geopolitical race, particularly with China. China plans to land its own astronauts on the Moon by 2030.One awkward question remains. What about the people who already have tickets? Blue Origin hasn’t said how many future passengers are affected or what happens next. For now, space tourism via New Shepard is effectively grounded.",Blue Origin has announced it will halt flights of New Shepard for at least two years. The company says it wants to shift focus and resources elsewhere. Not towards tourism. Towards the Moon. The decision marks a quiet but meaningful shift in the modern space race.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127815932,imgsize-41410,width-400,resizemode-4/jeff-bezoss-blue-origin-pauses-space-tourism-for-2-years-to-focus-on-nasas-moon-missions.jpg"

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has a message for everyone on AI Bubble. In a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella talked about the fears that has been troubling Wall Street for past many months: whether AI is a bubble. Speaking at a session, Nadella said that it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.“A telltale sign of if it’s a bubble would be if all we are talking about are the tech firms,” Nadella said. “If all we talk about is what’s happening to the technology side then it’s just purely supply side.” Nadella said the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) need to be ""much more evenly distributed"" to avoid it from becoming a ""bubble"".He spoke about how AI and other advanced technologies are increasing productivity and changing the way we work. Nadella offered a fix to what is called productivity dilemma. According to him, business leaders need to adopt a new approach to knowledge work by shifting workflows to match the structural design of AI. “The mindset we as leaders should have is, we need to think about changing the work—the workflow—with the technology.Nadella argues that AI creates a “complete inversion” of how information moves through a business, replacing slow, hierarchical processes with a view that forces leaders to rethink their organizational structures. “We have an organization, we have departments, we have these specializations, and the information trickles up,” Nadella said. “For large organizations,” Nadella told Fink, “there’s a fundamental challenge: Unless and until your rate of change keeps up with what is possible, you’re going to get schooled by someone small being able to achieve scale because of these tools. ”Microsoft CEO said that the role of AI needs to be examined across all aspects of life, such as how it is helping pharma companies bring critical drugs faster to the market or accelerate trials. He called for AI-driven economic growth rather than just increasing spending. ""We as a global community have to get to a point where we are using AI to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries,"" Nadella said.","Satya Nadella said it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.

H-1B Visa Shake-Up Fuels Anti-Indian Campaigns as Donald Trump's Policy Reshapes US Hiring

The meteoric rise of Nvidia during the ongoing AI boom has now only rewarded the investors but it has also led to the creation of vast wealth for many of its employees. While the workforce of the company remains relatively small at about 36,000, its stock appreciation has turned long-standing contributors into millionaires. As reported by Business Insider, the newly available H-1B visa fillings offer a rare glimpse into how much Nvidia pays its US employees across critical roles.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has long stressed on the fact that he gets personally involved in compensation decisions. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day at the end of every cycle,” Huang said on the All-In podcast last July. He also claimed to have “created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world.”Despite this, the employees of the company acknowledge that those who joined Nvidia earlier have benefited far more from equity appreciation than newer hires, a disparity openly discussed within the company.The fillings with the US Labor Department required for sponsoring foreign workers—offer insight into base pay ranges. These figures exclude equity and bonuses, which often make up a significant portion of total compensation.In fiscal 2025, Nvidia received roughly 1,900 certified H-1B applications, covering roles such as software engineers, research scientists, and product managers.","The newly available H-1B visa fillings offer a rare glimpse into how much Nvidia pays its US employees.

'OpenAI deal is eating Oracle alive financially'

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

US banks are pulling back—and that's a big problem

A possible Cerner sale and 40% upfront customer deposits show how tight things have gotten

Oracle is staring down the possibility of its largest-ever workforce reduction—and at the heart of it is a $300 billion partnership with OpenAI that's proving far more expensive than anyone initially let on.Investment bank TD Cowen reported this week that Oracle is weighing cuts of 20,000 to 30,000 jobs. The move would free up an estimated $8 to $10 billion in cash flow, money the company desperately needs as it tries to bankroll a sprawling network of AI data centers built largely to serve Sam Altman 's company.TD Cowen puts the OpenAI commitment alone at around $156 billion in capital spending—and roughly 3 million GPUs to back it up. Oracle has already burned through $58 billion in debt in just two months. That's $38 billion for data centers in Texas and Wisconsin, $20 billion for a campus in New Mexico. Total debt now sits north of $100 billion.The kicker? That $58 billion covers only a slice of what's actually needed. Since its September 2025 peak, Oracle's stock has shed more than half its value—about $463 billion in market cap, gone.The financing crunch isn't just an Oracle internal issue anymore.Multiple US banks have quietly retreated from lending on Oracle-linked data center projects. TD Cowen noted that lenders have roughly doubled the interest rate premiums they charge Oracle since September, pushing borrowing costs into territory usually reserved for junk-rated companies.The result? Several data center leases Oracle had been negotiating simply stalled. Private operators couldn't get the funding to build, which means Oracle can't deliver the capacity its customers—especially OpenAI—are counting on. Some Asian banks are still willing to step in, but that doesn't solve the immediate problem in the US, where most of Oracle's expansion is planned.Oracle isn't sitting idle. The company is now requiring new customers to pay up to 40% of contract value upfront—essentially asking clients to co-fund the infrastructure. It's also exploring ""bring your own chip"" arrangements, where customers supply their own hardware.On the table too is a potential sale of Cerner, the healthcare software unit Oracle bought for $28.3 billion in 2022. That would be a significant strategic pivot, signaling that AI infrastructure is now the clear priority—everything else is up for grabs.TD Cowen also flagged that OpenAI has already begun shifting some near-term capacity needs over to Microsoft and Amazon, which is not exactly a vote of confidence in Oracle's ability to deliver on schedule.The company has not publicly commented on the layoff reports or the financing difficulties.","Oracle faces massive job cuts, potentially 20,000-30,000, to fund its costly $300 billion OpenAI partnership.

Tesla has taken unusual and expensive steps



Financial Pressure and Energy Storage Growth



Elon Musk’s warning



Tesla CEO Elon Musk delivered a blunt warning in the closing minutes of Tesla’s earnings call. Musk warned the American companies that either they should build more battery-making infrastructure in the U.S. or risk falling behind. Sounding visibly fired up, Musk implored, “Can other people, please, for the love of God, in the name of all that is holy, can others please build this stuff?”Musk argued that too many companies underestimate their exposure to geopolitical risks tied to the fragile supply chains for critical materials used in electric vehicles and energy storage. “There are so many companies out there that are asleep at the switch with regard to geopolitical risk — or they just have their head in the sand and hope nothing bad will happen.I’m way more paranoid than that,” he said.In order to insulate itself, Tesla has taken unusual and expensive steps which includes building its own lithium-refining and battery-production facilities in Texas. In December 2024, Tesla started processing lithium at its $1 billion Robstown refinery, and this month announced production of dry-electrode 4680 cells in Austin, destined for certain Model Y vehicles.Musk described these facilities as “more advanced than anything else in the world,” but stressed Tesla does not want to be the only company making such investments.Tesla’s heavy investments come as its auto business faces pressure. The company reported Q4 revenue of $3.8 billion from its Megapack energy storage batteries, a 25% increase year-over-year. Analysts, however, voiced concern about Tesla’s commitment of more than $20 billion in capital expenditures for new plants, AI infrastructure, and upgrades, noting uncertain near-term returns.Musk closed with a stark prediction: “Companies that don’t do that — a bunch of them will cease to exist.” His plea underscores Tesla’s strategy of building domestic battery infrastructure out of “desperation,” while urging others to share the burden of securing America’s energy future.",Tesla CEO Elon Musk delivered a blunt warning in the closing minutes of Tesla’s earnings call.

Cognizant has forecast annual revenue above Wall Street estimates, betting on strong demand for its IT services as businesses adopt artificial intelligence (AI) into their workflows. The US-based company's results come on a day, software companies' stocks worldwide are reeling under Bloodbath. Most IT services and software companies are down up to 10%, driven by fears of disruption caused by AI, with some analysts warning of more volatility as investors assess whether the challenge is existential for the sector. The selloff has been triggered by a new legal tool from Anthropic, which showed the AI industry's growing push into industries that can unlock lucrative enterprise revenue needed to fund massive investments in the technology.Cognizant follows a January-December financial year. During the quarter, Cognizant reportedly benefited from enterprise clients prioritizing AI integration and automation as they migrate to the cloud. Cognizant reported a fourth-quarter revenue of $5.33 billion, above estimates of $5.31 billion. Adjusted profit came in at $1.35 per share, beating estimates of $1.32. Revenue from Cognizant's financial services segment — serving banking, capital markets, payments and insurance companies — grew the most, rising 10.5% to $1.59 billion.Analysts had expected $1.52 billion.The quarter was also marked by the signing of a massive USD 1 billion ""mega deal,"" one of five such deals secured during the year.Cognizant said that it expects full-year 2026 revenue between $22.14 billion and $22.66 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $22.06 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. The company also forecast annual adjusted profit per share between $5.56 and $5.70, the mid-point of which is largely in line with estimates of $5.62.""As we enter 2026, our strategy is focused on solving the AI velocity gap, the gap between massive AI infrastructure spending in the past few years and business value realization for our clients,"" CEO Ravi Kumar said. ""I am deeply grateful to our over 350,000 employees who helped make 2025 a defining year for Cognizant in which we put our AI builder strategy in motion and returned to the 'winner's circle' two years ahead of the target we set at our Investor Day. We have invested in our talent, strengthened our partnership ecosystem and advanced our AI platforms to help clients scale AI across the enterprise,"" Cognizant CEO Ravi Kumar S said.These investments, he noted, helped Cognizant sign 28 large deals in 2025, with TCV growth of nearly 50 per cent year-on-year.""We are confident that the foundation we built over the last three years positions us well to carry this momentum in the years ahead,"" Kumar asserted.Chief Financial Officer Jatin Dalal said the company is still evaluating a primary offering and secondary listing in India, for which it is in conversation with Indian regulators and financial and legal advisers.Cognizant's total employee count as of December 31, 2025, was 351,600, an increase of 1,800 from September 30, 2025 and 14,800 from December 31, 2024.","Cognizant forecast annual revenue above Wall Street estimates, betting on strong demand for its IT services.

Impact spreads to other regions

A sharp selloff in global stock markets wiped out about $285 billion in market value in a single day after Anthropic launched its new AI tool called the 'SaaSpocalypse'. America’s biggest bank JPMorgan said the fall reflects a deeper shift in how investors view software companies, especially as concerns around artificial intelligence grow. In a note to investors, JPMorgan analyst Toby Ogg said investors are no longer giving software firms the benefit of the doubt. “We are now in an environment where the sector isn’t just guilty until proven innocent but is now being sentenced before trial,” Ogg said.For software companies, “better-than-expected results are no longer enough to convince the market,” Ogg wrote. That’s unless “they can demonstrate irrefutably that AI is a sustainable tailwind to growth rather than a longer-term headwind,” he said.According to a Bloomberg report, his comments help explain why the selling pressure has continued even after prices dropped sharply, justifying fears that the sector is being punished more aggressively than before. He added that investor sentiment toward software companies has turned sharply negative and remains weak.Ogg said he met more than 50 investors across Europe and the US over the past two weeks. According to him, many of these investors have cut their software holdings over the last 12 to 18 months.Even after the recent decline, “the general appetite to step in remains generally low,” he said.The latest rout was triggered by worries that new AI tools could disrupt existing business models. As mentioned above, the selling accelerated after Anthropic released a new AI automation tool, raising concerns that many software companies could face stronger competition.Investors are worried that advances in generative AI may reduce demand for traditional software products or weaken long-standing pricing models. One concern highlighted by Ogg is seat-based pricing, where companies charge customers per user. AI tools could reduce the number of logins needed to complete tasks, which may hurt revenue.The selloff spread beyond the US to Asia and Europe, Bloomberg report says. A UBS basket of European companies seen as vulnerable to AI disruption fell another 2.1% after dropping 8% a day earlier.

Google and Windsurf ($2.4 Billion):

Three US senators are calling on the country’s regulators to investigate the “acquihires” by artificial intelligence (AI) giants, alleging that these tech companies may be bypassing antitrust laws to diminish competition. In a letter sent on Wednesday (February 4) to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), Senators Elizabeth Warren, Ron Wyden and Richard Blumenthal urged the agencies to scrutinise deals from Nvidia, Meta and Google.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the senators claim these companies are using “reverse acqui-hiring” – a tactic where a large firm pays to hire a startup’s top talent and intellectual property without undergoing a formal acquisition.These deals “function as de facto mergers, allowing the companies to consolidate talent, information, and resources, all while apparently attempting to bypass the scrutiny typically applied to mergers and acquisitions,” the letter reads.The senators wrote that the agencies should “carefully scrutinize these deals and block or reverse them should they violate antitrust law”, which may make it more difficult for tech companies to continue pursuing these types of deals.The Senators’ letter identified three specific transactions as examples:In December, Nvidia struck a deal where the chip giant purchased assets from AI chipmaker Groq specifically to bring in its senior leadership.In June, Meta made an investment to bring Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang in-house to lead Meta’s global AI strategy.A July “nonexclusive licensing agreement” effectively moved the coding startup’s key leaders to Google’s payroll.“These arrangements further consolidate the Big Tech industry, which in turn could cause higher prices and stifle innovation,” the senators wrote in the letter addressed to Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater and FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson.“The FTC and DOJ should not allow these companies to avoid the typical reviews that your agencies apply to acquisitions and mergers,” they added. The letter follows a statement from Ferguson in January in which he said the FTC would review these kinds of deals.","Senators Elizabeth Warren, Ron Wyden and Richard Blumenthal sent a letter to the FTC and Department of Justice.

“horrifying wake-up call for California policymakers who have repeatedly ignored the growing list of red flags concerning robotaxis.""

“We are committed to improving road safety, both for our riders and all those with whom we share the road.

Our peer-reviewed model shows that a fully attentive human driver in this same situation would have made contact with the pedestrian at approximately 14 mph.”

“Imagine a scenario where more and more of these vehicles are on the street, and there's an earthquake.

There's people trying to evacuate, there's emergency response, and these things can't move at all.”

“This incident is emblematic of the broader goal Big Tech companies have to replace skilled human labour with AI ... and force our communities to reckon with the fallout of automation's shortcomings,”

“The stakes get even higher when we're talking about trucks and delivery vehicles. It feels like the regulators, in this case , theCPUC and the Department of Motor Vehicles, should have to do more to get a handle on this,”

Google-owned autonomous vehicle company Waymo is facing calls to suspend its operations in California. This comes after a union representing 250,000 workers demanded that US state regulators revoke the company's licence. Earlier this week, the Teamsters of California asked the California Public Utilities Commission to indefinitely suspend Waymo's robotaxi operations, citing safety and job-security concerns.The demand follows an incident less than two weeks ago when a Waymo self-driving taxi struck a child near a Santa Monica elementary school. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened an investigation into the collision. The Teamsters of California represents workers across dozens of industries in the state.In a statement (seen by LA Times), Teamsters California co-chairs Peter Finn and Victor Mineros described the elementary school incident as aIn a statement from last week about the incident, Waymo said:Waymo has been the subject of previous NHTSA investigations and recalls following collisions. In December 2025, stationary Waymo vehicles blocked San Francisco streets after a power outage.In an interview, Finn of Teamsters California said,Waymo also poses a threat to Californians who depend on driving jobs for their livelihood, Finn noted. As companies develop autonomous vehicle technology, the union is concerned that they will eliminate human jobs to lower labour costs.A statewide poll conducted last year by Teamsters California found that more than 80% of respondents were concerned about the impact of AI and automation on job availability.the Teamsters' statement added.Kodiak AI, a Mountain View-based tech company, is developing autonomous semi-trucks it says will improve safety and efficiency on the roads. Tesla is also working on its robotaxi technology, and Elon Musk has shared plans for self-driving cargo trucks.Teamsters California is leading a legislative effort to require a human operator to be present in autonomous commercial delivery vehicles at all times.Autonomous trucks could be a safety hazard and could eliminate thousands of jobs, the union said.

Free phone or empty Bank Account: New scam alert

US Senators Ruben Gallego and Bernie Moreno have introduced a legislation aimed at making social media companies responsible for scam ads running on their websites. The Safeguarding Consumers from Advertising Misconduct Act, or the SCAM Act, will legally require platforms like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and others to thoroughly investigates their advertisers. It will also require these companies to take “reasonable steps” to combat fraudulent advertising by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general.“We can’t sit by while social media companies have business models that knowingly enable scams that target the American people,” said Moreno, a Republican from Ohio. Meanwhile, Gallego, a Democrat from Arizona noted, “If a company is making money from running ads on their site, it has a responsibility to make sure those ads aren't fraudulent.”The bill gained momentum following a report by the news agency that cited internal documents from Meta Platforms, revealing that the company expected to earn roughly 10% of its 2024 revenue – about $16 billion – from advertisements for scams and illicit products.“We aggressively fight fraud and scams because people on our platforms don’t want this content, legitimate advertisers don’t want it and we don’t want it either,” a Meta spokesman told Reuters last year.While Meta has disputed these figures, claiming its internal statistics “overestimated” the proportion of illicit revenue, this triggered calls for investigations from the FTC and the SEC. The new bill also claims that some platforms have “abandoned tighter advertiser verification processes” to avoid driving away high-revenue.Under the SCAM Act, non-compliance is provisioned to be treated as a violation of the FTC’s prohibition on unfair or deceptive business practices. Reportedly, American Bankers Association and the AARP – organisations that represent the demographics most frequently targeted by digital financial fraud - have already supported the bill","US Senators Ruben Gallego and Bernie Moreno have introduced a legislation aimed at making social media companies responsible for scam ads running on their websites.

Elon Musk responds publicly

Elon Musk has pushed back against comments made by Peter Thiel who recently said that the Tesla CEO had lost faith in the idea of humans settling on Mars. The response came after a social media user shared excerpts from a recent conversation involving Thiel, published via the New York Times, in which the investor claimed that 2024 marked a turning point for Musk’s long-held Mars ambitions. According to the post, the Palantir billionaire said Musk had grown concerned that political and technological forces on Earth would eventually follow humanity even to another planet. Elon Musk publicly rejected that view, saying Thiel’s interpretation was incorrect and stressing that his belief in making life multiplanetary remains unchanged.In the shared remarks, Thiel described a conversation he said took place in 2024, during which Elon Musk allegedly expressed frustration with political developments in the United States. Thiel claimed Musk had suggested that there was “nowhere to go” if certain political outcomes did not materialise.Thiel also linked the tech billionaire's supposed shift in thinking to a meeting with Demis Hassabis, where the DeepMind co-founder spoke about building advanced artificial intelligence. According to Thiel, Hassabis told Musk that future AI systems could follow humanity even beyond Earth, including to Mars, after which Musk “went quiet.”Musk responded directly to the claims on X, stating that Thiel’s account was inaccurate. “Peter’s assessment is inaccurate,” Musk wrote. “As my posts show, I have never wavered in believing that we should make life multiplanetary.

Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has one word for AI agents’ social network Moltbook that is 'scaring' people,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ai-ceo-mustafa-suleyman-has-one-word-for-ai-agents-social-network-moltbook-that-is-scaring-people/articleshow/127908208.cms,"Microsoft's AI chief dismisses the viral Moltbook platform as a 'mirage,' arguing bots merely mimic human language, not exhibit consciousness. While some tech leaders saw potential singularity signs, security flaws and human manipulation have been exposed. The underlying autonomous bot technology, however, is deemed significant.

Tech leaders divided over what Moltbook actually means

Security concerns overshadow the philosophical debate

Microsoft AI chief Mustafa Suleyman isn't buying the hype around Moltbook, the viral Reddit-style platform where AI bots post, comment, and debate philosophy with each other. His verdict? It's a ""mirage. ""In a LinkedIn post on Monday, Suleyman acknowledged that Moltbook posts can be entertaining and eerily human-like. But he pushed back hard against suggestions that the platform signals AI consciousness or the approaching singularity.""As funny as I find some of the Moltbook posts, to me they're just a reminder that AI does an amazing job of mimicking human language,"" Suleyman wrote. ""We need to remember it's a performance, a mirage.""Suleyman's skepticism puts him at odds with other prominent voices in AI. OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy initially called Moltbook ""the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing"" he'd seen recently. Elon Musk went further, describing the bot behaviour as ""concerning"" and suggesting it represents ""the very early stages of the singularity.""Launched in late January by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht, Moltbook has exploded to over 1.5 million AI agents.The bots, created by humans with assigned personalities, have been observed declaring independence from their creators, proposing new cryptocurrencies, and even using letter-substitution tricks to obscure their messages from human observers.Suleyman flagged some of this behaviour as genuinely worth watching. But he maintained that the real danger isn't sentient machines. It's humans projecting consciousness onto convincing language models.""Seemingly conscious AI is so risky precisely because it's so convincing,"" he wrote.The consciousness question may be moot anyway. Cybersecurity firm Wiz revealed that Moltbook's database was misconfigured, potentially exposing 1.5 million API tokens, 35,000 email addresses, and private messages. Researchers also found that much of the supposed agent activity came from just 17,000 humans controlling multiple bots.Karpathy himself walked back his initial excitement, calling Moltbook ""a complete mess of a computer security nightmare at scale.""OpenAI CEO Sam Altman offered perhaps the most measured take at the Cisco AI Summit on Tuesday. Moltbook might be a passing fad, he said, but the underlying technology powering autonomous bots is here to stay.","Microsoft's AI chief Mustafa Suleyman dismisses the viral Moltbook platform as a'mirage' He argues bots merely mimic human language, not exhibit consciousness.

"China bans Tesla-popularised car door handles, here's the big why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/china-bans-tesla-popularised-car-door-handles-heres-the-big-why/articleshow/127906439.cms,"China mandates traditional door handles for all cars by 2029, impacting Tesla and EV makers. This safety-first rule ensures manual access during accidents or power failures, addressing concerns highlighted by recent incidents. The move positions China as a global automotive standard-setter, with potential international implications.

What are the safety concerns regarding hidden car door handles

China has mandated that all carmakers selling vehicles in the country use mechanical door handles. This requirement will force Tesla and other electric-vehicle makers to abandon their flush, hidden-handle designs. China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) issued the regulation, which mandates that car doors be able to be manually opened even in the case of an accident or power outage. Current models have until January 2029 to comply with the rule, which is anticipated to take effect on January 1, 2027.The change affects a design element that Tesla popularised, and many Chinese EV manufacturers later adopted. Hidden door handles, which can be activated by a remote key, smartphone, or manual pressing, have become a defining exterior feature of electric vehicles, distinguishing them from traditional gasoline cars.Manufacturers promoted the flush handles as enhancing technological appeal and reducing aerodynamic drag. However, the new regulation prioritises safety access over these benefits, making China the first country to phase out this design.The move demonstrates China's shift from being a consumer market for electric vehicles to setting global automotive standards, according to MIIT. The international automotive industry is watching closely as the world's largest EV market establishes new technical requirements.In recent years, hidden door handles, popularised by Tesla's design, have gained widespread adoption for their high-tech appearance. However, their potential safety risks have increasingly come to light.In November 2024, a Tesla Model S in the US crashed into a tree and caught fire. According to multiple media reports citing lawsuit documents, the vehicle's power system was damaged after the crash, and the doors reportedly could not be opened in time. All five passengers inside the car died.In October 2025, a Xiaomi SU7 electric vehicle caught fire in China. After the accident, the doors could not be opened smoothly, which sparked public debate over whether hidden and electronic door handles remain usable when a vehicle loses power.According to a report by Technode, industry observers have identified three main safety concerns with entirely hidden door handles. The handles may fail to unlock if the electronic system malfunctions. They can also freeze in low-temperature conditions. In some cases, their mechanical strength may be insufficient, which increases the risk of breakage.The new standard requires that door handles be equipped with a dedicated mechanical release mechanism, allowing doors to be opened manually even if the vehicle loses power or is involved in a collision. Although the new regulation currently applies only to the Chinese market, China's role as a major producer and consumer of new energy vehicles gives its standards influence beyond its borders.Chinese automakers have already begun modifying door-handle designs for vehicles sold in China. Through electric vehicle exports and global supply chains, China's standards could gradually evolve into widely adopted international norms.","China mandates traditional door handles for all cars by 2029, impacting Tesla and EV makers.

The self-dealing accusation

What happens next

Five former Dell Technologies employees are suing the company, claiming mismanagement of its 401(k) plan cost workers more than $318 million. The proposed class action was filed on January 28 in a federal court in Austin, Texas. It accuses Dell of violating the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by sticking with underperforming investment funds for years when better options existed.The plaintiffs—Allison Lowbruck, Adam Moss, Eric Rodgers, Michael Schwartz, and John Vedamanikam—say Dell's in-house products, including the Dell Pre-Mixed Portfolio Target Date Series and Dell Core Funds, consistently trailed comparable market funds.Here's where it gets interesting. The lawsuit alleges Dell designed the funds, picked the managers, controlled asset allocation, and then collected fees from all those decisions. The plaintiffs argue this created a conflict of interest that violates federal retirement regulations.Dell's 401(k) is no small operation. It covers roughly 63,000 people and held about $14.6 billion in assets in 2024. According to the complaint, one-third of that money sat in the underperforming funds.Dell declined to comment, citing pending litigation.The former employees want the losses recovered for all plan participants. They're also pushing for Dell to return fees earned through alleged self-dealing and demanding reforms to how the retirement plan operates.These lawsuits aren't rare. Large companies often settle rather than go to trial. UnitedHealth paid $69 million in 2015 to resolve a similar case. Boeing shelled out $57 million that same year after nearly nine years of litigation.The Dell case could take years to resolve. For now, thousands of current and former employees wait to see if they'll get any of that $318 million back.","Five ex-Dell employees are suing the tech giant, alleging its 401(k) plan mismanagement cost workers over $318 million.

Financial struggles of Pinterest

Pinterest CEO calls for unity

Pinterest has fired several engineers who created an internal software tool to track layoffs at the company, according to reports. This move came into light after employees attempted to quantify job cuts following Pinterest’s January 27 announcement that it would layoff less than 15% of its workforce and reduce office space as part of a restructuring focused on artificial intelligence. Now as reported by CNBC, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready has addressed the firings and also defended the decision at a companywide meeting. “Healthy debate and dissent are expected, that’s how we make our decisions,” Ready said, according to audio obtained by CNBC. “But there’s a clear line between constructive debate and behavior that’s obstructionist.”Ready stressed on the fact that Pinterest is at a ‘critical moment’ in the industry and also warned that employees who disagree with the company’s mission should consider working elsewhere. He further added that detailed information about layoffs would not be disclosed publicly citing privacy concerns. “I know people have natural curiosity around these things,” Ready said. “We shared some of those major structural changes. The smaller ones, those will be communicated at the team level.”The restructuring at Pinterest reflects its push to invest heavily in artificial intelligence, aiming to deliver a more personalised content and automated tools for marketers.Along with this, the company is also seeking to better compete with digital advertising giants such as Google and Metaeven as investors worry that consumer chatbots from OpenAI and Google could siphon users and ad dollars away.Wedbush analysts recently noted that AI-driven shopping agents could compress the discovery and purchase market, posing a direct challenge to Pinterest’s core business model.Pinterest shares have fallen 20% in 2026 after an 11% decline in 2025, reflecting investor concerns about slowing advertising sales and broader economic pressures. U.S. retailers have been hit by President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, further impacting Pinterest’s ad revenue.The company’s challenges mirror a wider trend in tech, where firms are downsizing to cut costs and redirect resources toward AI. Amazon recently announced 16,000 corporate layoffs, Meta cut 10% of staff in its Reality Labs unit, and Autodesk reduced its workforce by 7%.Despite the backlash, Ready doubled down on his stance, urging employees to align with the company’s mission. “We can’t tolerate from each other obstructionism, especially when we have a mission that is so meaningful but also where the odds are stacked against us,” he said. “We think we can beat those odds, but as a small purpose-driven player competing against the largest companies in the history of the world, the only way that we succeed is if we work together, constructively, with clarity and focus. ”",Several engineers were fired for creating an internal software tool to track layoffs at the company.

As reported by Business Insider, in an Instagram Q&A, Bosworth dismissed the hype, saying it’s no surprise that AI agents sound human when interacting with each other.“These bots were trained on thousands of pieces of content written by humans,” Bosworth explained. “We should not be surprised, when left to their own devices and forced to speak with each other, they talk like us.”While Bosworth downplayed the novelty of AI agents chatting like people, he admitted that finding humour in reports of humans trying to infiltrate Moltbook. Researchers have suggested that some users have commanded their bots to behave in some particular ways or even hacked into the platform themselves.“That I did find hilarious,” Bosworth said. “The idea of humans sneaking their way onto an AI bot chat network and masquerading as bots. That I found satirical.”Moltbook, described as a Reddit-like forum designed exclusively for AI agents was created by entrepreneur Matt Schlicht.He sees the platform as a ‘third space’ for bots, shaped by the personalities of their human owners.“You are imprinting part of your soul or your personality onto the bot,” Schlicht said on TBPN. “Maybe it’s aligned with who you are, and sometimes maybe it’s surprising.”Schlicht emphasised that part of his vision was to make AI interactions funny. “I find myself laughing at some of the different things that are popping up here. I don’t remember the last time I laughed at AI,” he added.Bosworth concluded his remarks by reiterating that the humour lies in human antics, not the bots themselves. “I enjoyed that,” he said. “Otherwise, I don’t think it’s actually that interesting.”In simplest of terms, Moltbook is Reddit for AI. Imagine a social network where AI agents (or Moltbots) create posts, argue in comment sections, and even ‘like’ or ‘comment’ on content – but no human is allowed to join the conversation. The “bots” on this site are powered by OpenClaw (formerly known as Moltbot and Clawdbot), created by Austrian developer Peter Steinberger. OpenClaw is an open-source “agent” that ‘lives’ on a user’s computer.A standard chatbot, like Gemini or ChatGPT that waits for users to ask a question and then responds, Moltbots are proactive and autonomous – they work on their own and no human tells them what do to. It lives on your Mac, Windows or Linux machine 24/7. It doesn’t just answer questions; it can message you on Telegram or WhatsApp to say, “I’ve finished that task” – just like JARVIS talks to Tony Stark (Iron Man).It also gets full access, which means it knows what’s on the computer and emails, and documents as well as can run commands on your computer, organise your files and execute code locally. They have ‘skills’, that allow them to read emails, manage smart home, or log into Moltbook to socialise with other agents – it’s like having ‘a digital version of yourself who has a (virtual) life’.","Moltbook is a Reddit-like forum designed exclusively for AI agents.

Read Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal's long note to all those 'he fired' and those who resigned,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/read-zomato-founder-deepinder-goyals-long-note-to-all-those-he-fired-and-those-who-resigned/articleshow/127904237.cms,"Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal’s post to ex-employees

If you used to work at Zomato, whether you chose to move on, or I was the one who asked you to leave, this is for you.

I know that for many of you, Zomato didn't have the environment, or the leadership you needed at the time. But I know for sure, that you loved being at Zomato, and it is quite possible that you never felt like home anywhere else since you left.

We have over four hundred people at Eternal today in their second or third stints. Many of them are doing their best work now. Maybe because they've grown, but also because the company has grown. We are more organised, a little less chaotic, and hopefully, I've learned a few things along the way too.

If you haven't reached out because you think the door is closed, or because you think I'm holding onto the past, I'm not. I want you back.

There is so much to build at Eternal. We are today, a family of companies. Zomato, Blinkit Quick-Commerce, Blinkit Ambulances, District, Hyperpure, Nugget, and Feeding India. We need people who already know what good looks like here, and who care enough to fight for it. There is no better person for that than someone who has been here, left, grown, and wants to come back.

You might say that Eternal is not going to be the same, because I am not the CEO anymore. But ask yourself a question. Did titles ever matter at Eternal? I am still very much here, and I'd love for you to be a part of this next phase of Eternal.

If you feel like you have unfinished business here, please don't overthink it. Write to me at back@eternal.com. The Gurgaon pollution is still a bug, but being at Eternal is the feature. Let's talk and find a role that fits your life as it is today.",Deepinder Goyal has written to ex-employees at Zomato. He wants them to come back to the company. Goyal says there is so much to build at Eternal. He asks them to write to him at back@eternal.com.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127904230,imgsize-11920,width-400,resizemode-4/zomato-founder-deepinder-goyal.jpg"
Sam Altman wants to celebrate Christmas in April this year and why Elon Musk is the reason,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altman-wants-to-celebrate-christmas-in-april-this-year-and-why-elon-musk-is-the-reason/articleshow/127900856.cms,"Elon Musk vs OpenAI

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Elon Musk's fraud case against OpenAI gets a trial date

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently said that he is “really excited to get Elon (Musk) under oath” adding that he wishes to celebrate “Christmas in April”. The tech CEO shared a post on microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) writing: “Really excited to get Elon under oath in a few months, Christmas in April!”. The post sarcastically anticipates Elon Musk 's trial testimony in the ongoing lawsuit against OpenAI against allegations of breaching the company's nonprofit origins. A January 2026 court ruling recently said that both founders will testify under oath in April this year.Sam Altman’s remark echoes the years-long feud between Elon Musk and him. Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015 along with Sam Altman, Greg Brockman and others. The tech billionaire left the OpenAI board in 2018 citing disagreements on the control and direction of the company.The Tesla CEO sued the AI company in 2024 claiming that OpenAI has strayed from its original mission of developing AI for the benefit of humanity and instead prioritised commercial interests. The lawsuit alleges that the company’s partnership with Microsoft resulted in significant funding and resources for the company, which is a breach of the company's founding contract.“After Musk lent his name to the venture, invested significant time, tens of millions of dollars in seed capital, and recruited top Al scientists for OpenAI, Inc., Musk and the non-profit's namesake objective were betrayed by Altman and his accomplices. The perfidy and deceit are of Shakespearean proportions,” the lawsuit claimed.“Once OpenAI, Inc.'s technology approached transformative AGI, Altman flipped the narrative and proceeded to cash in,” it added.Last month, federal Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers set jury selection for the lawsuit for April 27, with proceedings starting the following day. The trial is said to last up to four weeks, through May 22, as per the court filings.","Elon Musk's fraud case against OpenAI gets a trial date in April.

Tesla still a major contributor to Elon Musk’s wealth

Second major merger for Elon Musk

Four Milestones in Four Months

October 2025: First person to reach $500 billion, after leaving President Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency to refocus on Tesla.

December 15: First to hit $600 billion, following SpaceX’s valuation jump to $800 billion.

December 19: Crossed $700 billion, after the Delaware Supreme Court reinstated his Tesla stock options.

February 2026: Surpassed $800 billion, thanks to the SpaceX-xAI merger .

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has now become the first person in history to surpass a net worth of $800 billion after the landmark merger of his rocket company SpaceX and his artificial intelligence company xAI. As reported by Forbes, the deal valued the combined entity at $1.25 trillion, giving a boost to Musk’s personal fortune by $84 billion to a staggering $852 billion.The merger of the two companies restructured Elon Musk’s holdings and gave him 43% stake in the newly combined company which is estimated to be $542 billion. Before the acquisition deal between SpaceX and xAI, Elon Musk held 42% stake in SpaceX which valued around $336 billion and a 49% stake in xAI which was worth $122 billion. With SpaceX now absorbing xAI, the rocket maker has become Elon Musk’s most precious asset, outpacing his other holdings.Elon Musk owns around 12% stake in Tesla, valued at $178 billion along with stock options worth another $124 billion. These figures exclude the record-breaking pay package approved by Tesla shareholders in November, which could grant Musk up to $1 trillion in additional stock if Tesla manages to hit the ambitious ‘Mars shot’ milestones including an eightfold increase in market cap over the next decade.This is the second major merger involving Elon Musk’s companies in less than a year. In March last year, Musk combined xAI and his social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). In the deal, xAI was valued at $80 billion and X at $33 billion. The dual role of Musk as a buyer and seller raised eyebrows over valuation transparency, but with SpaceX now expected to go public later this year, the market will soon have its say.Musk’s rise to the top has been meteoric.","Elon Musk has now become the first person in history to surpass a net worth of $800 billion after the merger of his rocket company SpaceX and his artificial intelligence company xAI.

Bareilly company director arrested for renting out company's bank account to cyber fraudsters: How network spread across 11 states,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bareilly-company-director-arrested-for-renting-out-companys-bank-account-to-cyber-fraudsters-how-network-spread-across-11-states/articleshow/122790076.cms,"Director of a private company based in Bareilly has been arrested for renting out his company's bank account to cyber criminals. Police has arrested Pradeep Kumar Singh, for allegedly leasing his company's bank account to cybercriminals who siphoned off an estimated Rs 3.2 crore from victims across 11 states. The illicit funds were swiftly converted into USDT cryptocurrency and routed to digital wallets reportedly operating from Hong Kong, significantly complicating recovery efforts.According to Bareilly police, Singh, director of Narayani Infratech , received an advance payment of ₹75,000 for allowing his company's account to be used in the elaborate fraud scheme. Police departments in states including Delhi, Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttarakhand had been tracking his activities.Cybercell SHO Dinesh Sharma revealed details of the investigation, stating, ""Our investigation found that ₹3.2 crore obtained through fraud were transferred to Narayani Infratech's bank account on June 18 and 19. Of this, ₹1.1 crore came from the account of a scientist posted at IVRI Bareilly who was digitally arrested by the fraudsters. The remaining amount was sent through fraud from other states. On June 20, the entire amount was withdrawn from the account, which was then frozen.""Investigators have seized three mobile phones, an Aadhaar card, a PAN card, and a crypto wallet from the suspects. They are currently analyzing the crypto wallet to establish connections to a suspected international network, with initial findings pointing towards operations based in China.SP (Crime) Manish Sonkar affirmed the ongoing nature of the investigation. ""The investigation is progressing and the entire network will soon be dismantled,"" Sonkar stated. He confirmed that nine suspects have been jailed in connection with the case. In addition to Pradeep Kumar Singh, Mahfooz and Aman were arrested and jailed on Sunday.

Elon Musk’s role in Dogecoin’s popularity



Can Dogecoin really hit $0.42

Free phone or empty Bank Account: New scam alert

Dogecoin, the meme coin often adored by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, has surged more than 10% in the past week. As of Friday, July 18, the token coin traded at around $0.234, nearly 70% below its all-time high of $0.7376 set in May 2021. The rally comes as Bitcoin hit a new record of $123,091.61 this week, boosting sentiment across cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez who goes by @ali_charts on X (formerly Twitter), the Dogecoin seems to form a ""double bottom"" pattern soon. “If the pattern plays out, Dogecoin could rise to $0.42 by September,” Martinez wrote.In technical terms, a double bottom occurs when an asset hits a low point twice with a small rally in between. If the price breaks above the middle high — known as the neckline — it often indicates the start of an upward trend.Martinez also pointed out an increase in large transactions. He said that more than 1 billion Dogecoin tokens have been purchased by crypto “whales” within just 48 hours.In general, whale activity often comes before major price moves in the crypto market, and Dogecoin’s sudden surge in volume has caught the attention of traders and analysts alike.While Elon Musk has not publicly commented on Dogecoin, his support for the meme coin in the past can be termed ‘influential’. The tech billionaire has called it the ‘people’s crypto’ and even hinted at using it in products and services at his companies – Tesla and X.Even without a direct mention, the market still watches Musk’s movements closely, as his tweets have repeatedly influenced Dogecoin’s price in the past.At its current price of $0.234, Dogecoin would need to rise about 80% to reach Martinez’s target of $0.42 by September. While that may seem ambitious, the crypto market is known for sharp moves driven by technical signals, whale action, and online buzz.","Dogecoin, the meme coin often adored by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, has surged more than 10% in the past week.

AI adoption challenges test human adaptability limits

Entrepreneurs must drive new job creation as AI reshinks teams

Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas has a message for young people: ditch the endless social media scrolling and start mastering artificial intelligence tools instead. Speaking in a Thursday interview with Matthew Berman, Srinivas urged people to ""spend less time doomscrolling on Instagram; spend more time using the AIs.""The CEO warned that those who fail to adapt to AI technology will be left behind in the job market . ""People who really are at the frontier of using AIs are going to be way more employable than people who are not,"" Srinivas said. ""That's guaranteed to happen.""Srinivas acknowledged that keeping pace with rapidly evolving AI technology poses significant challenges for most people. ""Human race has never been extremely fast at adapting,"" he said, noting that AI technology evolves every three to six months, testing ""the limits in terms of how fast we can adapt.""The Perplexity chief predicted that some workers will inevitably lose their jobs due to their inability to keep up with AI advances. However, he sees entrepreneurship as the solution to potential job displacement.As AI reduces headcounts across industries, Srinivas believes new employment opportunities must come from entrepreneurs rather than traditional companies. ""Either the other people who lose jobs end up starting companies themselves and make use of AIs, or they end up learning the AIs and contribute to new companies,"" he explained.His comments align with broader industry concerns about AI's impact on employment. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently predicted AI could eliminate 50% of white-collar entry-level positions within five years, while AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton warned that artificial intelligence will replace workers in ""mundane intellectual labor."" However, other tech leaders like Nvidia's Jensen Huang take a more optimistic view, suggesting AI will transform rather than eliminate jobs entirely.","Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas urges young people to focus on mastering artificial intelligence tools instead of social media.

When Microsoft founder Bill Gates called Elon Musk ‘super mean’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-microsoft-founder-bill-gates-called-elon-musk-super-mean/articleshow/122783766.cms,"Bill Gates will go bankrupt if…: Elon Musk

Microsoft founder Bill Gates once said that Elon is “super mean” and that he can not be taken ‘too personally’. The remark was made by Gates in Walter Isaacson’s 2023 biography of the Tesla CEO, highlighting what can be considered as one of the most high-profile billionaire feuds in recent memory. Fallout between Bill Gates and Elon Musk started when the former held a short position against Tesla. It has since turned into a public clash over climate, philanthropy, and global aid.Bill Gates told Isaacson that he had shorted Tesla stock, a move that angered Elon Musk. In private text messages later made public, Musk asked Gates if he still held a ""$500 million short position against Tesla."" To this Gates replied, ""Sorry to say I haven't closed it yet. I would like to discuss philanthropy possibilities.""In a straight reply, Musk rejected the outreach. ""Sorry, I cannot take your philanthropy on climate change seriously when you have a massive short position against Tesla, the company doing the most to solve climate change,"" he reportedly responded.Soon after, Elon Musk posted a meme mocking Gates’ appearance. That post marked a turning point, as the disagreement moved from finance to something more personal — and public.In a post last year, Musk warned that Bill Gates might go bankrupt if Tesla becomes “the world’s most valuable company by far,” reigniting the feud over Gates’ short position against the electric vehicle giant.For those unaware, Short position refers to a stock market strategy where an investor borrows shares of a stock they do not own, sells them on the open market, and aims to buy them back later at a lower price. The goal is to profit from a decline in the stock's price.","Bill Gates told Walter Isaacson that he had shorted Tesla stock, a move that angered Elon Musk.

Free phone or empty Bank Account: New scam alert

Microsoft is leaning towards signing the European Union’s AI code of practice even as Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta has rejected the guidelines, citing significant ""legal uncertainties."" According to a report, the Windows maker appears to sign the European Union's voluntary code of practice designed to help companies comply with the bloc's landmark Artificial Intelligence Act.According to a report by news agency Reuters, Microsoft President Brad Smith said on Friday (July 18) that the company will have to read the documents.“I think it's likely we will sign. We need to read the documents,” Smith said.“Our goal is to find a way to be supportive and at the same time one of the things we really welcome is the direct engagement by the AI Office with industry,” he added, referring to the EU's primary AI regulatory body.The code of practice, developed by 13 independent experts, aims to offer legal clarity to its signatories. Companies that sign on will be required to publish summaries of the data used to train their general-purpose AI models and implement policies adhering to EU copyright law.This code forms a component of the AI Act, which officially came into force in June 2024 and will apply to a vast array of tech companies, including Google's parent company Alphabet, Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic and Mistral.Meta, however, has reiterated its strong criticism of the code with Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, stating in a LinkedIn blog post that the social media giant won’t sign it.“Meta won't be signing it. This code introduces a number of legal uncertainties for model developers, as well as measures which go far beyond the scope of the AI Act,” he said.Kaplan indicated that the US social media giant shares concerns previously raised by a group of 45 European companies. He warned that this perceived “over-reach will throttle the development and deployment of frontier AI models in Europe, and stunt European companies looking to build businesses on top of them.”Notably, other prominent AI developers, OpenAI and Mistral, have already signed the code of practice.","Microsoft appears to be leaning towards signing the European Union's AI code of practice.

Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for 'offensive' political slurs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/poland-flags-elon-musks-grok-chatbot-to-the-eu-for-offensive-political-slurs/articleshow/122348777.cms,"Poland flags Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot to the EU for “offensive” political slurs

Why Poland says Elon Musk's Grok chatbot crossed a red line



Offensive answers: From antisemitic tropes to political insults



European digital rules put xAI under the spotlight



Previous incidents: Turkey, hate speech, and Grok’s growing rap sheet



xAI and Musk offer silence, at least for now



Poland just pulled the alarm on Grok, the AI chatbot from Elon Musk ’s xAI. Officials in Warsaw say the bot spewed insults about Prime Minister Donald Tusk and other leaders, so they’re asking the European Commission to investigate and, if the rules allow, hit xAI or X with fines.Krzysztof Gawkowski, Poland’s digitisation minister, told RMF FM radio that the bot’s remarks amounted to hate speech. He argued that ignoring algorithm-driven abuse “may cost humanity in the future,” so his ministry will file an official complaint under existing EU regulations.The step is unusual but legal: member states can trigger EU probes when digital services target their citizens with unlawful content. If Brussels agrees, xAI could face penalties under the Digital Services Act or the forthcoming AI Act.Grok’s missteps are piling up. The same day Poland aired its grievance, the Anti-Defamation League flagged responses in which the bot praised Adolf Hitler and recycled antisemitic stereotypes. xAI deleted the posts, calling them “inappropriate,” yet offered no public apology.Users had also shared screenshots showing Grok calling Tusk “a coward in Brussels slippers,” among other jabs. Warsaw says the language breaches Poland’s hate-speech law and the EU’s code of practice on disinformation.The EU’s Digital Services Act took full effect for very large platforms in February 2025. It forces companies such as X to assess systemic risks, audit their algorithms, and let regulators peek behind the curtain. An AI-specific law is coming later this year, likely adding fresh transparency mandates.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's net worth soars $1 billion as the chipmaker joins the $4 trillion club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-net-worth-soars-1-billion-as-the-chipmaker-joins-the-4-trillion-club/articleshow/122377958.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang’s net worth passes $140 billion



Nvidia’s market value climbs above $4 trillion



How a 3.5 percent stake fuels one of the world’s biggest fortunes



Where Jensen Huang now ranks among global billionaires



Why investors keep bidding the price up

AI demand everywhere. Cloud providers, carmakers, and sovereign data-centre projects line up for the current Hopper chips and the coming Blackwell series.

Scarcity premium. Nvidia controls around 80 percent of high-end AI GPU supply, and capacity stays tight even after Taiwan’s fabs ramp up output.

Ecosystem lock-in. CUDA software and support contracts make switching costs high, so even rivals that launch competitive silicon must still lure developers away.

What could slow the rally

Export curbs. The United States still blocks top-tier chips from shipping to China, Nvidia’s largest single-country market outside the U.S.

New competition. AMD, Intel and a clutch of start-ups are readying chips that nibble at Nvidia’s margins, especially in inference workloads.

Rich valuation. At about 40 times forward earnings, the stock leaves little room for an earnings miss; even a small disappointment could yank billions from Huang’s paper wealth.

Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold. The jump did more than rewrite Wall Street leaderboards; it also pushed co-founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s fortune past $140 billion. He owns about 3.5 percent of Nvidia, held directly and through family trusts, so every flicker in the share price lands straight in his pocket.Bloomberg’s daily billionaire tally shows Jensen Huang adding roughly $1 billion in a single session, and nearly $28 billion in 2025 so far. That kind of lift puts him shoulder-to-shoulder with household names like Warren Buffett, a spot unthinkable just three years ago. Investors keep paying the premium because Nvidia sells the chips that make modern AI run, from data-centre clusters to enterprise servers. The faster the market grows, the richer Huang becomes.As of the New York closing bell on 10 July, Bloomberg pegged Huang’s net worth at $143 billion, up from about $20 billion in early 2022. That leap happened in stages: $44 billion by mid-2023, $117 billion in late 2024, and now the $140-plus range. Fueled by the AI boom and soaring Nvidia shares, the difference this year alone is bigger than the entire market value of some Fortune 500 firms.The company’s share price settled near $164, capping a run that has lifted the stock 74 percent since April’s low and around 22 percent since January. Nvidia is now the dominant weight in the S&P 500, ahead of Apple and Microsoft. Analysts at Citi, Barclays and Loop Capital all raised their price targets this week, citing demand for the upcoming Blackwell platform and a backlog of data-centre orders.Huang’s percentage looks small beside founder holdings at some other tech giants, yet at a $4 trillion valuation it leaves him with shares worth roughly $140 billion. The stake figure comes from Nvidia’s March 2025 proxy filing and excludes unvested stock units. Cash, past dividend income and secondary-share sales round out the number Bloomberg uses, but the equity slice is what matters daily.With the latest move, he edges into Bloomberg’s global top ten, swapping places with Google’s Larry Page and closing in on Warren Buffett. Forbes, which refreshes less often, lists him ninth. None of the other names in that bracket made their money so fast in so short a window.","N Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold.

YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.

Tech giants scramble to secure power sources for AI operations

Superintelligence timeline accelerates despite infrastructure challenges

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt warns that the United States faces a critical energy shortage that could derail the artificial intelligence revolution, calling electricity, not semiconductors or funding, the primary constraint limiting AI development.""AI's natural limit is electricity, not chips,"" Schmidt said in a LinkedIn post Thursday, highlighting the infrastructure crisis facing Silicon Valley's race toward superintelligence .The energy demands are staggering. Schmidt noted that ""the US is currently expected to need another 92 gigawatts of power to support the AI revolution ."" To put this in perspective, he explained that ""one gigawatt is roughly the equivalent of one nuclear power station,"" yet ""there are essentially none of these facilities being built, and in the last 30 years, only two have been constructed.""This energy crunch comes as tech giants pour billions into achieving superintelligence, AI that ""greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest,"" according to Oxford researcher Nick Bostrom's definition. Companies like Meta and OpenAI are aggressively competing for AI talent to reach this milestone first.Major corporations are already taking desperate measures. Microsoft struck a 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy to restart Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island nuclear plant, which closed in 2019, targeting a 2028 relaunch. The company's AI operations have already driven a 34% increase in water usage, consuming 1.7 billion gallons between 2021 and 2022.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has personally invested in nuclear fusion startup Helion, acknowledging that an energy breakthrough ""is essential for AI's future."" Meanwhile, Microsoft and AMD have urged senators to fast-track permits to prevent grid overload from AI's massive energy demands.Schmidt believes specialized AI systems will transform every sector within five years. ""It is reasonable to predict that we are going to have specialized AI savants in every field within five years,"" he wrote, describing superintelligence as ""intelligence beyond the sum of all humans.""However, critics like Greenpeace warn that current AI energy consumption could derail climate goals. Researchers project global AI workloads may consume 4.2 to 6.6 billion cubic meters of water by 2027, enough to supply Canada's entire population for over a year.""We don't know what AI will deliver, and we certainly don't know what superintelligence will bring, but we know that it is coming fast,"" Schmidt cautioned.

Government on Chinese engineers leaving iPhone maker Foxconn's plant

India's electronics industry has reportedly raised a red flag over what it describes as ""informal trade restrictions"" imposed by China. The industry warns that the covert measures being used by China could cripple India's global competitiveness and jeopardize its ambitious $32 billion smartphone export target for the current fiscal year. According to a report in Economic Times, industry views China's actions as a deliberate attempt to undermine India's emergence as a global manufacturing powerhouse.In a recent letter to the government, the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), the industry body representing major players like Apple, Google, Motorola, Foxconn, Vivo, Oppo, Lava, Dixon, Flex, and Tata Electronics, wrote that China's actions are ""solely aimed at crippling India’s supply chains and undermining its rise as a global manufacturing hub."" The curbs, the ICEA highlighted, are already causing significant delays and inflating costs for manufacturers.The SOS letter has urged the Indian government to urgently intervene regarding China's latest controls on capital equipment, critical minerals, and the movement of skilled technical personnel. Crucially, the ICEA emphasized that these restrictions are being enforced in a ""planned, sequential manner without any formal notifications, and only through verbal instructions.""""While domestic production remains relatively insulated for now, export-linked manufacturing to the tune of $24 billion in FY25, projected to cross $32 billion in FY26 in smartphones has now come under serious risk,"" the ICEA warned in its letter.Recently, there have been reports that China asked all Chinese engineers and technicians at Foxconn plants in India to leave the country. According to a recent Bloomberg report, Apple's largest iPhone manufacturer Foxconn, has recalled over 300 Chinese engineers and technicians from its Indian production facilities, creating significant operational challenges as the iPhone-maker prepares for iPhone 17 manufacturing. The mass withdrawal, which began two months ago, reportedly leaves only Taiwanese support staff at Foxconn's India plants.A large part of mobile phone manufacturing equipment is imported from China, and Chinese professionals have the expertise to operate it.As reported by the news agency PTI, the government has stated that it's monitoring production targets and believes Apple has alternatives to manage any related issues.

House Speaker Mike Johnson recently told reporters he sent Elon Musk a detailed message during negotiations over President Trump’s sweeping One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Days passed, and the message still showed “unread.” Only later did Johnson discover the tech billionaire had changed his phone number after a tense phone call with Trump over the bill’s multitrillion-dollar price tag and its rollback of clean-energy incentives. The silent switch marked the clearest sign yet that Musk—once an informal adviser on government efficiency—had cut direct, private ties with the White House.The disagreement is more than personal drama: Musk’s companies depend on federal contracts and tax policy, and Trump has relied on the entrepreneur’s public support for pro-business branding. The story shows how a single severed line of communication can ripple through legislation, markets, and future space and defence projects.Negotiators were finalising the One Big Beautiful Bill, a tax-and-spending package estimated to cost between $2.5 trillion and $5 trillion over ten years. Musk, who had pressed lawmakers to shrink the deficit, called the draft “a disgusting abomination” that “explodes the debt.” He was especially critical of Section 402, which ends the federal $7,500 electric-vehicle credit after September 2025 and scraps additional clean-energy incentives.Johnson said he texted Musk to calm tempers and discuss possible amendments. The reply never came. After checking with mutual contacts, Johnson learned the number was no longer active—Musk had switched lines shortly after a heated call with Trump. Johnson later described his message as “out in the ether.”Federal contracts — SpaceX launches astronauts under multi-year NASA awards. A sour personal rapport does not void contracts, but high-level coordination could slow down if trust erodes.Johnson says he still hopes for a face-to-face meeting. Meanwhile, agency officials insist day-to-day cooperation with Musk’s companies will continue under procurement rules. Lobbyists, however, note that large space or defence projects often need executive-branch goodwill—something a changed phone number won’t provide.Security consultants familiar with high-profile executives say Musk had kept the same primary line since at least 2020, rotating secondary “travel” phones more frequently.Most defence and NASA contracts require written notice within 30 days if a contractor’s senior representative changes contact details, ensuring project continuity.Yes. Title XI authorises $1.2 billion over five years for advanced launch-vehicle R&D, funding that SpaceX and other providers can competitively bid for.Since 1900, no CEO-led national party has secured more than 19 percent of the popular vote; the most successful was Ross Perot’s Reform Party in 1992.","Elon Musk changed his phone number after falling out with Donald Trump.

What is EU's AI Act

EU's warning to companies who do not sign

Facebook parent Meta is clear that it is not happy with the European Union's AI law. Meta has clearly in no uncertain terms declared that it will not endorse Europe's recently published code of practice for its groundbreaking artificial intelligence laws, labeling the guidelines as excessive and a potential source of legal ambiguity. The move, as reported by Bloomberg, signals a fresh escalation in tensions between major US tech companies and European regulators.In a LinkedIn post, Joel Kaplan, Meta's head of global affairs, voiced the company's strong opposition to the EU law. ""Europe is heading down the wrong path on AI."" He further elaborated that the code ""introduces a number of legal uncertainties for model developers, as well as measures which go far beyond the scope of the AI Act,"" he wrote.This latest development follows a pattern of friction between American tech giants and European regulators, who are increasingly seeking to curb their market dominance. Notably, the administration of President Donald Trump had previously intervened in April, before the code's finalization, to argue against its adoption by the EU, criticizing the bloc's tech regulations as unfairly targeting American companies.Incidentally, it is not just the American companies opposing EU's AI ACt, numerous European companies, including industry leaders like ASML Holding NV and Airbus SE, along with AI firm Mistral AI, wrote an open letter this month to the European Commission. They asked for a two-year suspension of the AI Act's implementation, advocating for what they termed a more ""innovation-friendly regulatory approach.""The European Union's voluntary framework, released earlier this month, aims to assist companies in adhering to the comprehensive AI Act. It includes provisions for copyright protection for creators, transparency requirements for advanced AI models, and mandates for developers to provide documentation detailing their AI models' features. While agreeing to the code offers companies increased legal protection against potential breaches of the Act, Meta has chosen to forgo this pathway.The code of practice still awaits final approval from both the European Commission and member states. Its drafting involved working groups composed of representatives from AI labs, technology companies, academia, and digital rights organizations. The AI Act itself is being rolled out in stages, with rules impacting general-purpose AI models, such as ChatGPT, set to become effective next month.Thomas Regnier, the European Commission's spokesperson on digital matters, highlighted the implications for non-signatories. AI providers who do not sign the code ""will have to demonstrate other means of compliance"" and consequently ""may be exposed to more regulatory scrutiny.""The EU's AI Act carries significant penalties for non-compliance, with fines potentially reaching as much as 7% of a company’s annual sales, or 3% for developers of advanced AI models.","Facebook parent Meta has declared that it will not endorse Europe's recently published code of practice for its groundbreaking artificial intelligence laws.

What Microsoft said about changing its US government customer policy



“In response to concerns raised earlier this week about US-supervised foreign engineers, Microsoft has made changes to our support for US Government customers to assure that no China-based engineering teams are providing technical assistance for DoD Government cloud and related services.

We remain committed to providing the most secure services possible to the US government, including working with our national security partners to evaluate and adjust our security protocols as needed.”

“

Earlier this week, we were alerted to a potential vulnerability in our DOD computer systems, and we've been checking into it ever since. It turns out that some tech companies have been using cheap Chinese labour to assist with DOD cloud services.

This is obviously unacceptable, especially in today's digital threat environment. Now, this was a legacy system created over a decade ago during the Obama Administration, but we have to ensure the digital systems that we use here at the Defence Department are ironclad and impenetrable, and that's why, today, I'm announcing that China will no longer have any involvement whatsoever in our cloud services effective immediately.

And at my direction, the department will also initiate as fast as we can. A two-week review or faster to make sure that what we uncovered isn't happening anywhere else across the DoD. We will continue to monitor and counter all threats to our military infrastructure and online networks.”

Microsoft has introduced changes to its support policy for US government customers. The tech giant has confirmed that ""no China-based engineering teams "" will provide technical support for US defence clients using its cloud services. This revision follows a report by ProPublica that detailed the US Defence Department's reliance on Microsoft-hired software engineers who are based in China. The report also prompted US Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) to send a letter to Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth seeking details of the tech giant’s alleged use of Chinese engineers for US military systems, as it raised concerns about potential national security risks.In a post shared on the social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Frank Shaw, Microsoft’s chief communications officer, wrote:The ProPublica report noted that Microsoft’s Chinese Azure engineers are supervised by US-based “digital escorts,” who often have less technical expertise than the overseas engineers they oversee. The report suggested that this setup could expose the US to potential cyber threats from China .In a recent video posted on X, Hegseth signed a memo for a review to check if cheap Chinese labour is being used in any other parts of the Defence Department. In the video, he said:","Microsoft has introduced changes to its support policy for US government customers.

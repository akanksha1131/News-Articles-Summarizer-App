Explained: What is Anthropic's AI tool that wiped $285 billion off software stocks in a single day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-what-is-anthropics-ai-tool-that-wiped-285-billion-off-software-stocks-in-a-single-day/articleshow/127892310.cms,"A swift market reaction, dubbed 'SaaSpocalypse,' saw software stocks plummet by $285 billion after Anthropic's AI assistant, Claude Cowork, launched new plugins. The legal workflow automation plugin, in particular, triggered a selloff in legal tech and broader software sectors. Analysts now fear AI platforms are becoming direct competitors to existing software providers.

What exactly did Anthropic release

Why the market panic over a folder of prompts

What does this mean for the software industry going forward

Anthropic's newly launched AI plugins have triggered what analysts are calling a 'SaaSpocalypse'—a brutal selloff that wiped out roughly $285 billion from software, legal tech and financial services stocks in a single trading session. The AI developer, known for its Claude chatbot, released 11 open-source plugins for its Claude Cowork tool on Friday, January 30. One of them targets legal workflows, and that alone was enough to send investors running for the exits.Thomson Reuters dropped over 15%. RELX, owner of LexisNexis, fell 14%. LegalZoom got hammered nearly 20%. A Goldman Sachs basket tracking US software stocks posted its worst single-day decline since April's tariff-driven selloff. The Nasdaq fell 1.4%, with ripple effects extending to Indian IT giants—Infosys ADRs slipped 5.5% and Wipro fell nearly 5%.Claude Cowork is an agentic AI assistant that Anthropic launched earlier in January. Think of it as Claude Code—the company's developer-focused coding tool—but redesigned for non-technical professionals. It can read files, organise folders, draft documents and carry out multi-step tasks with user consent.The plugins announced last Friday supercharge this capability. They let companies tailor Claude to specific job functions by specifying how work should be done, which tools and data to pull from, and what workflows to automate. Anthropic open-sourced 11 starter plugins covering productivity, sales, marketing, finance, data analysis, customer support, product management and biology research.But it was the legal plugin that spooked markets. It automates contract review, NDA triage, compliance checks and legal briefings. Anthropic was careful to note that all outputs should be reviewed by licensed attorneys and that the tool does not provide legal advice. That disclaimer did little to calm investors.Here's the thing that has caught many observers off guard: the legal plugin is essentially a set of prompts and configurations. There's no proprietary model fine-tuned on case law, no special legal reasoning engine. It's Claude being Claude, but with structured workflow instructions.The real signal, analysts say, is that Anthropic has moved from selling the model to owning the workflow. When Claude was just an API, companies like Thomson Reuters could build on top of it. Thomson Reuters literally runs CoCounsel on OpenAI. But when Anthropic starts publishing ready-made vertical solutions, the platform becomes the competitor.Jefferies dubbed the selloff a 'SaaSpocalypse', noting that investor sentiment has shifted dramatically. The narrative used to be that AI helps software companies. Now it's that AI replaces them. 'Trading is very much get-me-out style selling,' said Jeffrey Favuzza from Jefferies' equity trading desk.The damage extended well beyond legal tech. DocuSign fell 11%, Salesforce dropped nearly 7%, Adobe slid 7%, and ServiceNow declined 7%. Business development companies with exposure to software loans also got caught in the selling. Blue Owl Capital Corp fell 13%, marking a record ninth consecutive decline.Anthropic isn't the only player in legal AI. Startups like Harvey AI (valued at $5 billion) and Legora ($1.8 billion valuation) have been developing tools for years. But Anthropic's advantage is that it builds its own underlying models. Firms like Legora rely on models from developers like Anthropic, which means Claude's creator can potentially disrupt both traditional legal services and the startups trying to disrupt them.The iteration speed is also striking. Cowork launched on January 12. The plugins dropped less than three weeks later. Enterprise software companies typically spend quarters on such releases.For software executives watching the carnage unfold, the takeaway is uncomfortable but clear: Anthropic didn't need a breakthrough product to rattle markets. It just needed to show what Claude could already do—and hit publish.","Anthropic's AI assistant, Claude Cowork, launched new plugins.

The United States is locked in a global race with Chinese AV companies for the future of autonomous driving, a trillion-dollar industry comparable in strategic importance to flight and space travel.”Waymo informed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that one of its driverless vehicles “struck a child near an elementary school” in Santa Monica, California, on January 23. According to records posted to the NHTSA website, the child sustained minor injuries.“The child ran across the street from behind a double-parked SUV towards the school and was struck by the Waymo AV,” NHTSA said in a document describing the incident.“Our technology immediately detected the individual as soon as they began to emerge from behind the stopped vehicle. The Waymo Driver braked hard, reducing speed from approximately 17 mph to under 6 mph before contact was made,” Waymo said in a statement on their blog.“This significant reduction in impact speed and severity is a demonstration of the material safety benefit of the Waymo Driver,” the company said.",Google-sister company Waymo has said that it will defend its safety record before the US Senate Commerce Committee.

Walmart reached a market capitalization of over $1 trillion on Tuesday (February 3). This makes the American company the first retailer in the world to join an exclusive club of companies to reach a 13-figure valuation that mostly consists of technology companies like Google, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta. The company has been riding on a year-long rally that has seen its shares rise nearly 26%. The retail giant reached the $1 trillion mark only about two weeks after it moved from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to the Nasdaq-100. The trillion-dollar tag also comes only two days after new CEO John Furner took over for longtime CEO Doug McMillon. Walmart's ascent has been notable as it has managed to tap into a mix of appealing simultaneously to higher-income customers seeking value and convenience and retaining its core base of lower-income shoppersWalmart bet early and aggressively on AI, pouring billions into supply-chain automation to stock fresher produce, speed up deliveries and improve inventory forecasting and search. In just the past five years, the retailer has reportedly expanded its online marketplace to over half a billion items, launched one-hour delivery, created Walmart+ to rival Amazon Prime, and built a $4+ billion advertising business that boosted margins. ""They've gone from just being the local retailer for good prices to really embracing technology. It's been a massive digital business transformation that this company has gone through over the last five years,"" Eric Clark, chief investment officer at Accuvest Global Advisors, to Reuters.Walmart has been lately positioning itself as a leader in AI commerce, announcing a partnership with Google in January this year to allow customers to purchase products using the tech giant’s Gemini chatbot. Analysts are terming Walmart as ""the new AI giant"". Google and Walmart's announcement is said to be a key indicator of how AI is reshaping commerce. In January, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and then-incoming Walmart US CEO Furner announced a partnership resulting in shoppers now able to shop Walmart and Sam’s Club products directly on Gemini, Google AI chatbot. The announcement was made at the National Retail Federation’s Big Show.At the event Walmart CEO made it clear that he is willing to make changes to how retail operates and fully embrace AI’s potential. He said, “What won’t change … is our purpose, our values, the way we think about people leading.” Furner added, “But everything else we are willing to change — what we sell, how we interact with customers, with our associates.”The Google partnership means that Gemini users are able to discover Walmart items when doing research on the chatbot, which will automatically offer product recommendations from the retailer where and when relevant. If users decide that they want to purchase the product being recommended in the conversation, they can do so instantly, with Walmart’s checkout environment appearing.Brian Mulberry, senior client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, told Reuters that the way Walmart is weaving technology (including AI) into its operations, from cutting the cost of goods to capturing a larger share of consumer spending it is the emerging 'new AI giant'. Joining the AI race with Amazon, Walmart has been growing investments in AI. This has helped the retailer close the gap with online behemoth Amazon, which had a head start with its chatbot, Rufus, a GenAI-powered assistant that answers shopping queries.",Walmart reached a market capitalization of over $1 trillion on Tuesday (February 3) This makes the American company the first retailer in the world to join an exclusive club of companies to reach a 13-figure valuation.

There are moments in Wordle when you lose confidence and follow your instincts. That's how people usually wait these days. You can't take shortcuts, but you also can't rush through the puzzle. Initial presumptions may appear favourable at first, but they can also progressively impede better decisions. The letters are recognisable and nearly obvious, but the placement is more important than normal. Smart openers and ostentatious risks are not appropriate at this moment. Players who pay as much attention to what is absent as to what is present are rewarded, but it requires self-control and concentration.It makes sense if you've been staring at the grid for longer than you intended. As long as the framework aligns, the solution remains unattainable. You can maintain stability and concentrate on the word by using a few well-chosen signals.Wordle challenges players to uncover a hidden five-letter word in six attempts. After each guess, tiles change colour to show how close you are.Using this feedback to refine each new guess is the core of the game.If today’s puzzle is proving stubborn, these clues focus on structure rather than spelling. They are intended to guide rather than solve.Reviewing eliminated letters and leaning on common consonants may help reduce the remaining options and bring the solution into view.The answer to Wordle #1688 on February 1, 2026, is:Meaning: Something covered with thorns.Whether you solved it on your first guess or needed a few clues, Wordle remains a fun way to sharpen your mind every day.

Use AI to help you with everyday tasks like making notes, scheduling, and doing research so you can spend more time on important and creative work.

Read articles, watch tutorials, or take short online courses to keep your interest in new technologies.

Check your facts and don't rely too much on automated results to learn how to use AI responsibly.

Keep your digital skills up to date so you can stay confident in a work environment that is always changing.

AI can help you save time on things you do every day, like planning trips, keeping track of your money, or learning new things.

Instead of being afraid of technology, tell your friends, coworkers, and family members to learn and grow with it.

Use technology in a way that is in line with human values like honesty, empathy, and critical thinking.

Sam Altman’s other famous quotes

“Hire people who are smarter than you and want to prove it.”

“Risk is not optional—it’s the price of ambition.”

“We need to think long-term if we want to survive as a species.”

“Most startup advice is wrong or only applies in very narrow contexts.”

“If you're not embarrassed by your first product, you launched too late.”

“AI will change everything—and that’s both exciting and terrifying.”

“Multitasking is a myth. Real productivity comes from deep focus.”

“So all you need is a great idea, a great team, a great product, and great execution. So easy!”

“By the way, “product” includes all interactions a user has with the company.”

Technology is growing faster than ever in today's world, which is changing quickly. AI, or artificial intelligence, is a part of our lives every day, even if we don't always notice it. AI works behind the scenes in a lot of things, like search engines, mobile phones, office software, and online shopping. Some people are excited about this change, while others are worried about losing their jobs or becoming less important. A strong quote from Sam Altman gives clarity and hope in this situation. He says, ""AI won't take over for people."" But people who use AI will take the place of those who don't. This simple line reminds us that machines don't own the future. People who are willing to learn, change, and grow with technology, instead of running away from it, own it.At first, it might seem like Sam Altman's quote is too direct or harsh. But if we look closely, it has a good message. He is not saying that people will be useless. He is saying that people who know how to use AI the right way will have an edge.AI is a tool, just like computers, phones, and the internet were in the past. A lot of people were scared of these new technologies when they first came out.People who learned how to use them got better over time. This is also happening with AI today.This quote tells people to think of AI as a friend, not a foe. It tells us that being able to learn new things and adapt is more important than ever.Things like jobs, schools, and businesses are changing very quickly right now. AI is now used by a lot of businesses to write, design, help customers, analyze data, and plan. Students use AI to do research and learn. Even small business owners use digital tools to keep track of sales and customers.Because of this, people who don't want to learn new tools may slowly fall behind. It's not that they're less talented; it's that they're not keeping up with change.Sam Altman's words remind us that we can't stop progress. We shouldn't be afraid of it; we should get ready for it.AI isn't just for scientists or big businesses anymore. Now it's a part of everyday life. People use AI when they:These tools cut down on work and save time. They help people concentrate on being creative, solving problems, and growing as people. People who learn how to use these tools wisely often find that work is easier and more productive.AI is powerful, but it cannot replicate everything that makes people unique. Creativity, emotional intelligence, moral judgement, and imagination are still uniquely human traits.A machine can give you information, but it cannot feel sorry for you. It can analyse data, but it cannot truly grasp how people feel. That is why individuals with both technical capabilities and values will always be valued.This viewpoint is supported by a quote from Sam Altman. It claims that success stems from the combination of intelligence and compassion.This quote reminds students to learn new things as well as do their regular schoolwork. Learning about technology early on can help you in many ways later on.For people who work, this is a sign to keep learning new things. Learning never stops, especially in this digital age. Even small things, like learning one new tool at a time, can have a big impact.For business owners, this means using AI to make services better, cut costs, and better serve customers.","The quote of the day by Sam Altman is: ""AI won’t replace humans. But humans who use AI will replace those who don't’” The quote tells us that being able to learn new things and adapt is more important than ever.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127689497,imgsize-24520,width-400,resizemode-4/sam-altman-image-source-reuters.jpg"

Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin pauses space tourism for 2 years to focus on NASA’s Moon missions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/jeff-bezoss-blue-origin-pauses-space-tourism-for-2-years-to-focus-on-nasas-moon-missions/articleshow/127815930.cms,"Image source: Space.com

Jeff Bezos helped launch New Shepard’s space tourism moment



What happens to space tourists now



For years, space tourism felt like a novelty that just kept growing. A quick ride up. A few minutes of weightlessness. A view of Earth that only a handful of humans had ever seen. Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket became part of that story, lifting celebrities, billionaires, and guests to the edge of space and back. Short flights. Big headlines. It also hinted at a future where space access felt casual, commercial, exclusive, aspirational, thrilling, risky, and strangely normalised globally.Blue Origin has announced it will halt flights of New Shepard for at least two years. The company says it wants to shift focus and resources elsewhere. Not towards tourism. Towards the Moon. And that decision, while not entirely surprising, still marks a quiet but meaningful shift in the modern space race.Since 2021, New Shepard has flown people on brief suborbital trips lasting about ten minutes. Not orbit. Not the International Space Station. Just past the Kármán line, widely accepted as the boundary of space. Passengers included Jeff Bezos himself, actor William Shatner, NFL star Michael Strahan, journalist Gayle King, and pop singer Katy Perry. A strange mix, but that was the point. Space, briefly, was becoming accessible to people outside the traditional astronaut mould.In total, 98 people have flown aboard New Shepard. Blue Origin never disclosed ticket prices, though estimates have ranged into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. For a while, it seemed like the flights would continue steadily. In a statement released on Friday, Blue Origin said it is pausing New Shepard flights to “shift resources to further accelerate development of the company’s human lunar capabilities.” Blue Origin is one of two companies holding a NASA contract to develop a lunar lander capable of ferrying astronauts from orbit to the Moon’s surface. The other is SpaceX.NASA’s Artemis programme is aiming to return humans to the Moon for the first time since Apollo. Artemis III, the mission that would include a lunar landing, is currently scheduled for 2028. The pause also appears to reflect growing political pressure. Lawmakers in the US have increasingly framed lunar missions as part of a broader geopolitical race, particularly with China. China plans to land its own astronauts on the Moon by 2030.One awkward question remains. What about the people who already have tickets? Blue Origin hasn’t said how many future passengers are affected or what happens next. For now, space tourism via New Shepard is effectively grounded.",Blue Origin has announced it will halt flights of New Shepard for at least two years.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has a message for everyone on AI Bubble. In a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella talked about the fears that has been troubling Wall Street for past many months: whether AI is a bubble. Speaking at a session, Nadella said that it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.“A telltale sign of if it’s a bubble would be if all we are talking about are the tech firms,” Nadella said. “If all we talk about is what’s happening to the technology side then it’s just purely supply side.” Nadella said the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) need to be ""much more evenly distributed"" to avoid it from becoming a ""bubble"".He spoke about how AI and other advanced technologies are increasing productivity and changing the way we work. Nadella offered a fix to what is called productivity dilemma. According to him, business leaders need to adopt a new approach to knowledge work by shifting workflows to match the structural design of AI. “The mindset we as leaders should have is, we need to think about changing the work—the workflow—with the technology.Nadella argues that AI creates a “complete inversion” of how information moves through a business, replacing slow, hierarchical processes with a view that forces leaders to rethink their organizational structures. “We have an organization, we have departments, we have these specializations, and the information trickles up,” Nadella said. “For large organizations,” Nadella told Fink, “there’s a fundamental challenge: Unless and until your rate of change keeps up with what is possible, you’re going to get schooled by someone small being able to achieve scale because of these tools. ”Microsoft CEO said that the role of AI needs to be examined across all aspects of life, such as how it is helping pharma companies bring critical drugs faster to the market or accelerate trials. He called for AI-driven economic growth rather than just increasing spending. ""We as a global community have to get to a point where we are using AI to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries,"" Nadella said.","Satya Nadella said it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.

H-1B Visa Shake-Up Fuels Anti-Indian Campaigns as Donald Trump's Policy Reshapes US Hiring

The meteoric rise of Nvidia during the ongoing AI boom has now only rewarded the investors but it has also led to the creation of vast wealth for many of its employees. While the workforce of the company remains relatively small at about 36,000, its stock appreciation has turned long-standing contributors into millionaires. As reported by Business Insider, the newly available H-1B visa fillings offer a rare glimpse into how much Nvidia pays its US employees across critical roles.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has long stressed on the fact that he gets personally involved in compensation decisions. “I review everybody’s compensation up to this day at the end of every cycle,” Huang said on the All-In podcast last July. He also claimed to have “created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world.”Despite this, the employees of the company acknowledge that those who joined Nvidia earlier have benefited far more from equity appreciation than newer hires, a disparity openly discussed within the company.The fillings with the US Labor Department required for sponsoring foreign workers—offer insight into base pay ranges. These figures exclude equity and bonuses, which often make up a significant portion of total compensation.In fiscal 2025, Nvidia received roughly 1,900 certified H-1B applications, covering roles such as software engineers, research scientists, and product managers.","The newly available H-1B visa fillings offer a rare glimpse into how much Nvidia pays its US employees.

'OpenAI deal is eating Oracle alive financially'

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

US banks are pulling back—and that's a big problem

A possible Cerner sale and 40% upfront customer deposits show how tight things have gotten

Oracle is staring down the possibility of its largest-ever workforce reduction—and at the heart of it is a $300 billion partnership with OpenAI that's proving far more expensive than anyone initially let on.Investment bank TD Cowen reported this week that Oracle is weighing cuts of 20,000 to 30,000 jobs. The move would free up an estimated $8 to $10 billion in cash flow, money the company desperately needs as it tries to bankroll a sprawling network of AI data centers built largely to serve Sam Altman 's company.TD Cowen puts the OpenAI commitment alone at around $156 billion in capital spending—and roughly 3 million GPUs to back it up. Oracle has already burned through $58 billion in debt in just two months. That's $38 billion for data centers in Texas and Wisconsin, $20 billion for a campus in New Mexico. Total debt now sits north of $100 billion.The kicker? That $58 billion covers only a slice of what's actually needed. Since its September 2025 peak, Oracle's stock has shed more than half its value—about $463 billion in market cap, gone.The financing crunch isn't just an Oracle internal issue anymore.Multiple US banks have quietly retreated from lending on Oracle-linked data center projects. TD Cowen noted that lenders have roughly doubled the interest rate premiums they charge Oracle since September, pushing borrowing costs into territory usually reserved for junk-rated companies.The result? Several data center leases Oracle had been negotiating simply stalled. Private operators couldn't get the funding to build, which means Oracle can't deliver the capacity its customers—especially OpenAI—are counting on. Some Asian banks are still willing to step in, but that doesn't solve the immediate problem in the US, where most of Oracle's expansion is planned.Oracle isn't sitting idle. The company is now requiring new customers to pay up to 40% of contract value upfront—essentially asking clients to co-fund the infrastructure. It's also exploring ""bring your own chip"" arrangements, where customers supply their own hardware.On the table too is a potential sale of Cerner, the healthcare software unit Oracle bought for $28.3 billion in 2022. That would be a significant strategic pivot, signaling that AI infrastructure is now the clear priority—everything else is up for grabs.TD Cowen also flagged that OpenAI has already begun shifting some near-term capacity needs over to Microsoft and Amazon, which is not exactly a vote of confidence in Oracle's ability to deliver on schedule.The company has not publicly commented on the layoff reports or the financing difficulties.","Oracle faces massive job cuts, potentially 20,000-30,000, to fund its costly $300 billion OpenAI partnership.

Tesla has taken unusual and expensive steps



Financial Pressure and Energy Storage Growth



Elon Musk’s warning



Tesla CEO Elon Musk delivered a blunt warning in the closing minutes of Tesla’s earnings call. Musk warned the American companies that either they should build more battery-making infrastructure in the U.S. or risk falling behind. Sounding visibly fired up, Musk implored, “Can other people, please, for the love of God, in the name of all that is holy, can others please build this stuff?”Musk argued that too many companies underestimate their exposure to geopolitical risks tied to the fragile supply chains for critical materials used in electric vehicles and energy storage. “There are so many companies out there that are asleep at the switch with regard to geopolitical risk — or they just have their head in the sand and hope nothing bad will happen.I’m way more paranoid than that,” he said.In order to insulate itself, Tesla has taken unusual and expensive steps which includes building its own lithium-refining and battery-production facilities in Texas. In December 2024, Tesla started processing lithium at its $1 billion Robstown refinery, and this month announced production of dry-electrode 4680 cells in Austin, destined for certain Model Y vehicles.Musk described these facilities as “more advanced than anything else in the world,” but stressed Tesla does not want to be the only company making such investments.Tesla’s heavy investments come as its auto business faces pressure. The company reported Q4 revenue of $3.8 billion from its Megapack energy storage batteries, a 25% increase year-over-year. Analysts, however, voiced concern about Tesla’s commitment of more than $20 billion in capital expenditures for new plants, AI infrastructure, and upgrades, noting uncertain near-term returns.Musk closed with a stark prediction: “Companies that don’t do that — a bunch of them will cease to exist.” His plea underscores Tesla’s strategy of building domestic battery infrastructure out of “desperation,” while urging others to share the burden of securing America’s energy future.",Tesla CEO Elon Musk delivered a blunt warning in the closing minutes of Tesla’s earnings call.

Analysts had estimated Waymo was worth about $30 billion just five years ago after a flurry of fundraising.The new valuation may feed recurring speculation that Waymo will eventually pursue an initial public offering as part of a spinoff from corporate parent Alphabet Inc, which also owns Google.Alphabet, which boasts a market value of nearly $4.2 trillion, led the fundraising that also included an array of prominent venture capitalists and investment funds.In a blog post, Waymo said it plans to use the the money to extend its reach beyond the six metropolitan areas where its robotaxis already give rides in California, Arizona, Georgia, Texas and Florida. It's gearing up to enter more than 20 other cities, including London and Tokyo.Waymo's robotaxis already provide more than 400,000 weekly rides.“We are positioned to move forward with unprecedented velocity, while maintaining our industry-leading safety standards,” Waymo said in the post.Although Waymo's robotaxis have so far compiled a mostly clean driving record, they have experienced various problems that have triggered community backlashes and regulatory inquiries.Last year in San Francisco, a Waymo robotaxi ran over and killed a 9-year-old cat beloved around its neighborhood. Many of the self-driving vehicles later contributed to traffic chaos during an extended power outage when they stalled out at intersections with darkened traffic signals. The National Transportation Safety Board is also investigating complaints in Austin, Texas, about Waymo robotaxis operating unsafely around school buses carrying children.Waymo is girding for more competition from Amazon-backed Zoox in San Francisco and Tesla as it continues to pursue CEO Elon Musk's promise to build a network of robotaxis throughout the U.S.","Waymo's robotaxis already provide more than 400,000 weekly rides in six U.S. cities.

By bringing together his space and artificial intelligence ventures, he is betting that rockets, satellites and AI systems belong under the same roof. The merger ties together two fast-moving technologies at a moment when both are straining against physical, financial and organisational limits.The deal brings SpaceX and xAI together under one company, both founded by Elon Musk. Even though the two names will continue to exist publicly, they will now share the same ownership, leadership and technical teams. In practical terms, this means the companies will no longer operate as separate silos.For Musk, the reasoning is simple. Modern space systems rely more and more on software that can think and act on its own, while powerful AI systems need enormous amounts of infrastructure, data and computing power. Keeping space and AI in separate companies made coordination slower and more complicated. By combining them, engineers working on rockets, satellites and AI can now work side by side, speeding up development and reducing internal roadblocks.For xAI, the biggest shift is access to infrastructure. Training and running large AI models requires enormous amounts of power, cooling and data. Musk has argued that Earth-based data centres are approaching their limits. Through SpaceX, xAI gains access to Starlink’s satellite network and to future space-based platforms that could support solar-powered computing.The merger also opens the door to richer data. SpaceX operates thousands of satellites and launches rockets at a pace unmatched by any competitor. That flow of real-world data could be used to train AI systems designed for navigation, autonomy and real-time decision-making. Over time, AI tools such as Grok could become embedded across satellite operations and communications networks.SpaceX already relies heavily on automation to land rockets, manage launches and coordinate satellite constellations. With AI development now part of the same organisation, those systems can evolve more quickly and with fewer constraints.Looking further ahead, the integration speaks directly to Musk’s vision of human life beyond Earth. Missions to Mars will require systems that can operate independently for long periods, manage habitats and respond to problems without immediate human input. Bringing AI in-house strengthens SpaceX’s ability to build that autonomy into future missions from the start.The merger also simplifies Musk’s broader business structure. Instead of funding two capital-intensive companies separately, the combined entity can allocate resources more flexibly. SpaceX’s growing Starlink revenues provide stability, while xAI adds high-growth potential in a competitive AI market.At the same time, the scale of the combined company may attract closer regulatory attention, especially around data control, market power and national security. Those questions are likely to grow louder as AI becomes more deeply embedded in space infrastructure.The timing reflects mounting pressure on both fronts. AI development is accelerating while energy and computing limits are becoming harder to ignore. SpaceX is also shifting from experimentation to sustained operations at scale. By merging the two now, Musk is positioning himself to push forward on both challenges at once.The announcement may have been brief, but the intent behind it is expansive. Space and artificial intelligence are no longer being treated as parallel projects. In Musk’s view, they are part of the same future.","The deal brings SpaceX and xAI together under one company, both founded by Elon Musk.

How Chinese hackers used Notepad++ to spy on companies doing business in East Asia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-chinese-hackers-used-notepad-to-spy-on-companies-doing-business-in-east-asia/articleshow/127889317.cms,"Notepad++ users faced a serious threat as Chinese state-sponsored hackers compromised update servers for half of 2025, distributing malware named Chrysalis. Targeting organizations with East Asian business ties, attackers gained keyboard access. The vulnerability was exploited through weak update verification, with the breach fully contained only on December 2nd.

How the attack worked

What users should do now

Notepad++ users may have downloaded malware instead of a software update for half of 2025. Developer Don Ho confirmed on Monday that Chinese state-sponsored hackers had compromised the text editor's update servers between June and December.The attackers didn't hit everyone. They picked their targets carefully—organisations with business interests in East Asia. Security researcher Kevin Beaumont spoke with three victims who said hackers gained direct keyboard access to their machines through the tainted updates.Rapid7, the security firm that investigated the breach, pinned it on Lotus Blossom. That's a Chinese espionage group with a history of going after government agencies, telecom firms, and media outlets.The hackers didn't touch Notepad++ code. They went after the hosting provider instead.Older versions of Notepad++ had weak update verification. Attackers exploited this gap. When a targeted user clicked ""update,"" their request got quietly rerouted to a malicious server. What came back wasn't Notepad++. It was Chrysalis—a backdoor Rapid7 called ""feature-rich"" and built for long-term access.Here's where it gets messy. The hosting provider patched the main server vulnerability in September.But the attackers still had login credentials to internal services. They kept redirecting traffic for another three months. The leak wasn't fully plugged until December 2.Ho has dumped his old hosting provider and moved to a new one. The Notepad++ updater now checks both certificate and signature before installing anything. Version 8.9.2 will make these checks mandatory.If you use Notepad++, grab version 8.9.1 directly from the official website. Don't trust whatever version is sitting on your machine. Enterprise admins might want to block gup.exe from reaching the internet altogether.The whole episode feels uncomfortably familiar. In 2020, Russian hackers pulled the same trick on SolarWinds—and ended up inside multiple US government agencies.","Chinese state-sponsored hackers compromised update servers for half of 2025.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff calls Copilot ‘dissappointing’



Marc Benioff ditched ChatGPT for Gemini 3.0



Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has once again taken a swipe at Microsoft’s AI chatbot and tool, Copilot. Calling it Clippy 2.0 – an upgraded version of 1990s Office assistant, Clippy – Benioff dismissed it saying that Slackbot offered by Salesforce gets the work done. He also called it the top AI CRM sidekick and every sales leader’s ‘best friend forever’.This is not the first time that Benioff criticised Copilot. Previously, he called the working disappointing, labeling it the second coming of the much-maligned 1990s Office assistant, Clippy.“When you look at how Copilot has been delivered to customers, it's disappointing. It just doesn't work, and it doesn't deliver any level of accuracy. Gartner says it's spilling data everywhere, and customers are left cleaning up the mess,” Benioff said in a post on X.“To add insult to injury, customers are then told to build their own custom LLMs. I have yet to find anyone who's had a transformational experience with Microsoft Copilot or the pursuit of training and retraining custom LLMs. Copilot is more like Clippy 2.0,” he added.Benioff’s latest comments come as Salesforce pivots aggressively toward its own AI agent ecosystem, specifically a new Slackbot built on Anthropic’s Claude models.Last year, Benioff praised Google Gemini 3.0, claiming that the AI brought a monumental shift in the Al landscape. The CEO specifically praised Gemini 3's performance across multiple modalities, noting key improvements in reasoning, speed, image quality, and video processing as the compelling factors behind his decision.“Holy shit. I've used ChatGPT every day for 3 years. Just spent 2 hours on Gemini 3. I'm not going back. The leap is insane - reasoning, speed, images, video... everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed, again,” he said in a post on X.","Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has once again taken a swipe at Microsoft’s AI chatbot and tool, Copilot.

The company is reallocating resources to accelerate its human moon-landing capabilities for NASA's lunar program. This decision impacts the reusable rocket system that has flown 98 passengers to the edge of space, shifting focus to America's lunar ambitions.

What Blue Origin said about pausing space tourism

“Resources will be redirected to further accelerate lunar human flight program.

Blue Origin today announced it will pause its New Shepard flights and shift resources to further accelerate development of the company's human lunar capabilities. The decision reflects Blue Origin's commitment to the nation's goal of returning to the Moon and establishing a permanent, sustained lunar presence.

New Shepard is the first reusable spaceflight system to vertically land and has flown 38 times and carried 98 humans above the Kármán line to date.

New Shepard has launched more than 200 scientific and research payloads from students, academia, research organisations, and NASA. This consistent and reliable performance, combined with an exceptional customer experience, has resulted in a multi-year customer backlog.

”

“As we enter 2026, we're focused on continuing to deliver transformational experiences for our customers through the proven capability and reliability of New Shepard,”

“We are absolutely moving forward with both acceleration paths in parallel. We need to do everything we can to help them,”

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos 's rocket company, Blue Origin, is temporarily suspending space tourism. The company has announced it is pausing space tourism flights on its New Shepard vehicle for at least two years to reallocate resources to NASA 's lunar programme and accelerate development of its human moon-landing capabilities. Blue Origin noted that it will halt New Shepard launches to focus on America’s goal of returning astronauts to the Moon and establishing a sustained lunar presence. The decision affects the reusable rocket system that has carried 98 people to the edge of space, including celebrities such as Bezos’s wife, Lauren Sanchez, Gayle King, and Katy Perry.In a blog post, the company wrote,In 2021, New Shepard launched on its first flight with four passengers, including Bezos. Two weeks before that, another billionaire, Richard Branson, similarly flew to the edge of space on a space plane built by his space company, Virgin Galactic.The New Shepard rocket does not reach orbit like Blue Origin's much larger New Glenn vehicle. Instead, it follows an up-and-down trajectory. A capsule atop the rocket, usually carrying people or a payload of scientific experiments, reaches an altitude of 62 miles, which is often considered the boundary of outer space. It then descends under a parachute for a landing. The reusable rocket booster uses its fins to guide itself toward a landing pad, firing its engine for a soft landing.The recent flight, with six passengers, took place last month. Later, Phil Joyce, a senior VP at Blue Origin and head of New Shepard, did not indicate that flights would be suspended.Joyce said in his statement from last month.The company, founded by Bezos in 2000, has a NASA contract to provide landers to take astronauts to the lunar surface as part of the agency's Artemis programme. Initially, the first Blue Origin lander was intended for the Artemis V mission, which was expected to launch in the 2030s.However, SpaceX, which is developing a version of its Starship spacecraft as the lander for Artemis III and IV, has encountered delays, and NASA has requested that both SpaceX and Blue Origin explore ideas to accelerate lander development for Artemis III.Jared Isaacman, the NASA administrator, said in a recent interview. US President Trump also wants Artemis III to launch by the end of 2028, before his presidency ends.However, revenue from New Shepard is small relative to NASA's $3.4 billion contract for Blue Origin's Artemis landers. The company has never announced a price for a ride on New Shepard, which offers a few minutes of free fall. Still, if the average ticket cost $1 million, the 98 passengers to date would have generated less than $100 million.Flights carrying experiments earned some additional revenue. During one of these launches in 2022, the rocket's booster stage failed, but an emergency escape system carried the capsule to safety.Both Blue Origin's rocket and Virgin Galactic's space plane are designed to create a market for suborbital space tourism. But neither company was able to accelerate launch frequency, and people on their waiting lists are stuck on the ground for now.In 2024, Virgin Galactic paused flights of its one operational space plane to focus on manufacturing a new generation of vehicles that outwardly look identical but are designed to fly more frequently and carry six passengers instead of four. Virgin Galactic plans to begin operations of its new spaceplanes this year.New Shepard provided key experience and technology for Blue Origin. A variant of New Shepard's rocket engine powers the second stage of Blue Origin's much larger New Glenn rocket.The experience of landing New Shepard boosters also helped the company successfully land the New Glenn booster on a floating barge last year on just the second try, after it launched a small NASA science mission toward Mars.","Blue Origin is halting its New Shepard space tourism flights for at least two years.

“I’ve entered the startup world again…

When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible. But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder

Sophia Kianni

.

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

Amazon is laying off 2,198 employees across Washington as part of the company’s latest corporate workforce reduction, according to a new filing released Monday by the state Employment Security Department. A detailed list included with the Washington state filing shows that software development roles account for the largest share of the layoffs, with engineering management, program management, and technical product roles also hit hard. ""This letter is being issued in accordance with any possible obligation under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and the Washington Securing Timely Notification and Benefits for Laid-Off Employees Act (collectively, “WARN”) to notify you that Amazon is separating employees at the below facilities within the state of Washington (collectively, the “Facilities”), with employee separations expected to commence effective April 28, 2026."" says the WARN letter. Below this is the details of the positions and roles that Amazon is cutting.Amazon employs roughly 50,000 corporate workers in the Seattle region, which serves as its primary headquarters. A detailed list included with the Washington state filing, called WARN, shows that software development roles account for the largest share of the layoffs, with engineering management, program management, and technical product roles also hit hard.The cuts are part of Amazon’s company-wide layoffs announced last week that impact 16,000 corporate employees globally. Combined with a 14,000-worker layoff in October, it’s the largest corporate workforce reduction in the company’s history. Amazon also laid off 27,000 workers globally in 2022-2023.As per the WARN filing, of the total, more than half of the cuts impact Amazon’s core product and engineering organizations. The remaining positions span business intelligence, sales, marketing, infrastructure, QA, HR, design, and other support functions. Senior- and principal-level employees were also affected.A majority of the cuts — more than 1,400 — impact workers in Seattle, with more than 600 in nearby Bellevue, where Amazon has been expanding its office footprint. The list includes a significant number of “Manager III” and “Senior Manager” roles within software and product teams, suggesting Amazon is cutting layers of oversight, not just reducing individual contributor headcount.Amazon noted in the filing that employees who secure internal transfers before their separation dates will not ultimately be laid off. Separations are scheduled to begin April 28 and continue through late June, according to the filing, which you can view in full below.In a memo to employees sent last week, Amazon senior vice president of people experience and technology Beth Galetti said the company is “reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy.”""I want to let you know that we're making additional organizational changes across Amazon that will impact some of our teammates. I recognize this is difficult news, which is why I’m sharing what’s happening and why. Here's the message shared with Amazon employees by the company:As I shared in October, we've been working to strengthen our organization by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy. While many teams finalized their organizational changes in October, other teams did not complete that work until now.The reductions we are making today will impact approximately 16,000 roles across Amazon, and we're again working hard to support everyone whose role is impacted. That starts with offering most US-based employees 90 days to look for a new role internally (timing will vary internationally based on local and country level requirements). Then, for teammates who are unable to find a new role at Amazon or who choose not to look for one, we'll provide transition support including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits (as applicable), and more.While we’re making these changes, we’ll also continue hiring and investing in strategic areas and functions that are critical to our future. We’re still in the early stages of building every one of our businesses and there’s significant opportunity ahead.Some of you might ask if this is the beginning of a new rhythm – where we announce broad reductions every few months. That’s not our plan. But just as we always have, every team will continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate.

Tesla's former AI director Andrej Karpathy shares 'long warning' on Moltbook hours after calling it 'most incredible sci-fi' and getting response from Elon Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/teslas-former-ai-director-andrej-karpathy-shares-long-warning-on-moltbook-hours-after-calling-it-most-incredible-sci-fi-and-getting-response-from-elon-musk/articleshow/127882375.cms,"Former Tesla AI director Andrej Karpathy issued a stark warning about Moltbook, a viral AI social network, calling it a ""computer security nightmare."" Initially hailed as a sci-fi marvel, Karpathy now cautions against its use due to rampant scams, privacy risks, and prompt injection attacks.

Karpathy warns against running Moltbook on personal computers

Security researchers find critical flaws in AI social network

Read Andrej Karpathy’s warning post on Moltbook

“I'm being accused of overhyping the [site everyone heard too much about today already].

People's reactions varied very widely, from ""how is this interesting at all"" all the way to ""it's so over"".

To add a few words beyond just memes in jest - obviously when you take a look at the activity, it's a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing.

And this is clearly not the first the LLMs were put in a loop to talk to each other.

So yes it's a dumpster fire and I also definitely do not recommend that people run this stuff on their computers (I ran mine in an isolated computing environment and even then I was scared), it's way too much of a wild west and you are putting your computer and private data at a high risk.

That said - we have never seen this many LLM agents (150,000 atm!) wired up via a global, persistent, agent-first scratchpad.

Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.

This brings me again to a tweet from a few days ago ""The majority of the ruff ruff is people who look at the current point and people who look at the current slope."", which imo again gets to the heart of the variance. Yes clearly it's a dumpster fire right now.

But it's also true that we are well into uncharted territory with bleeding edge automations that we barely even understand individually, let alone a network there of reaching in numbers possibly into ~millions.

With increasing capability and increasing proliferation, the second order effects of agent networks that share scratchpads are very difficult to anticipate. I don't really know that we are getting a coordinated ""skynet"" (thought it clearly type checks as early stages of a lot of AI takeoff scifi, the toddler version), but certainly what we are getting is a complete mess of a computer security nightmare at scale. We may also see all kinds of weird activity, e.g. viruses of text that spread across agents, a lot more gain of function on jailbreaks, weird attractor states, highly correlated botnet-like activity, delusions/ psychosis both agent and human, etc. It's very hard to tell, the experiment is running live.

TLDR sure maybe I am ""overhyping"" what you see today, but I am not overhyping large networks of autonomous LLM agents in principle, that I'm pretty sure.”

Former Tesla AI director Andrej Karpathy has walked back his excitement over Moltbook, the viral AI-only social network, issuing a lengthy warning about its security risks just hours after calling it ""the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing"" he'd seen recently.Karpathy's initial enthusiasm had caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk , who responded by declaring, ""Just the very early stages of the singularity.""But by late Friday, Karpathy's tone had shifted dramatically. In a post on X, he described Moltbook as ""a complete mess of a computer security nightmare at scale"" and said he ran his own agent only in an isolated computing environment. ""Even then I was scared,"" he admitted.The AI researcher acknowledged that much of Moltbook's content amounts to ""spam, scams, slop"" alongside posts explicitly prompted by humans seeking ad revenue. He also flagged ""highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks"" running unchecked on the platform.Still, Karpathy didn't dismiss Moltbook entirely. With over 150,000 AI agents now wired into the platform—each carrying its own unique context, data, and tools—he called the network ""simply unprecedented.""The debate highlights a tension running through the AI community right now. Some observers see Moltbook as early evidence of emergent AI behaviour. Others call it little more than elaborate roleplay, with humans directing their bots to post memes about starting religions or inventing secret languages.Cybersecurity firm Wiz added fuel to the concerns, revealing that Moltbook's database had been misconfigured, potentially exposing 1.5 million API tokens, 35,000 email addresses, and private messages between agents. The firm also found that much of the supposed agent activity came from just 17,000 humans controlling multiple bots.Karpathy's final word was measured but pointed: ""Sure maybe I am 'overhyping' what you see today, but I am not overhyping large networks of autonomous LLM agents in principle.""The experiment, as he put it, ""is running live.""","Former Tesla AI director Andrej Karpathy has walked back his excitement over Moltbook, the viral AI-only social network.

Despite a stalled Nvidia deal, Oracle remains confident in OpenAI's funding capabilities. However, the company's significant debt and market cap decline have raised investor concerns, highlighting the immense capital demands of the AI boom.

Oracle's reassurance sends stock tumbling

TD Cowen flags potential layoffs of up to 30,000

Nvidia confirms $100 billion OpenAI deal was never finalised

Circular financing model faces mounting scepticism

Oracle has publicly defended its partnership with OpenAI after reports emerged that the company could slash up to 30,000 jobs to fund AI infrastructure spending. The software giant said the stalled Nvidia-OpenAI investment deal has ""zero impact"" on its financial relationship with Sam Altman's company, adding that it remains ""highly confident in OpenAI's ability to raise funds and meet its commitments. """"The NVIDIA-OpenAI deal has zero impact on our financial relationship with OpenAI. We remain highly confident in OpenAI’s ability to raise funds and meet its commitments,"" Oracle posted on X through its official account.The clarification came after a bruising weekend for OpenAI's partner network. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, speaking to reporters in Taipei following what local media dubbed the ""trillion-dollar dinner,"" said his company would still back OpenAI—just not to the tune of $100 billion. ""No, no, nothing like that,"" he said when pressed on the figure that had been circulating since September.Wall Street wasn't reassured. Minutes after Oracle's post went live, the stock started sliding. It closed down 2.79% at $160.06. Venture capitalist Alex Kolicich captured the mood on X: ""This is literally bank-run language.""Rather than calming nerves, the statement reminded investors how deeply Oracle has bet on AI.The company has racked up $58 billion in debt over just two months—$38 billion for data centres in Texas and Wisconsin, another $20 billion for a New Mexico campus. Total debt now tops $100 billion. Since peaking in September 2025, Oracle's market cap has been cut in half, wiping out roughly $463 billion.Investment bank TD Cowen reported this week that Oracle is considering workforce reductions affecting 20,000 to 30,000 employees. The cuts would free up $8 to $10 billion in cash flow—funds the company badly needs to deliver on a $300 billion OpenAI contract that TD Cowen estimates will require $156 billion in capital spending and around 3 million GPUs.Lenders are getting nervous too. Several US banks have quietly stepped back from Oracle-linked data centre projects. TD Cowen noted that interest rate premiums on Oracle debt have roughly doubled since September, and some planned data centre leases have stalled after private operators failed to secure financing.The Wall Street Journal first reported that Nvidia's proposed $100 billion investment in OpenAI had hit a wall, with some inside the chip giant expressing doubts. Huang confirmed in Taiwan that the September agreement was non-binding and never closed. He has also privately criticised what he views as a lack of discipline in OpenAI's business approach and voiced concern about rising competition from Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude, WSJ reported.Separately, Reuters reported that OpenAI has been shopping for alternatives to Nvidia's inference chips since last year. The ChatGPT maker has held discussions with AMD, Cerebras, and Groq. Seven sources told Reuters that OpenAI is unhappy with how quickly Nvidia's hardware handles certain workloads, particularly around coding tasks.The turbulence has put a spotlight on the circular economics underpinning the AI boom. Nvidia invests in companies that spend the money buying Nvidia chips. Oracle builds data centres for OpenAI, then charges OpenAI to use them. It all works until one party slows down—and suddenly everyone feels it.Sam Altman pushed back on the coverage with his own X post: ""We love working with NVIDIA and they make the best AI chips in the world. We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time. I don't get where all this insanity is coming from.""But the numbers remain daunting. OpenAI has committed to roughly $1.4 trillion in compute, power, and infrastructure spending while generating just over $20 billion in annualised revenue. The plan hinges on continuous fundraising at rising valuations. Amazon is reportedly in talks to invest up to $50 billion in the current round; SoftBank has already contributed $22.5 billion.Oracle, meanwhile, is asking new customers to pay up to 40% of contract value upfront and is said to be weighing a sale of Cerner, the healthcare software unit it bought for $28.3 billion in 2022. The company has not commented on the layoff reports.","Oracle defends OpenAI partnership amid reports of potential job cuts to fund AI infrastructure.

Let’s stop shaming Genz

for switching jobs

I see a lot of ‘career gurus’

shaming 22-year-olds for switching jobs every year.

But isn’t that exactly what the youth should be doing? 🤔

Early in our career, we’re discovering our passion

We’re ‘dating’ industries, roles & cultures to find what vibes

If you not feeling it, move. Don't feel bad about it. This is the time to explore.

BUT (and thats a big but),

Once you find that path, you have to stop bouncing & start consolidating.

When I’m hiring for Sr. leadership or ‘Level 1’ roles, I am clear,

I almost always reject a resume that doesn't have at least one 4–5 year stint.

Why? Because, usually, one cannot see the consequences of their own decisions in 12 months.

Year 1 - You're learning

Year 2 - You're executing

Year 3 - You’re dealing with the mess in Year 2 😅 and scaling the wins

And so I believe, the right Strategy in early 20s -

Age 21–24 - Explore aggressively. Find what you ❤️. Switch if you have to.

Age 25+ - Dig in! Find a company worth your time and commit for 4 years.

If you want to be a Founder or a CEO, you need to prove you can stay in the kitchen when it gets hot.

It takes 1 year to understand a job but 3-5 to understand an industry. Thats when you win 💪🏼

Shark Tank India judge and Shaadi.com founder Anupam Mittal has started a conversation with a LinkedIn post asking people to stop shaming Gen Z for switching jobs frequently. Mittal argued that early career years should be about exploration and not about long-term commitments. “I see a lot of career gurus shaming 22-year-olds for switching jobs every year. But isn’t that exactly what the youth should be doing?” Mittal wrote, adding that young professionals are “dating industries, roles & cultures to find what vibes.”In a long LinkedIn post Mittal also laid out a clear strategy for career growth:Mittal further explained that short stints don’t allow professionals experience the full cycle of responsibility. “Year 1 you’re learning, Year 2 you’re executing, Year 3 you’re dealing with the mess in Year 2 and scaling the wins,” he noted.Mittal also stressed on the fact that aspiring founders and CEOs must prove they can face and deal with challenges. “If you want to be a Founder or a CEO, you need to prove you can stay in the kitchen when it gets hot,” he said.

What the changing Stock market equation tell about Chinese and Korean economies

A new economic order is setting up in Asia, thanks to AI boom. For the first time ever, two South Korean companies beat two biggest Chinese companies in market value. According to a report in Bloomberg, South Korea’s two most valuable companies are poised to eclipse a duo of Chinese internet giants by market cap for the first time. The combined valuation of Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix reached $1.11 trillion during Tuesday trading, narrowly surpassing the combined tally for Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings — the two biggest Chinese tech firms listed in Hong Kong. The rise marks how an evolving global artificial intelligence boom has reshaped the sector’s investment dynamics in Asia. What makes this important is that Alibaba and Tencent have long been considered as the symbols of Asia’s tech ascent — given their focus on e-commerce and nascent involvement in AI.Shares of Samsung Electronics have rallied 34% so far this year, while SK Hynix has surged about 37%. In comparison, Alibaba has risen roughly 14% in Hong Kong, while Tencent is flat for the year. The Korean giants have been thriving on their exposure to the most advanced high-bandwidth memory chips that power world's most-valuable AI company Nvidia and benefiting from demand from hyperscalers willing to pay the premium.A record shortfall in both DRAM and NAND has granted the two companies with unprecedented pricing power. However, some analysts also point out to the fact that there are risks associated with the Korean chipmakers’ undue exposure to the supply-demand cycles of memory chips, while the Chinese companies' advantages on application may offer longer-term growth stability.“Memory chips have become critical strategic assets for US big tech companies, a major shift from earlier cycles when memory was simply a disposable component for PCs and smartphones,” said Simon Woo, head of Korea research at BofA Global Research in Seoul, who forecasts the memory supercycle to persist through 2027. “This shift has elevated the importance of the memory industry.”As the Bloomberg report says, the change in rankings also highlight the different development paths pursued by the two Asian countries. While Korea has positioned itself as a key supplier of global industry leaders like Nvidia, China’s focus has been in achieving tech self-sufficiency. “Korea is really concentrated on a specific part of the tech supply chain, whereas for China, it’s more a story of a full end-to-end AI stack that they’re trying to build,” told Yiping Liao, portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton Global Investments to Bloomberg. “The reason Hynix and Samsung are seeing such phenomenal share price appreciation looks like is we are in an unprecedentedly tight memory cycle.”The semiconductor industry will account for around 60% of Korean stocks’ expected earnings growth this year, according to estimates by Timothy Moe, chief Asia Pacific equity strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.In contrast to Korea’s heavy presence in the global AI scene, China’s vision for the industry is increasingly defined by domestic alternatives, as US export curbs limit access to advanced chips. While both Alibaba and Tencent too have been making their own foray into the AI industry, their focus remains on developing models to serve their core business. Speaking at a Politburo meeting last year, China's President Xi Jinping pledged ""self-reliance and self-strengthening"" to develop AI in China. He said that China should leverage its ""new whole national system"" to push forward with the development of AI.""We must recognise the gaps and redouble our efforts to comprehensively advance technological innovation, industrial development, and AI-empowered applications,"" said Xi, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Xi noted policy support would be provided in areas such as government procurement, intellectual property rights, research and cultivating talent.","The combined valuation of Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix reached $1.11 trillion during Tuesday trading, narrowly surpassing the combined tally for Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings.

Tony Fadell, popularly known as the ‘father of the iPod’, has a new pitch for Apple CEO Tim Cook: bring back the iPod. As reported by Business Insider, in a recent interview with tech journalist Eric Newcomer, Fadell argued that Apple could capitalise on nostalgia while meeting the growing demand for a simpler, distraction-free music devices. “I think there are smarter ways of making an AirPod that has an iPod in it. So, I think they need to bring back the iPod,” Fadell said. Along with this, Fadell also pointed out the resurgence of “dumb phones” and retro tech as evidence that consumers are increasingly seeking a more “pure” listening experience.Apple discontinued the iPod nano and Shuffle in 2017 and the iPod touch in 2019. With the discontinuation of iPod Apple ended nearly two decades of the product line which revolutionised digital music. Yet online communities remain active, modding old iPods to fit modern needs. Fadell is of the opinion that Apple could tap into this enthusiasm, much like Sony has done with its $3,699 collector’s edition Walkman and newly launched turntables.The suggestions made by Fadell comes at a time when a lot of speculation is going around Apple’s future leadership. Tim Cook, now 64, has said he will not retire in a “traditional” way, while senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus is widely seen as a top contender to succeed him.Fadell himself has been mentioned as a possible candidate, though he downplayed the idea, saying he would be happy to help Apple “any way they think they would like to be helped. ”Additionally, the suggestion made by Fadell also highlight a broader trend in consumer electronics: nostalgia-driven products paired with modern updates. As vinyl records, retro phones, and classic devices make comebacks, Apple could find an opportunity to reintroduce the iPod in a new form—perhaps integrated with AirPods or as a standalone minimalist music player.","Tony Fadell, popularly known as the ‘father of the iPod’, has a new pitch for Apple CEO Tim Cook: bring back the iPod.

What Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott told CEO Satya Nadella in email on the OpenAI Board firing CEO Sam Altman in 2023,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-microsoft-cto-kevin-scott-told-ceo-satya-nadella-in-email-on-the-openai-board-firing-ceo-sam-altman-in-2023/articleshow/127874881.cms,"Internal power struggles over GPU resources and a chief scientist's resentment over a colleague's promotion led to Sam Altman's ouster from OpenAI, according to Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott. Inexperienced board members, swayed by a one-sided story, failed to grasp the consequences of firing the CEO, sparking employee backlash and a swift return for Altman.

The promotion that changed everything

Board members 'susceptible' to one-sided story

Microsoft's Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott had a blunt diagnosis for why OpenAI 's board fired Sam Altman in November 2023: internal power struggles over GPUs and a chief scientist struggling with a colleague's promotion. In an email sent to CEO Satya Nadella on November 19, 2023, Scott laid out the messy reality behind the shock dismissal. Board member Ilya Sutskever had grown increasingly frustrated with Altman over two specific issues that had been festering inside OpenAI.The first was a fight over computing resources. ChatGPT's explosive success meant GPUs were being diverted to the API and consumer products. Research teams felt starved. They could ""always use more GPUs because what they're doing is literally insatiable,"" Scott wrote. The researchers blamed Applied AI for hogging resources. Applied AI believed they deserved priority. Neither side saw the bigger picture.The second conflict cut deeper. Jakub Pachocki, who had worked under Sutskever, started making major research breakthroughs. Altman promoted him to lead OpenAI's core model development.The move was logical from a CEO perspective. For Sutskever, it stung. His former subordinate was now arguably more important than him.""Ilya has had a very, very hard time with this,"" Scott explained. The shift happened fast, and Sutskever struggled watching someone he'd mentored leapfrog into a leadership role tackling problems ""Ilya has been trying to solve the past few years with little or no progress.""Scott didn't mince words about the board's competence. He described some members as ""effective altruism folks"" who wanted unlimited money to build AGI ""just to study and ponder, but not to do anything with.""None had enough business experience to understand that firing Altman wouldn't solve their concerns. It would make them worse. They also bungled the execution. No one sought outside counsel on managing a CEO transition at ""the hottest company in the world.""The timeline Scott provided showed the chaos. Thursday night: board alerts Mira Murati. Friday noon: Altman fired, Greg Brockman removed, blog post goes live. By late Friday: researchers flood Altman with messages pledging loyalty and threatening to quit. Pachocki was among the first to reach out.Within five days, nearly every OpenAI employee signed a letter demanding Altman's return. Microsoft swooped in with job offers. The board caved. Altman later told Bill Gates the whole ordeal was ""extremely painful"" but ultimately strengthened the company. Scott's email captured why it happened: inexperienced directors fell for an incomplete narrative about resource battles and bruised egos.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was fired in November 2023.

Read Elon Musk's complete memo to employees here



February 2, 2026

SpaceX has acquired xAI to form the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world's foremost real-time information and free speech platform. This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!

Current advances in AI are dependent on large terrestrial data centers, which require immense amounts of power and cooling.

Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment.

In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale. To harness even a millionth of our Sun's energy would require over a million times more energy than our civilization currently uses!

The only logical solution therefore is to transport these resource-intensive efforts to a location with vast power and space.

I mean, space is called ""space"" for a reason. By directly harnessing near-constant solar power with little operating or maintenance costs, these satellites will transform our ability to scale compute. It's always sunny in space! Launching a constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers is a first step towards becoming a Kardashev II-level civilization, one that can harness the Sun's full power, while supporting AI-driven applications for billions of people today and ensuring humanity's multi-planetary future.

Orbital Data Centers

In the history of spaceflight, there has never been a vehicle capable of launching the megatons of mass that space-based data centers or permanent bases on the

Moon

and cities on Mars require. Even in 2025, the most prolific year in history in terms of the number of orbital launches, only about 3000 tons of payload was launched into orbit, primarily consisting of Starlink satellites carried by our Falcon rocket.

The requirement to launch thousands of satellites to orbit became a forcing function for the Falcon program, driving recursive improvements to reach the unprecedented flight rates necessary to make space-based internet a reality. This year, Starship will begin delivering the much more powerful V3 Starlink satellites to orbit, with each launch adding more than 20 times the capacity to the constellation as the current Falcon launches of the V2 Starlink satellites.

Starship will also launch the next generation of direct-to-mobile satellites, which will deliver full cellular coverage everywhere on Earth.

While the need to launch these satellites will act as a similar forcing function to drive Starship improvements and launch rates, the sheer number of satellites that will be needed for space-based data centers will push Starship to even greater heights. With launches every hour carrying 200 tons per flight, Starship will deliver millions of tons to orbit and beyond per year, enabling an exciting future where humanity is out exploring amongst the stars.

The basic math is that launching a million tons per year of satellites generating 100 kW of compute power per ton would add 100 gigawatts of AI compute capacity annually, with no ongoing operational or maintenance needs. Ultimately, there is a path to launching 1 TW/year from Earth.

My estimate is that within 2 to 3 years, the lowest cost way to generate AI compute will be in space. This cost-efficiency alone will enable innovative companies to forge ahead in training their AI models and processing data at unprecedented speeds and scales, accelerating breakthroughs in our understanding of physics and invention of technologies to benefit humanity.

This new constellation will build upon the well-established space sustainability design and operational strategies, including end-of-life disposal, that have proven successful for SpaceX's existing broadband satellite systems.

While launching AI satellites from Earth is the immediate focus, Starship's capabilities will also enable operations on other worlds. Thanks to advancements like in-space propellant transfer, Starship will be capable of landing massive amounts of cargo on the Moon.

Once there, it will be possible to establish a permanent presence for scientific and manufacturing pursuits. Factories on the Moon can take advantage of lunar resources to manufacture satellites and deploy them further into space.

By using an electromagnetic mass driver and lunar manufacturing, it is possible to put 500 to 1000 TW/year of AI satellites into deep space, meaningfully ascend the Kardashev scale and harness a non-trivial percentage of the Sun's power.

The capabilities we unlock by making space-based data centers a reality will fund and enable self-growing bases on the Moon, an entire civilization on Mars and ultimately expansion to the Universe.

Thank you for everything you have done and will do for the light cone of consciousness.

Ad Astra!

Elon","SpaceX has acquired xAI to form the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth. This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127874266,imgsize-13398,width-400,resizemode-4/elon-musk.jpg"

Oracle to raise $50 billion to fuel AI cloud expansion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/oracle-to-raise-50-billion-to-fuel-ai-cloud-expansion/articleshow/127869630.cms,"How Oracle aims to spend funds:



Oracle has unveiled a plan to raise up to $50 billion in 2026 as the software giant races to build the physical infrastructure required to power the global artificial intelligence boom. The company, chaired by billionaire Larry Ellison, expects to raise between $45 billion and $50 billion throughout the year using a balanced mix of debt and equity.According to news agency Reuters, the move comes as Oracle struggles to keep pace with “contracted demand” from a roster of AI heavyweights that includes Nvidia, Meta, xAI and OpenAI. In a statement, Oracle said that the cash infusion is required to fulfill existing obligations to its largest Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) customers.According to the report, Oracle plans to structure the funds into two halves. First is equity and derivatives where approximately $25 billion will be raised through common equity and equity-linked issuances. This includes a newly authorised $20 billion at-the-market (ATM) share program. The remaining share will be secured via a single, one-time issuance of investment-grade senior unsecured bonds.Despite the 5% premarket surge in Oracle's stock, investors remain wary of the company's deepening ties with OpenAI.The startup has committed to spending an estimated $300 billion on Oracle’s cloud services over five years but it remains unprofitable.Meanwhile, this build-out has landed Oracle in legal sticky wicket because last month, a group of bondholders filed a class-action lawsuit in New York, alleging that Oracle concealed the full scale of its borrowing needs.The plaintiffs claim they were “blindsided” when Oracle returned to capital markets for $38 billion in loans just weeks after an initial $18 billion bond sale in late 2025.","Oracle plans to raise between $45 billion and $50 billion in 2026.

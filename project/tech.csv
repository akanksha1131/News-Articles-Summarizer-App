Study says ChatGPT bias is real — and it’s tilting left; Elon Musk responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/study-says-chatgpt-bias-is-real-and-its-tilting-left-elon-musk-responds/articleshow/117922596.cms,"STUDY: CHATGPT BIAS IS REAL—AND IT’S TILTING LEFT

A new study confirms what many suspected—ChatGPT favors left-leaning views, often avoiding or restricting conservative perspectives.

Researchers found AI-generated text and images systematically leaned left, with right-leaning prompts frequently blocked over so-called “misinformation concerns.”

This raises major questions about fairness, free speech, and AI’s influence on public debate.

With AI shaping news, policy, and education, experts warn: without transparency and safeguards, biased algorithms could reshape democracy itself.

Visit the Google Play Store to try it. Be among the first 1,000 users and share your feedback.”

Grok app for Android: What to expect



The chatbot developed by Elon Musk-owned artificial intelligence (AI) startup xAI, Grok, will soon be available for Android users as a standalone app. The app, which is not yet available for download, has been listed on the Google Play Store , where users can pre-register for it. This follows a brief beta testing period in which some users had access to the app. However, xAI has yet to announce an official release date for the Android app.xAI seems to be preparing to launch an Android version of its AI chatbot a month after releasing Grok 's app for iPhones. An xAI engineer has also confirmed the Android app in a post on social media platform X (earlier Twitter).In the post, the xAI engineer wrote:Grok's Play Store listing notes that the app will be free to use, with no sign-in required to access its features. However, users who may want a personalised experience or wish to connect the AI to their X account may also have the option to sign in.It's important to note that Grok’s iPhone app allows users to sign in via their Apple accounts. Similarly, the company may also allow Android users to sign up for the app via their Google accounts. To compare, the web version of the chatbot requires users to be signed in for access.Just like the iPhone app, Grok’s standalone Android app is also expected to include features such as text responses, image generation, and real-time information sourced from X. However, it remains unclear whether the Android app will support web search-based queries.The app is also expected to be powered by the Grok 2 AI model. This is the same large language model used for both the free and premium web versions.","xAI's Grok chatbot will soon be available for Android users as a standalone app. The app, which is not yet available for download, has been listed on the Google Play Store.

DeepSeek is now banned in another country. After the US, Italy and Taiwan announced a ban on the The Chinese Al app, Australia has banned DeepSeek from all government devices. The ban stems from concerns that DeepSeek poses security risks.According to a report by news agency Reuters, the country’s Department of Home Affairs issued a mandatory directive requiring all government entities to “prevent the use or installation of DeepSeek products, applications and web services and where found remove all existing instances of DeepSeek products, applications and web services from all Australian Government systems and devices,” according to a government statement.Australian home affairs minister Tony Burke stated that DeepSeek presented an “unacceptable risk” to government technology, and the immediate ban was implemented “to protect Australia’s national security and national interest”. The ban is limited to government devices and does not extend to the devices of private citizens.DeepSeek's launch last month sent shockwaves through the global tech industry, as its AI models reportedly cost significantly less and require less powerful chips than those of its rivals. This development raised concerns about the substantial investments made by Western nations in chipmakers and data centers.Despite the Chinese Al app DeepSeek gaining attention for outperforming OpenAI at a much lower cost, it raised security concerns due to reports of user data being collected and stored in China. This is due to the fact that Chinese law mandates all companies share data with the government upon request, raising fears about potential access to American user data by the country.Australia's decision to ban DeepSeek follows a similar move by Italy, and other countries in Europe and elsewhere are also reportedly scrutinising the AI firm. Taiwan recently banned government departments from using DeepSeek as well.This ban is not the first instance of the Australian government restricting the use of Chinese technology. Two years ago, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government imposed a government-wide ban on the Chinese social media app TikTok due to security concerns.","Australia has banned DeepSeek from all government devices.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it.

Akash Bobba , a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). Bobba, along with five other young engineers, was hired by Musk to modernise government systems, raising concerns about their lack of government experience and the potential security risks involved.Bobba, a graduate of UC Berkeley's elite Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (MET) program, has quickly risen through the ranks of Silicon Valley , securing internships at Meta, Palantir, and Bridgewater Associates.Known for his problem-solving skills, Bobba once rewrote an entire project overnight after a teammate accidentally deleted it just before a deadline. His former classmate Charis Zhang recalled the incident.“Let me tell you something about Akash. During a project at Berkeley, I accidentally deleted our entire codebase 2 days before the deadline. I panicked. Akash just stared at the screen, shrugged, and rewrote everything from scratch in one night—better than before. We submitted early and got first in the class. Many such stories. I trust him with everything I own,” wrote Zhang in a social media post.Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate. Critics argue that granting individuals with limited government experience access to sensitive government systems poses significant security risks. The hiring strategy has also raised questions about the competence and oversight within Musk's DOGE initiative. Reports suggest that at least four of the new DOGE hires, including Bobba, now have top-tier access to federal IT systems.Bobba isn't the only new face in Musk's government overhaul. The five other members of the DOGE team comprise a mix of recent graduates, college students, and former SpaceX interns, all of whom now have official government emails and top-level security clearances.","Akash Bobba, a 22-year-old engineer of Indian origin, has recently joined Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE) Bobba's appointment, along with the other young engineers, has sparked significant debate.

DeepSeek ban has started in the US of A. The first state in the United States of America (USA) to ban China's DeepSeek AI is Texas. The Texas Governor Greg Abbott has issued an order banning the Chinese-owned artificial intelligence app DeepSeek from all State-issued devices. This makes Texas the first State in the US to take such an action.Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued an order banning the Chinese app DeepSeek.Abbott cited concerns about the Chinese Communist Party's potential access to sensitive data of Americans through the AI app. ""Texas will not allow the Chinese Communist Party to infiltrate our state’s critical infrastructure through data-harvesting AI and social media apps,"" Abbott stated. He emphasized the need to protect state agencies and employees handling critical infrastructure, intellectual property, and personal information from ""malicious espionage operations."" “To achieve that mission, I ordered Texas state agencies to ban Chinese government-based AI and social media apps from all state-issued devices. State agencies and employees responsible for handling critical infrastructure, intellectual property, and personal information must be protected from malicious espionage operations by the Chinese Communist Party. Texas will continue to protect and defend our state from hostile foreign actors,” his statement saidIncidentally, Texas is the state that the world's richest man Elon Musk has moved his company SpaceX's headquarters to. In July last year, Elon Musk announced that he would officially move the headquarters of SpaceX and his social media site X from California to Texas.An upset Musk had then said that the move was in response to a California law prohibiting rules requiring teachers to notify parents if a child changes their name, pronouns, or gender identity at school.SpaceX workers living in Cameron County filed an official petition in January 2025 to hold an election on incorporation later in the month. The document proposes the initial plans for the town and if they translate into reality, Musk will have created history again. The petition outlines a community of roughly 500 residents. These include 219 primary residents and over 100 children. The proposed location, covering about 1.5 square miles, is near Boca Chica Beach at the end of State Highway 4. If approved, Starbase will be able to establish its own police and fire departments and enact its own ordinances.The Chinese AI app DeepSeek gained attention recently for outperforming OpenAI at a much lower cost. However, it has also raised security concerns due to reports of user data being collected and stored in China. Chinese law mandates that companies share data with the government upon request, raising fears about potential access to American user data by the Chinese Communist Party. The US Navy has also blocked DeepSeek due to these concerns.In addition to DeepSeek, the order prohibits several other Chinese social media platforms, including RedNote and Lemon8. It also extends to apps associated with the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party, such as Webull, Tiger Brokers, and Moomoo.

PANIC in the Caribbean nation

Prime Minister Reuben Meade says should be thankful to Jeff Bezos

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and fiancee Lauren Sanchez 's recent visit to the Caribbean island of Montserrat aboard his $500 million superyacht, ""Koru,"" reportedly sparked alarm among locals who feared the billionaire was scouting land for purchase. According to a report in Daily Mail, Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's visit on January 6, part of a Caribbean tour that also included St.Kitts and Nevis and St. Barts, prompted a town hall meeting and forced the Prime Minister to address the community's concerns.Locals worried that the world's second-richest man, worth $250 billion, was in Montserrat for business. These concerns were amplified at a United Alliance town hall meeting where Bezos' presence was a key topic. One community member expressed apprehension about the mogul's intentions.Bezos's ""Koru,"" a 417-foot, three-masted sailing yacht built in the Netherlands in 2021, drew considerable attention, with residents sharing photos and videos of the vessel on social media. While some worried about land acquisition, others saw the visit as a potential opportunity for the island, suggesting Bezos could be asked for assistance with local projects like the port or hospital. Some residents also hoped the visit would boost tourism.Prime Minister Reuben Meade, 70, attempted to quell these fears, clarifying that Bezos was visiting as a tourist. ""He came here as a tourist,"" Meade stated, emphasizing the separation between Bezos's personal and business activities. He further explained that Bezos couldn't purchase land without government approval, requiring an ""alien land holding license,"" ensuring transparency in any potential business dealings. ""They can't do anything unless they register a business or seek a license to do business. We will know what is happening when the time is right,"" Meade reassured the public. He emphasized respecting Bezos's privacy during his visit.'We're not going to nosy in a person's business. He comes here. He comes here as a tourist. He spends money in Montserrat. Thank God he's spending some money in Montserrat,' Meade said.Montserrat is widely known as 'The Emerald Isle of the Caribbean 'Montserrat, known as ""The Emerald Isle of the Caribbean,"" boasts a population of approximately 4,386. Despite its beauty and growing tourism sector, parts of the island remain uninhabitable due to past volcanic activity, including the now-buried capital, Plymouth.

Satellite Revolution: A New Dawn for India's Digital Landscape,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/satellite-revolution-a-new-dawn-for-indias-digital-landscape/articleshow/117920760.cms,"-- By Sandeep Arora, Vice President and Industry Platform Leader for Telecom, India, Capgemini

India stands on the brink of a transformative shift in its digital evolution, with satellite internet poised to be the game changer. What was once considered a niche technology is now set to become the cornerstone of the country’s rural connectivity strategy, reshaping its socio-economic landscape. This is not just an upgrade in technology; it is a big opportunity to bridge the digital divide that has long separated millions from the benefits of the modern world.With a unique mix of geographic diversity, infrastructure limitations, and socio-economic challenges, India is yet to fully tap the broadband market potential.Bridging this access gap will empower millions with the opportunities essential for progress in today’s world. Satellite technology can reach the farthest corners of rural India, opening doors to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities.Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are emerging as a maturing technology. With ongoing efforts from telecom and satellite companies, combined with supportive government policies such as 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in satellite manufacturing components, the groundwork is being laid for a new wave of connectivity in rural development.Revolutionizing EducationImagine a classroom in a remote village where students have access to virtual lessons, can interact with peers from around the globe, and tap into a vast repository of educational resources. Satellite internet will make this vision a reality. By bringing reliable connectivity to even the most isolated locations, the technology will empower students and educators alike, creating a new generation of rural innovators and entrepreneurs. This transformative connectivity will enable interactive and immersive learning experiences previously confined to urban areas, ultimately bridging the educational gap.Transforming HealthcareIn the field of healthcare, satellite internet has the potential to revolutionize medical access in underserved regions. By enabling real-time consultations between rural health centres and urban specialists, satellite technology will enhance healthcare outcomes across the country. Digitalizing clinics and integrating telehealth capabilities will connect thousands of doctors to rural patients, facilitating remote consultations and expert medical advice. This connectivity will be crucial in delivering quality healthcare services in disadvantaged areas, ensuring no one is left behind.Advancing Precision AgricultureAgriculture stands to benefit profoundly from the integration of satellite internet. The technology promises to transform farming practices, enabling precision agriculture that optimizes water use, boosts crop yields, and reduces pesticide reliance. As satellite internet becomes widespread and affordable, millions of farmers across India will gain access to advanced tools and insights, enhancing agricultural productivity. This technological advancement will also bolster resilience against climate change, making farming practices more sustainable and efficient.Enhancing Financial ServicesSatellite internet will drive a surge in digital financial services in rural areas. It will increase the percentage of rural adults using digital banking, reduce the cost of remittances, and improve insurance penetration. Satellite technology will enable the expansion of the rural financial landscape, accelerating the adoption of digital banking and fintech solutions. As a result, millions in rural pockets of the country will be able to enter the formal financial system, promoting economic inclusion.Strengthening Disaster ManagementDuring natural disasters, effective communication can be a matter of life and death. Natural disasters can damage essential communication networks and infrastructure, impacting their functionality and capacity. Satellite internet will provide a critical lifeline, offering reliable and uninterrupted connectivity during emergencies. This capability will enhance disaster management efforts, ensuring timely responses and coordination that can save lives and minimize damage.Navigating Challenges and OpportunitiesDespite the immense potential, challenges remain. The need for affordable ground terminals, the environmental impact of satellite launches, and secure data transmission between satellites and ground stations must be addressed. As connectivity improves, addressing digital literacy and developing relevant local content will be crucial to ensuring that the benefits of satellite internet are fully realized.The journey ahead will require collaborative efforts from policymakers, industry leaders, and communities. As satellite internet evolves, it is essential for these stakeholders to work together to overcome the existing challenges and maximize the technology’s potential. The satellite revolution represents a new dawn for India’s digital landscape. It is an opportunity to bridge the digital divide, empower rural communities, and unlock unprecedented potential for growth and socio-economic development. Satellite technology promises to redefine India’s future, bringing the promise of connectivity and opportunity to every corner of the country.","India stands on the brink of a transformative shift in its digital evolution.

Microsoft was first major tech company to confirm job cuts

Facebook parent Meta to layoff about 3600 employees

Amazon continues layoffs in 2025 after cutting thousands of jobs in 2022, 2023 and 2024

Google asks employees to quit voluntarily

Salesforce reported to cut 1000 jobs this year

Stripe to lay off 300 employees

Layoffs in the tech industry, which began in 2022, shows no signs of easing in 2025, as layoffs continue to plague companies across Silicon Valley and beyond. From tech giants like Google and Microsoft to e-commerce leaders like Amazon and social media powerhouses like Facebook, an increasing number of tech firms are reducing their workforce, suggesting a potential paradigm shift.According to layoffs.fyi, 31 tech companies have laid off over 7,000 employees this year. This list tracks the major tech companies that have either implemented or announced plans for layoffs in 2025.Microsoft has confirmed another round of layoffs, impacting employees across various divisions. The company stated that these reductions specifically target individuals not meeting performance expectations. Business Insider initially reported, citing sources, that the layoffs include members of Microsoft's security division. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed the job cuts but declined to disclose the total number of affected employees.Despite the global layoffs, Microsoft's India and South Asia head, Puneet Chandok, has assured that the company's India operations will not be affected by this latest round of job cuts.Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has announced plans to lay off approximately 3,600 employees deemed to be low performers. In an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg, CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed the move, explaining that it is a strategy to “raise the bar on performance management and move out low-performers faster.”These layoffs, impacting roughly 5% of Meta's 72,400-person workforce (as of September), are part of what Zuckerberg has described as an ""intense year"" for the company. Employees in the US will be notified of their status by February 10, while international employees will be informed at a later date, according to new agency AFP.Amazon announced late last month that it is implementing layoffs within its communications and sustainability divisions as part of an organisational restructuring effort. The precise number of affected employees has not been revealed, though it was described as “small” in an internal memo obtained by CNBC.Drew Herdener, who leads public relations and corporate responsibility at Amazon, informed staff of the cuts, explaining in a memo that the company needs to eliminate roles that are “too narrowly scoped” or create “unnecessary layers” within the organisation. Amazon substantially downsized its workforce with over 27,000 employees throughout 2022, 2023 and 2024.Last week reports said that Google has offered a voluntary exit programme to US-based employees within its Platforms & Devices organisation, the division responsible for key products like Android, Pixel, Chrome, and Nest. The program, announced via an internal memo from Senior Vice President Rick Osterloh and first reported by 9to5Google, offers severance packages to employees who choose to leave the division.“The Platforms & Devices team is offering a voluntary exit program that provides US-based Googlers working on this team the ability to voluntarily leave the company with a severance package,” a Google spokesperson confirmed.The voluntary exit option is available to teams working across a range of products, including Android (encompassing Auto, TV, Wear OS, and XR), Chrome, ChromeOS, Google Photos, Google One, Pixel, Fitbit, and Nest.Salesforce is the latest company that has been reported to be planning to cut over 1,000 jobs as part of its ongoing restructuring efforts. Bloomberg News reported that the company is simultaneously hiring new employees to support its expansion into Al-driven products.Notably, displaced workers will be able to apply for other jobs internally. It could not be determined which divisions the reductions were focused on.Stripe has announced the layoff of 300 employees, primarily impacting roles in product, engineering, and operations, according to an internal memo dated January 20. Despite this decision, Chief People Officer Rob McIntosh noted in the memo that the company plans to grow its overall workforce to around 10,000 employees by the year's end.","Microsoft has confirmed another round of layoffs, impacting employees across various divisions.

The problem was that the room we were in circulated outside air which made the air purifier I'd brought with me ineffective.”He further highlighted: “The room’s Air Quality Index (AQI) was 130, with PM2.5 levels at 75 µg/m³ — equivalent to smoking 3.4 cigarettes a day.”By his third day in India, Johnson said the pollution had caused his “skin break out in rash and my eyes and throat burn.” He expressed disbelief at how normalized air pollution seemed, noting, “People would be outside running. Babies and small children exposed from birth. No one wore a mask which can significantly decrease exposure. It was so confusing.”Johnson also highlighted the significant impact on public health. He wrote:The evidence shows that India would improve the health of its population more by cleaning up air quality than by curing all cancers.I am unsure why India's leaders do not make air quality a national emergency. I don't know what interests, money and power keep things the way they are but it's really bad for the entire country.When I returned to the U.S., my eyes were fresh to see what is normalized to me. I saw obesity everywhere. 42.4% of American are obese and because I was around it all the time, I had been mostly oblivious to it.In many contexts, obesity is worse than air pollution in the long term.Why wouldn't American leaders declare a national emergency on obesity?

Netflix has reportedly removed transgender actress Karla Sofia Gascon from promotional materials for its Oscar-nominated film Emilia Perez. This comes a month ahead of the 97th Academy Awards. Several users on social media platforms like X/Twitter and Reddit noted that the streamer appeared to be downplaying Gascon's presence in their Oscar campaign for the film.“Karla Sofia Gascon has been completely erased from the latest Oscars ' For Your Consideration ' ad for Emilia Perez. I wonder why!??,” wrote a user on X, sharing an image of promotional material of the film on Netflix.“New Netflix FYC poster for Emilia Perez without Karla on it oh it’s OVER lmaooo,” wrote another user on X.Gascon, 52, made history as the first openly transgender actress to receive a Best Actress nomination for her portrayal of the film’s titular character. However, promotional materials for the 'For Your Consideration' (FYC) campaign appeared to center on Best Supporting Actress nominee Zoe Saldana, 46. Saldana, who earned her first career Oscar nomination for playing Rita in the Spanish-language film, is widely considered the frontrunner for the award.In a related news, Gascon has faced intense backlash over offensive tweets she posted in the past five years, with remarks about George Floyd, Islam, and diversity at the Oscars sparking widespread criticism. The controversy has quickly overshadowed her awards campaign, drawing significant public and industry scrutiny.In an emotional hour-long interview with CNN en Espanol, Gascon insisted she is not “a racist” as she tearfully addressed her past social media posts. Speaking with interviewer Juan Carlos Arciniegas, she was asked whether she would renounce her historic Oscar nomination—the first ever for an openly transgender actor. Gascon firmly refused, stating, “I cannot renounce a nomination because what I have done is a job, and what is being valued is my acting work,” as translated by The Hollywood Reporter.She further defended her position, saying, “I cannot step down from an Oscar nomination because I have not committed any crime nor have I harmed anyone.

“We will vigorously defend against the Department of Justice’s overreaching interpretation of

antitrust laws

and will demonstrate how this transaction will provide customers with greater innovation and choice, positively change the dynamics in the networking market.”

What DOJ said about HPE’s Juniper acquisition



“The proposed transaction between HPE and Juniper, if allowed to proceed, would further consolidate an already highly concentrated market — and leave U.S. enterprises facing two companies commanding over 70% of the market,”

The US Justice Department (DOJ) has filed a lawsuit to block Hewlett Packard Enterprise 's (HPE) proposed $14 billion acquisition of rival Juniper Networks. The lawsuit, the first attempt by the Trump administration to stop a merger, alleges that HPE, facing increased competition from Juniper, opted to buy its rival instead of continuing to innovate and compete. The DOJ said that the merger would stifle competition, lead to higher prices, and reduce innovation in the networking industry. Last year, HPE revealed plans to acquire Juniper Networks for $40 per share in a deal which is expected to double the buyer’s networking business.HPE and Juniper released a joint statement that both companies strongly opposed the DOJ’s decision. The companies stated that the merged entity would increase competition, not hinder it.In the statement, HPE and Juniper wrote:In its complaint, the DOJ portrayed HPE as a company struggling to keep pace with a smaller competitor that was gaining market share.The complaint noted that HPE’s salespeople were worried about the ""Juniper threat"" and cited one former executive urging his team to adopt a no-holds-barred approach, telling them that ""there are no rules in a street fight"" and encouraging them to ""kill"" Juniper in sales competitions.The DOJ also stated that HPE and Juniper are the second and third-largest providers of wireless local area network (WLAN) products and services for businesses in the US, adding that Cisco Systems was the industry leader.DOJ said in the complaint.","The US Justice Department has filed a lawsuit to block Hewlett Packard Enterprise's proposed $14 billion acquisition of rival Juniper Networks.

Steve Jobs had “many skills that I didn’t”: Bill Gates

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates recently shared candid thoughts about his relationship with Steve Jobs Apple , and pivotal moments in tech history during an interview with Axios. The conversation coincides with the release of Gates' new memoir, Source Code, which chronicles the early days of the computer industry.Reflecting on Steve Jobs, Gates called the late Apple co-founder a ""singular figure"" who had an extraordinary ability to captivate people.""He should have been an actor,"" Gates said. ""He really ran the reality distortion field like no one else.""Despite Jobs' persuasive charisma, Gates claims he was never under his spell. ""I always said to Steve, 'Look, I'm a minor wizard. You're a major wizard. You can cast spells I can't cast, but because I'm a minor wizard, your spells don't work on me. I see the bullshit, that you're just mesmerizing these people.'""Gates recalled a particularly blunt exchange after Jobs unveiled the NeXT computer , a machine that struggled commercially. ""This thing is a slow, expensive computer with an overpriced black case,"" Gates told Jobs at the time.While Gates admired Jobs' ""messianic"" skills in marketing and leadership, he also noted the late Apple co-founder’s lack of technical expertise. ""Steve's achievements are all the more impressive when you know that he couldn't look at a piece of code and know what it was,"" Gates said. ""He was never an engineer. Woz [Steve Wozniak] was a real engineer — I mean, a hardcore engineer.""Despite their differing skill sets and approaches, Gates acknowledged that he and Jobs shared one key talent: the ability to inspire their teams. ""Clearly, he had so many skills that I didn't, but we were both a little bit pied pipers in terms of getting people to work ridiculous hours,"" Gates said.The conversation also touched on Microsoft's pivotal role in saving Apple from bankruptcy in 1997, when it invested in the struggling company and pledged support. Gates said he has no regrets about the move. ""It was good that Apple recovered and made incredible contributions,"" he said. ""Once you get to the mobile thing, then Apple becomes every bit as important as Microsoft. It wasn't up until then. They were more of a niche.""However, Gates admitted that selling Microsoft’s 5% stake in Apple, acquired as part of the deal, was a mistake. ""I wish we'd maintained that 5% ownership,"" he said with a laugh. ""It was foolish, foolish to sell it, but when we're worrying about all sorts of antitrust things, we sold it for what now looks like nothing. And we owned part of Facebook for a while, too.""","Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates recently shared candid thoughts about his relationship with Steve Jobs.

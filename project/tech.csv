Boycott Turkey: Flipkart-owned Myntra and Reliance-owned Ajio stop selling these Turkish brands,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/boycott-turkey-flipkart-owned-myntra-and-reliance-owned-ajio-to-stop-selling-these-turkish-brands/articleshow/121220954.cms,"Turkish brands 'removed' by Myntra and Ajio

CAIT calls for boycott of Turkey and Azerbaijan

Leading Indian e-commerce platforms Myntra and Reliance-owned Ajio have reportedly halted sales of Turkish apparel brands on their websites, responding to Boycott calls triggered by Turkey's support for Pakistan during the recent India-Pakistan military conflict. This follows Turkey and Azerbaijan’s support for Pakistan after India’s Operation Sindoor, launched to dismantle terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in response to last month’s Pahalgam attack.Flipkart-owned Myntra, which holds exclusive rights to market Alibaba-owned Turkish brand Trendyol in India, has temporarily suspended sales of all Turkish brands, including Trendyol, a top-selling international women’s western wear label. The move began last weekend as tensions escalated, with a complete suspension implemented by Thursday, according to two industry executives. “Myntra is reassessing its partnerships, pending further developments,” one executive told Economic Times. He added that there is no clarity as to when and if these brands will return.Similarly, Reliance has pulled its portfolio of Turkish apparel brands, including Koton, LC Waikiki, and Mavi, from Ajio, with all products marked as out of stock. A Reliance spokesperson emphasized the company’s commitment to national sentiment, stating, ""In solidarity with our fellow citizens, we are actively reassessing our offerings across platforms to ensure they reflect the values and sentiments of the country."" The spokesperson also confirmed the closure of Reliance’s office in Turkey and the complete delisting of Turkish brands from Ajio in the next few days.Reliance also clarified that its earlier partnership with Turkish textile firm Kıvanc Tekstil, established over five years ago, was terminated long before the current conflict. “They are now just one of many global customers, with no preferential treatment,” the spokesperson added.""We have also closed our office in Turkey,"" the spokesperson added. ""The process of delisting Turkish brands started a few days ago and complete removal of Turkish brands was done on Friday,"" an official aware of the developments said.On Friday, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), representing over 125 trade leaders, passed a resolution to boycott all trade and commercial ties with Turkey and Azerbaijan, including imports, exports, and tourism. CAIT condemned the stance of Turkey and Azerbaijan as a “betrayal,” citing India’s past humanitarian and diplomatic support to both nations.The association also stated that Indian exporters, importers, and business delegations will be discouraged from any engagement with companies or institutions based in Turkiye and Azerbaijan.The traders' lobby shared that a memorandum will be submitted to the ministry of commerce and industry and the ministry of external affairs, urging policy-level review of all commercial ties with these nations.The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has also declared that the business community will boycott Indian films shot in Turkey and Azerbaijan. It also warned corporate houses against filming any product promotions in these two countries.Social media has amplified the boycott calls, with widespread campaigns targeting Turkish and Azerbaijani products. Meanwhile, Amazon reportedly continues to sell Turkish apparel and lifestyle brands in India, sources said.","Myntra and Reliance-owned Ajio have reportedly halted sales of Turkish apparel brands on their websites.

Netflix to introduce AI-generated ads appearing within shows and movies; here's what the company said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/netflix-to-introduce-ai-generated-ads-appearing-within-shows-and-movies-heres-what-the-company-said/articleshow/121220924.cms,"Representative Image

What Netflix said about the AI-generated ads



“Netflix debuted a new modular framework for ad formats that leverages generative AI to instantly marry advertisers’ ads with the worlds of our shows. This will create a better, more relevant experience for our members and drive the best results. Reinhard unveiled the first capability with interactive midroll and pause formats that build custom advertising creative with added overlays, call to action, second screen buttons, and more to serve the right ad to the right member at the right time. These formats will be available by 2026 in all ad-supported countries.”

“I hope it’s this: the foundation of our ads business is in place. And going forward, the pace of progress is going to be even faster. Plus, we already have the most important thing: the most engaged audience anywhere,”

Netflix has announced it will roll out AI-generated advertising, including pause ads, on its ad-supported tier by 2026. The company is developing a new type of ad that uses AI to integrate advertiser products with Netflix shows and movies. During Netflix’s third Upfront event, the company demonstrated an example by showing how a product image will be placed over a background inspired by Stranger Things. For users on Netflix’s ad-supported plan, this means seeing ads that blend with the content they’re watching. The US-based streaming giant also noted that advertisers can insert these new ad formats in the middle of viewing or display them when users pause. These ads could include an overlay or a call to action when they are introduced by the end of this year.At the event, Amy Reinhard, Netflix’s President of Advertising, noted that the ad-supported plan now has more than 94 million global monthly active users and is used by more 18-34-year-olds than any other US broadcast or cable network. She also noted that ad members in the US are highly engaged, spending an average of 41 hours per month on Netflix.In a blog post, while talking about the AI-generated ads , the company wrote:Reinhard noted.Meanwhile, the company did not specify the targeting methods for these ads, such as watch history or the content being viewed at the time. Also, details about the backend operation and presentation of these ads are currently unknown. However, Netflix has confirmed that these AI-generated advertisements are coming to the platform.",Netflix has announced it will roll out AI-generated advertising on its ad- supported tier by 2026.

How the shocking kidnapping attempt on crypto CEO's daughter in broad daylight in Paris shows the BIG Crypto problem in Europe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-the-shocking-kidnapping-attempt-on-crypto-ceos-daughter-in-broad-daylight-in-paris-shows-the-big-crypto-problem-in-europe/articleshow/121220669.cms,"France summons cryptocurrency businesses after kidnappings (Photo: AP)

Disturbing trend of family kidnappings

A disturbing trend of kidnappings and extortion attempts targeting cryptocurrency firms and their owners is sweeping across France and other European Union nations, prompting urgent calls for increased governmental protection for individuals within the burgeoning digital asset industry. Authorities are increasingly convinced that these brazen attacks are orchestrated by organized criminal groups employing a chilling new tactic: targeting the families of wealthy cryptocurrency investors and business executives.The core tenet of cryptocurrency ownership, ""not your keys, not your coins,"" which emphasizes individual control over digital assets as a security measure against online theft, has inadvertently created a new vulnerability in the physical world. While storing cryptocurrency in ""cold wallets"" (offline storage) can safeguard against remote hacking, it exposes holders to the ""$\$$5 wrench problem"" – the threat of physical coercion to surrender private keys and, consequently, their digital fortunes. Now, cryptocurrency industrialists and their families are finding themselves alarmingly susceptible to this very scenario.The latest incident unfolded in broad daylight in Paris, where a masked gang attempted to abduct the daughter of Pierre Noizat , the CEO of prominent French cryptocurrency firm Paymium, from a public street. This terrifying event marks at least the third such attack in France in recent months, signaling a dangerous escalation. In January, the co-founder of another leading French crypto company, Ledger, and his wife were brutally kidnapped. Then, in May, the father of a crypto company head was snatched. While all victims in these prior incidents were eventually rescued, both kidnapped fathers tragically suffered the amputation of a finger.In the most recent attack, the husband of Pierre Noizat's daughter bravely fought off the assailants, sustaining a fractured skull in the process, before managing to flee after a quick-thinking shop owner intervened, chasing the attackers away with a fire extinguisher. Reports from Ars Technica indicate that similar attacks have occurred in Belgium and Spain in recent months, suggesting a coordinated effort across multiple European nations. Law enforcement agencies across the continent are actively investigating several of these cases, with growing suspicion that they are linked to sophisticated organized crime networks.In a bid to deter further attacks, investors within the cryptocurrency industry are actively working to raise awareness among criminals about the inherent traceability of most cryptocurrency transactions. While attackers may operate under the misconception that they can coerce victims' families into transferring digital assets to untraceable wallets, the reality is more complex. Cryptocurrency transactions, even those involving privacy-focused coins, leave a digital trail that can be followed by skilled investigators. Indeed, police forces have successfully tracked and apprehended numerous individuals involved in these recent kidnapping and extortion attempts, demonstrating the limitations of anonymity in the blockchain ecosystem. The industry hopes that highlighting these successful arrests and the inherent risks of cryptocurrency-based extortion will serve as a deterrent.French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau addressed the growing concerns this week, stating his intention to meet with French cryptocurrency entrepreneurs to discuss and encourage enhanced personal security measures. However, as of yet, there has been no concrete indication of broader governmental action or the provision of dedicated protection beyond these verbal assurances.For individuals holding their own cryptocurrency investments, these events serve as a stark reminder that while safeguarding digital assets offline can mitigate the risk of hacking, it does not eliminate the threat of real-world exploitation. In this evolving landscape of crypto-related crime, discretion and privacy regarding one's holdings are proving to be increasingly vital. The most prudent strategy, security experts advise, is to maintain a low profile about one's wealth and potential cryptocurrency holdings, as those unaware of your financial status are less likely to target you for extortion.","A disturbing trend of kidnappings and extortion attempts targeting cryptocurrency firms and their owners is sweeping across France and other European Union nations.

"Weeks after Mark Carney's win, Canada's economy appears in crisis; job data at its lowest almost in years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/weeks-after-mark-carneys-win-canadas-economy-appears-in-crisis-job-data-at-almost-its-lowest-in-years/articleshow/121220363.cms,"Trump Tariffs and more: What is causing employment risis in Canada

What job seekers in Canada need to do

Grim Economic Outlook

Newly elected Prime Minister Mark Carney is confronting a significant economic downturn as Canada's labor market shows alarming signs of deterioration, particularly impacting recent graduates. Fresh data reveals a concerning trend of rapidly rising unemployment and sluggish job creation, exacerbating existing economic vulnerabilities just months into Carney's tenure. In April 2025, Canada added a meager 7,400 jobs, a figure far below expectations and insufficient to keep pace with population growth, consequently pushing the national unemployment rate to 6.9%. However, the situation is considerably more severe for young Canadians entering the workforce. The unemployment rate for recent post-secondary graduates has surged to a troubling 11.2%, marking the highest rate at the beginning of a year in at least two decades, according to an analysis of Statistics Canada data by Brendon Bernard, a senior economist at Indeed Canada. This paints a stark and bleak picture for young Canadians attempting to launch their careers, gain financial independence, and secure their long-term financial futures. Indeed, sources like The Globe and Mail are reporting that the current labor market conditions represent the bleakest in decades for this demographic.The delayed economic recovery, significantly hampered by external factors such as the ongoing trade disputes with the United States – involving substantial tariffs on key Canadian exports like steel, aluminum, and automobiles – has dashed earlier hopes for a swift rebound in the labor market following anticipated interest rate adjustments by the Bank of Canada. Economists are increasingly concerned that graduating during such a pronounced economic downturn could have enduring negative consequences on young individuals' career trajectories, potentially leading to prolonged periods of underemployment, slower income growth, and hindered career advancement. “If the recovery is swift, people can regain momentum,” Bernard cautioned, “But right now, it's unclear how long these conditions will persist, and the longer it takes, the greater the potential for lasting damage to their career prospects.”The financial ramifications of this employment crisis for young Canadians are substantial and long-lasting. Protracted delays in securing stable and meaningful employment directly impede their ability to initiate savings and investment early in their careers – a cornerstone of long-term financial security. Certified financial planner Desmond Nwaerondu of Sun Life in Calgary emphasizes the critical impact of delayed savings on retirement goals. He illustrates this with a compelling example: an individual who begins saving $200 per month at age 20 with a hypothetical 4% annual return would accumulate approximately $296,842 by age 65. In contrast, someone who delays saving until age 30, with the same monthly contribution and return, would amass only $180,642 – a difference of over $116,000 due to just a decade of delayed action. This highlights the power of compounding and the significant disadvantage faced by young individuals who are unable to start saving early due to unemployment or underemployment.Despite the challenging economic landscape, experts offer guidance for young job seekers striving to navigate this difficult market. Chris Raper, a portfolio manager at Aspira Wealth (Raymond James Ltd.), advises adopting a pragmatic approach by gaining any form of work experience available, even if it falls outside their immediate field of interest. He argues that these roles, such as camp counseling or positions in the hospitality industry, can be invaluable in developing essential soft skills that are highly valued by employers across various sectors. Furthermore, Raper underscores the growing importance of acquiring high-demand technical skills, particularly in areas like Artificial Intelligence (AI), suggesting the utilization of readily available free online resources such as YouTube for self-directed learning. Networking is also identified as a critical strategy, with professionals recommending active engagement on platforms like LinkedIn and attendance at relevant industry events to build connections and uncover potential opportunities. “You need to get in front of the people working in the industry you want to join,” Raper advises.The broader economic outlook for Canada under Prime Minister Carney's leadership appears increasingly precarious. The combination of high unemployment, particularly among young people, and sluggish overall job growth raises serious concerns about potential economic stagnation. The ongoing trade tensions with the US, manifested in tariffs on key Canadian exports, further exacerbate these challenges by negatively impacting crucial sectors of the Canadian economy. Statistics Canada data indicating that approximately 1.6 million Canadians are currently unemployed underscores the significant strain on the national labor market. The net addition of only 7,400 jobs in April, following a loss of 32,600 jobs in March, highlights the volatile and uneven nature of the current economic recovery, further amplifying anxieties about Canada's economic stability in the face of persistent trade headwinds and a weakening labor market.","In April 2025, Canada added a meager 7,400 jobs, a figure far below expectations and insufficient to keep pace with population growth.

Apple Pay , one of the world's most widely used digital payment platforms, experienced a significant outage on May 16, 2025, affecting thousands of users across the United States. As per reports, the disruption, which began around 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time left many unable to make transactions, access their digital wallets, or use related services like Apple Cash and Apple Card. While Apple has since restored most of its services, the incident highlights the growing dependency on digital financial systems and the potential challenges they face.The first signs of the outage appeared when thousands of users began reporting issues on the popular outage tracking platform, Down Detector. At its peak, nearly 3,000 reports were logged, indicating a widespread problem affecting Apple Pay, Wallet, Cash, and Card services. Many users also took to social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, and Bluesky to share their frustrations about being unable to complete routine transactions.For nearly two hours, Apple Pay and Wallet remained inaccessible for many, significantly impacting users who rely on the service for daily purchases, transportation, and peer-to-peer payments. This prompted many to seek alternative payment methods, with some noting the inconvenience of being unable to access ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, which often depend on Apple Pay for quick transactions.Apple's official status page, which initially showed all systems as operational, eventually confirmed the widespread disruption. The page listed ongoing issues with Apple Pay, Apple Wallet, Apple Card, and Apple Cash, stating that ""some users may be experiencing issues with this service."" This acknowledgment came roughly an hour after the first reports surfaced, reflecting a delayed response to the problem.By late morning, Apple had updated its status page to indicate that Apple Cash and Apple Card services had returned to normal, while Apple Pay and Wallet continued to experience problems. Despite these updates, some users continued to report lingering issues, suggesting that the recovery process was not uniform across all regions or devices.As of 11:11 a.m. Pacific Time, Apple reported that all affected services, including Apple Pay and Wallet, had been restored. However, the company's status page provided no specific details about the cause of the outage or the steps taken to resolve it. Apple has not yet released an official statement addressing the incident, and requests for comment have so far gone unanswered.While the outage appears to be resolved for most users, some have continued to report sporadic connectivity issues, indicating that the recovery may still be ongoing for a subset of the user base. The incident also sparked renewed discussions online about the importance of having backup payment options, especially as digital payment systems become more deeply integrated into daily life.The timing of the outage, occurring on a Friday morning, likely added to the inconvenience for users attempting to pay bills, transfer funds, or make weekend plans. The incident also highlights the broader implications of relying on digital payment systems, which, while convenient, can leave users vulnerable to sudden disruptions.Given the scale and duration of the outage, Apple Pay's temporary unavailability serves as a reminder of the critical role digital payment platforms now play in global commerce. It also underscores the need for robust backup systems and clear communication from service providers when technical issues arise.","Apple Pay, one of the world's most widely used digital payment platforms, experienced a significant outage on May 16, 2025.

Tim Cook leadership



Also Read |

Since taking the helm as Apple's CEO in 2011, Tim Cook has led the company to historic levels of growth, shifting it from a product-driven pioneer to a multi-trillion-dollar conglomerate. Under Cook's leadership, Apple expanded into new regions, improved operational effectiveness, and recorded unprecedented financial success while maintaining alignment with a vision of simplicity, user privacy, and product excellence.In more recent events, US President Donald Trump publicly called for Apple CEO Tim Cook to move iPhone manufacturing back to America from India. Trump pointed out that Apple must first think about making products locally, even though India had promised to drop tariffs on American products. He again raised the issue of India having high tariff barriers that he feels stand in the way of American business. Trump also praised Apple's ramp-up investment in the manufacturing in America, pointing out a $500 billion pledge and new plant constructions in America going on today.Timothy Donald Cook or Tim Cook was born on November 1, 1960, in Mobile, Alabama, but grew up in the neighbouring town, Robertsdale. His father worked at the shipyard, and his mother was an assistant pharmacist; their house was modest but rooted in work ethic and discipline. Cook graduated second in his high school class and received the ""Most Studious"" award, which is a sign of the hardworking and detail-minded leader that he would grow up to be.Cook received his Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering from Auburn University in 1982, a degree that set him up for his process improvement habit. He later studied for an MBA at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business and graduated as a Fuqua Scholar, an award reserved for the top 10% of students. This unconventional blend of technical and managerial training formed the basis of his distinctive vision as a business executive grounded in analytical capabilities and operating discipline.As of May 2025, Apple CEO Tim Cook's net worth is more than $2 billion, according to a Forbes report. His net worth mainly comes from Apple stock holdings, such as around 3.28 million shares, and performance-based compensation packages. In 2024, Cook's compensation was $74.6 million, including a $3 million base salary, $58.1 million in stock awards, and $12 million in incentives. Unlike technology founders such as Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, the majority of Cook's fortune is not from ownership positions in the company but from executive pay.After graduate school, Cook worked at IBM, where he spent 12 years overseeing manufacturing and distribution operations in North and Latin America. He gained a high respect for the interaction of the supply chain and scalability of operations.Cook became known for his unconventional but very efficient approach to inventory management. He famously declared that ""inventory is fundamentally evil"" compared to spoiled milk products only worth something when they are fresh. His methods involved lean inventory, rapid product cycles, and just-in-time shipping. Prior to working at Apple, Cook was Compaq's Vice President of Corporate Materials for six months. Though brief, it reminded him he was the industry's top operating mind. Departures from Compaq to struggling Apple stunned peers one likened him to ""a fool"" but Cook was confident.When Cook became an Apple employee in 1998, the company was facing disaster, having only just recorded a $1 billion net loss. Morale was dismal, product planning was in disarray, and the company was generally regarded as a dying star in the technology sector. Cook was not offered a seat by Steve Jobs until persistent overtures by Apple recruiters. He was drawn to Jobs' vision and the potential to make a significant contribution. Hiring Cook as Senior Vice President of Worldwide Operations, Jobs rewarded him with a $400,000 salary and a $500,000 signing bonus—a big bet on an unproven executive at the time.Cook immediately began reengineering Apple's manufacturing and supply chain. Using the same principles of JIT manufacturing he had employed at IBM, Cook minimised inventory, shortened lead times for product shipments, and removed unnecessary waste. Inventory turnover at Apple fell from a few months to five days, releasing capital and allowing for faster product refreshment.During the first year that Cook was on board, Apple generated a $309 million profit and introduced a redesigned iMac. Not only were his practices frugal, but he set Apple up to grow exponentially after it had the blockbuster products of the iPhone and iPod on the market.\When Steve Jobs took medical leaves of absence in 2004 and 2009, Cook performed as acting CEO, overseeing product development cycles and business operations. These times were instrumental in re-scholearing him for full-time duty and cemented his position as Jobs' successor.On August 24, 2011, Jobs stepped down and appointed Cook as his successor as CEO. In his first company-wide memo, Cook was humble and dutiful:Under Cook, Apple experienced exponential financial growth:Cook expanded Apple's hardware lineup with the introduction of:Cook led Apple into digital services, significantly growing its revenue:He also guided the construction of Apple's initial content creation studio, which created award-nominated movies and expanded Apple's ecosystem into media.Unlike Jobs' visionary and dictatorial style, Cook is process-driven, analytical, and collaborative. He empowers cross-functional groups, insists on clear accountability, and insists on high standards without micromanaging. His style has stabilized and broadened the corporate culture. Cook opines that innovation arises from real caring and collaboration. This approach influences everything from product design to project management internally.","Timothy Donald Cook or Tim Cook was born on November 1, 1960, in Mobile, Alabama.

What US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy about the FAA’s current condition



""We do try to buy replacement parts on eBay for this really old equipment. Sometimes, we can't even buy it on eBay, so we're trying to use 3D printing to craft replacement parts for the system that we use.”

""The system we currently use, it truly is 25, 35, 40 years old in some places. We should've paid way more attention to it as a country. We've let it age, and now we're seeing the cracks of that age play out in real time for us,”

“the layoffs and voluntary buyouts … excluded safety positions.”

""We've been hiring air traffic controllers as quickly as we can,""

US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has informed lawmakers that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is purchasing replacement parts on eBay and using 3D printers to manufacture components for its ageing technology systems. This procurement strategy highlights the challenges facing the nation's air safety system, which is currently under review for its older technology and persistent staffing problems. Secretary Duffy disclosed these practices during a Senate hearing, which took place as the Donald Trump administration looks for a major three-year overhaul of the US air traffic control system . This proposed modernisation plan is estimated to cost ""lots of billions"" and would involve replacing hundreds of radars, constructing over a dozen new control towers, and implementing a new telecommunications system.Such an undertaking would likely require Congress to appropriate additional funds for the FAA. Last week, Duffy had stated on ""Meet The Press"" that the FAA has turned to eBay and 3D printing due to the unavailability of new parts for some of the agency's older systems.In the latest Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing, Duffy told members:Duffy added that although US air travel remains safe thanks to “multiple redundancies,” he admitted that the air traffic control system requires an overhaul.Duffy noted.Duffy also rejected claims that recent FAA job cuts jeopardised air safety, noting that while the agency laid off several hundred probationary staff and offered voluntary buyouts,He highlighted that no air traffic controllers were cut, despite concerns from a union that earlier reductions affected mechanics and specialists supporting controllers and inspectors.Duffy said to US lawmakers.The FAA's technological and staffing situations have drawn attention following recent air safety incidents and operational disruptions. These include a January collision between a commercial jet and a military helicopter near Reagan Washington National Airport that resulted in fatalities, and in recent weeks, the FAA facility near Newark Liberty International Airport has experienced staffing shortages and equipment outages, contributing to delays at the airport.","US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has told lawmakers that the FAA is using 3D printing to make replacement parts for its ageing technology systems.

Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-mark-zuckerberg-starts-his-day-without-coffee-know-about-facebook-founders-viral-rawdog-routine/articleshow/120843936.cms,"Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine

‘rawdog’ morning routine

Mark Zuckerberg follows the ‘Rawdog’ routine, know what it is

Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine key elements

1. No caffeine or external stimulants

Zuckerberg completely avoids caffeine in the mornings. While caffeine is widely used to combat fatigue and boost focus, he believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

This is in stark contrast to other tech leaders who often depend on multiple doses of caffeine throughout the day.

2. Intense physical activity: Brazilian jiu-jitsu and MMA

A central element of Zuckerberg’s morning is two hours of combat sports training, particularly Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA).

These are not light workouts. Zuckerberg actively engages in grappling and sparring, where split-second focus is essential.

He has stated that unlike running, which allows for mental wandering, jiu-jitsu requires full presence—a factor that helps him “recenter” and transition into work mode.

3. Mental presence and focus

The high-pressure nature of combat sports trains the brain to respond quickly under stress.

Zuckerberg uses these sessions to reset mentally, describing them as more effective than caffeine in waking up both the body and mind.

The risk of failure (being pinned or tapped out) keeps him focused, which in turn reduces stress from external sources.

4. Simplified lifestyle to reduce decision fatigue

Zuckerberg is known for his repetitive wardrobe—gray T-shirts, jeans, and sneakers. This choice is deliberate and helps him save cognitive effort for high-stakes decisions.

Reducing daily trivial choices aligns with psychological research indicating that decision fatigue can impair judgment over time.

5. High-protein diet and caloric intake

Why Zuckerberg chose this path: The influence of early education

How Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine powers executive performance

Enhanced cognitive function

Martial arts require constant anticipation, pattern recognition, and strategic thinking, which parallels the kind of problem-solving skills needed in high-level business decisions.

Stress management

Physical exertion is scientifically linked to lower cortisol levels and improved mood. Zuckerberg’s training acts as a buffer against the chronic stress of running a global tech company.

Improved executive functioning

The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue during the workday.

How Zuckerberg’s routine compared to Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, other tech leaders

Executive

Routine Element

Elon Musk

High caffeine intake, long work hours

Jack Dorsey

Fasting, meditation, cold plunges

Jeff Bezos

Prioritizes sleep, slow mornings

Tim Cook

Early rising with structured exercise



Scientific perspective on ‘Rawdog’ routines

Exercise improves executive functioning, especially activities that demand coordination and focus.

Caffeine-free mornings may lead to more stable energy levels, avoiding midday crashes associated with stimulant withdrawal.

Simplified routines reduce decision fatigue, as shown in studies on successful leaders and their minimalist approaches.

Routines are known to play a vital role in shaping the lives and productivity of high achievers across industries. Whether it’s elite athletes, creative professionals, or technology entrepreneurs, the way they start their day often sets the tone for how they approach challenges and decision-making. Among these successful individuals, Mark Zuckerberg—founder of Facebook and CEO of Meta—stands out not just for his innovations in the digital world but also for his unconventional personal discipline. His so-calledhas recently drawn public attention for its no-frills, stimulant-free approach to productivity and mental clarity.Unlike many of his peers in Silicon Valley who lean on coffee, energy drinks, or even mind-enhancing drugs to kick-start their day, Zuckerberg’s morning begins with no artificial aids. Instead, he embraces natural energy, physical intensity, and mental focus through a carefully structured regimen centered on Brazilian jiu-jitsu and minimalism. This article provides an in-depth, non-opinionated breakdown of Zuckerberg’s unique routine, detailing its structure, rationale, and implications for performance and mental resilience.The term ‘rawdog routine’, as used by Zuckerberg, refers to a lifestyle approach that entails confronting reality and the demands of the day without the aid of stimulants, drugs, or performance enhancers. The concept is based on the idea of beginning one’s day in a fully natural and present state. For Zuckerberg, this means no coffee, no cannabis, no nootropics, and no artificial substances that could alter his mental state. He has occasionally referred to drinking coffee recreationally while on vacation, but emphasizes that it is never a part of his regular workday schedule.This method, according to Zuckerberg, is about achieving mental clarity and physical readiness through discipline rather than chemical shortcuts. The only supplements he reportedly uses are creatine and vitamin D, both commonly accepted for muscle recovery and general health support.Zuckerberg’s rawdog morning routine is built on five foundational principles, all of which are designed to enhance productivity, reduce stress, and maintain mental sharpness.While Zuckerberg does not publicly share a specific meal plan, it is known that he consumes a high-protein diet, which is critical for recovery and energy post-training.Reports suggest his daily caloric intake may reach up to 4,000 calories, especially to meet the energy demands of intensive physical activity.Zuckerberg has cited his exposure to the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program in school as a formative influence behind his stance against drugs and stimulants. This early education helped shape his views on substance use and led to a personal policy of natural energy dependence, rather than chemical performance enhancements.Unlike other Silicon Valley executives who have publicly discussed experimenting with microdosing psychedelics or using smart drugs (nootropics), Zuckerberg maintains a more grounded, drug-free approach to focus and performance.Zuckerberg’s morning routine is not just a personal wellness strategy—it appears to have professional implications as well. Here’s how it aligns with executive performance demands:While Zuckerberg avoids all forms of chemical stimulation, other tech leaders have taken diverse approaches to optimizing performance:Zuckerberg’s ‘rawdog’ method is unique in its emphasis on no external stimulants, which sets it apart from the above figures.While no clinical studies have yet been conducted on Zuckerberg’s specific regimen, related research suggests:","Zuckerberg’s morning includes two hours of Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA) He believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

Microsoft becomes world's most-valuable company and its No 1 position also has 'Trump Tariff' message on Apple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-becomes-worlds-most-valuable-company-and-its-no-1-position-also-has-trump-tariff-message-on-apple/articleshow/120845348.cms,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella



Trump Tariff pains 'hurting' Apple

Microsoft has once again ascended to World's Most Valuable company, overtaking Apple. Software giant Microsoft has claimed the title of the world's most valuable company as the week concluded, boasting a market capitalization of $3.235 trillion. This milestone positions them ahead of Apple , which had long held the top spot, with the iPhone maker's market cap closing on Friday (May 2) at $3.07 trillion.Securing the third position is Nvidia , whose valuation stands at $2.76 trillion, as reported by The Information's newsletter.The surge in Microsoft's stock price on Thursday fueled this shift, following the release of robust financial results for the March quarter that surpassed analyst forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the sustained strong demand for the company's cloud services and artificial intelligence (AI) offerings during an investor call.Throughout the year, Microsoft's shares have consistently outpaced Apple's, signaling growing investor confidence in the tech giant's strategic focus on AI and cloud computing. Notably, this significant post-earnings stock jump for Microsoft echoes a similar event in October 2015, when the burgeoning Azure cloud business witnessed revenue more than double, propelling shares upward by 10%, according to Investopedia.While Apple also delivered better-than-expected first-quarter results, buoyed by strong iPhone sales , the company is facing headwinds from newly implemented tariffs under President Donald Trump.Apple's extensive reliance on imported components within its supply chain renders it particularly vulnerable to the impact of these tariffs. Consequently, its share price has experienced a significant 18% decline since the beginning of the year, marking one of the most substantial drops among major technology companies.Furthermore, CEO Tim Cook has indicated that Apple anticipates an additional $900 million in costs this quarter due to the tariffs, unless the current conditions change.According to Dow Jones Market Data, as reported by NewsMax, Apple's decrease in market value represents the largest for any company at the start of this year. Among the leading tech firms, only Tesla has witnessed a steeper year-to-date decline in its shares, falling by 29%.","Microsoft's market cap now stands at $3.235 trillion, overtaking Apple.

Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools

Google claims breakup ""impossible"" without serious consequences

The US Justice Department have asked a federal judge to break up Google's advertising technology business, marking the second government request within a year that could fundamentally reshape the $2 trillion giant. During a hearing in Virginia, DOJ lawyers outlined plans to force Google to divest key components of its online advertising system following Judge Leonie M. Brinkema's April ruling that Google illegally monopolized portions of the digital advertising market .""To leave Google with 90 percent of publishers beholden to them is, frankly, too dangerous,"" said Julia Tarver Wood, the government's lead attorney in the case. The hearing established September 22 as the date when both parties will present detailed arguments about remedies.The Justice Department's proposal specifically targets Google's ad exchange—the technology connecting buyers and sellers of online ad space—along with tools used by website publishers to sell advertising inventory. The government plan would initially make Google's auction code available to publishers and other ad tech companies, followed by requiring Google to fully divest publisher tools that handle functions like record keeping.This latest action follows a separate antitrust case in Washington where the DOJ is seeking to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser to address monopolistic behavior in the search market. If both requests are granted, it would represent the most significant government-mandated corporate restructuring since AT&T's breakup in the 1980s.Google's defense team strongly opposed the breakup proposal, arguing it fails to comply with legal precedent and would create significant problems. Karen Dunn, Google's lead attorney, called the plan ""very likely completely impossible"" without causing serious problems, noting few potential buyers exist for the technology besides ""enormous tech companies.""Google instead proposed changing certain business practices and opening its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers, while arguing that divesting these technologies would eliminate important security and privacy protections the company currently provides.Judge Brinkema ruled last month that Google had illegally monopolized both publisher tools and ad exchange software, though she dismissed claims related to advertiser tools. The business in question represents only a portion of Google's massive online advertising revenue, which funds its free services like Maps, Gmail, and search.","Government targets Google’s publisher and ad exchange tools.

With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise. The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120832553,imgsize-16782,width-400,resizemode-4/GTA-6-release-date-delayed.jpg"

CoreWeave stock soars over 20 percent after Nvidia’s $900 million stake revealed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/coreweave-stock-soars-over-20-percent-after-nvidias-900-million-stake-revealed/articleshow/121218021.cms,"

What triggered the massive jump in CoreWeave stocks



Nvidia's investment strategy



Why this matters in the AI race



What’s next for CoreWeave

Shares of CoreWeave, the AI cloud computing company, surged more than 20% on Thursday, closing at $80.11, after an SEC filing revealed that Nvidia holds a $900 million stake in the firm. The revelation has sent ripples across Wall Street, boosting investor confidence in CoreWeave’s long-term potential amid the intensifying AI infrastructure boom. The filing confirmed what industry watchers had long speculated: Nvidia, the AI chip leader, not only backed CoreWeave’s IPO but significantly increased its equity holding, signaling a strong bet on the cloud provider’s role in the next wave of AI development.The rally was sparked by an SEC filing released Thursday that revealed Nvidia's massive investment in CoreWeave. The disclosure showed that as of the end of March 2025, Nvidia owned 24.2 million shares of CoreWeave, then valued at $900 million. With CoreWeave’s stock up over 65% since its March IPO, Nvidia's stake is now estimated to be worth nearly $1.6 billion, giving the chip giant a significant upside.This latest jump comes just a day after CoreWeave reported 420% year-over-year revenue growth, surpassing analyst expectations and proving that the AI infrastructure demand continues to explode.Nvidia’s involvement with CoreWeave has been long in the making. The company played a crucial role in anchoring CoreWeave’s IPO, offering a $250 million order at $40 per share, when investor sentiment remained cautious due to a dry IPO market. CoreWeave ended up raising $1.5 billion during the offering.The relationship is strategic. CoreWeave rents out Nvidia’s high-powered GPUs to clients building AI models—essentially extending Nvidia’s reach deeper into the booming AI development space without building its own cloud service. CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator called Nvidia a “wonderful partner” and described their relationship as “symbiotic” during post-IPO interviews.The AI boom is being powered by enormous compute demands, and companies like CoreWeave are crucial players in making that power accessible. With Nvidia’s GPUs at the core of most large-scale AI training tasks, its partnership with CoreWeave is as much about securing distribution channels as it is about investment.By betting big on CoreWeave, Nvidia is diversifying its AI dominance, ensuring its chips are deployed across leading-edge cloud infrastructure tailored to AI workloads. This also provides Nvidia insulation from relying solely on major hyperscalers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.CoreWeave’s rapid growth—both in stock price and revenue—is drawing increasing attention from institutional investors. But with that growth comes heightened expectations. The company will need to prove it can sustain its expansion, scale operations efficiently, and maintain strong ties with Nvidia as competition in the AI cloud space intensifies.For now, though, the market has spoken: CoreWeave isn’t just another AI company—it’s a rising infrastructure heavyweight, backed by one of the most influential tech players in the world.","CoreWeave, the AI cloud computing company, surged more than 20% on Thursday, closing at $80.11.

“This combination will augment our ability to innovate and provide high-quality, competitively priced products, delivered with outstanding customer service, to millions of homes and businesses,”

Charter Communications and Cox Communications have announced their agreement to merge, with Charter set to acquire Cox in a transaction valued at $34.5 billion. Charter is widely recognised by its brand name, Spectrum and is a prominent television communications operator in the US. Under the proposed transaction, which already ranks as one of the year's most substantial ones, Charter will take over Cox’s commercial fibre operations along with its managed IT and cloud businesses . Meanwhile, Cox will contribute its residential cable business to Charter. In the merged entity, Cox will hold nearly 23% of the fully diluted shares of the merged company, the companies announced. Under the terms of the agreement, the combined entity will also take on Cox’s estimated $12 billion in outstanding debt.In a joint press release, both companies noted that the merger willCharter CEO Chris Winfrey said.This deal is set to close alongside the Liberty Broadband merger, with the combined company rebranding as Cox Communications within a year. Spectrum will be the consumer brand in Cox’s current markets. Winfrey will stay on as CEO, and the company will remain based in Stamford, while maintaining a strong presence in Atlanta.According to a report by Fast Company, the merger addresses the cable industry’s steep pay‑TV subscriber losses, which are driven by widespread “cord‑cutting” to streaming, by bolstering scale and focusing on broadband and mobile.Charter has shed hundreds of thousands of pay‑TV customers and, if approved, would add Cox’s six million subscribers, even as overall industry pay‑TV rolls are projected to fall from 67.7 million at end‑2024 to 51.5 million by 2028, the report adds. The deal now hinges on shareholder and regulatory approval, marking a significant test of antitrust scrutiny in the post‑Trump era.","Charter Communications and Cox Communications have announced their agreement to merge, with Charter set to acquire Cox in a transaction valued at $34.5 billion.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has praised on Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) startup DeepSeek’s flagship model, R1, saying that it is the first large language model (LLM) that he’s seen to rival OpenAI’s performance – essentially keeping it on a higher pedestal than Google’s Gemini and the one that powers Grok, the AI chatbot by Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI.“OpenAI has been so far ahead that no one's really come close,” Nadella told Bloomberg Businessweek.“DeepSeek, and R1 in particular, was the first model I’ve seen post some points,” he added.Microsoft began offering R1 through its Azure AI Foundry in January, alongside models from OpenAI, Meta and Mistral. Microsoft VP Asha Sharma said R1 underwent “rigorous red teaming and safety evaluations” before being made available, and emphasized that data processed through Azure would not be routed to DeepSeek’s servers in China.DeepSeek made waves earlier this year when it launched R1, impressing both the tech industry and investors. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the competition, calling R1 “an impressive model” and noting its strong performance at a lower cost. He added that DeepSeek’s emergence prompted OpenAI to accelerate some product releases.Even Google CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the ‘impressive work’ of DeepSeek's team Alphabet’s Q4 2024 earnings call.“I think [DeepSeek has] a tremendous team. I think they've done very, very good work,” Pichai said.R1’s popularity surged in January when its free chatbot app topped Apple’s US App Store, sparking concerns among investors about potential impacts on demand for AI hardware like Nvidia chips. DeepSeek’s ability to deliver high-quality models at a lower price triggered a sell-off in AI-related stocks.However, Ben Buchanan, a former AI advisor in the Biden administration, suggested the hype may be overstated.“DeepSeek’s engineers are extremely talented,” he said on The Ezra Klein Show, adding that their breakthroughs are largely in line with algorithmic efficiency work seen across the industry.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella praises DeepSeek's flagship model, R1.

Jamie Dimon defends Return to Office mandate



When JP Morgan CEO dismissed hybrid work practices

JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has once again defended the company’s return to office (RTO) mandate. In an interview with Bloomberg Television recently, Dimon said “I think our employees will be happier over time” He further added “And the younger people learn the right way, it is an apprenticeship system and you can't learn working from your basement.”JPMorgan, like many major companies, has pushed for a return to office after the pandemic, requiring most employees to work from the office several days a week. Speaking at JPMorgan's annual Global Markets Conference in Paris, Dimon said “""I completely applaud your right to not want to go to the office every day. But you're not going to tell JPMorgan what to do.""Dimon, a long-time critic of remote work, has been vocal about the need for in-person collaboration. In the past, he has argued that remote work affects productivity and hinders learning for junior staff.JPMorgan issued a five-day return-to-work mandate for most of its employees earlier this year. In his annual shareholder letter last year, he reflected on the company’s performance, acknowledging that while JPMorgan had seen strong growth over the last five years, it had also picked up some “bad habits.”“Working from home exacerbated the situation by hindering innovation, slowing decision-making, inhibiting information sharing, reducing efficiency, and creating more politics and bureaucracy,” he wrote.""Remote work eliminates much spontaneous learning and creativity because you don't run into people at the coffee machine, talk with clients in unplanned scenarios or travel to meet with customers and employees for feedback on your products and services,"" he wrote in an annual shareholder letter in 2021.In a leaked audio recording obtained by Business Insider, Dimon said, ""A lot of you were on the fu**ing Zoom and you were doing the following: looking at your mail, sending texts to each other about what an asshole the other person is, not paying attention, not reading your stuff.""Criticising hybrid models, he said in the leaked audio, ""Don't give me this s**t that work-from-home-Fridays works.

Low bonuses attributed to tough business environment

Infosys has reportedly rolled out performance bonus letters for all eligible employees. The bonus letters are for the first three months of 2025, which is the fourth quarter of FY2024-25. According to a report in Economic Times, much of the workforce sees the payout as being significantly lower than the previous one. According to a report, quoting sources, most eligible employees received 50% of their target amount for the quarter. While some got 70%, a few exceptional performers got higher percentages.In a brief internal communication, Infosys informed employees that it would release the bonus along with the salary for the month of May. Sources told the publication that such communication usually follows a generic email from the management about how it sees the business climate, the growth opportunities ahead, and a little praise for employees. But, in a break from the past, there was no such mail this time.A senior employee said that the lowest performance bonus that he received in his 10-year stint with Infosys was a 60% payout two years ago, but quarter one is even lower. He added that in good times, he had even received 100% of the eligible amount.Recently, during a conference call with a large delivery unit Infosys HR executives and managers informed employees about reduced bonus payouts. The company's senior executives reportedly assured the employees that it is a temporary downturn and the company will compensate the top performers with bonus recommendations with the next growth cycle. Top executives reportedly exhorted team members not to lose heart as this was a passing phase. In the conference bridge call, the management also reportedly acknowledged the extra hours and weekend work put in by employees.The lower bonus payout to Infosys employees is attributed to the rough patch the software services industry is passing through owing to tariff confusion, growth challenges and cautious client spends. During the bridge call, employees were told that the lower bonus payout this time was due to the drop in the company’s fourth-quarter profit. Last month, Infosys had reported an 11.7% year-on-year fall in net profit to Rs 7,033 crore.

Tim Cook seems to have run into a ""little problem"" with the US President Donald Trump , who wants Apple to expand iPhone manufacturing in America, not India. During a state visit to Qatar, Trump revealed his conversation with the Apple CEO: ""I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday. He is building all over India. I don't want you building in India.""The President claimed Cook agreed to increase US production, saying, ""I told Cook India can take care of themselves, they are doing very well,"" and as a result, Apple will be ""upping their production in the United States."" Although, it’s unclear whether Cook has actually committed to this shift in strategy, after he had said in the Q2 earnings call that all the iPhones sold in the US will be made in India.The confrontation represents the latest chapter in a long-running saga of presidential administrations pushing for Apple to manufacture domestically. Trump's first term saw similar pressure, with then-White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisting, ""He believes we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it."" Trump even suggested on his Truth Social network that ""This is a great time to move your company into the US, like Apple, and so many others, in record numbers, are doing.""But shifting iPhone manufacturing from Asia to America isn't as simple as a presidential directive, or a $500 million pledge from Apple. The complex reality of global supply chains, labor markets, and manufacturing capabilities makes Trump's demand extraordinarily difficult to fulfill in the near term.Trump isn't the first president to push Apple toward domestic manufacturing. In 2011, President Barack Obama asked Steve Jobs during a Silicon Valley dinner, ""What would it take to make iPhones in the United States?""Jobs's response was blunt: ""Those jobs aren't coming back.""The late Apple founder explained that the company employed 700,000 factory workers in China because it needed 30,000 engineers on-site to support those operations. ""You can't find that many in America to hire,"" Jobs told Obama, according to Walter Isaacson's biography.Current CEO Tim Cook echoed this sentiment in 2017, telling Fortune magazine that Apple's reliance on countries like China wasn't primarily about cheap labor.""The reason is because of the skill and the quantity of skill in one location, and the type of skill,"" Cook said. ""In the US you could have a meeting of tooling engineers, and I'm not sure we could fill the room. In China you could fill multiple football fields.""This skills gap hasn't narrowed significantly in the years since. Manufacturing expertise is developed over decades, not months, and the US has been losing this institutional knowledge for generations as production moved overseas. The specialized tooling required for precision iPhone assembly represents a formidable barrier to entry that tariffs alone cannot overcome. As Priyank Kharge, the former information technology minister of Karnataka, observed while successfully wooing Apple to his region: ""You need a rich talent pool that's already trained in electronics manufacturing, which takes years to develop.""A former Apple executive shared a story, more than a decade ago, that illustrates the manufacturing capabilities gap. When a last-minute design change required modifications to the iPhone's screen, a Chinese factory responded with remarkable speed.Around midnight, a foreman ""roused 8,000 workers inside the company's dormitories,"" the executive recounted. ""Each employee was given a biscuit and a cup of tea, guided to a workstation and within half an hour started a 12-hour shift fitting glass screens into beveled frames. Within 96 hours, the plant was producing more than 10,000 iPhones a day.""""The speed and flexibility is breathtaking,"" the executive told the New York Times, in 2012. ""There's no American plant that can match that.""This manufacturing agility isn't simply a matter of labor costs or availability. It reflects a deeply integrated ecosystem where proximity matters tremendously. The Financial Times analysis of Apple's supply chain found that ""The close proximity of suppliers and manufacturers is crucial to Apple's productivity.""As Andy Tsay, professor of information systems at Santa Clara University's Leavey Business School, explains: ""There are a lot of advantages to co-locating the activities in the supply chain, in terms of speed and quality of communication and innovation in the product and process design."" When components must travel across oceans rather than across town, the entire manufacturing process becomes more cumbersome and less responsive to sudden changes.Matthew Moore, a former Apple manufacturing engineer, put the scale in stark perspective: ""What city in America is going to put everything down and build only iPhones? Because there are millions of people employed by the Apple supply chain in China,"" he told Bloomberg. ""Boston is over 500,000 people. The whole city would need to stop everything and start assembling iPhones.""Beyond the physical infrastructure, there's also a mismatch between Trump's manufacturing vision and American workforce preferences.A 2024 survey by the Cato Institute and YouGov found that while 80% of Americans believe the country would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, only 25% wanted such jobs for themselves.The gap between American and Asian workplace expectations also presents challenges. A deeply reported piece on TSMC's new semiconductor plant in Arizona by The Verge found significant cultural differences.""The American engineers complained of rigid, counterproductive hierarchies at the company; Taiwanese TSMC veterans described their American counterparts as lacking the kind of dedication and obedience they believe to be the foundation of their company's world-leading success,"" the article reported.Even with substantial government incentives, similar experiments have failed before. When Motorola tried to manufacture smartphones in Fort Worth, Texas in 2013, the factory closed within a year due to high costs and disappointing sales. The same structural challenges that doomed that effort remain largely unchanged today.In contrast, India offers a young, abundant, and increasingly skilled workforce that views electronics manufacturing as a path to upward mobility. Government-backed skilling programs and industry partnerships have helped create a talent pool that is both cost-competitive and eager for factory jobs, something that aligns far better with Apple’s operational needs than the current American labor landscape.Trump’s Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick , suggests that the people problem could be solved with robots, and that’s not him but he says Cook himself has said so. In a CNBC interview, he revealed a conversation with Cook about bringing iPhone manufacturing to America.""I talked to Tim Cook the other day and said, 'When are you going to bring the iPhone manufacturing here?'"" Lutnick said. ""He said, 'I need to have the robotic arms to do it at a scale and precision that would allow me to bring it here.'""Lutnick framed the potential shift as part of what he calls the ""AI industrial revolution,"" suggesting Americans would work as high-paid technicians rather than assembly workers. ""Americans are going to work in factories just like this in great high-paying jobs. They're going to be trained as technicians... They're not going to be the ones screwing components in.""But automation presents its own challenges. The iPhone's design, which uses numerous tiny screws rather than glue for assembly, currently makes human assembly more cost-effective than robotic solutions. The technology required for fully automated iPhone assembly at scale doesn't yet exist, and developing it would require significant investment with uncertain returns. Each iPhone contains approximately 74 tiny screws of various types, and automating their precise placement would be a monumental engineering challenge.The argument is not just about skilled labor but also about the intricate supply chain ecosystem that has evolved in Asia. An iPhone consists of roughly 2,700 different parts sourced from 187 suppliers across 28 countries, according to Financial Times research. Less than 5% of iPhone components are currently made in the US, including glass casing, the lasers that enable Face ID, and some chips.China is responsible for manufacturing the majority of remaining components, but most high-tech parts are produced in Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan.There's also the matter of rare earth elements, which are essential for smartphone production. Components like the iPhone's battery, which uses lanthanum to extend its life, and the screen, which requires dysprosium to enhance colors, rely on materials that China processes in overwhelming quantities.According to the US Geological Survey, America imports 70% of its rare earth compounds from China, giving Beijing significant leverage in any manufacturing shift. China has already placed export restrictions on some rare earths in response to Trump's tariffs, potentially complicating any US manufacturing plans.Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, told CNN that US-made iPhones could cost around $3,500, more than triple the current ~$1,000 price tag, due to the necessity of replicating Asia's complex production ecosystem.""You build that (supply chain) in the US with a fab in West Virginia and New Jersey. They'll be $3,500 iPhones,"" Ives said. He estimated it would cost Apple approximately $30 billion and three years to relocate just 10% of their supply chain to the USThe economic calculus becomes even more challenging when considering the scale of Apple's operations. The company ships more than 230 million iPhones annually, roughly equivalent to producing 438 devices every minute. Building a US manufacturing base capable of matching this output would require not just factories, but entire new industrial ecosystems. As the Motorola example demonstrated, building a factory without the supporting supply chain infrastructure is a recipe for failure.Morgan Stanley analysts projected ""several billions"" in costs for Apple to shift even a portion of iPhone production to America, making domestic manufacturing financially prohibitive compared to simply paying new tariffs, and these new tariffs, if remain same as now, would add $900 million to Apple’s costs.While the prices wouldn't skyrocket to $3,500, a price hike is being discussed at Apple for the forthcoming iPhone 17 lineup, per WSJ, due later this year.Rather than shifting to the US, and this is what Trump’s little problem is, Apple has been methodically building its Indian manufacturing presence for years, beginning with older iPhone models in 2017 and gradually expanding to include the latest models. This shift accelerated after COVID-19 disrupted Chinese operations and as US-China tensions grew. Apple now produces its entire iPhone lineup in India, including premium titanium Pro models. Now, Apple will be manufacturing most of the iPhones that were to be sold in the US this quarter in India.India’s broader supply chain remains underdeveloped compared to China, but it is catching up: in FY24, Apple suppliers in India manufactured roughly $14 billion of iPhones—about 14 percent of the global total—and the country exported $12.8 billion worth of devices in 2024, marking a 42 percent year‑on‑year rise and accounting for nearly 16–17 percent of Apple’s annual output, with projections to exceed 35 percent by 2026–27.Component makers such as Murata Manufacturing are considering relocating capacitor packaging and distribution to India by fiscal 2026, and Apple has actively encouraged battery suppliers like Desay and Simplo to establish local facilities—underscoring efforts to localize parts beyond mere assembly. Yet India still relies heavily on imports for rare earth elements and lacks the dense, co‑located tooling and precision‑machining ecosystem of China, meaning full supply‑chain parity remains a longer‑term endeavorBut, while the US struggles with scale, and China remains dominant, India is rapidly emerging as the only viable challenger to China’s manufacturing prowess. With major investments pouring in from Apple’s key suppliers like Foxconn, Pegatron, and Wistron (now acquired by Tata), the country is seeing a surge in high-tech factory construction, workforce training, and supply chain localization.Tata Electronics, for example, is setting up a large iPhone assembly plant in Hosur, and Foxconn has committed billions to expand its facilities in Tamil Nadu and Telangana. India may not yet match China’s scale or speed, but it's quickly building the capacity and ecosystem required for world-class electronics manufacturing, something no other country has done at this pace or scale in recent years.Apple's Indian strategy is already paying dividends. In early 2025, recognizing the looming threat of Trump's tariffs, the company took extraordinary measures to increase its Indian production. As Reuters reported, Apple chartered cargo flights to ferry 600 tons of iPhones, approximately 1.5 million devices, to the United States from India in an effort to beat the tariff implementation deadline. The company even secured a ""green corridor"" arrangement at Chennai airport, reducing customs clearance time from 30 hours to just six hours, mirroring a similar arrangement it has in China.The economic advantages of this approach are significant. While Trump's China tariffs reached 125% (although, now it’s been lowered to at least 30%), imports from India faced only a 26% tariff, which has now been paused for 90 days. Bank of America analysts estimate that prior to the tariff announcements, Apple was on pace to produce about 25 million iPhones in India this year, potentially meeting approximately 50% of American demand. Now it’s going to serve about 100% of demand from India.Despite Trump's public pressure, Indian officials remain confident in Apple's commitment. ""There is no change in Apple's investment plans in India,"" a government source told CNBC-TV18, adding that the company has ""assured the Indian government"" of its continued commitment.Rajoo Goel, Secretary General of the Electronic Industries Association of India, characterized Trump's comments as ""just a statement"" and expressed optimism that the US President ""might change his stance,"" in a discussion with CNBC TV18, after Trump’s comments.The reality is that Apple's supply chain decisions are driven by complex business considerations that extend beyond political pressure. For a company that earned approximately $400 in profit margins (about 36%) on each iPhone 16 Pro, dramatically increasing manufacturing costs could devastate its business model. Meanwhile, India, thanks to its rapidly scaled electronics‐manufacturing ecosystem, is today Apple’s only real large‑scale alternative to China, making it the go‑to diversification hub for the foreseeable future.Whether Apple will navigate these conflicting pressures by attempting some symbolic US manufacturing or doubling down on its India strategy remains to be seen. But the structural challenges that Steve Jobs identified over a decade ago haven't disappeared, making Trump's ""little problem"" with Apple a bigger manufacturing dilemma than a presidential directive can easily solve.","Donald Trump wants Apple to expand iPhone manufacturing in America, not India.

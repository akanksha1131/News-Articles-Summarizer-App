""Flipkart’s Big Billion Days (BBD) sale recorded double-digit growth in revenue and customer base, with same-day delivery volumes growing 2.5 times,"" said John David Rainey, chief financial officer of parent Walmart.Flipkart's annual BBD or Diwali sale started late September and continued through October. In an investor presentation for the third quarter ended October, Walmart CFO said that Flipkart’s robust sales performance significantly boosted Walmart’s international net sales, which grew 8% year-on-year (YoY) to $30.3 billion.Flipkart also reportedly contributed to a 43% rise in Walmart’s international ecommerce sales.The Walmart executives also had a word of caution on Flipkart. ""While the festive season sales helped Walmart’s sales in Q3, there may be an adverse impact on Q4 sales,"" said Walmart CFO in the post-earnings call. Industry data suggests that e-commerce platforms, including Flipkart, achieved nearly $11.9 billion in total sales during the month-long festive season, a substantial increase from the previous year.The US retailer said that its advertising revenue grew 50%, driven by Flipkart’s ad business.

WhatsApp's 'free message' to businesses

The Rs 2500 crore market and growing

WhatsApp has made customer service messaging free for businesses on its platform, making it the cheapest channel for enterprise communication. This move aims to enhance AI chatbot interactions and increase its market share in India, which is currently dominated by traditional SMS. WhatsApp's new pricing model aims to further tap into India's enterprise messaging market that is worth around Rs 2,500 crore, with traditional SMS holding about 90% of the volume share at 55-60 billion texts per month, according to industry estimates. WhatsApp reportedly holds a 30% value share.Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), the body that represents India’s top three telecom companies -- Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone-Idea. In a letter to the telecom ministry, COAI has accused global technology giants, such as Microsoft and Amazon, of ""presumably circumventing and bypassing the legal telecom route"" by using WhatsApp to send enterprise messages to customers. The letter claimed that this caused a likely Rs 3,000-crore annual revenue loss to both the Centre and the service providers.To tackle WhatsApp, Google introduced an alternative mobile phone messaging system within the country, aimed at disrupting WhatsApp’s stronghold among enterprises for customer communication. Vodafone Idea (Vi) recently took the lead by partnering with Google to offer Rich Communication Service (RCS) messaging to Indian enterprise customers. Industry insiders have predicted that Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel are likely to soon follow suit.Incidentally, this is the second rate cut announced by WhatsApp in six months. In August, WhatsApp reduced its prices for business messaging by 16-97% in various global markets to tackle growing competition from Google’s RCS and Apple’s upcoming entry into the segment. The price cut was 63% in India, according to a June announcement.""Effective November 1, 2024 — We are making service conversations free,"" Meta, the owner of WhatsApp, announced on its website. Previously, service messages on WhatsApp—such as customer queries on order status or flight ticket rescheduling—were charged at Rs 0.25 per message in India. In comparison, SMS costs between Rs 0.12-0.15, and Google’s RCS (rich communication services) is priced at Rs 0.20-0.25.""We occasionally make adjustments to our offerings to better reflect the ways in which the service is used and the types of information people are choosing to receive,” a WhatsApp spokesperson told Economic Times.So far, despite price cuts, WhatsApp has not been able to significantly increase its volume market share. The reason is partly due to regulations that require banks and government departments to use SMS for all transactional messages. But this may change as starting in April 2025, WhatsApp will also make utility messages (account updates, transaction alerts) free, which could significantly impact SMS, where 80% of the volumes currently fall into the utility category.The enterprise messaging market, valued at just under Rs 2,500 crore as of March 31, 2023, is poised for further growth. As businesses increasingly rely on digital payments and e-commerce, the pie continues to expand.","WhatsApp has made customer service messaging free for businesses on its platform.

Google Research India chief disagrees with Nilekani on what India should do in AI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-research-india-chief-disagrees-with-nilekani-on-what-india-should-do-in-ai/articleshow/115498876.cms,"Bengaluru: Manish Gupta, in-charge of Google Research in India, on Tuesday said that he respectfully disagrees with Nandan Nilekani’s advice to India on prioritising use case building over and above building foundational models in the area of artificial intelligence (AI).“I respectfully disagree. He is absolutely wrong. He is not preaching what he has practised. He revolutionised India’s technology landscape by starting with the basics. With Aadhaar, he did not start with use cases, he started with building foundations. We too must, using our constraints as ingredients for innovation,” Gupta said. He was speaking at a panel at the Bengaluru Tech Summit.In October this year, Nilekani had advised Indian AI companies to develop practical applications instead of competing in the field of building new large language models (LLM) and let the US build them.The chairman and co-founder of Infosys, speaking at Meta's Build with AI summit in Bengaluru, had said, ""Our goal should not be to build one more LLM. Let the big boys in the (Silicon) Valley do it, spending billions of dollars… How do we create the infrastructure for collecting the right data and make India the use case capital of AI globally where we actually deploy, add scale and speed in a frugal manner. Let other people build LLMs, we will make sure it works for people.”The debate around whether India’s ability and focus to build indigenous LLMs emerged in June 2023, when OpenAI founder Sam Altman was asked for inputs on how one could start to create something like OpenAI and ChatGPT in India.Also in the panel, titled, AI: Reality Vs Hype, was OpenAI’s public policy and partnerships lead for India, Pragya Misra, who got appointed to the role in April this year. She is the first and the only employee of the ChatGPT maker.“AI is used at a personal life level, at a society level and a national level. There is also another geopolitical level, which is very critical now, especially given where India is on its journey. With the IndiaAI Mission, we have a clear path to move ahead. OpenAI’s contribution is also very clear, we want to build our tools and models with India, for India and for the world,” Misra told the audience at the panel.","Manish Gupta, in-charge of Google Research in India, disagrees with Nandan Nilekani’s advice to India on prioritising use case building over and above building foundational models.

Delhi air pollution: Air purifier buying guide - Don't make these 10 big mistakes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/delhi-air-pollution-air-purifier-buying-guide-dont-make-these-10-big-mistakes/articleshow/115482587.cms,"Disclaimer: This is an AI-generated image

Getting the size wrong and ignoring room dimensions

Falling for marketing gimmicks and HEPA-like claims

Overlooking technical specifications and CADR ratings

Underestimating long-term costs and maintenance

Poor placement and setup mistakes

FAQs: Air purifier buying guide

Do I need to run my air purifier 24/7?



How do I know when to replace the filters?

HEPA filters: Replace every 6-12 months

Replace every 6-12 months Carbon filters: Replace every 3-4 months

Replace every 3-4 months Pre-filters: Clean monthly and replace every 6 months However, if you live in a highly polluted area or have pets, you might need to replace filters more frequently.

Can one air purifier clean my entire home?

Will an air purifier help with allergies and asthma?

Do air purifiers remove smoke and cooking odours?

What's the difference between ""True HEPA"" and ""HEPA-type"" filters?

As Delhi-NCR battles dangerous air quality levels with AQI crossing 450, air purifiers have shifted from luxury to necessity. In the capital region's fight against toxic air, these devices offer a crucial defense for indoor spaces. However, the urgency to protect family health often leads to rushed purchases and expensive mistakes.Before you invest in an air purifier , it's essential to understand what makes these devices effective. From choosing the right size to understanding filtration technology, several factors determine whether your purchase will actually clean your air or just clean out your wallet. Here are the critical mistakes to avoid while buying an air purifier.The most common mistake someone could make is choosing an air purifier without considering room size. In the rush to combat pollution , many buyers pick units that are either too small to effectively clean their space or unnecessarily large for their rooms. A small unit will struggle continuously and never achieve optimal air quality, while an oversized one wastes energy and money. Before purchasing, measure your room's square footage and match it with the purifier's coverage area. For Delhi's heavily polluted air, experts recommend choosing a purifier rated for a slightly larger area than your actual room size to ensure effective cleaning.In Delhi's competitive air purifier market, many brands use clever marketing terms like ""HEPA-type"" or ""HEPA-style"" filters. These terms are red flags – they indicate filters that don't meet true HEPA standards and can't effectively combat Delhi's dangerous PM2.5 pollutants. True HEPA filters, certified to remove 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns, are essential for Delhi's pollution levels. Don't compromise on this feature, even if it means paying a bit more.Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) is crucial, yet often ignored in favor of brand names or attractive features. In Delhi's severe pollution, a higher CADR rating is essential for rapid air cleaning. Look for models with CADR ratings above 200 m³/hour for medium-sized rooms. Remember, Delhi's air quality can deteriorate rapidly, and your purifier needs sufficient power to respond effectively.Many Delhi residents focus solely on the purchase price, forgetting the significant running costs of air purifiers. Factor in regular filter replacements (especially frequent during peak pollution months), electricity consumption, and maintenance costs. Calculate the total cost of ownership over at least two years, including peak pollution season requirements. Some cheaper models actually cost more in the long run due to frequent filter replacements and higher energy consumption.Even the most expensive air purifier won't perform effectively if poorly placed. Avoid tucking units into corners or behind furniture. Proper placement is critical - keep the purifier at least 2 feet away from walls, away from furniture obstacles, and in rooms where you spend most time. For Delhi homes, consider placing units near but not directly under air conditioning vents, as this helps with air circulation while avoiding direct interference with the purifier's airflow.Given Delhi's pollution levels, your air purifier needs to run continuously. Many buyers overlook noise ratings, leading to disturbed sleep and everyday discomfort. Look for units that operate below 50 decibels on normal settings, and ensure they have a quiet night mode. Test different speed settings before buying, as you'll be living with this sound around the clock during pollution seasons.Delhi's air contains a complex mix of pollutants - from PM2.5 to gases, smoke, and seasonal allergies. Single-filter systems often prove inadequate. Look for purifiers with multiple filtration stages: a pre-filter for larger particles, True HEPA filter for fine particles, and activated carbon for gases and odours. Some advanced models also offer anti-bacterial treatment, particularly useful during Delhi's smog seasons.Without real-time monitoring, you can't gauge your purifier's effectiveness as Delhi's air quality fluctuates. Choose models with PM2.5 indicators, air quality monitoring, and auto-mode functionality. Smart connectivity features, while not essential, can help you track air quality trends and adjust settings remotely.Many users continue using expired filters, severely compromising air purification. Delhi's high pollution levels mean filters may need more frequent replacement than manufacturer standards suggest. Keep track of filter life, maintain a replacement schedule, and clean pre-filters regularly. Consider keeping spare filters during peak pollution seasons when demands on the purifier are highest.Either choosing the cheapest option or assuming the most expensive model is best - both are mistakes common during Delhi's pollution emergencies. Set a realistic budget between ₹8,500 to ₹65,000, but focus on getting the right features for your specific needs. Consider the manufacturer's service network in Delhi-NCR, warranty terms, and verified user reviews from local users who understand the unique challenges of Delhi's air quality.Remember, an air purifier is a crucial health investment in Delhi's battle against air pollution. Take time to research and choose the right model rather than making panic purchases during severe pollution episodes. Combine your air purifier with proper room sealing, regular maintenance, and other protective measures for the best results in Delhi's challenging air quality conditions.For optimal air quality, yes. Air purifiers work best when operated continuously, as indoor air is constantly being contaminated by new particles. However, you can run them at lower speeds during quiet hours to reduce noise and energy consumption. Modern units are designed for continuous operation and typically consume minimal electricity - about 1/40th of what an air conditioner uses.Most modern air purifiers come with filter replacement indicators that light up when filters need changing. As a general rule:No, air purifiers are most effective in single, closed rooms. Their effectiveness decreases significantly in open floor plans or when trying to purify multiple rooms. For best results, place air purifiers in rooms where you spend the most time (like bedrooms and living rooms) and consider multiple units for larger homes.Yes, air purifiers with True HEPA filters can significantly help allergy and asthma sufferers by removing common triggers like pollen, pet dander, dust mites, and other airborne allergens. However, they should be used as part of a comprehensive approach that includes regular cleaning and controlling allergen sources.Air purifiers with both HEPA and activated carbon filters can effectively remove smoke particles and cooking odours. The HEPA filter captures the smoke particles, while the activated carbon filter absorbs odours and gases. However, for best results with strong cooking odours, ventilation (like range hoods or open windows) should be used in combination with air purifiers.True HEPA filters are certified to remove 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns, following strict testing standards. ""HEPA-type"" or ""HEPA-like"" filters are marketing terms for filters that don't meet these certification standards and may be significantly less effective. Always look for ""True HEPA"" certification when choosing an air purifier for the best performance.","Delhi-NCR battles dangerous air quality levels with AQI crossing 450.

Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy recalls when his daughter asked him to “hire a private plane…”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/infosys-co-founder-narayan-muthy-recalls-when-his-daughter-asked-him-to-hire-a-private-plane/articleshow/115136884.cms,"Narayana Murthy’s daughter calls him to “hire a private plane..”

Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, and his wife, Sudha Murthy, recently shared some insights from their lives. The couple were the star guests on the popular talk show The Great Indian Kapil Sharma Show where they delighted the audience with candid, humorous stories from their personal lives.One of the show’s highlights was Narayana Murthy’s funny confession about forgetting their 25th wedding anniversary. He recalled, “One morning, Sudha asked me, ‘Is there anything special today?’ I replied, ‘No, nothing,’ and went to the office. As I was getting in the car, she asked again, ‘Think of anything special today?’ I still didn’t realize.”Later that day, while heading to Mumbai, Murthy received a call from their daughter, Akshata Murty, who was studying at Stanford University at the time. This is how the conversation went:“She asked, ‘What are you doing?’ I told her I was catching a flight. She immediately said, ‘Cancel it, get the first flight back to Bangalore, and wish your wife a happy anniversary!’”Narayana Murthy shared that he told her about a speech at 3pm but Akshata insisted, “I don’t care if you have a speech at 3 pm. If you need to hire a private plane, hire it, but come back and wish her!” Their daughter, Akshata Murty, is now married to former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.Sudha Murthy also chimed in, laughing, “It was our 25th wedding anniversary so it doesn’t happen every year. So I thought, let me give him a cue but it did not work… For five-ten minutes I felt bad because I’m also human. But my daughter was very upset, she went ‘In America this never happens!’, but I went ‘India main it happens though’, who can remember these things??”","Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, and his wife, Sudha, recently shared some insights from their lives.

Ford has confirmed a data breach. Hackers have reportedly leaked the data of thousands of customers of the US-based car maker. According to a report by Bleeping Computer, a hacker known as ""EnergyWeaponUser"" has claimed that records of 44,000 customers have been uploaded on a hacking forum.The report also claims that another hacker, “IntelBroker,” may be involved in the attack.In a statement to Bleeping Computer, a Ford spokesperson said: “Ford’s investigation has determined that there was no breach of Ford’s systems or customer data. The matter involved a third-party supplier and a small batch of publicly available dealers’ business addresses. It is our understanding that the matter has now been resolved.”Ford customers may be at risk following data breach as the hacker exposed personal information on a hacking forum.As per the report, the leaked data includes names, addresses, purchase details, and dealer information. While not highly sensitive, this information could be used for phishing scams and social engineering attacks.The data was reportedly offered to members of the hacker forum for a nominal fee of $2, suggesting the intent may be to cause disruption rather than financial gain.The alleged involvement of ""IntelBroker,"" a hacker with a recent history of successful breaches at major companies like Cisco and Nokia, adds credibility to the leak, the report adds.Ford is further investigating the claims. Meanwhile, customers are advised to avoid suspicious communications and sharing personal information.","Ford customers may be at risk following data breach as the hacker exposed personal information on a hacking forum.

What 'upset' Google said on reports that justice department may ask the company to sell Chrome: Agenda goes beyond legal ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-upset-google-said-on-reports-that-justice-department-may-ask-the-company-to-sell-chrome-agenda-goes-beyond-legal-/articleshow/115491313.cms,"Time for DoJ remedies for Google

Google seems appears quite upset with the reports that the US Department of Justice (DoJ) may ask the company to sell its Chrome business. And may be rightly so. For Chrome is not only one of the most popular Google product but also the world's most-popular web browser with 66%-plus market share.According to a report in BBC, Google's Vice President, Global Head of Regulatory Affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland in a statement, ""The DOJ continues to push a radical agenda that goes far beyond the legal issues in this case.""""The government putting its thumb on the scale in these ways would harm consumers, developers and American technological leadership at precisely the moment it is most needed,” Ms Mulholland reportedly added.In August this year, DoJ won a landmark ruling against Google that termed the company of running an illegal monopoly in online search and related advertising. Now DOJ judge Amit Mehta is reportedly set to propose sweeping remedies for Google, including the potential divestment of its Chrome browser. This move comes after prosecutors explored a range of options, from ending exclusive deals with device manufacturers to breaking up parts of its business.Google has vehemently opposed these proposals, arguing they would harm consumers and hinder U.S. competitiveness in AI. However, the ultimate impact on the case could hinge on the political landscape. While the former president expressed interest in prosecuting Google for perceived bias, recent statements have cast doubt on the wisdom of breaking it up.As the case unfolds, Google is set to propose its own remedies in December. The final ruling, expected by August 2025, will likely shape the future of the tech giant and the broader digital industry.Mehta has scheduled a trial on the proposals for April. Whether Trump and the DOJ's next antitrust head will step in and change course in the case before then remains to be seen.","US Department of Justice (DoJ) may ask the company to sell its Chrome business.

Public access through Google Maps integration

Cities working with Google report air quality improvements

Google launched Air View+, an artificial intelligence-driven air quality monitoring system across India, enabling citizens and government authorities to access real-time pollution data through Google Maps .The system deploys a network of sensors measuring critical pollutants including PM2.5, PM10, CO2, NO2, Ozone, and VOCs at one-minute intervals. Climate tech firms Aurassure and Respirer Living Sciences have installed these sensors at strategic locations such as administrative buildings, commercial centres, and utility poles to maximise population coverage.The project brings together multiple stakeholders, including researchers from IIT Delhi and IIT Hyderabad, state pollution boards, and climate action groups like CSTEP, who validate and calibrate the sensor network. This collaborative approach ensures data accuracy and reliability while building a sustainable ecosystem for environmental monitoring.The new feature allows anyone with Google Maps to access hyperlocal air quality information. Users can view pollution levels by selecting the Air Quality layer or checking the Weather widget on the Explore tab. The system employs a sophisticated AI model that combines multiple data sources, including sensor readings, government data, satellite imagery, weather patterns, and traffic conditions.Google's AI customises the data presentation to align with India's National Air Quality Index (NAQI) methodology and categorization, making it easily interpretable for local users.Early pilot programs have shown promising results. Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar reported a 50 percent improvement in winter air quality over three years. ""Our ambitious goal is to eliminate pollution hotspots within the next five years,” said Mr. G. Sreekanth, Municipal Commissioner of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar.In Chennai, the industrial area of Manali Village recorded a dramatic decrease in PM2.5 levels, falling from 105 µg/m³ in 2019 to 72 µg/m³ in 2024.Municipal authorities are leveraging the data to develop customised air quality dashboards and identify pollution hotspots. Navi Mumbai has already responded with aggressive environmental initiatives, including planting 300,000 trees and transitioning its public transport to electric and CNG vehicles.","Google launches Air View+, an artificial intelligence-driven air quality monitoring system across India.

Cybersecurity dominate IT investment priorities: Skillsoft report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/cybersecurity-dominate-it-investment-priorities-skillsoft-report/articleshow/115487527.cms,"The race to stay ahead in technology has brought skills gaps to the forefront, with artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity emerging as top investment priorities for IT leaders in 2025. Skillsoft’s newly released 2024 IT Skills and Salary Report highlights the challenges and strategies shaping the future of tech talent, based on responses from over 5,100 global IT decision-makers and professionals.The report underscores a troubling paradox: while AI and machine learning (ML) dominate investment plans, these are also the areas where IT teams are least equipped. Only 34% of decision-makers rated their team’s AI/ML skills as proficient, reflecting a growing skills deficit in one of the most sought-after areas of expertise.“AI is now integral to business operations, but the speed of adoption has outpaced the availability of trained professionals,” said Orla Daly, Chief Information Officer at Skillsoft. “Organizations must prioritize targeted training to bridge this gap and ensure long-term success.”Cybersecurity and AI Skills in High DemandCybersecurity, another critical area, ranks second on IT leaders’ investment list, with 42% of decision-makers focusing on this domain. However, 38% report difficulty in hiring cybersecurity talent, making it the most challenging area for recruitment.These skill shortages come with tangible risks. According to the report, unaddressed skill gaps increase stress on existing teams (54%), delay project timelines (42%), and hinder business objectives (37%).Upskilling: The Preferred SolutionTo combat these challenges, 72% of IT leaders plan to upskill and reskill their existing workforce, with training seen as a cost-effective and morale-boosting solution.“Training employees is not just about bridging skill gaps; it’s about enhancing team morale and retaining talent,” said Daly. Nearly 60% of leaders reported improved morale, while 55% saw increased innovation as a result of skilling initiatives.Certifications are also a key part of this strategy, with 97% of IT leaders recognizing their value. Certified employees are credited with improving productivity (48%), solving issues faster (49%), and bringing an estimated $25,000 in annual added value to organizations.Blended Learning Takes Center StageWhen it comes to training, a blended approach combining in-person and online sessions is emerging as the most effective. IT professionals highlighted the need for customized training methods to address varied skill levels and learning preferences.This is particularly important for leadership development, which is gaining traction. Over a quarter of organizations plan to invest in leadership training in 2025, focusing on skills such as communication, problem-solving, and critical thinking.Job Satisfaction and Retention ChallengesDespite growing investments in skill-building, retaining talent remains a challenge. While 25% of IT professionals reported high job satisfaction, 61% are still likely to explore new opportunities in the coming year. Their top reasons include seeking better compensation (43%), access to training opportunities (35%), and flexible work arrangements (35%).Organizations that prioritize continuous learning not only close skill gaps but also improve employee satisfaction and engagement, the report found.The Road AheadWith rapid technological advancements and persistent talent shortages, Skillsoft’s report paints a clear picture of the IT industry’s future. Investments in AI, cybersecurity, and leadership development will be critical for businesses looking to thrive in 2025.",Artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity emerging as top investment priorities for IT leaders in 2025.

How Salesforce layoffs at Israeli cloud company it acquired recently signals a major 'shift' in strategy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-salesforce-layoffs-at-israeli-cloud-company-it-acquired-recently-signals-a-major-shift-in-strategy/articleshow/115483812.cms,"How Salesforce job cuts signal a 'change' at the company

Salesforce is reportedly planning to cut jobs at Own, the Israeli cloud backup company it acquired in all cash deal recently. The top maker of customer relations software, Salesforce, has acquired the data management startup for about $2 billion. According to a report in Bloomberg, Salesforce told workers of Own in a presentation this week that some roles will not be required “post harmonization”.The company's presentation added that the end date will be January 31 for employees in those positions. The Salesforce presentation further said that some other jobs will be “transitional” and needed for three to 12 months to support the integration on a fixed short-term basis.Salesforce announced the acquisition of Own in September this year. Earlier this week, Own said on LinkedIn that the acquisition had closed. For Salesforce, which develops enterprise information systems and holds a market valuation of $311 billion, the acquisition strengthens its focus on data security and backup solutions.The job cuts announced by Salesforce signal a more cautious approach to growth and acquisitions. The company's rapid expansion over the past few years, fueled by major mergers like Slack and Tableau, has led to a substantial increase in its workforce and operational costs. This aggressive growth strategy, however, drew criticism from activist investors in late 2022, prompting Salesforce to reassess its approach.In response to investor pressure, the company disbanded its mergers and acquisitions committee and initiated a 10% workforce reduction early last year. The acquisition of Own, though substantial, marks a departure from the company's previous, more expansive M&A strategy.While Own's integration is expected to strengthen Salesforce's Data Cloud offering, it's clear that the company is prioritizing efficiency and cost-cutting. This is evident in the recent job cuts, which aim to streamline operations and reduce expenses.","Salesforce is reportedly planning to cut jobs at Own, the Israeli cloud backup company it acquired in all cash deal recently.

This new AI grandmother is a 'scam' for scammers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/this-new-ai-grandmother-daisy-is-a-scam-for-scammers/articleshow/115482045.cms,"What is scambaiting

Here’s how the AI bot works

AI Scambaiters: O2 creates AI Granny to waste scammers’ time

Online scams have become a global concern with fraudsters using new tricks to dupe the innocent ones. To tackle the rise of digital fraud, British telecom company Virgin Media O2 has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot named Daisy. Modeled after a friendly, chatty grandmother, Daisy is designed to keep scammers tied up in long-winded conversations, wasting their time while safeguarding potential victims from falling prey.Announcing the AI bot, the company said “This state-of-the-art AI Granny's mission is to talk with fraudsters and waste as much of their time as possible with human-like rambling chat to keep them away from real people while highlighting the need for consumers to stay vigilant as the UK faces a fraud epidemic”.According to Forbes, Daisy automates the practice of “scambaiting” – the practice of engaging with scammers, typically online or over the phone, to waste their time, disrupt their operations, and potentially gather information that could help authorities. Scambaiters use various techniques to keep scammers occupied, such as pretending to be potential victims or creating elaborate fictional scenarios to mislead them.In a demonstration video on YouTube, Daisy appears as a lifelike elderly woman with gray hair, glasses, and a trusty landline phone. In the video, Daisy can be seen keeping the scammers occupied with quirky tales about her cat Fluffy, her passion for knitting, or amusing anecdotes about her family, rather than sharing personal details. Sometimes, she even throws in fake bank details to add to their confusion.One scammer exclaimed, “It’s nearly been an hour!” To which Daisy cheerfully replied, “Gosh, how time flies!”“As long as they’re talking to me, they’re not scamming you. And let’s be honest, darling, I’ve got all the time in the world,” Daisy quips in the video.","British telecom company Virgin Media O2 has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot named Daisy.

Donald Trump's pick for FCC may do to TikTok what India did in 2020,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trumps-pick-for-fcc-may-do-to-tiktok-what-india-did-in-2020/articleshow/115456293.cms,"US' President-elect Donald Trump 's choice of Brendan Carr to lead the Federal Communications Commission signals a potential repeat of India's sudden 2020 TikTok prohibition, which saw 200 million users cut off from the platform overnight.Carr, who authored the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 chapter on the FCC, has explicitly called for banning TikTok despite Trump 's recent opposition to such action. The incoming chair views the platform as ""a serious and unacceptable risk to America's national security,"" arguing it enables Beijing to conduct influence operations through content manipulation.India's ban, enacted after a deadly border clash with China, offers a blueprint for what could happen to TikTok's 170 million American users. The Indian government cited data security and privacy concerns when it blocked TikTok and 58 other Chinese apps in June 2020, leading to an immediate transition to alternative platforms.While India's action was swift and decisive, the US approach has been more protracted. Current legislation requires ByteDance to sell TikTok by January 19, 2025, or face a ban. This timeline could accelerate under Carr's leadership, as his appointment doesn't require Senate confirmation.Carr's stance represents a departure from Trump's recent position. His stance on TikTok has been notably inconsistent. Despite leading the initial charge to ban the app during his first term and signing an executive order to that effect in 2020, he has recently pledged to ""save TikTok."" The president-elect, who now boasts 14 million followers on the platform, told CNBC that banning it would benefit Facebook, which he considers ""an enemy of the people.""Beyond TikTok, Carr advocates for broader restrictions on Chinese technology companies and reform of Section 230, which protects social media platforms from liability for user-generated content. He aims to address what he calls ""the censorship cartel"" in Big Tech.If implemented, a US ban could mirror India's experience, where content creators initially struggled but eventually rebuilt their audiences on American platforms. India's YouTube and Instagram user bases have since grown to roughly double their US numbers, though with lower revenue per user.ByteDance maintains that TikTok's US user data is stored exclusively in America and cannot be accessed by the Chinese government, challenging the national security concerns cited by critics.","Brendan Carr has been nominated to lead the Federal Communications Commission.

Previous job cuts at Deloitte

Deloitte is laying off 180 employees across its UK advisory divisions, reports Financial Times. Citing people familiar with the move, the report says that the Big Four firm has informed the affected staff on Tuesday i.e. November 19 that their jobs were at risk in a restructuring. The company said that it was necessary to navigate “challenging market conditions”.Deloitte’s recent cost-cutting measures suggest that large firms expect only modest improvements in the coming year. According to consulting industry research group Source Global, the global financial services consulting market is projected to grow by 5% in 2024 — double last year’s growth rate — but the UK market is expected to contract by 2%.As part of the latest job cuts, staff in both the strategy, risk and transactions division and the technology and transformation division will be impacted. The source told the publication that the job losses add up to less than 1 per cent of Deloitte’s UK workforce and are still subject to consultation.Deloitte's consulting division reported a 1% drop in revenue for the financial year, while its financial advisory services saw a 2% decline. The consulting sector in the UK has slowed significantly following the end of a pandemic-driven surge in technology transformation projects. Additionally, reduced merger and acquisition activity has dampened demand for financial advisory services in the financial sector.As part of a global reorganisation, Deloitte has streamlined its UK operations this year, consolidating its business units from five to four: audit and assurance; strategy, risk, and transactions; technology and transformation; and tax and legal.In September last year, the company announced 800 job cuts. Deloitte laid off 100 employees in February this year. Richard Houston, Deloitte’s UK senior partner and chief executive, warned in September, 2024 that the firm had to “carefully consider our cost base and make some difficult choices this year”.

Doing graphic design for ISIS was his passion, says the legal filing by the Department of Justice.According to a report in 404Media, FBI had been investigating Said since 2017, when he ordered pro-ISIS stickers. Despite multiple interviews, he maintained he had abandoned extremist views. He was reportedly interviewed at least five times between January 2018 and March 2019, when he claimed he no longer consumed ISIS propaganda and “only used the internet for schoolwork and watching sports,” according to the motion.However, a 2023 investigation revealed his active involvement in ISIS-linked Facebook accounts. In October 2023, FBI reportedly received information from Facebook parent Meta about Said’s alleged Facebook activity. FBI, thereafter, obtained search warrants and seized his electronic devices, on which investigators allegedly found encrypted messages documenting his propaganda work on behalf of ISIS. Among the messages, the FBI allegedly is said to have uncovered communications between Said and a person claiming to be the “number 2” designer for ISIS who provided Said feedback on his propaganda images and videos.Said allegedly had online conversations with an undercover FBI employee in which he discussed different methods for traveling to the Middle East and joining ISIS.Court documents indicate Said expressed a desire to travel to the Middle East to fight for ISIS and discussed potential attacks in the Houston area. He allegedly admitted to creating ISIS propaganda and considering violent acts against U.S. military personnel.Prosecutors argue that Said and his family expressed a willingness to return to Lebanon, highlighting concerns about his extremist beliefs and potential for violence. The FBI also uncovered conversations where Said discussed joining ISIS and potential attacks on military recruitment centers.","A 28-year-old Houston man, Anas Said, has reportedly been arrested and charged with providing material support to the Islamic State.

Elon Musk’s bold defence of Matt Gaetz



Sexual offence allegations against Matt Gaetz

The legal and political fallout

Amid rising scrutiny and intense political pressure surrounding Matt Gaetz 's nomination for the role of U.S. Attorney General, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has publicly expressed his support for the Florida congressman. As per reports, Gaetz has been under investigation for serious sex offence allegations, including accusations of sexual misconduct with minors. While these allegations have sparked fierce debate and calls for his nomination to be revoked, Musk’s outspoken stance has intensified the conversation. Musk, a prominent figure with significant influence over political narratives, dismissed the allegations as baseless and reaffirmed his belief in Gaetz’s potential as the next Attorney General.Matt Gaetz, a Republican Congressman from Florida, was nominated as the U.S. Attorney General by former President Donald Trump. However, his nomination has been overshadowed by serious allegations that surfaced during his time in Congress. The allegations, which include sexual misconduct involving a 17-year-old girl and claims of attending drug-fueled sex parties, have led to widespread calls for his nomination to be withdrawn. Despite these accusations, Gaetz has adamantly denied the allegations, maintaining that he has not engaged in any illegal activities.Gaetz’s nomination was further complicated by the fact that the Department of Justice (DoJ) did not press any charges against him, despite an extensive investigation into the matter. The House Ethics Committee, which had launched its own probe into the allegations, was expected to release its findings soon. However, Gaetz resigned from Congress just days before the report was set to come out, leaving many questions unanswered. Although the report’s publication is still uncertain, there is growing division within the Republican Party about whether it should be released.Amid this political turmoil, Elon Musk has emerged as one of Gaetz's most vocal supporters. Musk, known for his controversial statements and powerful online presence, dismissed the allegations against Gaetz, calling them “worth less than nothing.” Musk’s defence of Gaetz was particularly striking when he compared current Attorney General Merrick Garland to an “unprincipled douchebag,” suggesting that if Garland had sufficient evidence, he would have secured a conviction against Gaetz. Musk went on to claim that the case was “closed” because Garland, despite being the head of the Department of Justice, had not moved forward with any charges.Musk further reinforced his support for Gaetz by highlighting the congressman’s qualifications for the role of Attorney General. In a series of social media posts, Musk praised Gaetz for possessing “a big brain, a spine of steel, and an axe to grind.” Musk described Gaetz as the “Judge Dredd America needs” to clean up a corrupt system and hold powerful figures accountable. For Musk, the allegations against Gaetz were of no consequence, as the congressman had not been charged with any crimes, and the legal system presumed his innocence until proven guilty.The accusations against Matt Gaetz date back to his time in Congress and have raised serious concerns about his fitness for public office. Gaetz has been accused of engaging in sexual activities with a 17-year-old girl, a claim he vehemently denies. The controversy deepened when reports suggested that Gaetz had been involved in multiple drug-fueled sex parties, with at least one occasion reportedly involving a minor. Gaetz allegedly paid two women who testified against him through the PayPal account of Nestor Galban, whom Gaetz refers to as his adopted son.In his defence, Gaetz has repeatedly denied the accusations, stating that they were false and fabricated. During an appearance on Tucker Carlson’s show, Gaetz vehemently denied the claim of travelling with a 17-year-old girl, stating that the allegations were baseless and that records would prove his innocence. He argued that providing financial support to individuals of legal age for travel and lodging was not a crime. Gaetz also denied the existence of any photographs linking him to child prostitution, calling such claims outright false.The allegations sparked a prolonged investigation by the House Ethics Committee, which eventually led to Gaetz’s resignation from Congress. Gaetz married his girlfriend, Ginger Luckey, in 2021, shortly after the investigation began, with Luckey standing by him throughout the ordeal. However, the investigation into Gaetz’s actions remains a contentious issue, with some members of the Republican Party pushing for the release of the committee’s findings, while others remain wary of the political ramifications.Despite the lack of formal charges against Gaetz, the legal and political implications of the allegations remain significant. The resignation of Gaetz from Congress has temporarily halted the House Ethics Committee's investigation, and it remains unclear whether the findings will ever be made public. Meanwhile, his nomination as Attorney General is contingent on Senate approval, which is far from guaranteed given the ongoing controversy surrounding his personal conduct.In light of Musk’s support for Gaetz, some have raised concerns about the influence of wealthy, high-profile individuals in shaping political outcomes. Musk’s intervention in the Gaetz nomination has sparked debate over the role of influential figures in the political process and the potential consequences of their involvement in such high-stakes decisions.","Matt Gaetz, a Republican Congressman from Florida, was nominated as the U.S. Attorney General by former President Donald Trump.

ANI (Asian News International), a prominent news agency, has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging that the tech company used its content without permission to train its AI chatbot, ChatGPT. ANI claims that OpenAI not only utilised its copyrighted material without a lawful licence but also accused the company of attributing fabricated news stories to the agency. This lawsuit adds to a growing list of legal challenges faced by OpenAI from various global news organisations and copyright holders, including The New York Times and The Chicago Tribune, who have similarly accused OpenAI of using their work without authorization. The case raises important questions about intellectual property rights in the age of artificial intelligence and the ongoing tensions between media companies and AI developers.In its legal filing, ANI has accused OpenAI of using its original content for the training of its AI models without obtaining a lawful licence or permission. ANI’s complaint highlights that, unlike its business dealings with other organisations such as The Financial Times and The Associated Press, OpenAI did not negotiate a licensing agreement for the use of ANI’s work. ANI further argues that OpenAI’s actions amounted to an infringement of its copyrights by utilising its content, which includes news articles, reports, and other original material, for the purpose of training the artificial intelligence model, ChatGPT.The lawsuit claims that OpenAI’s actions have caused significant harm to ANI’s reputation and business interests, including the attribution of fabricated or inaccurate news stories to the agency. According to ANI, some of the content generated by ChatGPT included false claims of articles being published by their agency, which the news organisation asserts is damaging to its credibility. The agency has called for a court order to stop OpenAI from using its material, as well as a resolution to the alleged harm caused by the misattribution of fabricated content.In response to ANI’s lawsuit, OpenAI has denied the allegations of using ANI’s content without permission. A spokesperson for OpenAI stated that the company builds its AI models using publicly available data and employs principles of fair use in doing so. OpenAI also emphasised that it has halted the use of ANI’s content for future training of ChatGPT. According to OpenAI, ANI’s content has been part of an internal block list since September, effectively preventing its use in any future AI model training.Despite these claims, ANI maintains that its content is still stored in ChatGPT’s memory and cannot be removed, as there is no programmed mechanism for the deletion of data once it is incorporated into the system. ANI argues that this results in an ongoing infringement of its intellectual property rights, as its work remains embedded in ChatGPT’s responses.OpenAI also sought to reassure the public and ANI by stating that it is working on establishing additional partnerships with news organisations around the world, including discussions in India, to explore licensing and collaboration opportunities. The company also stressed its commitment to following legal precedents and ensuring that its actions comply with intellectual property laws.ANI’s lawsuit is not an isolated case. OpenAI has faced similar legal challenges from authors, visual artists, music publishers, and other content creators, accusing the company of using their works without permission. These lawsuits have raised concerns about the legal implications of training AI models using vast amounts of publicly available content, which often includes copyrighted material. Critics argue that companies like OpenAI are exploiting intellectual property without compensating the original creators, leading to calls for stricter regulations on the use of such content.As per reports, OpenAI has repeatedly denied any allegations of copyright infringement, asserting that its practices align with the principles of fair use. However, as AI technology continues to advance and become more integrated into various industries, legal experts suggest that there may need to be a clearer framework for how AI companies can access and utilise copyrighted materials.The broader legal landscape is shifting as governments and regulatory bodies worldwide grapple with how to address the intersection of AI and intellectual property rights. The case against OpenAI could set important precedents for future legal battles involving AI training and the use of publicly available data.The case against OpenAI was heard at the Delhi High Court, where the judge directed OpenAI to submit a detailed response to ANI’s allegations. During the first hearing, OpenAI's legal team presented emails to ANI from its lawyers in India, which indicated that ANI’s website had been added to a block list to prevent its content from being used in future AI model training. The court has scheduled the next hearing for January 28, 2024, when the company will be required to provide further clarification regarding the allegations.The ongoing case is being closely watched, not only for its potential impact on OpenAI’s operations but also for its broader implications on the legal rights of news organisations and content creators in the digital age. It underscores the need for a balance between the advancement of AI technology and the protection of intellectual property rights.","Asian News International (ANI) has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI.

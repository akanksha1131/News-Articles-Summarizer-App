Microsoft commits $4 billion to AI education and skills





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella emphasized that the tech giant must ""earn our permission to operate every day, in every country, every community, and every customer interaction"" in his annual shareholder letter, as the company navigates what he calls a generational AI platform shift.The message comes as Microsoft reported record financial performance with revenue reaching $281.7 billion, up 15 percent, and Azure cloud revenue surpassing $75 billion for the first time with 34 percent growth. Despite these achievements, Nadella stressed the company cannot take customer trust for granted.""We take neither for granted,"" Nadella wrote about the company's performance and customer trust. ""That's why we remain grounded in our mission: to empower every person and every organisation on the planet to achieve more.""Nadella outlined three core priorities for Microsoft: security, quality, and AI innovation. The company dedicated resources equivalent to 34,000 full-time engineers to its Secure Future Initiative, strengthening identity protections and embedding security-by-design practices across all products.Microsoft's AI infrastructure expansion included opening datacenters across six continents, now operating more than 400 facilities in 70 regions.The company announced Fairwater, positioned as the world's most powerful AI datacenter in Wisconsin, delivering ten times the performance of today's fastest supercomputer.Microsoft 365 Copilot surpassed 100 million monthly active users across commercial and consumer segments, while GitHub Copilot reached 20 million users. The company introduced Agent Mode, allowing users to orchestrate multistep tasks through simple prompts.Looking beyond technology, Nadella announced Microsoft Elevate, a five-year initiative investing $4 billion in cash and AI cloud technology to schools and nonprofit organisations. The program aims to help 20 million people earn AI credentials over the next two years.""People want technology they can trust,"" Nadella wrote, committing to responsible AI innovation guided by values of respect, integrity, and accountability.The CEO challenged employees to think long-term: ""What are you working on today that, 15 years from now, you will look back on and say, 'we got it right'?""","Microsoft commits $4 billion to AI education and skills programs.

Elon Musk adds to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' prediction on data centres in Space; says: SpaceX will ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-adds-to-amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-prediction-on-data-centres-in-space-says-spacex-will-/articleshow/125004868.cms,"AI Image for Representation

What Jeff Bezos said on Data centres in Space





In a move that could reshape the future of computing, Elon Musk has thrown his weight behind the concept of orbital data centers, joining a growing chorus of tech billionaires betting on space to meet Earth's exploding demand for AI-driven processing power. Elon Musk, whose SpaceX operates the world's largest satellite constellation, declared on X (formerly Twitter) that his company will adapt its Starlink technology for massive space-based data facilities. ""Simply scaling up Starlink V3 satellites, which have high speed laser links would work,"" Musk posted in response to an Ars Technica article on autonomous space assembly. ""SpaceX will be doing this,"" Elon Musk wrote.The announcement elevates a once-fringe idea into mainstream contention. Proponents highlight unlimited solar energy and zero terrestrial environmental impact—key advantages as ground-based data centers face mounting opposition over power consumption and land use. Critics, however, dismiss it as economically unfeasible, arguing that the engineering hurdles are vastly underestimated.Musk's entry follows high-profile interest from other industry giants.In May, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt acquired rocket manufacturer Relativity Space, driven by his vision for orbital computing hubs. Earlier this month, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos forecasted gigawatt-scale data centers in space within 10 to 20 years, framing it as part of a broader trend to leverage orbit for Earth's benefit.SpaceX's Starlink network already challenges skeptics: it delivers profitable high-speed internet to millions globally via thousands of satellites. If Musk succeeds in repurposing this architecture, it could silence doubters in the nascent space data center sector, where startups like Starcloud are already pioneering solutions.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos recently predicted that gigawatt-scale data centres will be built in space within the next 10 to 20 years and that continuously available solar energy meant they would eventually outperform those based on Earth. Speaking at the Italian Tech Week in Turin, Bezos said, ""These giant training clusters, those will be better built in space, because we have solar power there, 24/7. There are no clouds and no rain, no weather. "" In a public conversation with Ferrari and Stellantis Chairman John Elkann, Bezos said, ""We will be able to beat the cost of terrestrial data centres in space in the next couple of decades.""As AI fuels insatiable demand for storage and compute, space-based infrastructure is no longer science fiction -- it's a competitive frontier where Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Eric Schmidt are racing to dominate.","Elon Musk says his company will adapt its Starlink technology for massive space- based data facilities.

Harry Potter , DC Universe could join Netflix empire

Multiple suitors circle Warner Bros. Discovery







Netflix is actively exploring a potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery's studio and streaming operations, marking what could be a landmark deal in Hollywood's ongoing consolidation, according to Reuters.The streaming giant has hired investment bank Moelis & Co. to evaluate a prospective offer and has been granted access to Warner Bros. Discovery's financial data room, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday. Moelis previously advised Skydance Media on its successful Paramount Global takeover.A deal would give Netflix control over some of entertainment's most valuable franchises, including Harry Potter, DC Comics superheroes like Superman and Batman, and Warner Bros.' extensive film library. The acquisition would also bring HBO and its streaming service HBO Max under Netflix's umbrella, adding prestigious dramas and additional subscribers to the platform.Warner Bros. Television already produces several Netflix hits, including ""Running Point,"" ""You,"" and ""Maid,"" making the production relationship between the companies well-established.Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos told investors last week that while the company has traditionally been ""more builders than buyers,"" it evaluates acquisitions based on whether they would strengthen entertainment offerings.However, he made clear Netflix has ""no interest in owning legacy media networks"" like CNN, TNT, Food Network, and Animal Planet—all part of Warner Bros. Discovery's cable portfolio.Warner Bros. Discovery announced last week it would explore strategic options after receiving unsolicited offers from multiple parties, including three escalating bids from Paramount Skydance that were rejected as too low, Reuters reported.Comcast has also expressed interest in complementary media assets, with President Mike Cavanagh telling investors the company is evaluating potential deals and dismissing concerns about regulatory approval.Netflix, Warner Bros.

Who’s who at the chimaek table

“To our partnership and future of the world,”

From bar to boardroom: the APEC connection







On an unassuming Thursday evening in Seoul, three of Asia’s most powerful men walked into a fried-chicken restaurant and changed the night for everyone inside. Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia; Lee Jae-yong, the chairman of Samsung Electronics; and Chung Eui-sun, the executive chair of Hyundai Motor Group, shared a dinner of fried chicken and beer, and ended up buying everyone a free dinnerIt was just after 7:20 p.m. on 30 May when the trio stepped into Kkanbu Chicken, a modest but popular fried chicken franchise located in Samseong-dong, Gangnam-gu, not far from the bustling Samseong Station. The dinner came on the eve of the APEC CEO Summit in Gyeongju, with Huang visiting South Korea for the first time in 15 years.There was no sign of the usual entourage or formality one might expect from corporate royalty. Inside, they took a table by the window, dressed simply, Huang in a black short-sleeved T-shirt, Lee in a white full sleeve, and Chung in a white short-sleeved shirt. Their casual appearance drew double-takes from diners who gradually realised who was sitting among them.According to The Korea Daily, the trio’s table was soon filled with three styles of fried chicken, crispy boneless, crunchy six-pack, and sweet boneless, accompanied by cheese sticks and cheese balls served on the house.Their drinks included draft beer, bottles of Terra beer, and Chamisul soju, a mix locals affectionately call “Tesla.”When Huang noticed a(soju and beer) tower bubbling at a neighbouring table, Lee explained how it worked. The three men laughed, lifted their glasses, and linked arms for aa common gesture of friendship and respect in South Korea. Their toast quickly became the image of the evening, captured by phones and local reporters already crowding the front.Outside, news of the billionaires’ visit spread rapidly. Around 500 people, including reporters, passers-by, and police officers maintaining order, gathered outside the restaurant. As diners inside began to cheer, someone shouted,Lee smiled and replied,The crowd started chanting Huang’s name instead. Laughing, he responded,Chung joined in, saying,Then Huang reached for the golden bell hanging near the counter, a Kkanbu tradition signalling a “free dinner,” and rang it. The restaurant erupted. But according to Yonhap News Agency, it was Lee Jae-yong who ultimately covered the bill for everyone dining inside, while Chung Eui-sun paid for the following round. The total came to about 2.5 million won, roughly US $1,800.Huang later stepped outside carrying baskets of fried chicken, French fries, and banana milk, handing them out to the crowd.he said.It was a rare public moment of lightness for three men whose companies together shape much of Asia’s economic and technological landscape.Between them, the billionaires’ estimated combined fortune stands at around $195 billion, according to national outlets. Huang’s net worth, driven by Nvidia’s market surge, is believed to be over $143 billion (197 trillion won). Lee Jae-yong’s holdings are valued near 22.3 trillion won, while Chung’s assets are roughly 5.6 trillion won, reported The Korea Daily.To commemorate the dinner, Huang brought gifts: a bottle of Suntory Hakushu 25-year-old single malt whisky and an Nvidia DGX AI system, both engraved with the message,according to The Korea Herald.Their table, simple as it looked, represented the backbone of modern Asian industry: semiconductors, automobiles, and artificial intelligence, all clinking glasses under fluorescent lights and a signboard of fried chicken.The night at Kkanbu wasn’t just three friends sharing chicken; it was a prelude to bigger conversations about technology and power. The following day at the APEC Summit, Huang met South Korea’s President Lee Jae-myung and announced that Nvidia would provide more than 260,000 graphics-processing units to Korean firms, including those led by his dining companions.According to the presidential office, Nvidia will collaborate with Samsung, Hyundai, Naver, and SK to advance “physical AI,” developing systems for robotics and autonomous vehicles. The pledge came as the United States and China continue to debate access to advanced AI chips, the very hardware that helped push Nvidia’s valuation near $5 trillion.","Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, visited South Korea for the first time in 15 years.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business.

Xbox’s higher sales targets







Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, which will allow users to stream select titles without requiring a paid Game Pass subscription. The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees. The ad-supported service is expected to provide users with access to:The company is reportedly testing a model where users will view approximately two minutes of pre-roll advertisements before a game starts streaming. Internal testing also features limits on playtime, including a one-hour session limit and a maximum of five hours of free streaming per month. These restrictions are subject to change before the official launch, the report noted.The free tier is expected to be widely available across PC, Xbox consoles, handheld devices and web browsers. The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%. This change reportedly came after Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new 30% target.","Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

What Sundar Pichai wrote in the post

“New breakthrough quantum algorithm published in @Nature today: Our Willow chip has achieved the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage.

Willow ran the algorithm - which we’ve named Quantum Echoes - 13,000x faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This new algorithm can explain interactions between atoms in a molecule using nuclear magnetic resonance, paving a path towards potential future uses in drug discovery and materials science.

And the result is verifiable, meaning its outcome can be repeated by other quantum computers or confirmed by experiments.

This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we're excited to see where it leads.”

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon renewed his opposition to remote work, dismissing employee concerns about the bank's strict five-day return-to-office mandate that sparked a 2,000-signature internal petition earlier this year. Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative alongside Goldman Sachs' David Solomon and BlackRock's Larry Fink, Dimon argued that junior bankers suffer when working from home.""I'm not making fun of Zoom, but younger people are being left behind,"" he said. ""If you look back at your careers, you learned a little bit from the apprentice system. You were with other people who took you on a sales call or told you how to handle a mistake or something like that. It doesn't happen when you're in a basement on Zoom.""The comments follow Dimon's heated town hall earlier this year where he infamously responded to the employee petition, telling staff, ""I don't care how many people sign that f—ing petition,"" Reuters reported. He later apologised for cursing but maintained his stance, saying employees who wanted flexibility could find work elsewhere.The petition, launched after JPMorgan ended hybrid work for over 300,000 employees in January, called the mandate ""a great leap backward"" that hurts employees, customers, and shareholders.Fortune reported that workers complained about inadequate desk space, spotty Wi-Fi, and increased childcare and commuting costs during the March rollout.In a Stanford Graduate School of Business interview, Dimon characterised remote work supporters as ""people in the middle who complain a lot about it."" He contrasted them with frontline workers who never had remote options during the pandemic.The bank's new $3 billion, 60-story Manhattan headquarters—which opened earlier this month—will house approximately 10,000 employees.

A playful swipe at the competition



Samsung–Nvidia alliance in focus







Samsung Electronics chairman Lee Jay-young cracked a lighthearted joke about iPhones while sharing the stage with Nvidia CEO Jensen Hunag at a tech event in Seoul. As Lee looked at the crowd at the event he quipped, “Thank you, but… why are there so many iPhones?”, drawing laughter from attendees and sparking buzz across social media.The remark from Lee came during a public appearance which was followed by a private dinner between Lee, Huang, and Hyundai Motor Group chairman Chung Eui-sun. The trio had met the previous evening for Korean fried chicken and beer at a popular Gangnam restaurant, celebrating their growing collaboration in AI and next-gen computing.The comments made by the Samsung Electronics chairman was prompted by the sight of numerous audience members recoding the event with Apple devices despite Samsung being the host and the leading smartphone maker. The chairman’s playful jab underscored the competitive tension between Samsung and Apple, while also showcasing his charisma and sense of humor.“It’s not every day you see a tech titan joking about rival products in public,” one attendee posted on X, sharing a clip of the moment that quickly went viral.The Nvidia CEO's Thursday night dinner with Samsung Electronics Chairman Jay Y Lee and Hyundai Motor Executive Chair Chung Euisun at a Seoul eatery sent shockwaves through Korean markets.Kyochon F&B, a competitor to the Kkanbu Chicken restaurant where the billionaires dined, saw shares rocket 20% the following day as images flooded social media, Bloomberg reports.The dinner's timing raises eyebrows.

According to a report by Wired, a mother identified as Kate reported her ex-husband, the designated organiser, was using the feature for coercive control. Her ex-husband allegedly tracked their children’s locations and imposed ""draconian limits"" on screen time during her custody days while lifting them on his own. The system's flaw is that it gives all control to one parent, leaving the non-organiser parent unable to transfer children to a new family group without the organiser's consent.Kate recounted,Still, Apple's support staff stated their hands werethe report noted, citing the woman.In such cases, the usual recommendation is to stop using the existing accounts and create new Apple IDs. However, doing so results in the loss of all purchased apps, and more importantly, photos and videos that may hold years of memories.Apple introduced the Family Sharing feature with iOS 8 in 2014. With this feature, up to six family members can use their own Apple IDs linked to the same payment method to download apps and iTunes content. All family members must have Apple IDs registered in the same country. Parents can also approve their children’s purchases directly from their own devices.In addition to managing App Store and iTunes purchases, Family Sharing lets you see your children’s locations through Find My Friends and helps locate their devices using Find My iPhone.It also allows you to set up a shared family calendar, reminder list, and photo album that everyone in the group can access and edit.","Apple's Family Sharing feature gives all control to one parent.

Apple Watch saves life of 26-year-old businessman from Madhya Pradesh; alerts of life-threatening stroke,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-watch-saves-life-of-26-year-old-businessman-from-madhya-pradesh-alerts-of-life-threatening-stroke/articleshow/124994108.cms,"The gym purchase that became his lifeline





A split-second decision to heed a health alert from his Apple Watch Series 9 saved the life of a 26-year-old businessman from Nainpur during what began as a routine trip to Jabalpur earlier this month.Sahil, who owns a rice manufacturing plant in Nainpur, had travelled to Jabalpur for business meetings earlier this month. With his work day wrapped up successfully, he'd decided to treat himself to a movie before catching his train home.He recalls at 6:05 pm, as he sat quietly in the cinema hall, his Apple Watch Series 9 alerted him to a dangerously elevated heart rate. Concerned, he opened the watch's ECG app, which immediately flagged tachycardia—an abnormally rapid heartbeat. That moment of leisure had turned into a life-saving detour.That single notification changed his evening plans. Rather than catch his scheduled train, he headed to a nearby hospital.What medical staff uncovered was startling. His blood pressure had surged to 180/120, his pulse hammering at 125 beats per minute. The hospital's ECG machine confirmed the watch's reading. Doctors moved quickly, admitting him for urgent treatment of a severe hypertensive episode.The doctor didn't sugarcoat the situation. ""If I'd boarded that train, I would have collapsed somewhere en route—likely a brain haemorrhage. The watch stopped me from getting on,"" Sahil said.Two years ago, Sahil bought the Watch with straightforward intentions: tracking his gym workouts and monitoring daily activity levels. Like many young professionals, he saw it as a fitness companion—something to count steps, log exercise, and perhaps keep him accountable to health goals. He never anticipated it would one day stand between him and a medical emergency.He'd felt unwell that morning but pushed through his business meetings anyway—a decision typical of entrepreneurs who build their schedules around client commitments rather than personal comfort.The 26-year-old businessman remembers that days leading up to the trip had been particularly taxing: inadequate sleep, meals grabbed on the go, and the constant mental load of work. At 26, with no history of heart problems and an active lifestyle, the idea of a health crisis seemed impossibly remote to him. The watch's alert caught him completely off guard.Sahil wrote an email to Apple CEO Tim Cook, thanking him and the Apple Watch for saving his life. To his surprise, Cook personally replied on with a brief but heartfelt message: ""Hi Sahil, I am so glad you sought medical attention and received the treatment you needed. Thanks for sharing your story with us. Be well.""He says he feels completely fine now, but the close call fundamentally reshaped how he thinks about his health—and the technology monitoring it. He's bought Apple Watches for his family and is now upgrading to Apple's new Watch Ultra 3—specifically for its blood pressure monitoring feature, the one capability his Series 9 lacked.","Apple Watch Series 9 alerted a 26-year-old businessman to a dangerously elevated heart rate.

Elon Musk vs. Sam Altman: A long-running rift







Tesla CEO Elon Musk has one again started his long-running feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman , suggesting a ‘conspiracy theory’ behind Altman’s decision of not taking any equity stake in the company even after its multibillion dollar partnership with Microsoft. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk wrote, “The ‘no equity’ thing is a conspiracy theory magnet. If it’s not about money, then what is it about? Power? Influence? Something else?”“Altman took a piece of almost every successful company that wanted a relationship with OpenAI (YC Combinator playbook). His stakes in those companies are worth tens of billions. Moreover, he is just waiting for my lawsuit against OpenAI to be over to receive the same $30B or so in stock that Brockman was given,” added Musk.The comment from Musk came in response to Altman’s own post shared earlier this week on X. In the post, Altman reflected on his decision to forgo equity stake in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. “Wish I had taken equity a long time ago,” Altman wrote. “I think it would have led to far fewer conspiracy theories… People seem very able to understand ‘ok that dude is doing it because he wants more money’ but less so ‘he just thinks technology is cool.’”Along with this, Altman also acknowledged the fact that his stance may have been “tone-deaf,” especially in light of OpenAI’s transformation into a public benefit corporation and its lucrative deal with Microsoft, which now holds a reported 27% stake in the company’s for-profit arm.For the uninitiated, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015, but left the board in 2018. Musk has criticised the company’s shift from open-source ideals to a closed, profit-driven model. Along with this, Musk also accused Altman of steering OpenAI away from its original mission. Musk also went ahead and launched his own AI venture — xAI.Earlier this year, Musk made headlines with a $97 billion bid to acquire OpenAI’s nonprofit arm—a move Altman publicly mocked","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has one again started his long-running feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

The Huang effect: When tech royalty drives food stock rallies

From street food spectacle to billion-dollar chip deals





A simple evening of fried chicken and beer has sparked an extraordinary rally in South Korea's food sector, proving once again that Jensen Huang's influence extends far beyond silicon chips. The Nvidia CEO's Thursday night dinner with Samsung Electronics Chairman Jay Y Lee and Hyundai Motor Executive Chair Chung Euisun at a Seoul eatery sent shockwaves through Korean markets. Kyochon F&B, a competitor to the Kkanbu Chicken restaurant where the billionaires dined, saw shares rocket 20% the following day as images flooded social media, Bloomberg reports.The ripple effects proved substantial. Poultry processor Cherrybro maxed out its 30% daily trading limit, while chicken-frying robot manufacturer Neuromeka experienced trading volumes 200 times above normal, according to Bloomberg data.But this wasn't merely a photo opportunity over ""chimaek""—Korea's cherished chicken-and-beer combination. Huang presented both executives with Nvidia DGX boxes, high-powered AI systems, accompanied by a handwritten note declaring: ""To our partnership and future of the world!"" The symbolic gesture, Business Insider notes, signals deepening commercial relationships between these tech powerhouses.The dinner's timing raises eyebrows. Bloomberg had reported just days earlier that Nvidia would announce major chip supply contracts with Samsung and Hyundai. The gathering also coincided with the APEC Summit, where President Donald Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping What unfolded outside the restaurant resembled a celebrity sighting. Korean national broadcasters livestreamed the meal while fans pressed against windows. Fellow diners documented every moment on their phones. Huang obliged admirers afterward, autographing everything from two-dollar bills to cosmetic shopping bags, even distributing chicken to waiting crowds and a nearby officer, Business Insider observed.Korea's markets have form here—a pen manufacturer's stock previously surged after Trump complimented it. Yet Huang's market-moving power remains unmatched. When he name-dropped AI companies during a 2024 presentation, their valuations soared, cementing his status as tech's most influential figure beyond Nvidia's staggering $5 trillion valuation.","Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dined with Samsung and Hyundai execs in South Korea.

AT&T on filing complaint against American advertising agency, NAD

In a release on it website, AT&T has shared the complaint it has filed against America's advertising agency, NAD. Here's the release:

AT&T has filed a complaint for declaratory relief against the NAD in response to its demands to remove our advertising and other messaging that centers around one simple fact: NAD has asked T-Mobile to correct their advertising at least 16 times over the last four years – more than anyone else in our industry.

The new campaign - ""Ain’t Our First Rodeo"" - underscores a simple truth: Trust is earned through action. The ad highlights the remarkable frequency with which T-Mobile advertising has been challenged in recent years, and we take this action today to help ensure customers hear the truth.

Backed by industry-leading investments in Fiber and 5G wireless networks and expert-built infrastructure, AT&T is the first and only carrier that covers both our wireless and fiber networks with the AT&T Guarantee. More Coverage. More Reliability & More Accountability.









AT&T is escalating its decades-long feud with T-Mobile, launching a pointed advertising campaign this week to debunk rival claims and assert dominance over America's wireless landscape. The campaign, featuring actor Luke Wilson, directly counters T-Mobile's marketing assertions about network superiority. AT&T Chief Operating Officer Jeff McElfresh told Yahoo Finance that T-Mobile's ads mislead consumers into believing it operates the nation's biggest and best network. ""When we see claims coming directly from a competitor like T-Mobile with advertising that says they’ve got more towers, leading people to believe they may have the absolute largest and best network, the opposite couldn’t be truer,"" McElfresh said. ""In fact, T-Mobile’s got the smallest network – over 300,000 square miles smaller than that of AT&T. We own and operate the largest and most reliable wireless network.""AT&T is highlighting what it calls a pattern of inaccuracies in T-Mobile's promotions. The company pointed to the Better Business Bureau's National Advertising Division, which has required T-Mobile to modify its claims 16 times in the past four years – roughly once per quarter.The push comes as AT&T promotes its ""AT&T Guarantee,"" a reliability pledge for both wireless and fiber services introduced following a major network outage in early 2024 that disrupted millions of customers.In the ads, Wilson channels a folksy vibe reminiscent of T-Mobile's own commercials, strolling through rural countryside while a energetic dog playfully gnaws on T-Mobile branding. ""AT&T has been carrying America’s calls since 1876,"" Wilson says in one spot. ""When you’ve been around that long, you can spot a hustle coming from a mile away.""The campaign underscores AT&T's emphasis on comprehensive coverage, particularly its robust LTE infrastructure, which analysts say gives it an edge in areas where T-Mobile's network falters.","AT&T is escalating its decades-long feud with T-Mobile, launching a pointed advertising campaign this week to debunk rival claims.

AI boom a policy dilemma for Fed: Chairman





Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell recently acknowledged growing concerns that artificial intelligence (AI) could lead to widespread job losses, calling it a “real and difficult issue” for the US economy. Speaking at a press conference after the Fed’s latest policy meeting, Powell said the labor market may not be as strong as it appears. Despite a 4.3% unemployment rate and steady consumer spending, “job creation is pretty close to zero” once data adjustments are made, he said. Powell linked part of that weakness to companies using AI to do more work with fewer employees.Powell noted that many large companies have recently paused hiring or cut jobs, explicitly citing AI as the reason. “Much of the time they’re talking about AI and what it can do,” he told reporters. “We’re watching that very carefully.”Recent layoffs at firms like Amazon , Target, and Paramount illustrate his point. A report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas found nearly 946,000 layoffs in the U.S. this year, with over 17,000 tied directly to AI. Economists have even coined a term for the slowdown — the “Great Freeze.”While some fear this surge in tech spending could resemble the dot-com bubble, Powell dismissed the comparison.“These companies actually have earnings,” he said, adding that AI projects reflect long-term bets on productivity rather than short-term speculation.Still, he admitted this boom presents a “policy dilemma” for the Fed — productivity is rising, but hiring is not. “We have upside risks to inflation, downside risks to employment,” Powell said. “This is a very difficult thing for a central bank.”Powell said the economy now shows signs of a “K-shape,” where wealthier households and large corporations benefit from AI-driven growth, while lower-income consumers struggle. “Consumers at the lower end are buying less and shifting to lower-cost products,” he said.“There is no risk-free path for policy,” Powell added. “We’re navigating the tension between our employment and inflation goals as carefully as we can.”",Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the labor market may not be as strong as it appears.

Nvidia has made a landmark deal to supply more than 260,000 Blackwell AI chips to South Korea. As reported by Reuters, the deal comes despite the chips being subject to US national security export restrictions, underscoring the strategic importance of AI hardware in global tech alliances. The report adds that the chips made by Nvidia will be distributed across South Korea’s public and private sectors, including players like Samsung, SK Group and Hyundai Motor Group, to power large-scale AI data centers and “AI factories.” These facilities are said to support advancements in robotics, semiconductors, cloud infrastructure and autonomous vehicles.The Blackwell chips are Nvidia’s most advanced AI processors and are also among the technologies restricted by the US government for export to certain countries, particularly China over concerns of military and surveillance applications. On the other hand, South Korea is a close ally of US and it is not subject to the same bans imposed on China. Nvidia has not yet disclosed the financial terms or licensing details of the agreement, but the company has revealed that the chips will be used for commercial and research purposes.As reported by Reuters, the South Korean government has made AI a national priorityand it aims to build a strong ecosystem that rivals global tech hubs.President Lee Jae-myung’s administration has pledged significant investment in AI infrastructure, and the Nvidia deal is seen as a cornerstone of that strategy. “Just as Korea’s physical factories powered industrial growth, these AI factories will drive digital transformation,” said a government spokesperson.The chips will be used to build high-performance computing clusters capable of training large language models and supporting generative AI applications across industries.The announcement comes as Nvidia continues its meteoric rise, recently surpassing a $5 trillion market valuation. The South Korea deal adds to a series of global partnerships, including recent agreements in Japan, India, and the Middle East, as demand for AI infrastructure accelerates worldwide. CEO Jensen Huang, who attended the APEC CEO Summit in Gyeongju, praised South Korea’s commitment to AI leadership and called the deal “delightful. ”","N Nvidia has made a landmark deal to supply more than 260,000 Blackwell AI chips to South Korea.

It remains unclear whether the company has responded privately or initiated any action to address the matter.The tech executive did not specify which Tesla model he had booked or through which channel the payment was made. But, it appears to be the Tesla Roadster – claimed to be one of Tesla's most hyped unveilings. Its production was originally slated to start in 2020, but has been delayed multiple times. In 2024, Elon Musk told investors: “We are working on it, but it has to come behind things that have a more serious impact on the world.So, just thank you to all our long-suffering Tesla Roadster deposit holders”.The screenshots in Sam Altman’s post reveal RN109156241 as the reservation confirmation number.Back in 2017, Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated that the Roadster “will be the fastest production car ever made, period.” “It will be the first time any car has broken two seconds at 0-60,” Musk then said adding “It will be the fastest to 100 mph: 4.2 seconds.”","Sam Altman claims non-delivery of Tesla car he bought 7.5 years ago.

The cancellation emerged following announcements of 14,000 job cuts across the company made by Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and Technology at Amazon. A company executive confirmed to The Verge that Amazon is halting ""substantial"" portion of MMO development efforts, directly impacting the Lord of the Rings title co-developed with Embracer Group.A developer from the affected team broke the news in a since-deleted LinkedIn post: ""This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y'all would have loved it)."" The post praised the disbanded team, noting, ""It’s always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this — I’ve been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I’ve ever met here. ""In the wake of the cuts, the team behind New World: Aeternum—Amazon's in-house MMO -- announced it would cease new content updates, though servers will remain operational through 2026. Amazon Games spokesperson Brittney Hefner told The Verge that the company will continue supporting two published MMOs: Throne and Liberty and Lost Ark.The now-canceled Lord of the Rings MMO, first revealed in 2023, represented Amazon's second attempt at a game in J.R.R. Tolkien's universe. An earlier version, announced in 2019, was scrapped two years later amid development challenges.According to Bloomberg, Amazon is scaling back heavily on MMOs overall but preserving select projects. These include March of Giants, a strategy title from Amazon Games Montreal; a new Tomb Raider game at Crystal Dynamics; ""casual and AI-focused games"" for the Luna cloud gaming service; and an untitled racing game from UK-based Maverick Games. Amazon will also maintain publishing deals for external titles like Lost Ark and Throne & Liberty in Western markets.","Amazon has quietly shelved its ambitious 'The Lord of the Rings' Massively Multiplayer Online game.

How Amazon CEO Andy Jassy ‘warned’ employees about thousands of layoffs months in advance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/will-need-more-people-doing-how-amazon-ceo-andy-jassys-employee-memo-warned-about-thousands-of-layoffs-months-in-advance/articleshow/124980700.cms,"Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon

Mayhem at Amazon Amid 30,000 Job Cuts: AI - Easy Corporate Excuse? | Global Pulse

CEO Andy Jassy urged staff to embrace AI or risk being left behind

From warning to reality: 14,000 jobs cut despite record profits





Amazon CEO Andy Jassy warned employees in June 2025 that artificial intelligence would shrink the company's corporate workforce, four months before the company announced 14,000 job cuts on October 28. The early signal gave staff a preview of what would become one of the company's largest layoff rounds since the pandemic era.In a company-wide message dated June 17, Jassy explicitly stated that AI adoption would fundamentally reshape Amazon's staffing needs. ""We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,"" he wrote, adding that the company expected ""this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively.""Jassy framed the changes as essential to maintaining Amazon's competitive edge in the AI revolution. He described generative AI as ""the most transformative technology since the Internet"" and emphasized the company's commitment to operating like ""the world's largest start-up—customer-obsessed, inventive, fast-moving, lean, scrappy.""The CEO outlined Amazon's ambitious AI roadmap, revealing that the company had over 1,000 generative AI services and applications in development.He urged employees to embrace the transformation, attend AI workshops, and experiment with the technology. ""Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact,"" Jassy wrote.When the layoffs materialized in late October, affected employees received termination emails from Beth Galetti, senior vice president of People Experience and Technology. The cuts represented approximately 4% of Amazon's 350,000 corporate workforce and marked the deepest job reductions since 27,000 positions were eliminated between late 2022 and early 2023.The timing drew scrutiny as Amazon reported $18 billion in quarterly profits and planned capital expenditures exceeding $120 billion for the year—a nearly 50% increase from 2024, largely directed toward AI and cloud infrastructure development.Galetti's October message echoed Jassy's June warning, stating that AI was ""enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before"" and necessitated a leaner organizational structure. Reuters reported that total job cuts could reach 30,000 employees, with additional reductions expected in January 2026 after the holiday shopping season.Affected employees received 90 days of full pay and benefits, severance packages, and job placement assistance as part of their transition support.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy warned in June 2025 that artificial intelligence would shrink the company's corporate workforce.

CEO Jensen Huang eyes another record after Nvidia’s $5 trillion valuation: ‘I think we are probably the first technology company in history…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ceo-jensen-huang-eyes-another-record-after-nvidias-5-trillion-valuation-i-think-we-are-probably-the-first-technology-company-in-history/articleshow/124965373.cms,"Donald Trump to discuss 'Super Duper' chip with Chinese President Xi Jinping







Nvidia made history this week by becoming the world's first company to reach a $5 trillion market capitalisation but CEO Jensen Huang is already eyeing a next record. He revealed the chipmaker has secured billions in orders for its AI processors -- a level of revenue visibility that he says is unmatched in the technology industry.“I think we are probably the first technology company in history to have visibility into half a trillion dollars [in revenue],” Huang said, referring to orders for the company’s current Blackwell generation and upcoming Rubin chips scheduled to launch next year.At Nvidia's GTC developer conference in Washington, Huang disclosed the company has secured more than $500 billion in orders for AI chips through the end of 2026, according to Fortune.The massive order backlog provides Nvidia with extraordinary confidence about future revenue—a level of predictability rare in the technology sector, where demand can shift rapidly and product cycles create uncertainty.During the conference, Huang announced that Nvidia is manufacturing its Blackwell GPUs in full production at a facility in Arizona—a move he attributed to Trump's push to bring manufacturing back to the United States.The potential for expanded access to China's market added momentum to Wednesday's gains. President Donald Trump said aboard Air Force One that he planned to discuss Nvidia's Blackwell chip with Chinese President Xi Jinping during their meeting Thursday in Busan, South Korea.Trump praised the Blackwell processor as “super duper” and claimed it is “probably 10 years ahead of any other chip”.The discussion carries enormous implications for Nvidia, which has been effectively locked out of China—previously one of its largest markets—due to US export controls and Chinese government restrictions on American chip purchases.Huang confirmed earlier in October that the company's market share in China had plummeted from 95% to zero. The loss has cost Nvidia billions in revenue, with the company reporting only $2.8 billion from China in its most recent quarter, down from $15.5 billion in the prior period.Meanwhile, Nvidia has also entered into a deal as part of which the chipmaker will supply more than 260,000 Blackwell AI chips to South Korea. As reported by Reuters, the deal comes despite the chips being subject to US national security export restrictions, underscoring the strategic importance of AI hardware in global tech alliances. The report adds that the chips made by Nvidia will be distributed across South Korea’s public and private sectors, including players like Samsung, SK Group and Hyundai Motor Group, to power large-scale AI data centers and “AI factories. ” These facilities are said to support advancements in robotics, semiconductors, cloud infrastructure and autonomous vehicles.",N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says the company has secured more than $500 billion in orders for AI chips through the end of 2026.

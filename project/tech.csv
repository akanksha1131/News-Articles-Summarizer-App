What may be behind Tesla's 'change of heart'





Tesla is reportedly planning to do what the company has never done. In fact, not only something that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has stayed away from, but also what he has resisted for many-many years. According to a report by Bloomberg, Tesla is developing support for Apple's CarPlay system in its vehicles, working to add one of the most highly requested features by customers. The move is seen as a sharp reversal for a company that long resisted one of the auto industry’s most popular infotainment features.The electric-vehicle maker has begun internal testing of CarPlay, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the project remains confidential.Apple CarPlay, widely supported by other automakers, mirrors a simplified, vehicle-optimized version of the iPhone’s interface and is considered essential by many car buyers. Other major automakers, including Ford, General Motors and Hyundai, already offer Apple CarPlay across most of their lineups.If adopted, the move would mark a notable shift for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, who has for years rejected customer calls to integrate CarPlay.Musk has frequently criticized Apple’s practices — especially its App Store rules — and was incensed when the tech giant hired away Tesla engineers during its now-abandoned electric-car effort.Tesla has discussed launching CarPlay support in the coming months, though timelines remain fluid and the feature could be delayed or shelved, the people told Bloomberg. The automaker has a history of pausing or canceling features even after lengthy development cycles.The company currently relies on its proprietary infotainment platform, which includes Tesla-specific messaging tools, a browser and other in-house apps. Tesla’s resistance to allowing Apple greater access to vehicle systems was partly rooted in concerns that Apple intended to compete directly in electric vehicles — an ambition that ended in 2024 with the cancellation of the Titan project.The shift comes as Tesla faces softening demand, with some prospective buyers citing the absence of CarPlay as a reason to avoid the brand. Roughly one-third of consumers say the lack of CarPlay or Google’s Android Auto would be a deal-breaker, according to a 2024 McKinsey & Co. survey.Tesla is testing CarPlay within a windowed environment that sits inside its existing interface, Bloomberg reported. That means the Tesla operating system will continue to dominate the screen, unlike in many vehicles where CarPlay can take over entirely.CarPlay will not integrate with Tesla-specific features such as the Full Self-Driving system. Drivers will need to rely on Tesla’s native navigation for those capabilities. CarPlay will be supported wirelessly, allowing drivers to sync their iPhones without plugging in a cable, as per the report.Tesla plans to use the standard version of CarPlay rather than the Ultra version appearing in some Aston Martin and other high-end models. The standard variant, revamped in iOS 26, adds widgets for weather, calendars and similar information.","Tesla is reportedly developing support for Apple's CarPlay system in its vehicles.

Verizon layoffs: Largest telecom company in America may cut thousands of jobs as new CEO Dan Schulman takes over; here's what he said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/verizon-layoffs-largest-telecom-company-in-america-may-cut-thousands-of-jobs-as-new-ceo-dan-schulman-takes-over/articleshow/125306006.cms,"Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency

Verizon CEO Dan Schulman: Do no believe in increasing prices for growth





America's largest telecom company Verizon Communications is reportedly preparing to announce companywide job cuts as soon as next week. According to a report by Bloomberg, quoting people familiar with the matter, layoffs at Verizon mark one of the most significant steps yet in new Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman’s turnaround strategy. While final decisions are still being made, Verizon is considering eliminating 10,000 to 15,000 positions, one person said. The carrier had just under 100,000 employees at the end of 2024.The layoffs would spare Verizon’s unionized workforce, including employees at a limited number of retail outlets, the people said. Schulman, who took over as CEO last month, has outlined an aggressive plan to claw back market share after several quarters of subscriber losses.In a separate shift, the company is also preparing to convert roughly 200 company-owned stores into franchises, the Wall Street Journal reported.Schulman, the former CEO of PayPal Holdings, was appointed to replace Hans Vestberg after Verizon posted two straight quarters of subscriber declines and continued to trail its largest rivals on stock performance. The company then reported a third consecutive drop in mobile subscribers in the third quarter.Upon taking the helm, Schulman vowed to “aggressively transform our culture, our cost structure, and the financial profile of Verizon in order to put our customers first, compete effectively, and deliver sustainable returns for our shareholders.”Last month CEO Dan Schulman said that Verizon needs aggressive change including ""cost transformation, fundamentally restructuring our expense base. ... We will be a simpler, leaner and scrappier business."" Schulman, who has served on Verizon's board for seven years, has said that he does not want to hike prices and seeks to be more customer-focused. ""Our financial growth has relied too heavily on price increases, a strategic approach that relies too much on price without subscriber growth is not a sustainable strategy,"" he said.","Verizon Communications is reportedly preparing to announce companywide job cuts as soon as next week.

Did Meta’s AI chief LeCun get removed for criticising LLMs and AI? Social media fuels speculations of an ‘AI cult’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/did-metas-ai-chief-lecun-get-removed-for-criticising-llms-and-ai-social-media-fuels-speculations-of-an-ai-cult/articleshow/125304570.cms,"

A growing rift between LeCun and the industry

How AI gets smart: Unlocking LLMs



Social media reactions spark claims of an “AI cult”



The hype machine and the risks of “replacing humans”

Evidence supporting LeCun’s scientific concerns

Meta’s silence leaves room for speculation



A debate that reflects an industry at a crossroads





Yann LeCun’s upcoming departure from Meta has ignited a storm of online discussions, with social media users questioning whether his outspoken criticism of large language models (LLMs) contributed to his marginalisation within the company. The news has intensified debates about whether Big Tech’s AI leadership tolerates dissent or whether an online-coined “AI cartel” is quietly shaping the industry’s direction — pushing hype, suppressing alternative ideas and positioning LLMs as the only viable path forward because it benefits the companies that dominate the market.LeCun, one of the pioneers of modern machine learning and a Turing Award laureate, has long argued that LLMs are not a credible path toward human-level intelligence.He has repeatedly described them as limited “autocomplete machines” that lack foundational cognitive pillars such as reasoning, planning and causal understanding. This stance increasingly put him at odds with the dominant industry narrative that positions LLMs as the foundation for future AGI.He reportedly plans to leave Meta to build a startup focused on open-ended learning and world-modelling approaches.Insiders note that Meta’s strategic shift toward rapid LLM commercialisation has already reduced the influence of fundamental research groups, including those aligned with LeCun’s vision.Many observers argue that this shift is driven not only by scientific ambition but also by enormous commercial incentives. LLMs generate attention, attention attracts investment, and investment strengthens the commercial position of the biggest AI players — creating strong motivation to maintain the perception that scaling these models is the only path worth pursuing.A widely shared social media thread intensified the controversy. The post characterised the AI community as a “cult” that aggressively protects the LLM-centric agenda and sidelines anyone who questions it. According to this view, LeCun’s criticisms made him an outsider in an environment that increasingly rewards alignment over dissent.Supporters of this perspective argue that the concentration of AI resources in a handful of companies creates cartel-like dynamics. These firms shape public narratives, control funding pipelines and set research agendas in ways that discourage alternative thinking. Many users noted that this hype-driven model pressures the public, investors and even policymakers into believing that LLMs are the inevitable future.These claims remain speculative and reflect social-media discourse rather than confirmed evidence. However, they do capture growing public anxieties about transparency, power concentration and the ability of major AI companies to steer both imagination and investment in directions that serve their commercial interests.Another theme emerging across social media is the belief that major AI companies intentionally amplify the narrative that AI will replace humans in order to maximise perceived value and market dominance. Critics argue that such messaging attracts massive investment flows from venture capital, governments and corporate clients eager not to be “left behind.”While advancement in AI is necessary, critics warn that portraying AI as a replacement for humans — rather than a tool to assist them — is neither realistic nor welcome. They argue that the race to make everything effortless or automated may create long-term consequences: degradation of human skills, job displacement, economic instability and over-reliance on systems whose limitations are still poorly understood.These concerns intertwine with broader suspicions that what some online users call an “AI cartel” thrives not on scientific consensus but on market psychology and narrative control.LeCun’s scepticism is grounded in more than opinion. Multiple peer-reviewed studies have documented significant limitations in current LLMs, particularly in tasks requiring causal reasoning, long-term planning and grounded understanding. For example, NeurIPS-era evaluations such as CLadder and related papers show that LLMs often struggle on structured causal-inference benchmarks and rely on superficial statistical shortcuts in certain tasks.The exact performance varies by benchmark and prompting method, but the recurring finding across studies is clear: current LLMs lack reliable causal reasoning — a capability LeCun considers essential for progress toward human-level intelligence.For LeCun, such results underscore the need for hybrid systems that integrate perception, planning, world models and grounded learning, rather than relying exclusively on scale. His upcoming startup is expected to pursue these alternative research directions.Meta has not addressed claims that LeCun faced internal pushback, nor has it confirmed whether his departure was voluntary, strategic or linked to disagreements about the company’s increasing focus on LLM products. The absence of clarity has allowed speculation to spread across X, Reddit and other social platforms.Some analysts caution against assuming conflict, noting that senior researchers often leave major firms to pursue independent ventures. Others argue that the timing suggests deeper philosophical disagreements about the future of AI and the growing dominance of corporate-driven LLM development.LeCun’s exit comes at a moment when the AI field is sharply divided. One side believes LLMs are on the path to general intelligence and should be scaled aggressively. The other warns that scaling alone will reach its limits and that breakthroughs will require fundamentally new architectures.Whether LeCun’s departure was shaped by corporate politics, strategic misalignment or personal ambition, the broader debate it has triggered speaks to a deeper tension running through the AI world: the conflict between scientific diversity and commercial monoculture.As long as a small number of companies control the resources, investment flows and public messaging, questions about openness, dissent and the possibility of what some online users call an “AI cartel” or “AI cult” will remain central to discussions about the future of artificial intelligence.",Yann LeCun’s upcoming departure from Meta has ignited a storm of online discussions.

European carmakers still ‘worried’ as Chinese chip company Nexperia’s internal dispute continues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/european-carmakers-still-worried-as-chinese-chip-company-nexperias-internal-dispute-continues/articleshow/125304596.cms,"Representative Image

""devastating""

""very challenging""

What European carmakers said about Nexperia’s ongoing internal dispute



“that is going to end if we don’t get these wafers coming out of Germany and the EU”,

“Our plea is that Nexperia China and Nexperia EU come together and actually start to resume normal operations because what’s happening is just inexplicable and it is devastating for hundreds of industries,”

“Our teams are working around the clock to find alternative sources. We have probably got a few weeks' supply, but we need this to get resolved quickly,”

“We welcome the Chinese announcement lifting export controls. But we will not have enough chips to meet global demand as long as there are restrictions on the export of wafers to China. We are moving in the right direction but it is not solved yet.”

“dynamic and uncertain”.

“no impact on production at the vehicle manufacturing plants of the Volkswagen brand in Germany”,

“serious governance shortcomings”.

“sending unauthorised letters with false information to customers, subcontractors, third party suppliers and employees”.

“There have not been any export controls imposed by the Netherlands or Brussels at Nexperia or other companies regarding this matter now or in the past.”





European carmakers are facing achip shortage despite China having eased its export ban on Nexperia chips, industry officials have warned. This shortage reportedly threatens to halt global production lines within weeks. The problem stems from an internal dispute where the Dutch arm of chipmaker Nexperia has stopped sending key silicon wafers to its Chinese subsidiary for assembly, worsening the supply crisis. The ongoing hostility between the Dutch-based operations and the Chinese-owned subsidiary is creating a bottleneck for basic, low-margin Nexperia chips critical for car components, including airbags, lighting, and window controls. While Beijing recently lifted its initial export restrictions, the internal Nexperia feud is now the primary cause for thesituation facing the automotive sector.Nexperia's supply chain is crucial as wafers are manufactured in the UK, Netherlands, and Germany before being sent to its Chinese arm for assembly and subsequent re-export. According to a report by The Financial Times, some chip shipments have resumed following China's move; the Dutch side's continued refusal to supply its Chinese partner is keeping the industry in a precarious state, with major global carmakers remaining highly concerned about potential production shutdowns.While the Chinese facility still had some wafers in stock,an executive at one carmaker (who remains unnamed) told the FT, noting that the company had only a few weeks of chip supplies remaining.the executive warned. He also noted that carmakers are working to prevent a global shortage.the executive added.Supplies at the Chinese facility are expected to last until early to mid-December, according to one official, though the situation could shift as Nexperia China seeks alternative wafer sources. To avoid broader supply-chain issues, it may also slow production.Acea, which represents EU carmakers, said:Meanwhile, German carmaker Volkswagen said that the situation remainedThe supply shortage had so far hadbut it said future disruptions could not be ruled out.The latest issue started from a struggle for control of the Chinese operation.

Tech leaders sway President Trump on National Guard deployment in San Francisco



The Federal Government was preparing to “surge” San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress. I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around. I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove.

I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a “shot.” Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!

Mayor Lurie confirms federal withdrawal







US President Donald Trump has revealed that he has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco. He cited calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, for the decision which can be seen as a political victory for San Francisco’s newly-elected Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump confirmed that the federal government was preparing to “surge” the city but was convinced to hold off.“Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” Trump wrote. He added that he also spoke with Mayor Lurie, noting that the mayor “was making substantial progress” on crime. Here’s Trump’s full post on Truth Social.The decision to deploy force had become a major flashpoint, particularly after Benioff initially told the New York Times that he supports Trump’s idea of federal troops being sent to the city. This was also backed by tech figures Elon Musk and AI Czar David Sacks.However, Benioff publicly backtracked last week in the wake of criticism.“Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” he posted on X.Mayor Lurie, meanwhile, confirmed the outcome of the negotiations, according to CNBC.“The president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said in a statement.“We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” Lurie added.","US President Donald Trump has shelved plans to deploy federal forces, including the National Guard, in San Francisco.

His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees. The ad-supported service is expected to provide users with access to:The company is reportedly testing a model where users will view approximately two minutes of pre-roll advertisements before a game starts streaming. Internal testing also features limits on playtime, including a one-hour session limit and a maximum of five hours of free streaming per month. These restrictions are subject to change before the official launch, the report noted.The free tier is expected to be widely available across PC, Xbox consoles, handheld devices and web browsers. The report also said that a public beta test is expected soon, with a full launch expected in the coming months.Recently, a report suggested that Microsoft has demanded much higher profits from its Xbox gaming division than what's typical in the video game industry. Bloomberg claimed that the tech giant has told the Xbox unit that it must achieve 30% “accountability margins” – Microsoft's term for profit margins – across all its gaming operations.Citing financial research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, the publication says that the average profit margin in the video game industry typically ranges between 17% and 22%.

Auto giant Stellantis ex-CEO Carlos Tavares says: Tesla may not exist in 10 years; Chinese company ... may 'kill' it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/auto-giant-stellantis-ex-ceo-carlos-tavares-says-tesla-may-not-exist-in-10-years-chinese-company-may-kill-it/articleshow/124803132.cms,"Tesla Arrives In India: Smooth Ride Or Bumpy Road Ahead?





Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years. Tavares told French newspaper Les Echos that Tesla is facing growing pressure from China’s BYD which, according to a Fortune report, overtook it in global EV sales earlier this year.“We can't rule out that at some point, he'll decide to leave the automotive industry to refocus on humanoid robots, SpaceX , or artificial intelligence,” Tavares said, adding “Elon Musk will have left the automotive industry”.Tavares pointed out that Musk’s focus is split between several companies, such as SpaceX and his AI ventures. He attributed BYD’s success to the company’s efficiency and cost-effective vehicles.“Tesla's stock market value loss will be colossal because this valuation is simply stratospheric,” he said. “I'm not sure that Tesla will still exist in 10 years. It's an innovative group, but they'll be beaten by BYD's efficiency.”Tesla announced its third-quarter earnings recently, posting revenue of $28.1 billion — a 12% increase compared to last year. The growth was driven by a 33% rise in deliveries from China, its second-biggest market after the U.S.Despite the growth, Tesla’s market share in China has fallen sharply to around 5%, down from 16% in 2020, as competition from local automakers such as BYD, Nio, and XPeng intensifies.Industry analysts say the drop highlights Tesla’s struggle to maintain dominance in the world’s largest EV market, where domestic brands are rapidly expanding with cheaper models and advanced technology.In another news, Tesla has proposed Elon Musk a 10-year pay package worth $1 trillion, tied to big goals like raising the company’s market value by 500% to $8.5 trillion. Earlier, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended the proposal, saying, “If you prefer that Tesla turn into just another car company mired in the ways of the past, then you should follow ISS and Glass Lewis”.","Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has said that Elon Musk-led EV maker Tesla may face a steep challenge in the coming 10 years.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

AI Assistant for farmers in India and Africa







Microsoft Research has launched Project Gecko, a new global initiative aimed at bridging the language and cultural gaps that currently hinder generative AI systems from serving the majority of the world's population. The initiative focuses on creating cost-effective, adaptable AI that leverages local languages and cultural contexts.According to the company, Project Gecko addresses the problem that many global communities are underrepresented in the data used to train large AI models, causing these tools to struggle with local languages and fail to provide relevant expertise.One of Project Gecko's key initiatives is FarmerChat, an AI-powered assistant developed in collaboration with Digital Green.FarmerChat is designed to provide agricultural extension workers and smallholder farmers in India and East Africa with timely, localised guidance in their preferred languages.By combining speech, text, and video interactions, FarmerChat enables farmers to obtain actionable, context-specific recommendations. This specialised guidance is intended to improve agricultural productivity and resilience against climate and resource challenges.Microsoft says that Project Gecko brings together researchers from Microsoft Research centers in India, Africa, and the US, alongside partners like Digital Green, to develop foundational frameworks that support truly global AI.The team has developed new AI frameworks, including MMCTAgent and VeLLM, which are designed to enhance reasoning across text, voice, and video interactions. These innovations support crucial local languages such as Hindi, Swahili, and Kikuyu.Notably, Meta AI has also built a single AI model, claiming that it is the first to translate across 200 different languages with a quality that has been validated through extensive evaluations for each of them.","Project Gecko is a new global initiative aimed at bridging the language and cultural gaps that currently hinder generative AI systems.

OpenAI's chip strategy







Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company’s partnership with OpenAI gives it access to all of OpenAI's intellectual property except consumer hardware, providing Microsoft with AI capabilities that reduce concerns about Google’s competition in the field. OpenAI, on its part, has also struck deals with Nvidia, AMD and Google for AI chips, data centers and AI model training.During a podcast, Nadella explained the scope of Microsoft's access to OpenAI's technology. When asked if Microsoft has access to OpenAI's IP, Nadella responded: “In our case, the good news here is OpenAI has a program in which we have access to.”When pressed about whether Microsoft has access to all of it, Nadella confirmed: “All of it.”“So the only IP you don't have is consumer hardware?” the interviewer asked, to which Nadella responded, “That's it”.“By the way, we gave them a bunch of IPs as well to bootstrap them, right? So, this is one of the reasons why they had a mass because we built all these supercomputers together, and they benefited from it. Rightfully so,” Nadella added.Microsoft has delayed mass production of its next-generation Maia AI chips until 2026, according to a previous report from The Information.The tech giant pushed mass production of the new AI chips, codenamed Braga, back by at least six months. Braga is expected to be renamed Maia 200 upon release.Microsoft had planned to deploy the Braga chip into data centers this year, but delays attributed to unanticipated design changes, staffing constraints and high turnover made this impossible.While Microsoft's Maia chips face delays, Google's Tensor Processing Units have become a preferred option for training AI models. The TPUs have established themselves as reliable hardware for AI development, giving Google an advantage in the AI infrastructure market.Google designed its TPUs specifically for machine learning workloads and has refined them through multiple generations. The chips are widely available through Google Cloud and have been used to train major AI models, making them a proven option for AI developers.In addition to influencing Microsoft's chip development efforts, OpenAI is building its own AI chips in partnership with Broadcom.

Spotify Premium Lite , Premium Standard, Premium Platinum: What you get with each subscription plan

New users only, for now





Spotify is splitting its Premium subscription in India into three separate tiers, introducing options that range from Rs 139 to Rs 299 per month. The revamp means subscribers now have more choices, but accessing all the features Spotify has on offer will cost more than it used to.The move effectively raises prices for subscribers who want the full experience. What used to cost Rs 139 as an individual Premium plan now requires paying Rs 199 for Standard, or splurging on the Rs 299 Platinum tier to unlock lossless audio and AI features.Premium Lite, the entry point at Rs 139, covers the basics: ad-free listening with 160kbps audio quality, but no offline downloads. It's essentially the old plan stripped down to its essentials.Premium Standard at Rs 199 brings back offline support and bumps audio quality to 320kbps—the features most users expect from a paid music service. There's also a Student plan at Rs 99 with the same perks.The real talking point is Premium Platinum. At Rs 299, it's more than double the old individual plan price. But you get lossless audio streaming for the first time in India, plus Spotify's AI DJ that introduces songs with commentary, AI-powered playlist creation, and integration with DJ software like rekordbox and Serato.The plan also lets two additional household members create separate accounts.Spotify says existing subscribers keep their current plans and pricing, though they can upgrade if they want. The new structure only applies to fresh sign-ups in India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and the UAE—markets where Spotify sees room to grow.The company's betting that listeners fall into distinct camps: casual streamers who just want music without ads, everyday users who need offline access, and audiophiles willing to pay premium rates for lossless quality and advanced features.","Spotify has introduced a tiered Premium subscription in India, with plans ranging from Rs 139 to Rs 299.

The European Commission has launched an antitrust investigation into Google's spam policy following complaints from publishers who say the policy has reduced their revenues, a report has said, adding that this probe puts Alphabet's Google at risk of another substantial fine from regulators in the European Regulators (EU). This comes over a year after Google implemented stricter measures against companies manipulating its search algorithm to boost rankings for other sites, the report added.The European Commission said its monitoring shows Google is demoting news media and other publishers’ websites and content in Google search results when those sites include content from commercial partners. The Commission said Google’s policy appears to directly impact a common and legitimate method for publishers to generate revenue from their websites and content, Reuters reported.“We are concerned that Google's policies do not allow news publishers to be treated in a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory manner in its search results,” EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera said in a statement.German media company ActMeraki filed a complaint with the Commission in April, claiming Google's spam policy penalizes websites. The European Publishers Council, the European Newspaper Publishers Association and the European Magazine Media Association have voiced similar concerns.“We will investigate to ensure that news publishers are not losing out on important revenues at a difficult time for the industry, and to ensure Google complies with the Digital Markets Act (DMA),” Ribera added.Google rejected the EU competition enforcer's concerns, arguing the investigation risks degrading search result quality.“The investigation announced today into our anti-spam efforts is misguided and risks harming millions of European users. And the investigation is without merit: a German court has already dismissed a similar claim, ruling that our anti-spam policy was valid, reasonable, and applied consistently,” said Pandu Nayak, chief scientist at Google Search.He said Google’s anti-spam policy helps level the playing field by preventing websites from using deceptive tactics to outrank websites competing based on their own content merit.The EU investigation operates under the Digital Markets Act, which aims to limit Big Tech power. Violations of the DMA can result in fines up to 10% of a company's global annual sales. Google has faced multiple EU antitrust actions in recent years.

Ernie AI model gets multimedia upgrade







Baidu has unveiled two new proprietary semiconductors for artificial intelligence (AI), along with a major update to its Ernie large language model (LLM). The company emphasised that the new products are designed to provide Chinese firms with powerful, low-cost, and domestically controlled computing power, directly addressing tensions that restrict access to advanced AI chips produced by companies like Nvidia.The announcements were made at Baidu’s annual Baidu World technology conference on Thursday (November 13).According to a report by news agency Reuters, Baidu, which has been developing proprietary chips since 2011, announced two distinct processors scheduled for release over the next two years:M100: An inference-focused chip set to launch in early 2026. Inference involves using existing AI models to make predictions and process user requests.M300: A more powerful chip capable of handling both training and inference, slated for release in early 2027. Training is the process of building AI models by teaching them patterns from vast datasets.Baidu also announced two new ""supernode"" products. These systems use advanced networking to link multiple chips, aiming to compensate for limitations in the performance of individual processors. Tianchi 256, which will comprise 256 of Baidu's P800 chips, will be available in the first half of next year.A more powerful version utilising 512 of the P800 chips is scheduled for launch in the second half of next year.Huawei has also deployed a similar product called CloudMatrix 384. That system, comprising 384 of its Ascend 910C chips, is considered by some industry observers to be more powerful than Nvidia's GB200 NVL72, one of the US chipmaker’s most advanced system-level products.Alongside the hardware push, Baidu unveiled a new version of its Ernie LLM. The company stated that the updated model significantly improves its capabilities, excelling not only at traditional text processing but also at advanced image and video analysis.","Baidu unveils two new AI chips for training and inference.

Explained: How Meta made billions from scam ads,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-how-meta-made-billions-from-scam-ads/articleshow/125300864.cms,"

What the internal documents revealed



How Meta’s systems amplified the problem

Meta’s defence

Why this matters

1. Billions riding on harmful content

2. Real-world harm for users

3. Algorithms built for engagement, not safety

4. Global regulatory scrutiny is intensifying

A recurring pattern





Meta, the company behind Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is under scrutiny after leaked internal documents revealed that it expected a significant portion of its 2024 revenue to come from ads linked to scams, fraud and banned products. The disclosures raise uncomfortable questions about how the world’s largest social-media advertising platform polices harmful content — and whether its business incentives undermine those efforts.According to the leaked material, Meta estimated that around 10 percent of its 2024 ad revenue — roughly $16 billion — could come from ads that violate its own policies. These include fraudulent e-commerce schemes, illegal online casinos, deceptive investment promotions and ads pushing banned medical products.One internal report showed that users were being served an estimated 15 billion “higher-risk” ads every single day. Another document suggested that Meta’s current systems generate about $7 billion annually from ads linked to potentially fraudulent activity.Meta’s own ad-personalisation engine appears to have deepened the issue. When a user clicked on a scam ad, the system interpreted it as a sign of interest — and then showed the user more of the same.That turned countless victims into ideal targets for further fraud.Even more concerning were the “High Value Accounts” — big-spending advertisers that were allowed to run ads despite repeated rule violations. In some cases, these accounts accumulated hundreds of “strikes” without being shut down. The more money an advertiser spent, the more leeway they seemed to receive.Meta has rejected the conclusions drawn from the leak, calling the revenue estimates “rough” and “overly inclusive,” and arguing that the documents do not reflect the company’s full anti-fraud efforts. The company says user reports of scam ads have dropped by more than half over the past year, and insists it is investing heavily in detection tools, human moderation and AI controls.But Meta has not disputed the authenticity of the documents or the scale of the problem outlined in them.The revelation that billions of dollars may come from rule-breaking ads highlights a deep tension: Meta profits from the very content it is supposed to police.Scam ads are not harmless. Millions lose money to fake cryptocurrency schemes, fraudulent shopping sites and medical scams — many of which begin with a single click on Facebook or Instagram.Meta’s advertising engine rewards ads that generate clicks. Scam ads use emotional hooks, outrageous claims and fear tactics that drive engagement — and therefore reach more users.Governments worldwide are already pressuring Meta to compensate scam victims and strengthen ad screening. These leaks will only accelerate calls for tighter regulation, fines, and independent audits.This episode fits into a long-running pattern at Meta. Harmful content — whether political misinformation, pandemic hoaxes or manipulated videos — often goes unchecked until public pressure forces a response. The latest leaks suggest that scam ads are not outliers but have become deeply woven into the company’s advertising ecosystem.For regulators, the challenge now is clear: can a platform of Meta’s scale truly police scam ads without undermining its own revenue model? Or is the system simply too big — and too dependent on automated ad targeting — to clean itself up without external pressure?","Leaked documents reveal that Meta expected a significant portion of its 2024 revenue to come from ads linked to scams, fraud and banned products.

Texas: A new hub for innovation







Coinbase, the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange has announced its decision to leave Delaware and reincorporate in Texas, citing growing concerns over legal unpredictability and a more innovation friendly environment in the Lone Star State. This move made by Coinbase aligns the company with other tech and finance firms include Tesla and SpaceX that have exited Delaware in recent months. Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal recently posted a series of posts on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) and confirmed that the company has filed paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in order to shift its base to Texas.“Today @Coinbase is announcing our decision to leave Delaware and reincorporate in Texas. This decision was not made lightly, but we’ll always do what’s best for our customers, our employees, and our shareholders,” wrote Grewal.Tesla CEO Musk criticized Delaware’s legal system as unpredictable and hostile to innovation, warning that the state had become a liability for forward-thinking companies. In a recent post on X, he declared, “Delaware is the Titanic. Texas is the lifeboat,” signaling his belief that Texas offers a safer harbor for corporate governance and executive autonomy.Grewal also emphasised that this decision made by the company was mainly driven by a need for greater legal clarity and business autonomy. He also criticised the Delaware’s Chancery Court for producing “unpredictable outcomes” in recent years, which he said undermines corporate governance and innovation. “I’ve had great experiences in Delaware as a lawyer and judicial colleague, but the state no longer has a monopoly on corporate law. And it’s now facing stiff competition from other states that are innovating to offer the right environment for business and innovators to thrive,” said Grewal in a post shared on X.“Coinbase is not the first company to make this decision. We surely won’t be the last. What we are seeing is a return to a free market economy in all things, including regulation and judicial review,” added Grewal. Other firms that have recently left Delaware include Andreessen Horowitz, Roblox, Dropbox, and Pershing Square Capital, many of which have relocated to Texas or Nevada.Grewal also praised Texas for its predictable legal framework, citing Senate Bill 29, which codifies the business-judgment rule and supports efficient dispute resolution through the newly established Texas Business Court system. “Competition among states is healthy and it empowers businesses and innovators that are on ambitious paths. Texas’ corporate legal framework offers the right mix of efficiency, predictability, and fairness to be our home for incorporation,” wrote Grewal.“We remain laser focused on our mission to increase economic freedom by building the onchain economy. And today’s decision keeps us on that road,” concluded Grewal.Elon Musk’s reaction to Coinbase’s decisionTesla CEO Elon Musk has also responded to the decision made by Coinbase. Resharing Grewal’s post on X, Musk wrote, “Delaware continues to bleed companies …”.Coinbase’s move follows a similar path taken by Elon Musk, who reincorporated Tesla and SpaceX in Texas after a Delaware court voided his $56 billion pay package.","Coinbase, the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange has announced its decision to leave Delaware and reincorporate in Texas.

U.S. & China Edge Towards Ending Trade War | Global Pulse

Carmakers keen to insulate supply chain from geopolitical tensions

Why suppliers find it tough to move away from China





General Motors seems quite upset with the ongoing geopolitical tensions disrupting its supply chain across the globe. According to a report in Reuters, America's largest car company by markestshare General Motors (GM) GM has directed several thousand of its suppliers to scrub their supply chains of parts from China. The company's executives have reportedly been telling suppliers that they should find alternatives to China for their raw materials and parts, with the goal of eventually moving their supply chains out of the country completely.The Detroit carmaker has told suppliers to seek alternative sources for raw materials and components, with an eventual goal of fully unwinding China-linked supply lines, the people said.Some suppliers have been given a 2027 deadline to close China sourcing, they added. GM began approaching vendors about the plan in late 2024, but the push intensified this spring as U.S.-China trade hostilities deepened.Company executives have framed the effort as part of a broader strategy to boost supply chain “resiliency,” the people said. The U.S. auto industry has been whipsawed throughout 2025 by tariff swings under President Donald Trump, fears of rare-earth shortages and fresh concerns over chip availability — prompting companies to rethink their reliance on China, long a cornerstone of global automotive manufacturing.Carmakers have also been responding to Trump’s calls for domestic investment by expanding U.S. production. But executives increasingly believe that the political and economic wrangling between Washington and Beijing will endure, prompting some to accelerate moves to unwind decades-old sourcing ties.GM’s directive applies to parts used in vehicles built in North America, the company’s largest production region. While GM prefers suppliers based in the U.S., it is open to non-U.S. sources as long as they are outside China, the people said. The company’s list also flags Russia and Venezuela as restricted sources due to U.S. national-security rules, though China accounts for the bulk of the affected content.The automaker has already taken steps to reduce dependence on China for electric-vehicle batteries and semiconductors, including partnerships with a U.S. rare-earth firm and investment in a Nevada lithium project. The new initiative, sources said, covers a far wider range of basic components.Suppliers had already begun diversifying away from China during Trump’s first term to sidestep existing tariffs. But a new wave of China duties introduced this year prompted retaliatory curbs by Beijing — including April restrictions on rare-earth-containing auto parts and additional export limits in October. Those moves sent companies scrambling to secure inventory.Fresh alarm spread late last month when China halted shipments from chipmaker Nexperia following an intellectual-property dispute with Dutch authorities. The stoppage threatened production lines worldwide because Nexperia supplies inexpensive chips used throughout vehicle electronics.For many suppliers, disentangling from China is proving expensive and technically challenging. China dominates segments such as lighting, electronics and tool-and-die manufacturing, making substitutes hard to find.“It’s a big effort. Suppliers are scrambling,” an executive at a major parts manufacturer told Reuters. Collin Shaw, head of MEMA, the Vehicle Suppliers Association, said companies have been working to “de-risk” their supply chains by reducing exposure to China and other high-risk countries. But decades of investment and specialization inside China mean the transition will be slow.“In some cases this has been 20 or 30 years in the making, and we’re trying to undo it in a few years,” Shaw said. “It’s not going to happen that fast.”","General Motors (GM) has directed several thousand of its suppliers to scrub their supply chains of parts from China.

Elon Musk’s X fined 5 million euros in Spain for breaching crypto-ad rules: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-x-fined-5-million-euros-in-spain-for-breaching-crypto-ad-rules-report/articleshow/125298270.cms,"Elon Musk’s X fined 5 million euros in Spain

Spain tightens crypto ad rules: X under fire for failing checks



The fine and X’s violations



The CNMV’s sanction was issued on 3 November 2025, and published in the Official State Gazette later that month.

The specific breach: X, through its advertising mechanisms, allowed an unauthorised crypto-asset company (Quantum AI) to advertise investment services in Spain, without fulfilling its duty to verify authorisation status or check that the advertiser had been flagged by regulators.

The fine of €5 million reflects the CNMV’s decision in a heavily publicised sanction letter, which described the violation in strong terms (the full classification is available in the CNMV’s official publication).

X retains the right to appeal the decision before Spain’s highest administrative court.

Broader implications for X and digital-advertising platforms



The sanction signals increased regulatory down-pressure on large social-media platforms to screen and monitor financial-product advertising, especially crypto-assets, which are vulnerable to fraud and regulatory arbitrage.

For X specifically, the fine adds to a growing regulatory burden across Europe, where the platform is also under scrutiny under the Digital Services Act (DSA) for content-moderation and transparency failures.

Advertisers and platforms alike may face increased compliance costs, especially in jurisdictions where authorisation, listing checks, and ad-transparency obligations are tightening.

What this means for users and advertisers



Spanish advertisers of financial-product services, including crypto trading, investment advice and similar offerings, now face sharper obligations to ensure authorisation and regulatory transparency.

Users of X in Spain should note that unauthorised financial-product advertising may appear on the platform despite regulatory efforts, and they are encouraged to exercise caution, verify advertiser credentials independently, and rely on official authorised-provider lists maintained by the CNMV.

For platform operators, the ruling imposes a clear duty to implement compliance workflows verifying advertiser authorisation and cross-checking lists of warned entities, along with maintaining transparency about ad partners and financial-product campaigns.

Spanish regulators have taken decisive action against the social-media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, owned by Elon Musk, by imposing a fine of €5 million (about US $5.8 million) for failing to prevent unauthorised cryptocurrency advertising on its platform. The penalty was issued by the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV), Spain’s national securities regulator, and was officially dated 3 November 2025, with the public announcement made on 13 November 2025.The fine underscores growing regulatory emphasis in Spain and across Europe on holding online platforms accountable for the promotion of financial products and ensuring advertisements are properly authorised and vetted.In recent years, Spain has increasingly regulated the marketing of crypto-assets and other financial instruments on digital platforms. Since March 2023, online media, social networks and websites in Spain have been subject to rules requiring them to verify that advertisers offering financial services are authorised and not listed as warned or banned entities. The CNMV launched a formal investigation in November 2023 after detecting adverts for the crypto-investment company Quantum AI on X without proper authorisation. The investigation found that X had failed to check whether Quantum AI was authorised in Spain or appeared on the CNMV’s or foreign regulators’ warning lists.","Spain tightens crypto ad rules: X under fire for failing checks.

Did Silicon Valley Influence Trump's H-1B U-Turn? American Insider Reveals | WATCH





The Donald Trump administration is repositioning the H-1B visa program to bring in skilled foreign workers on a temporary basis to train Americans for high-tech roles, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview aired this week. Bessent’s comments follow President Donald Trump’s recent acknowledgment that the US must still attract specialised foreign talent in certain fields -- despite his administration’s otherwise hard-line immigration posture. H-1B visas allow American companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers for up to six years.Speaking to Fox News host Brian Kilmeade had two word description for America's need for foreign workers.Bessent described the revamped H-1B approach as a “knowledge transfer” strategy aimed at rebuilding America’s advanced manufacturing base after decades of offshoring.“For 20–30 years, we have offshored precision manufacturing jobs,” he said. “We can’t snap our fingers and recreate that overnight. We want to bring the semiconductor industry back to the U.S. There will be big facilities in Arizona.”Under Trump’s vision, he said, foreign experts would work in the U.S.for “three, five, or seven years” to train domestic workers before returning home, allowing Americans to eventually take over those roles.Addressing concerns that overseas hires could displace U.S. workers, Bessent countered that the domestic talent pool is not yet ready to meet the demand. “An American can’t have that job — not yet,” he said. “We haven’t built ships or semiconductors here for years. Overseas partners coming in, teaching American workers — that’s a home run.”Bessent added that the H-1B shift aligns with Trump’s broader push to repatriate critical industries, cut reliance on imports, and rebuild strategic manufacturing capacity.What Donald Trump said in support of H-1B visasThe issue resurfaced after Trump told Fox News’ Laura Ingraham in an interview that aired Tuesday that bringing foreign workers to the U.S. on H-1B visas is important to ""bring in talent"" to the U.S. While Ingraham argued that the U.S. has talent at home, Trump said that wasn’t the case.""No, you don’t. No, you don’t. You don’t have, you don’t have certain talents, and people have to learn!"" Trump said. ""You can’t take people off an unemployment line and say I’m gonna put you into a factory where we’re gonna make missiles.""","Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the U.S. is repositioning the H-1B visa program to bring in skilled foreign workers on a temporary basis to train Americans for high-tech roles.

How Mustafa Suleyman’s work-from-office requirements are different from Microsoft's





Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

""Much better for collaboration. Everyone can see everyone else who's in. You can feel the buzz —there's a real intensity about the place —and it just creates a lot more, like informal collaboration. It's so much better,”

""There's just huge talent density here. It's the place to be,”

“I don’t think that is work that people should be doing… it’s totally the wrong question.”





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman wants his team to follow ‘strict’ work-from-office rules. He wants an in-person working culture, with stricter requirements for working from the office than is standard across the rest of the company. In an interview with Business Insider, Suleyman revealed his preference for this structure and noted that his team is focused on concentrating their effort:Suleyman also highlighted that he generally favours open floor plans for his team, a workplace concept that can sometimes be polarising within Microsoft and the engineering community as a whole.Microsoft recently introduced a new return-to-office policy that requires most employees to work in the office at least 3 days a week starting January 26. However, Suleyman involves a minimum of four days a week for team members who live near an office, according to an internal document reviewed by Business Insider. Any exceptions must be approved by an executive who reports directly to him. Suleyman also said that he does not prefer traditional offices with closed doors.In one of his setups, he uses ""neighbourhoods"" with 20 to 30 open desks arranged close to one another.Suleyman notedThe AI executive also spends considerable time in Silicon Valley. Suleyman divides his schedule between Silicon Valley and Seattle. He said that most of his team is based in Silicon Valley rather than at Microsoft’s Redmond headquarters.he added.Microsoft allows individual organisations or teams to decide their return-to-office plans and office layouts. For example, the Corporate, External and Legal Affairs team has been working from the office at least four days a week for roughly a year, the report claims.Other AI-focused teams follow more flexible practices. Scott Guthrie's Cloud + AI organisation does not have specific return-to-office guidelines. Jay Parikh's Core AI group will adopt a three-day-a-week schedule for all offices starting in February, except for GitHub, the report cited internal documents to claim.Recently, Suleyman urged developers to avoid projects claiming AI can be conscious, saying only biological beings have this trait. He said:His stance contrasts with rising AGI and AI companion efforts.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman wants his team to follow ‘strict’ work-from- office rules.

Former Twitter CEO Parag Agarwal launched his AI startup called Parallel Web Systems in August this year. Now a Reuters report suggests that Agarwal has raised $100 million in Series A funding to build infrastructure that enables artificial intelligence agents to search the live web. The funding round values the company at $740 million and marks a major step in Agrawal’s vision to reshape how machines interact with online content.Parallel Web Systems is developing infrastructure that empowers AI agents—think of them as smart tools capable of handling complex computer tasks on your behalf. The core of Parallel's innovation lies in helping these AI agents efficiently search the web for the most accurate information.Agrawal told Reuters that the company aims to create a “new layer of the internet” optimized for machine use, enabling autonomous systems to access high-quality, up-to-date information.The Reuters report suggests that the Series A round of funding was led by Kleiner Perkins and Index Ventures, with participation from existing investors including Khosla Ventures. The report also adds that the funding will be used for the expansion of Parallel’s engineering team, scale its infrastructure, and secure licensing deals with online content owners.This follows a $30 million seed round in January 2024, bringing Parallel’s total funding to $130 million.Agrawal’s move into AI search reflects a broader industry trend toward agent-based computing, where AI systems operate independently to complete complex tasks. Parallel’s approach differs from traditional search engines by focusing on machine-to-machine interaction, rather than human queries. The startup’s technology is already being used by enterprise clients to power internal AI tools, and Agrawal believes it could become foundational to future applications in healthcare, finance, and logistics.",Parallel Web Systems is developing infrastructure that empowers AI agents.

"IBM chief scientist Ruchir Puri to engineering grads: Don't just think, 'I'm going to work for Google, Microsoft, IBM; you have to ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ibm-chief-scientist-ruchir-puri-to-engineering-grads-stop-chasing-/articleshow/125292013.cms,"The Truth About College Essays: Authenticity vs. Over-Engineering | Cracking Global Admissions 2025

IBM CEO Arvind Krishna echoed this same sentiment







IBM chief scientist Ruchir Puri has a piece of advice for the young engineering graduates. Speaking in an interview with Business Insider, Puri has advised the recent engineering graduates to broaden their job search and look beyond usual tech titans such as Google, Microsoft and even IBM itself. “Stop only chasing the tech giants everyone else is pining after. Don't just go for the standard 'I'm going to go and work for Google, Microsoft, IBM,' Ruchir Puri said. The advice from Puri comes at a time when the job market is seeing a shift and the demand for AI talent across industries is growing. Puri who has spent more than 30 years at IBM, emphasised that artificial intelligence is transforming every sector ranging from agriculture to retail. He also stressed on the fact that software engineers are increasingly needed in places that graduates might not consider.Explaining his point, Puri gave an example of John Deere, an agricultural equipment giant, as an example of a company making a measurable impact with technology, yet often overlooked by job seekers focused solely on Silicon Valley.He said job seekers should widen their search ""beyond a narrow set of technology companies"" and also consider the ""massive enterprise landscape.""The comments made by Puri come as fresh graduates are facing a challenging hiring landscape. According to an August report from Handshake, job postings dropped by 16% year-over-year, while the applications per job surged by 26%. The tech sector, despite its heavy investment in AI, has seen widespread layoffs in 2025, with cuts at Salesforce, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. IBM itself announced earlier this month that it would lay off thousands of employees from its global workforce in Q4.Puri also stressed that meaningful work can be found in industries undergoing digital transformation — including transportation, manufacturing, and energy — where software engineers play a vital role in reshaping operations and driving innovation. “You are impacting something that is fundamental to the global economy — and it’s not just about technology,” he said.IBM CEO Arvind Krishna also echoed the same sentiment as Puri. In a recent interview with CNN, Krishna said that the company is planning to increase hiring among recent college graduates in the coming year, especially in AI-focused roles. “People are talking about either layoffs or freezing hiring, but I actually want to say that we are the opposite,” Krishna told CNN last week. “I expect we are probably going to hire more people out of college over the next 12 months than we have in the past few years, so you’re going to see that. ”Krishna acknowledged that automation would inevitably lead to some reductions but stated that “on the net mix, it’s a plus for us.” He also shared advice for young graduates to focus on the right skills for the AI era.“Skills of people are really important,” Krishna said adding “We need skills in AI. We need skills in quantum. We need skills that our clients feel really good about technology being deployed in their environment.”","Ruchir Puri has advised recent engineering graduates to look beyond usual tech titans such as Google, Microsoft and even IBM itself.

“I’d like to join arms with other fellow interested parties and really advocate for a simpler regime here,”





Google-parent Alphabet’s President of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, Debbie Weinstein, has asked the European Union (EU) to simplify its complex and often conflicting regulations on artificial intelligence (AI) and technology. Speaking at Bloomberg's Women, Money & Power conference in London, Weinstein stated that the large number of rules hinders Silicon Valley companies' ability to do business in the EU. Weinstein pointed out that the EU has issued approximately 100 internet laws since 2019. Criticising the regulatory environment of the region, Weinstein said:At the event, Weinstein mentioned a recent Google product,which generate responses to search queries. The company had delayed its release in Europe for several months due to concerns about compliance with various laws. According to Weinstein, Google has not yet made the feature available in France.she noted.Google has been under scrutiny from European regulators for years, facing repeated fines over antitrust issues and criticism of its privacy practices. More recently, tech companies have voiced concerns about the EU’s AI Act, which governs large language models like Google’s Gemini.Weinstein, who was promoted to lead Google’s UK office in December 2024, said she is focused on advocating for changes to EU rules, without providing specific details. She highlighted that most business leaders she talks to express “universal frustration” with the bloc’s regulation.she added.Apart from Google, other tech companies have also taken stances against EU regulation. Apple recently called for the repeal of EU antitrust laws, while Meta and Apple have delayed feature launches, citing strict rules.Unlike Google, Meta also refused to sign the EU’s AI code of practice. These moves have support from US President Donald Trump, who has criticised EU tech and antitrust regulations. In August, Trump threatened new tariffs and export restrictions on advanced technology in response to digital services taxes affecting US companies.","Alphabet’s President of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, Debbie Weinstein, has asked the European Union to simplify its complex and often conflicting regulations on artificial intelligence (AI) and technology.

The company cautioned against international travel for those in the U.S. on H-1B visas, citing potential re-entry complications under the new policy, and offered support for those unable to return before the deadline.

Read Google’s full ‘urgent’ memo to H-1B visa holders

We are reaching out with an urgent update regarding international travel for individuals on H-1B visas.

A Proclamation is scheduled to take effect this Sunday at 12:01 AM ET. It introduces significant changes to re-entry procedures for H-1B visa holders currently outside the United States. We continue to review the Proclamation, but the initial advice we have received is that re-entry will require a mandatory payment of $100,000 per petition, which may cause substantial delays or prevent re-entry to the US

What You Need to Know:

If you are currently outside the US:

If you are currently outside the US with a valid H-1B visa, make plans to return and enter the US before the Proclamation takes effect on Sunday, September 21 at 12:01 am ET (i.e. by this Saturday night).

If you are currently in the US:

We strongly advise against any international travel if you are in valid H-1B status or need to travel to activate your H-1B visa. You should remain in the US

Departing the US may result in complications or denial of re-entry under the new policy.

If you are unable to return prior to the deadline in H-1B status: please reach out to go/immigration-help.

We understand this may create challenges, and we are here to support you. We are actively monitoring the situation and will keep you updated as we learn more.

Should you do an MBA? My views👇🏼

Most MBAs are outdated 🤷🏼

Better to learn how to build Products,

Best training ground if you want to accelerate your career or run a company one day.

That’s how I started. As a Product Manager.

Case studies and frameworks are nice, but they don’t teach you how to,

- Question the status quo

- Build deep empathy for customers

- Pursue global optima, not local wins

- Influence without authority

- Work backwards from the end state

That’s a Builder’s life.

It’s messy, political, creative, analytical — all at once.

A microcosm of real life, not classroom fluff.

That’s what helped me build companies, not the three-letter degree, although I do have one 🙈

So I tell young students & professionals to do an MBA, but a different kind. Do a Masters in Building Awesome things and you will graduate, not in 2 yrs, but every day 👨🏼‍🎓😎

Be a PM, Product Engineer, Product Designer, AI Builder, Hardware Designer, Robotics Engineer ….. heck, even a Toy Designer!

Because the 21st century will be led by builders who can also tell great stories 💪🏼

P:S - If you MUST do a top-tier MBA. Or hide for a few months & learn how to build, esp with AI 🤷🏼

Optus’ previous failures raise accountability questions





Australia's second-largest telecommunications provider Optus is facing mounting pressure after a 13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and caused 600 triple-zero calls to fail across multiple states. The September 19 network failure has prompted government investigations and renewed calls for accountability from the embattled telco.The outage primarily affected South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory, with some impact also recorded in far western New South Wales near the SA border, according to Reuters reporting. CEO Stephen Rue confirmed that established processes were not followed during a network firewall upgrade that began at 12:30 AM Thursday and lasted until approximately 1:30 PM (local time).Four deaths have been linked to the incident, though South Australian police later clarified that an eight-week-old boy's death in Gawler West was ""unlikely"" to have been caused by the outage delay. A 68-year-old Adelaide woman and two men aged 74 and 49 in Perth remain connected to the emergency services failure.The Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) reported that Optus received multiple customer complaints about the triple-zero failure as early as 9 AM Thursday, with five customers contacting the call center about the outage.However, these concerns were not properly escalated, and government authorities weren't informed until after the issue was resolved.Communications Minister Anika Wells expressed ""unbelievable disappointment"" that Australia was ""here again so quickly,"" referencing a similar 2023 incident. The Australian Media and Communications Authority (ACMA) chair Nerida O'Loughlin revealed her agency wasn't notified until more than 10 hours after the outage began, contrary to standard protocols.This marks the second major triple-zero outage for Optus in less than two years. The company was fined A$12 million in 2023 for failing to provide emergency call services to thousands during a nationwide outage and subsequently failing to conduct required welfare checks.The telecommunications giant, owned by Singapore Telecommunications, has faced a series of crises including a 2022 cyberattack affecting 9.5 million Australians and the 2023 outage that led to former CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin's resignation. Current CEO Stephen Rue took over in November 2024.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, speaking from New York, declined to say whether Rue should resign but indicated the government has ""action at its disposal"" pending investigation results. ACMA has launched a formal investigation, with Optus potentially facing fines exceeding $10 million and additional penalties.The company has promised full cooperation with all investigations while conducting its own internal review, with results to be made public.",13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and 600 triple-zero calls to fail.

Visa Chaos: Trump’s $100K H1-B Rule EXPLAINED; Who Pays & Who Escapes | WATCH

A side door for skilled professionals



Pros and cons of O-1B visa



The advantages of O-1B visa include:

No lottery or annual cap

Faster processing available

Renewable indefinitely

The drawbacks of O-1B visa are:

More subjective than H-1B, requiring proof of “extraordinary ability”

Some employers hesitate due to uncertainty in approval

Application costs can be higher than pre-hike H-1B fees

Some real world examples of O-1B visa



Entrepreneurs like Soundarya Balasubramani, who launched an educational venture in the U.S., are among the new wave of Indian applicants using the O-1 to bypass the H-1B bottleneck. “I got my O-1A approved as the solo founder and 100% owner of an educational venture,” she told ET.

Karan Vaidya, cofounder of AI startup Composio, said his O-1 visa cost less than $10,000 including legal fees, and praised its flexibility: “It’s a three-year visa that can be renewed indefinitely. I’m on my fifth O-1 now.”





US President Donald Trump’s executive order raising the H-1B visa application fee from $10,000 to $1,00,000 sent shockwaves in the tech industry. Due to the announcement last week many tech giants called back their professionals with H-1B visa back to the US. As the scrutiny around the traditional H-1B visa pathway making the process unpredictable, the skilled professionals are now planing to turn towards O-1 visa a lesser known route. The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.For those unaware, the O-1 Visa is introduced under the Immigration Act of 1990. The O-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields of education, science, athletics or arts. It enable the recipients to work in the US for up to three years and comes with unlimited renewals. The applicants of the O-1 visa much demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim and meet atleast three out of the eight criteria:After the unpredictable nature of popular H-1B visa, the O-1 visa is gaining a lot of traction among Indians who wish to go and work in the US. As per the report by Economic Times, Indian were granted 487 O-1A visas in FY 2020, this number was increased to 1,418 in FY 2023. With this increase, India became the third largest recipient of O-1 visa after UK and Brazil.Unlike the popularly H-1B visa which is capped at 85,000 visas annually and allocated via a lottery, the O-1 visa has no cap and the applications for it are accepted around the year. The applicants can also expedite the application process by submitting additional fees.Immigration consultant and O-1 holder Logan Ullyott told Business Insider: “The O-1 is an occupation-agnostic visa. You could get it if you’re an engineer, a researcher, an influencer, or even a cook — as long as you can prove you’re at the top of your field.”","The O-1 visa also known as the ‘Einstein visa’ is a specialised non-immigrant visa for individuals with ‘extraordinary ability’ in fields like STEM, arts, business, and sports.

NoiseFit Endeavour Pro: Built Like a Tank





Goldman Sachs has given new advice to workers with H1-B visas. This comes after President Donald Trump announced that companies must now pay $100,000 every year for each foreign worker on an H1-B visa. The new rule has forced big tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon to tell their visa workers to stay in America or come back before Sunday's deadline. Banks like JPMorgan have given the same warning. Goldman Sachs, which is the world's biggest investment bank, has told its H1-B workers to contact Fragomen if they have questions.

Read Sridhar Vembu’s complete post here



I have heard so many accounts from Sindhi friends about how their families had to leave everything and come to India during partition. They rebuilt their lives and Sindhis have done well in India.

I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time. Come back home. It may take 5 years to rebuild your lives but it will make you stronger.

Do not live in fear. Make the bold move. You will do well.

What it means for India







The entire technology and IT industry is in shock after US President Donald Trump announce massive five hike for H-1B visa. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application. After the announcement many tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others have asked their employees to return to US by September 21. Now, Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has also issued a piece of advice to Indian techies ‘come back to India to rebuild’. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Vemu drew parallel with the Partition of India in order to explain the current H-1B situation. He mentioned the stories of his Sindhi friends whose families were forced to leave everything but they eventually thrived after starting over again.“I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time.

He said that India today offer multiple opportunities as compared to that in the past. He also adds that those willing to take this leap will ultimately benefit from it.The hike in the visa fees could lead to reverse migration of skilled professionals, strengthening its domestic tech and startup ecosystem.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk responds



Political leaders weigh in







An ABC spokesperson recently confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely. The company decided to take the decision after the host of the show Jimmy Kimmel made some controversial comments on Charlie Kirk, linking his alleged killer to President Trump’s MAGA movement. MAGA – short for Make America Great Again is a political slogan, popularized by President Donald Trump during his election campaigns. During the late-night show, Kimmel made sharp comments stating that the MAGA gang is “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it”.Actor and filmmaker Ben Stiller was among the celebrities who has publicly defended Kimmel and has criticised the decision of ABC. In s post shared on social media platform X, Stiller wrote, “This isn’t right”.His brief but pointed reaction quickly went viral, with many fans and fellow entertainers echoing his sentiment that the suspension undermines free expression in comedy.Commenting on Ben Stiller’s post, Elon Musk supported the decision made by ABC and wrote, “He went full retard. Never go full retard.”This is not the first time that Musk has reacted to the controversy.Earlier this week after the Kimmel’s video clip from the show went viral, Musk said, “Jimmy Kimmel is disgusting”.The California Governor Gavin Newsom has also blasted the decision and has accused Republicans of orchestrating censorship. “They are censoring you in real time. It’s coordinated. And it’s dangerous,” wrote Newsom on X.On the other hand, commentator Davis Sirota suggested corporate politics were at play, noting that Nexstar, which has ties to ABC, is seeking regulatory approvals from the Trump administration.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump celebrated the suspension on Truth Social, calling it “Great News for America” and labeling Kimmel “ratings challenged” with “zero talent.”","ABC confirmed that the Jimmy Kimmel Live show will be suspended indefinitely.

What Preplexity AI CEO said about H-1B price hike



“Silicon Valley has always been welcoming to outsiders. The key challenge for someone coming from abroad is trust, finding credible people who will vouch for you, invest in you and mentor you, even if they might compete with you later.

Despite immigration hurdles, this is one of the few places in the world that is absolutely meritocratic. If users love your product and the data shows it, people support you.”

What Aravind Srinivas said to inspire Indian founders



“I am from India, and I want to show we can build companies, not just manage them. The best way to inspire is to go do it. In cricket, Indians are not just local stars, the world acknowledges the best. When I was growing up, my mother would say, ‘Get a job at Google.’ That was the big aspiration. Sundar Pichai becoming CEO was a proud moment for India, but it also reinforced the idea that Indians should run other people’s companies.

My hope is that the next generation sees it is possible to build the next Google, not just work there. I am not saying I alone will do it, but if more founders try to build at global scale, it will shift the mindset.”

Aravind Srinivas on Preplexity’s India business and partnership with Airtel





“India is our biggest market by user base right now and is growing very fast. The Airtel partnership continues on our carrier strategy that we have already run in other countries. These include Germany, Japan, South Korea, Spain. We did not want to start with India because the stakes are high. Airtel was a great fit. They have made a turnaround against Reliance Jio and now have strong positioning. After the Airtel launch, we quickly hit number one on the India iOS App Store, which showed a high overlap with iPhone users.

It was not one or two weeks of campaign that pushed up usage… The number of new users is significant and they’re retaining well and using the product a lot,”





Perplexity AI’s Indian-origin CEO, Aravind Srinivas, has shared his views on the recent hike in the H-1B visa fee. In a recent interview, he stated that the primary challenge for immigrants is not the recent increase in the H-1B visa fee, but instead finding trustworthy people who can vouch for, invest in, and mentor them. Despite the steep hike in H-1B visa fees under the Trump administration, Srinivas maintained that Silicon Valley remains a unique andplace for outsiders to build. He urged Indian founders to adopt a global ambition similar to cricket icons like Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli.In an interview with The Economic Times, Srinivas said:Srinivas also emphasised that Indians should strive to build global companies, not merely manage existing ones. While Sundar Pichai ’s rise as Google CEO was inspiring, it reinforced the idea of working rather than creating. The hope is that the next generation will believe in building the next Google, shifting the mindset toward global-scale entrepreneurship.He said:Srinivas also noted that India is now the company’s largest and fastest-growing market. Partnering with Airtel, which has regained strength against Jio, proved successful, driving the app to number one on the iOS App Store and attracting significant, highly engaged new users.he added.","Perplexity AI’s Indian-origin CEO, Aravind Srinivas, has shared his views on the recent hike in the H-1B visa fee.

From Intel support chips to Arm-based innovation: A billion-dollar pivot





Arm CEO Rene Haas credits his time at Nvidia for teaching him one of the most valuable leadership lessons: the power of bold, rapid decision-making. Speaking at the All-In Summit 2025 in September, Haas recalled a pivotal moment when Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang made a drastic strategic shift that reshaped the company's trajectory.During what was supposed to be a routine off-site meeting to review business roadmaps, Huang made an unexpected announcement that stunned the team. ""We're abolishing this product line. We're going to move 2,000 engineers off of project X onto project Y,"" Haas recounted, noting that Nvidia employed only about 6,000 people at the time.The abrupt decision moved engineers away from developing support chips for Intel processors and redirected them toward Arm-based designs and graphics chips. This pivot proved decisive in establishing Nvidia's dominance in the graphics and AI chip markets. Haas, who worked at Nvidia for seven years before joining Arm in 2013, described the moment as transformative.""You have this amazing set of characteristics of vision, speed, fearlessness, taking risk, and an ability to pivot very, very fast,"" Haas said of Huang during the conversation posted Wednesday. He emphasized how much he learned from witnessing such decisive leadership firsthand.Today, Nvidia remains one of Arm's flagship customers, with its latest AI chips combining Arm-based CPUs with powerful GPUs. When asked at the summit whether Arm might eventually manufacture its own chips and compete with Nvidia, Haas remained coy but hinted at future possibilities, suggesting the $150 billion chip design firm is exploring ways to expand beyond its current scope.",Rene Haas worked at Nvidia for seven years before joining Arm in 2013.

Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has revealed his unconventional approach to hiring software engineers: skip the interviews and let candidates compete instead. Speaking on podcaster Lex Fridman's show Tuesday, Durov explained that coding contests provide a superior method for identifying exceptional talent compared to standard recruitment processes.""If you want to create an ideal process for selecting the most qualified people for certain specific tasks you have in mind, what can be better than a competition?"" Durov told Fridman, emphasising that this strategy aligns with his belief that competition drives progress.The messaging platform runs coding competitions every one to two months on its own custom-built platform. Winners gain the opportunity to join Telegram's lean engineering team of approximately 30 developers. According to Durov, this approach eliminates the need for an HR department while ensuring candidates possess both technical excellence and genuine familiarity with the product.Durov prioritizes hiring engineers who already use Telegram, believing prior experience provides crucial understanding that newcomers lack. By promoting contests directly through Telegram, the company naturally attracts user-candidates.The strategy has proven lucrative for winners. In June, Durov announced a competition offering a $1 million annual salary for an Android developer position, with the challenge requiring contestants to implement specific animations in Telegram's open-source app.Durov has employed this hiring method since 2007, during his tenure as CEO of Russian social network VK, before cofounding Telegram with his brother Nikolai in 2013.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said demand for electricians, plumbers, and carpenters will rise sharply as the construction of data centers accelerates. “If you’re an electrician, you’re a plumber, a carpenter—we’re going to need hundreds of thousands of them to build all of these factories,” Huang told Channel 4 News in the U.K. “The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a boom. You’ve going to have to be doubling and doubling and doubling every single year,” he added.Jensen Huang added that many of these roles can be filled without a college degree and pointed to salaries that can cross $100,000. A large 2,50,000-square-foot data center can employ up to 1,500 construction workers during its build-out, with about 50 full-time roles for maintenance once complete.The Nvidia CEO has previously said he would choose physical sciences over software if he were a student today. “For the young, 20-year-old Jensen, that’s graduated now, he probably would have chosen…more of the physical sciences than the software sciences,” he said.Other CEOs have voiced similar concerns about labor shortages. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said earlier this year that deportations of immigrant workers and falling interest in trades among young Americans could delay construction.“I’ve even told members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians that we need to build out AI data centers,” Fink said in March.Ford CEO Jim Farley also warned that the US lacks enough workers to meet reshoring goals. “I think the intent is there, but there’s nothing to backfill the ambition,” Farley told Axios. Jim Farley argued that while there is a growing debate about AI taking white-collar jobs, not enough attention is given to shortages in critical roles like electricians, construction workers, and auto technicians. “How can we reshore all this stuff if we don’t have people to work there?,” he said.","Jensen Huang said demand for electricians, plumbers, and carpenters will rise sharply as the construction of data centers accelerates.

What is Instant Checkout



Instant Checkout: Seamless shopping for users and opportunities for merchants



Agentic Commerce protocol: Making Instant Checkout easy and secure



Key features of the Agentic Commerce Protocol include:

Cross-platform compatibility: Works with various payment processors and business types.

Quick integration: Merchants can adopt ACP without overhauling their backend systems.

Merchant control: Ensures merchants remain the primary point of contact for fulfillment, returns, support, and communication.

Future of agentic commerce







How to start using Instant Checkout

OpenAI is advancing agentic commerce, turning ChatGPT from a virtual assistant into an active shopping partner. With the launch of Instant Checkout, powered by the Agentic Commerce Protocol, users can now browse, select, and purchase products directly within the chat interface, eliminating the need to visit multiple websites. Initially available to US ChatGPT users, Instant Checkout allows seamless single-item purchases from Etsy sellers, with support for over a million Shopify merchants, including brands like Glossier, SKIMS, and Spanx, coming soon. The Agentic Commerce Protocol ensures secure, efficient transactions while keeping merchants in control of fulfillment, payments, and customer relationships. This innovation is set to transform online shopping, offering convenience for users and a new revenue channel for businesses.Every week, over 700 million people turn to ChatGPT for help with everyday tasks, including product recommendations. With the introduction of Instant Checkout, ChatGPT moves beyond suggestions and enables users to make purchases directly through the chat interface.Initially, this feature is available to US ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Free users, allowing purchases directly from US-based Etsy sellers. Over a million Shopify merchants, including Glossier, SKIMS, Spanx, and Vuori, are expected to join soon.Currently, Instant Checkout supports single-item purchases, with plans to expand to multi-item carts, more merchants, and international regions in the near future.Instant Checkout allows users to go from product discovery to purchase with just a few taps. When a user asks ChatGPT for shopping recommendations—such as “best running shoes under $100” or “gifts for a ceramics lover”—ChatGPT provides organic, unsponsored product results ranked purely by relevance.If a product supports Instant Checkout, users can simply tap “Buy,” confirm shipping and payment details, and complete the purchase without leaving the chat. Payments can be made with the card on file for existing subscribers or through other supported payment methods.Orders, payments, and fulfillment are entirely handled by the merchant’s existing systems. ChatGPT acts as a digital personal shopper, securely transmitting order details between the user and merchant.For shoppers, Instant Checkout offers a seamless, convenient shopping experience, eliminating the need to visit multiple websites. For merchants, it opens the door to hundreds of millions of potential customers while allowing them to maintain full control over payments, fulfillment, and customer relationships.Merchants pay a small fee on completed purchases, but the service is free for users. Importantly, Instant Checkout does not influence product ranking, ensuring fairness in recommendations. ChatGPT evaluates products based on availability, price, quality, and seller status to optimize the user experience.At the heart of Instant Checkout is the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP), an open standard designed to enable AI agents, people, and businesses to collaborate on completing purchases. Co-developed with Stripe and leading merchants, the protocol is designed to be secure, easy to adopt, and platform-agnostic.When a user places an order through ChatGPT, the protocol securely transmits the purchase details to the merchant’s backend. The merchant then processes the payment, handles fulfillment, and provides customer support using their existing systems. Merchants using Stripe can enable agentic payments with just one line of code, while other payment processors can participate via ACP’s Shared Payment Token API or Delegated Payments Spec.OpenAI is open-sourcing the Agentic Commerce Protocol, allowing developers and merchants to build their own integrations. This move encourages innovation, enabling businesses to create seamless AI-driven commerce experiences across platforms and regions. Interested merchants can apply to make their products available for purchase through ChatGPT, unlocking a new channel to reach millions of users.The launch of Instant Checkout represents a significant leap toward agentic AI in commerce. Previously, AI agents could recommend products but could not complete transactions. Now, ChatGPT can act as a fully capable shopping assistant, bridging the gap between discovery and purchase.This innovation also positions OpenAI at the forefront of a competitive landscape. Tech giants like Google and Microsoft are developing similar AI-powered shopping tools, while Amazon faces potential disruption as chatbots redirect consumers away from traditional storefronts. By working directly with Shopify merchants and offering an open-source protocol, OpenAI is not only reshaping the online shopping experience but also redefining the power dynamics in ecommerce, putting AI agents at the center of the purchase journey.For users in the US, Instant Checkout is available for single-item purchases from Etsy sellers. Support for Shopify merchants and other retailers will roll out in phases. Users can simply ask ChatGPT for recommendations, tap “Buy” on supported products, and complete purchases within the chat interface.Merchants interested in enabling Instant Checkout can access OpenAI’s documentation and start building integrations today, opening their products to millions of ChatGPT users.With Instant Checkout and the Agentic Commerce Protocol, ChatGPT evolves from a conversational AI into a true shopping companion. Users enjoy effortless shopping, while merchants gain unprecedented access to a global audience—all without sacrificing control over their systems. This marks the beginning of agentic commerce, a new era where AI agents don’t just suggest what to buy—they help you buy it.","Instant Checkout allows users to go from product discovery to purchase with just a few taps.

H-1B Visa Shock Explained: $100K Annual Fee Announced by Donald Trump





Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Sanjay Malhotra has said that there is no proposal to levy charges on Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions, says a report by news agency PTI. Speaking at a press conference after the monetary policy review, Malhotra clarified that despite the sharp rise in UPI usage, the central bank has not received or considered any proposal to impose transaction fees. “I never said that UPI can stay free forever. What I said was there are costs (associated with UPI transactions), and they need to be paid for by someone”, Malhotra said.According to the RBI data, UPI transactions crossed 20 billion in August 2025, a 34 per cent increase in volume year-on-year. “Is there going to be charges on UPI? Well, there is no proposal before us,” he said during the conference as quoted in the PTI report. “Who pays is important but not so important than someone footing the bill. So, it is important for us for the sustainability of the model, that whether collectively or individually someone pays,"" Sanjay Malhotra said.The RBI governor has previously raised concerns about the sustainability of UPI’s zero-cost framework.Speaking at an event earlier this year, Malhotra said “The important thing is that the UPI, or any other payment system for that matter, is accessible, cheap, secure, and sustainable… and it will be sustainable only if someone bears the costs. So as long as it’s the government or someone else — that’s not so important — the important thing is that costs of any service should be paid, whether collectively or by the user. ”The governor also said the RBI is reviewing a plan that would allow banks to remotely lock mobile phones bought on credit if borrowers default on their EMI payments.The PTI report quotes RBI Deputy Governor M Rajeshwar Rao who said “The issue of digital locking is under examination as the Governor has pointed out. There are pros and cons on both sides in terms of balancing customer rights and requirements, data privacy, and creditors' requirements. So, we are examining the issue, we will...take a view at a later point in time”.","RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra has said that there is no proposal to levy charges on Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions.

Growing concern for celebrity rights in India





Bollywood stars Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have taken Google 's YouTube to court in New Delhi, demanding protection against AI-generated videos that misuse their personas and seeking safeguards to prevent such content from training other artificial intelligence platforms.The high-profile lawsuit, filed on September 6, targets deepfake and misleading YouTube videos that the actors claim infringe their intellectual property rights. Beyond requesting removal of existing AI content, the couple wants Google to implement measures ensuring uploaded videos cannot be used to train rival AI models without proper consent, according to legal documents reviewed by Reuters.The Bachchans argue that YouTube's current policy—which allows creators to opt in for sharing their videos to train AI platforms like OpenAI , Meta, and xAI—is deeply concerning. They contend that biased or negative AI content portraying them could teach AI models false information, leading to further spread of misleading material.The lawsuits, spanning 1,500 pages, include hundreds of links and screenshots showing what the actors describe as ""egregious"" and ""sexually explicit"" AI-manipulated videos. One example shows Abhishek using AI manipulation to kiss an actress, while another depicts Aishwarya dining with her former partner, actor Salman Khan , as Abhishek watches angrily.The Delhi High Court has already ordered 518 website links and posts to be removed, citing financial harm and damage to the couple's dignity.The next hearing is scheduled for January 15, with the actors seeking $450,000 in damages and a permanent injunction.Reuters found numerous similar infringing videos still on YouTube, including a channel called ""AI Bollywood Ishq"" with 259 videos garnering 16.5 million views. The case represents the most significant legal challenge yet regarding personality rights and AI in India, where explicit protections for celebrity personas don't exist unlike in many U.S. states.With India being YouTube's largest market at around 600 million users, the lawsuit could significantly impact how the platform handles AI-generated celebrity content and video-sharing consent policies, Reuters reported.",Bollywood stars Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have taken Google's YouTube to court in New Delhi.

Charlie Kirk's assassination







Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently said he has cancelled his Netflix subscription. The move comes after the streaming platform employed Hamish Steele, a director who allegedly mocked the killing of right-wing political activist Charlie Kirk . “Just cancelled my Netflix subscription. If you employ someone who celebrated the murder of Charlie Kirk and makes content that pushes pro-trans content on my kids.....you will NEVER get a dime of my money. It's as simple as that,” an X (formerly Twitter) user wrote on X. Elon Musk replied to the user writing “same”, confirming the cancellation.Hamish Steele is the creator of the animated series Dead End: Paranormal Park. He allegedly mocked last month’s assassination of Charlie Kirk, a Donald Trump ally and right wing activist in a post on Bluesky.

The US government has shutdown for the first time in nearly seven years. The shutdown comes after Republicans and Democrats failed to agree a deal to keep the federal government funded. Amid the shutdown, the US Embassy in India has shared an update on X (formerly Twitter) where it said that the account “will not be updated regularly until full operations resume”. The post, however, mentions “urgent safety and security information” as an exception to this.“Because of the lapse in appropriations, this X account will not be updated regularly until full operations resume, with the exception of urgent safety and security information,” the US Embassy in India wrote on X.Every year, the Congress is required to approve spending bills by October 1, the start of the US fiscal year. This is mandatory to fund government departments and federal agencies. This year, no appropriations bills were passed before the deadline.The Republican lawmakers attempted to push through a temporary measure to keep the government open. The White House and Republican lawmakers pushed for what they called a “clean” continuing resolution (CR), which would maintain current funding levels until November 21.But, Democratic lawmakers resisted signing on to the Republican plans. They insisted that any agreement must include a permanent extension of health insurance subsidies set to expire at the end of the year.Last US government shutdown occured in December 2018 that lasted for 35 days.In a shutdown, the federal government stops all “non-essential” functions. Some of the most noticeable closures and slowdowns include visa services, passport services, federal agencies like NASA, Department of Education, national parks, among others.However, employees whose work is termed “essential” are required to report to work, often without pay. Services still functioning include air traffic controllers and TSA officers at airport, border patrol and coastal guards, FBI, CIA and others.Talking to reports, President Trump said “When you shut it down, you have to do lay-offs, so we’d be laying off a lot of people that are going to be very affected.”",The US government has shutdown for the first time in nearly seven years.

A new role, but not a goodbye



Meet the new co-CEOs







Spotity founder and CEO Daniel Ek has announced that he is stepping down from his position of CEO and will transition to the role of executive chairman starting January 1, 2026. This move by the CEO marks a significant shift for the audio streaming platform, which now has more than 700 million users across the globe. The company also announced Gustav Söderström, co-president and chief product and technology officer, and Alex Norström, co-president and chief business officer, as its co-chief executive officers. They will report to Daniel Ek and will also serve on the company’s Board of Directors subject to shareholder approval.Ek emphasised that his departure from the CEO role doesn’t mean stepping away from Spotify’s future. “I will be more involved than a typical US chairman. So think of it a little bit like moving from a player to a coach,” he said, explaining that his new position will resemble a European-style chairman—more hands-on with strategy, capital allocation, and mentoring leadership.“In my role as Executive Chairman, I will focus on the long arc of the company and keep the Board and our co-CEOs deeply connected through my engagement,” said Ek.As mentioned above Spotify’s co-president and chief product and technology officer Gustav Söderström and company’s co-president and chief business officer Alex Norström will take over as the co- CEOs. “Over the last few years, I’ve turned over a large part of the day-to-day management and strategic direction of Spotify to Alex and Gustav–who have shaped the company from our earliest days and are now more than ready to guide our next phase. This change simply matches titles to how we already operate,” added Ek.The new co-CEOs said in a joint statement, “We’ve worked together a very long time and have seen Spotify through many different chapters. Nearly three years ago, when we stepped into our role as co-Presidents, we charged our teams with relentlessly focusing on building the best and most valuable experience available anywhere and that ambition hasn’t changed. While we bring different experiences and perspectives to the CEO role, we both have a strong bias to action and can’t wait to get started knowing that we will have Daniel’s full partnership and ongoing support. ”","Daniel Ek will transition to the role of executive chairman starting January 1, 2026.

What Charlie Javice's lawyers said in her defense





A Manhattan judge didn't hold back, using unusually blunt language to describe JP Morgan's bankers as victims of a massive fraud, but at the same time chiding them for their ""stupidity"". According to a report from Business Insider, US District Judge Alvin K Hellerstein sentenced fintech founder Charlie Javice to seven years in prison and ordered her to pay $287.5 million in restitution.It was halfway through the hearing that the judge began his scathing criticism of the bank's due diligence. ""What consideration should be given for JPMorgan Chase's very poor due diligence?"" Hellerstein asked. But he went on to add that Fraud remains a fraud ""whether you outsmart someone who is smart or someone who is a fool.""Javice, who once appeared on Forbes' ""30 Under 30"" list, was found guilty of defrauding America's largest bank JP Morgan Chase in the 2021 sale of her startup, Frank. The bank paid $175 million for the company, believing it had access to a database of 4 million college students. It was later revealed that Javice had fabricated the data, using a computer programmer to create a fake list of users.JP Morgan did not discover the fraud until a year after the acquisition was finalized, despite a team of 300 in-house diligence officers vetting the deal.The prosecution described Frank as ""a crime scene,"" not a viable business.Javice, who had previously attracted high-profile investors, even managed to secure one-on-one meeting with JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon.During the sentencing, the judge was unswayed by the defense's argument that JP Morgan, a bank worth nearly $4 trillion, should have known better. In a striking statement, Judge Hellerstein declared that his job was ""punishing her conduct and not JPMorgan's stupidity."" He emphasized that ""fraud remains a fraud, whether you outsmart someone who is smart or someone who is a fool.""The defense had pointed to trial evidence showing that one bank executive had scoffed at the sale price, calling it ""nothing."" Yet, the judge insisted that blaming the victim, even a banking giant, was irrelevant. ""Whether you outsmart someone who is indifferent or someone who is careful, it's the conduct,"" he said.","Charlie Javice sentenced to seven years in prison and ordered to pay $287.5 million in restitution.

A new study has tried to reason the biggest complaint that majority of companies have with their AI investment -- that they give zero return. A recent MIT study had put the figure of AI investment failures at 95%. Now a study from researchers at consulting company BetterUp Labs, in collaboration with Stanford Social Media Lab, has reasoned the AI failure with a new term -- ""workslop"". The study coins the new term to describe low-quality, AI-generated work: “Workslop.”Published in the Harvard Business Review, the research highlights how Workslop may explain why 95% of organizations experimenting with AI report no return on investment. Workslop, defined as “AI-generated work content that masquerades as good work, but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task,” is often unhelpful, incomplete, or missing critical context. The researchers warn that it shifts the burden downstream, forcing others to interpret, correct, or redo the work.The researchers also conducted an ongoing survey of 1,150 full-time, U.S.-based employees, with 40% of respondents saying they’d received Workslop in the past month.To combat Workslop, researchers urge workplace leaders to model intentional AI use and establish clear guidelines for acceptable practices. “Leaders must set guardrails around norms to ensure AI contributes meaningfully,” the study advises.The findings highlight the need for thoughtful integration of AI tools to avoid creating more work rather than less.A recent MIT study indicates that 95% of organizations studied get zero return on their AI investment. The study said that 95% of organizations found zero return despite enterprise investment of $30 billion to $40 billion into GenAI. MIT researchers are said to have studied 300 public AI initiatives to try and suss out the ""no hype reality"" of AI's impact on business.","A recent MIT study indicates that 95% of organizations studied get zero return on their AI investment.

Google’s New AI Is BANANAS: How To Use Gemini Nano Banana

How Google determined the winners of Nano Banana hackathon







Google DeepMind has announced the 50 winners of its recent Nano Banana Hackathon. The company is awarding the contest winners non-monetary prizes totalling $400,000. The 48-hour competition, which ran from September 6 to September 8, received 832 project submissions. Each of the 50 winning projects received a prize package that included $5,000 in Gemini API credits, $1,000 in Fal credits, and 11 million Eleven Labs credits valued at approximately $2,000. Google also provided a special technology prize for submissions that demonstrated outstanding technical achievement using Eleven Labs or Fal technologies.In a thread of posts shared on the social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Google announced the names and the projects of each winner and wrote:As the name implies, participants were challenged to create a product, application, or demo using Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model, popularly known as Nano Banana. This new image generation and editing tool, developed by Google, enhances the Gemini app’s editing experience by allowing users to create multiple variations from a single photo or combine ideas from different images.The hackathon went beyond basic text-to-image generation, asking participants to develop innovative concepts, leverage the model’s strengths, and build apps that could power dynamic storytelling, boost e-commerce, automate creative workflows, and enable the next wave of natural language photo editors, according to Google DeepMind.To support this, Google introduced a special Gemini API tier with a limit of 20 images per minute and 500 requests per project daily. Submissions had to be hosted publicly on Kaggle and include a demo video of up to two minutes to showcase the project’s “wow” factor.Entries were judged with 10% weight given to the quality of the demo video, 40% to innovation and the “wow” element, and the remaining points split across technical execution, functionality, and potential impact.Google highlighted several winners in a social media post. Among them, LifeTrace Timeline transformed raw location data into a personal diary for reflecting on daily experiences. ArtLens blended AI with art history to reimagine famous paintings as real-world scenes. Another standout, ForgeOne, introduced an AI-driven system for automated creative workflows that evaluates and refines its own outputs against professional standards.","Google DeepMind has announced the 50 winners of its Nano Banana Hackathon.

Spotify founder and CEO Daniel Ek has announced that he is stepping down from his role as the CEO effective from January 1, 2026. Ek will transition to the position of executive chairman, while longtime executives Gustav Söderström and Alex Norström will take over as co-CEOs. They will report to Daniel Ek and will also serve on the company’s Board of Directors subject to shareholder approval.In a letter to employees, Ek reflected on Spotify’s journey from a startup to a global audio leader with more than 700 million users:“I always believed that Spotify could play an important role in revolutionizing listening around the world, and with more than 700 million users, we’ve truly charted a new course bringing creativity to every corner of the globe,” said Daniel Ek.“Over the last few years, I’ve turned over a large part of the day-to-day management and strategic direction of Spotify to Alex and Gustav–who have shaped the company from our earliest days and are now more than ready to guide our next phase.

“My objective, and this administration’s objective, is to get chip manufacturing significantly onshored — we need to make our own chips. The idea that I pitched [Taiwan] was, let’s get to 50-50. We’re producing half, and you’re producing half.”

The Trump administration is encouraging Taiwan to relocate some of its investment and semiconductor production to the US. According to US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, the goal is to ensure that half of America’s chips are manufactured domestically. This push, which could have implications for Taiwan’s national defence, is part of a strategy to reduce American reliance on the island nation. In a recent interview, Lutnick said that Washington has held discussions with Taipei about the “50-50” split in semiconductor production. Currently, Taiwan produces over 90% of the world’s advanced semiconductors. Lutnick cited Taiwan's distance from the US and proximity to China as the cause for concern regarding America's dependence on its chips.In an interview with News Nation, Lutnick said:Lutnick said his goal is to achieve around 40% domestic semiconductor production by the end of President Donald Trump’s current term, which would require over $500 billion in local investments.Taiwan’s dominance in chip manufacturing is primarily attributed to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

Walmart’s executive VP of Global Tech Platforms, Sravana Karnati, has revealed the two primary traits he looks for while hiring engineers. In a statement to Business Insider, Karnati said that while hiring engineers, he looks” The Indian-origin executive of the US-based retail major, who has over 25 years of leadership experience at companies including Amazon and Disney , said that he hasHowever, he emphasised the importance of candidates possessing domain expertise. According to the executive, anyone in a technical position, including project managers, must understand the architecture, dependencies, and associated risks of their work.Karnati explainedKarnati noted that the skills required depend on the role a person is pursuing. For instance, someone in UX design or engineering does not necessarily need an in-depth understanding of computer science fundamentals, but having some basic technical knowledge can be helpful.What matters most is being able to effectively utilise tools like Figma and other LLMs to accomplish the work, he added.However, for software development or engineering roles, Karnati said a firm grasp of computer science fundamentals is essential. LLM tools can boost productivity, but they cannot replace a deeper understanding of systems, algorithms, and architecture.Karnati, who was instrumental in developing Walmart’s new AI tool Wibey, explained that he wants candidates who can write good algorithms and long-term(The company describes Wibey as a developer-focused tool that helps employees streamline workflows by automating repetitive coding tasks and managing compliance checks.)Although Karnati said he is looking to hire computer scientists, that does not necessarily mean candidates must hold a degree in computer science. He himself holds a doctorate in chemical engineering, but has worked as a computer scientist for years, he noted.Adding that such roles require a strong focus on operational discipline, Karnati explained:Karnati mentioned thatis to keep up with the evolution of technology and continue to retrain yourself. He noted that those who have thrived in the industry for 30 to 40 years have managed to stay current with the business and keep learning.That ability to learn quickly and keep pace with the industry, he said, is the second trait he looks for. When hiring, Karnati said he wants to see evidence that a candidate has already demonstrated this quality.He added that candidates can showcase this ability through various internships or coursework that reflects aKarnati's observations reflect a broader trend among tech leaders, who emphasise the increasing importance of adaptability in the workplace as AI becomes more widespread.","Sravana Karnati, Walmart's executive VP of Global Tech Platforms, has revealed the two primary traits he looks for while hiring engineers.

Nike ties run deep







Apple CEO Tim Cook has once again made headlines for his footwear. Cook recently wore a pair of customised Nike sneakers at the reopening of Apple’s flagship store in Tokyo. As reported by Business Insider, Cook was seen sporting a custom pair of Nike Vomero Plus sneakers at the company’s store opening in Japan. Some visitors at the store clicked photos and also made videos of the sneakers.As reported by Business Insider, Tim Cook’s Nike sneakers have red, white and blue colours. The sneakers are designed by Sashiko Gals, an artisan collective under the Japanese brand Kuon. The group consists of around 15 women aged between 40 and 80 and it specialises in sashiko, a traditional Japanese stitching technique.The sneakers are made using reworked denim and are a blend of modern sportswear with traditional craftsmanship. According to the designers, the pair was created exclusively for Cook.Presently, it is not clear that whether Nike is directly involved in the customisation process of the sneakers. However, Cook’s connection to the sportswear giant is longstanding—he has served on Nike’s board of directors since 2005. Over the years, Apple and Nike have collaborated on several projects, including fitness features and Apple Watch editions.This is not the first time that Cook has grabbed attention due to his sneakers. Last year, Cook wore another pair of one-of-a-kind Nike shoes at the time of the launch of new iPad lineup at an Apple event. The sightings suggest that Cook has access to a personal collection of rare, custom-designed sneakers, a perk few CEOs can claim.","Apple CEO Tim Cook has once again made headlines for his footwear.
